I decided to finish it because I really liked the main character and still wanted to know the ending but to this day I still don't know how it ended because that one chapter was haunting me and I could get it out of my head. Anytime me and my friends talk about books in general I always say how I couldn't stand this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Giver","review":"Every once in a while, a book comes along that changes the way we look at ourselves and at the world in which we live. The Giver is one of those books. The writing style is deceptively simple; the prose conveys controversial and explosive ideas and issues with incredible clarity. This is truly an incredible book... for readers of all ages."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Giver","review":"The GiverBY Tori HallI thought the book The Giver was ok. The beginning of the book started out good but as the book went on I found that it got strange. The book took on a very science fiction sense as it got into the book. The book changed from being a book about a different community to being a book that kept talking about people killing other people with shots. I found it changed around too much through out the book to really enjoy it. And last of all the ending left me confused. I did not know if the main character Jonas had died or if he found A different place or what. I think another factor that made me not really enjoy the book is the fact that we had to read it for school. When you are forced to read something you do not enjoy it as much as if you choose to read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Readers12 and under Only","review":"Written at a 6th grade reading level, The Giver has very little literary or stylistic value. It is filled with cliched rhetoric such as \\"intelligence\\" \\"integrity\\", \\"courage\\", and \\"wisdom\\" -- words fit for a middle school graduation. Lowry creates a futuristic world that seems too much like a follow up of Orwell's *1984*, and is really a very bland version of *Brave New World*. The themes and ideas can hardly be called original. Though for a children's book, it is quite valuable in its effective warning against modern society's trend toward regimentation and sterilization. As for anyone over 12 years of age, read Brave New World if you want intellectual stimulation."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver was a great book to me. Unlike alot of other books this one kept me on the edge of my seat and I was always wondering what was going to happen next. It was the only book the teacher issued that I actually liked to read and didn't want to put down.When I read it I sometimes felt sorry for Jonas because he was so different and his friends couldn't even relate to what Jonas was going through. He wanted so much to tell his friends everything he knew but he wasn't allowed to. But he ending up being happy so I would definately recomend this book to everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"My opinion","review":"This book was not that very interesting since I really don't like reading.I thought this book could make me fall asleep even with loud sounds by me.It could have been since I hate reading long books like this one.But I still read it so I kind of liked some parts of it.I really didn't understand it that's why. Books bore me so don't take it personaly alright.I liked the idea of them trying to save Gabriel.The whole memories thing was dumb in away."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is a great book and goes into alot of detail. The book had me to where when I was reading it I didn't see or hear anything else. I was focussed on the reading every sigle line, sentence, and word. I didn't want it to end. Towards the middle of the book it gets a little depressing, when the giver is giving Jonas, the main character, memories of what it was like to feel feelings. Alot of the memories are very depressing, while some were happy, and exhilarating as The Giver would put it. The book was also very mysterious, like when an apple changed in mid-air I didn't realize that Jonas was noticing the color red, through this i found that every one in the community was color blind. I think if you are thinking of buying this book you should because, trust me its not a waste of time like some other books are."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Giver","review":"Very intriguing. Couldn't put it down. The ending left me disappointed and in need of closure. I plan to read the whole series.

Im only on chapter 15 but should be finished soon. When I first started reading it, I wasnt really into it; but the closer I got to the ceremony of twelve, the more interested I got.The thing that makes this book interesting is the fact that only one person knows the history of the world. This is a very good book for young people. Every school should assign this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"disturbing and depressing","review":"This book, no matter how well it is written, is a book that really has no ending or solution to the problems that the author puts forward. I found it to be extremely disturbing and could not wait for the happy ending to come, but it didn't.Some will like it because of its origianl theme but I for one did not enjoy it very much at all. People who read it should know that its ending is depressing (to me it was) and ultimately pointless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting but incomplete","review":"This book starts off well with a great story line. Jonas lives in a society where everything is controlled by rules. The rules were decided long ago to eliminate any individuality, any fear, any worry or anxiety. But, as he learns when he is made the Receiver of Memories, a lot has also been lost. There is no color, no music, no love and no pain. However, what starts off as a great story with great potential quickly looses its thrust. It's almost as though the author didn't know how to end the story and grabbed the first thing that came to mind. The ending leaves the reader with many questions. That in and of it self is not bad as long as they are thought provoking questions. But these are not. Rather, the reader is left asking where the rest of the story is. This book leaves the reader flat. There is no closure. Perhaps that is what the author wanted but, if it is, then she chose to give up the story for the sake of a momentary effect on the reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"it is different :0( =0)","review":"This is not a really exciting.

I really wish the auther would hve either taken off the last paragraph or so, or added a few more chapters. also i found that the way that people were released was a bit disturbing, but the way that jonas's dad releasesd the newborn child was the most disturbing of all, especially how he lied about it.

I see different things in different points in my life and I get something new out of it every time. This book makes you think of what the world would be like without inconveniences and how someone always has to bare them. It's about a special society that has removed all of that and one person who remembers a time before everything good and bad was taken... It's really an incredible book and a must read for people of all ages. This is a great book to sit down with your middle schoolers or high schoolers and read together. There is some pretty deep stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"the giver","review":"The book The Giver is an awesome book and should be read by all. There are many twist in this book, and is sometimes hard to understand. But it is a very well written book and very interesting.

It is a really good even great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favourite books.","review":"I read this first at 12 and it has been one of my favourite books ever since. Jonas lives with his parents and sister in a society where everything is strictly ordered. It's safe and everyone knows what to do and how to act in any thinkable situation. The society runs like clockwork. Jonas is turning 12 soon. For the children, every year is marked with a Ceremony. At the Ceremony the transition is marked with new clothes, a bike, new duties etc. for each age group. The Twelves are given their assignment - their job for the rest of their adult life.Jonas' Assignment is a shock to him and to the Community. But he soon learns to cope with it - and with a dangerous new world of feelings, memories, lost freedoms and the consequences of brutal equality. The story follows him through most of his twelfth year, where Jonas' thoughts of his home drastically changes. He grows up fast - and then has to make a choice for himself and for the Community."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jonas is assigned to be the new reciever of memory","review":"I think that this story was very weird. It was exciting too. I liked it because in the beginning it makes you want to read more. It also confuses you. From one through five I rate it a four because it could of had a better ending. The ending was very boring and not exciting at all. I thought that it was going to have a better ending. Other than the ending, it was very cool. In some parts of the book it leaves you in suspense and makes you want to read more. My favorite part was when Jonas is assigned his assignment and goes for his training to the annex room. When he receives pain and happiness. Also when he discovers things. This is my review and opinion on the book called \\"The Giver\\" by: Lois Lowry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jonas lived in a perfect world","review":"We liked this book because it was a great mystery and action packed book especially when Jonas runs away from community and takes Gabriel and gives him warmth to stay alive.That's why we like this book and gave it five thumbs up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting, well written, and thought evoking.","review":"I just finished reading \\"The Giver\\" for an assignment in my Young Adult Liturature 4510 class, and I wish I would have read it sooner in life.With it's interesting subject matter, inovative ideas, and easy-to-read structure, \\"The Giver\\" would be an excellent way for youth to study their own culture, prescribed social boundaries, and their own ideas about what society should be like.I was once asked \\"If a book doesn't get under your skin and make you think about it's content, then what is the purpose of reading it?\\" I think that Lowry does an excellent job of probing young minds to ask questions and explore new ideas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good book, horrible ending","review":"What might have been a decent book, was all killed in the end. I am not sure how anyone gave this book 5 stars. It does not seem like a completed book at all, the ending completely left you hanging. I thought at first that it was the first set in a trilogy, only to find out that the subsequent books are not actual follow-up books but rather books with seperate characters, plots and societies. How disappointing! Its like the author got bored with writing the book and decided to just end it. Save yourself some time and skip this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Much Potential Falls Flat","review":"As much as I wanted to love this book, I cannot.I adore sci-fi and dystopic novels, but this books writing was just awful. Lowry leaves an absurd amount of questions unanswered and it's seriously like she just gave up on the ending. It's almost as if she decided it would be better left like that, so all the school kids who have to read this worthless book are forced to write an ending as part of their grade for \\"The Giver\\"'s unit.I don't believe in censorship (it basically says to teenagers \\"I'm banned! Therefore, I MUST be good if your teachers don't want you to read me.\\"), but I definitely don't believe this book belongs up there with all of the other great classics that kids are required to read, like \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\". If you are interested in bringing young adults into this genre, I suggest \\"The Hunger Games\\" by Suzanne Collins.Such an amazing idea falls flat on its face.1 out of 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"very dark and not for children 14 and under","review":"When my 7th grader was reading the Giver and said the book was very strange, I picked it up myself to read. It is a strangebook that is very sad, dark and about a society of people that does not experience life as it really is, but experiences life in a controlled way. There is no pain, love or self expression. The old are sent to the house of old to live until death, never to embrace grandchildren. The weakest in the community are \\"released\\" which means they are murdered. The scene in the book where the youngest twin (twins aren't allowed)is injected with a lethal injection,goes thru spasms, then goes limp and dies is ultra sad for anyone to read, let alone a young reader. The law doesn't apply to this community. What exactly is the books value to our children and what lessons are they learning?"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Giver left me thinking about what happened to Jonas.","review":"I think Lois Lowry wrote a very fantastic book. It left me thinking for hours about what happened to Jonas and Gabriel. This is one of favorite books ever. You should buy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Giver","review":"I thought this book sucked. We had to read it for school and I practically fell asleep through the whole book thats how boring it was. It was so dull no color or excitement to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a really great book!","review":"Out of the two books that Mrs. Lowry wrote, that I read, I like The Giver the best. I thought Number The Stars was kind of boring. I liked how Jonas was my age, in The Giver, so I could relate to him a bit. And, even though Gabe wasn't Jonas' brother, I could relate to that, too. So, I could really get into the book, because of that.I didn't like the ending of The Giver, though. I don't think many people liked the ending either. So, I have a request, could you make another book, of the same topic, but with a better ending? I also didn't like the whole release thing. Especially with the twins, how they would kill the one who weighed the least.Overrall I would say this was a great book, and just forget about my rating I put! I really got in to it, even though it was an assignment for my English class, well, now that I think about it, so is this letter!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"I'm surprised I never came across this when I was younger.

I'd reccomend it to anyone. I am in sixth grade and read it as a school book. It's great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Giver","review":"Jonas lives in his community not knowing how wonderful the world could be. As a reciever of memories he slowly gets to know the qualities that a community could have and realizes how boring and miserable the perfectly controlled community is. Now he tries to find the Elsewhere and wants to reach a better world. Apart from that, this book leaves open a lot of questions, for example: \\"Who created this community?\\" and the important one, What happens to Jonas?\\" Summing up it was an exciting book and I recommend it to every person of every age."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jennifer Schmalhofer from Germany, Dec.15,1999","review":"For me it was the first time reading an anti-utopian text and so the plot was a new experience in literature. But nevertheless I am fascinated. The Giver tells the story of a community, the story of a boy and while the reader is informed about this perfect world the boy's eyes are opened. In my opinion this book would be a nice x-mas gift for younger and older ones. The Giver is such a well written bock and so I enjoyed reading it every second."},{"rating":"2","title":"Appreciating Our Joy and Pain","review":"This is a truly wonderful depiction of mankind attemping to preserve only the \\"good\\" characteristics of life. Lowry clearly shows us the benefits of both worlds; in one world, suffering and happiness coexisted, in the other only \\"happiness\\" existed; in the former, life was sometimes unfulfilling and stressful, in this world, life is predetermined and stressfree. However, as Lowry expertly shows, if we let go of the \\"bad\\" things in life, the \\"good\\" things cease to have as much value. To Love without knowing what it is to Hate; to be Happy, without knowing what Sadness is; in some way the value of our emotions is lessened if we do not know what the opposite emotion feels like. Lowry helps us to see the many good things which exist in our world today...as well as the necessity of some \\"bad\\" things."},{"rating":"2","title":"I <3 the Giver","review":"The Giver is an amzing story that you will never forget! It will keep you reading, and at the end, you'll want to read it again!

Jonas gets a special \\"honor\\" rather than an assignment. He is to be trained to hold all the memories from all time for the community and he soon learns just what the community members have had to sacrifice to live this \\"perfect\\" life.I can see this book staying with me for a long time. It was not only an excellent story, but it gives you a lot of things to think about. I think Lois Lowry did a great job writing this book in a way that the target age group can understand the issues brought about. I would have liked to know a little more at the end, but it was a great read nonetheless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious","review":"Laborious.

I really didn't enjoy reading what I read because it'sabout the future with a perfect society. Why would someone want to live in thatkind of place? No competition, and you're assigned your future job, your child(s),and your spouse. How Pathetic. What's the point in life if everything has to beperfect. No wars? No memories? I'm glad to have my memories and I don't want toforget them. The only reason why I'm giving this book 2 stars instead of 1 isbecause Lois did a good job on descibing the characters and what's going on. Ijust don't like the storyline. Now, her other book 'Number the Stars' was fantasticand I rate that a 5 because it's also based on true events. It definatelycreates mood in the story of sarrow and pain.

After he has lost the memory of snow, a sled and a hill, he experiences it and then the memory can stay with him (Jonas) and Gabe (Gabriel) for life , and the same thing with the music. Also when he takes Gabe (Gariel) with him, he is understanding the true and real meaning of love, unlike the community, who can't experience love because they don't know what love is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moving, Beautiful and Deep","review":"The Giver was moving, beautiful, and deep. The world reminded me a lot of Matched by Ally Condie. I'm glad I read it as an adult. It might have gone over my head if I'd read it in middle school. It was pretty deep and serious stuff. I'm still thinking about it. To be honest, I'm trying to figure out what happened at the end. It had a very high-brow literary feel to it, but it wasn't hard to read. Good literature has three things: first, excellent writing, second, lots and lots of feelings, and third, a nice, ambiguous ending. The Giver has all of this and more. As ambiguous as the ending was, it was still beautiful and I walked away from the book having a better appreciation for life in general."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Giver Audio","review":"The CDs are great!

It is wonderfully explained how one ends up not questioning the system and how he/she can escape it. The end is splendid except for a \\"prop\\" which appears from nowhere. This excepted, the book is beautiful. I strongly recommend it to everyone over 13. I warranty parents they won't hear \\"I'm bored\\" or \\"I have nothing to do\\" the time of this book reading and may be thinking of :).

It was a real page turner at first. But, there were some things that I feel should have been better explained to make the story feel more real. For example, that author didn't explain HOW the people were unable to see color or HOW all hills were removed. About 3/4 of the way done, I realized that the end of the book was rapidly approaching and wondered how it would end. Well, it seems the author got a little bored and just decided to end it. The ending was terrible. TERRIBLE. This book had so much potential and the storyline itself was interesting.

My criteria for awarding my 5 stars is, \\"Will I remember this story next week and does it leave me pondering the book's ending?\\" The Giver makes us think about freedom at the most basic level. We must also ponder which is more important, freedom or safety, having needs immediately satisfied through keeping people ignorant or allowing people to make their own decisions though they won't have the cushion of large numbers of people to accomplish goals. Can people live with harsh punishments for breaking miniscule rules? The Giver asks us to ponder many such questions and to contemplate how the story may relate to our own government and how our liberty and freedoms have been and continue to be diluted and even stolen by socialistic leaders."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Perfect World is not always perfect.","review":"Have you ever read a book that's so great you can't put it down to use the bathroom.

'But you suffer all the time.' When he becomes so stressed, he runs away with Gabriel, a Newchild. As he rides down the hill with the sled, memories of joy and love come to him. The end is ambiguous, leaving the reader to decide Jonas and Gabe's fate.The Giver is a Newberry Medal winner. It's a, \\"One more chapter!\\" book. If you read The Giver, you will be glad you did."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is a very interesting and inspiring book. It's about a boy named Jonas living in a community that is perfect. This community has no feelings, nor colours. Jonas has been chosen to be the Receiver of Memory on his 12th birthday and discovers the real world of pain, the feelings and learns all the colours. Lois Lowry's creative mind touched me, with her amazing story. This book leaves you with a surprising ending. I strongly recommend this to all the readers out there who love to read and children from ages 10 and up."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver was a great novel because it always keeps you on your toes and makes you stop and think about life. It is a novel about a boy named Jonas who lives in a utopia with no differences, he is given a respected job, he is notified that in the training of his new job there will be pain it is called the job of receiving memory. In training Jonas receives things that people in the community are not given such as color, choice, memory of war, snow, sun, love and hate. Jonas is overwhelmed with painful and cherished memories and realizes that a perfect world for one person is not a perfect world for another, but he and the previous receiver of memory are the only ones that know this because the other people if the communities don’t experience choice, love or hate. Jonas finally decides to escape the community and leave all the memories to the community and the old receiver of memory."},{"rating":"2","title":"What Are You Waiting For?","review":"Like thousands of other English classes around the country, mine has been reading The Giver. The Giver, in my opinion, is one of the most thought-provoking books of recent memory. The plot, which I won't give away as many other reviewers have, is very well crafted by Lowry. Though the book is intended for a younger audience, many adults will enjoy it as well. This book is a \\"must get\\" for any readers who truly understand and enjoy their books."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Frightening Future","review":"I realy enjoyed The Giver by Lois Lowry. It was very interesting. It's about a boy named Jonas who is eleven years old.He will soon be twelve. Jonas is going to be in the ceremeny of the twelves. That is when you are given a job in the community. Jonas gets picked as The Giver. The Giver has memories of the past that no one else has. But will Jonas be able to except the memories? You will have to read The Giver to find out."},{"rating":"1","title":"No mans land","review":"Censorship reflects a community's shortage of self-confidence. In the book The Giver written by Lois Lowry almost everything is censored in their community: the ability to see color, pick their own jobs, and read books. Also, there aren't any hills, weapons, music, fishing, birthdays, families, love, or memories. Censorship can be bad or good depending on what you are blocking. America is unlike the community in The Giver, less strict on what to block and what to allow. I would rather live in America because we can see color and we also have more rights."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lasalle springs Middle *!*!*!*!*!*!*!*!*!*!*","review":"Censorship proves that the world has no assurance in its youth. Likewise, it exhibits an untrustworthy atmosphere by the elders. Screening is one person's beliefs forced upon everyone else. One book that has been banned by some school districts because of censorship is The Giver. In my opinion, I thought it was a very good book. It showed a world of sameness and what can happen when you take away the thoughts and choices of people in a community. Then the characters in the book discover the security is not the best choice. Censorship allows people to decide whether they can share their thoughts without being afraid of how the public will react. This is why censorship shows that leaders have no confidence in the rest of the community."},{"rating":"2","title":"the giver review by:Cory Charlton","review":"I found that The Giver quite amusing. The Giver is about a community not an ordinary community this community is so called perfect. This book is about a kid named Jonas.(Every year they have an assembly and all of the people(s) birthdays are all on the same day.)This last assembly Jonas received a job Jonas had been selected.Jonas is a very important person in this book. I really liked the book except for the end because it really stumped me did he die ?, or did he live?

I like the point of view. The Giver, like 1984, gives an impression of what the future could be like. In The Giver Jonas is selected as the Reciever of Memory. This position give him the training to get all of the memories that the other people of the community don't have. The others don't have feelings, can't see color, and everything is planned out. Jonas decides that he wants to be free of the community and go to the \\"elsewhere\\". He steals the child that his family was caring for and escapes. He does this without preperation bacause the child was scheduled for release, to be killed, the following day. This almost cost them their lives. At the end of the book Jonas finds the sled in his memory and slide down the hill."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Giver Review","review":"I thought The Giver was a very strange book. I thought it was strange because their community had so many rules. For example, they become adults when they are 12, and the men have to apply for their wives and children.

It stands out on that list because, unlike other dystopias, this one requires a few elements borrowed from fantasy literature to make possible the relationship between the Giver and the Receiver.Perhaps if that had been worked differently, this would have gone from four to five stars.As a dystopia, this is one of the rare \\"female\\" dystopias. A male dystopia shows how each person plugs into the society and how it impacts the family. A female dystopia concentrates more on the family relationships and how they support society. The two are similar but not the same. This makes a good read for the reason of a refreshing perspective.Even though this is considered \\"adolescent literature\\", it was well written enough for an adult to enjoy.

After reading the book The Giver, thought it was an okay book. I don't really like to read so I don't read books unless I have to. The Giver is a weird book. I don't know why you would have a community with no color or memory or anything like that. It's just stupid. The Giver is a good book, I guess, if you can understand it, I thought it was very confusing because the whole town is colorblind except for a couple of people. And they can't have memory or experience pain. I got confused on that part. Only The Giver and the receiver of memories can see color. But at the end they get back to their community and everybody can see color and they are all having fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brilliant Idea, Poorly Written","review":"The idea behind The Giver is clearly a unique perspective on things. It is the type of book where, you are placed in the middle of a totally different area, and you are left to figure out how it works. Gradually, you learn more and more, and things you thought were obviously true, weren't. However, there are some things in this book that are unacceptable. For instance, this society is very complex, and yet, there was still only one active plot throughout the entire book. There was not a single scene that did not contain the main character. This book has the potential to be alot more entertaining to read, if it were to have more subplots. Also, the book is very simply written when it comes to the grammar and choice of vocabulary, thus, you do not have to be \\"mature\\" to understand this book at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intriguing!","review":"I thought this book was great.

It's the idea that by getting rid of the 'bad', such as war, starvation, and suffering, will inadvertently get rid the 'good' , such as beauty, love, and relationships.However, the vehicles used to prove that idea are lacking. 12 year old boys do not worry about their careers; 12 year old boys do not plot a runaway for the sake of a baby; it is not remotely convincing that thousands of memories would come over a community because one person left.

I rated The Giver 2 stars because in my opinion it needed more work. Overall the book was well-written and it seemed to me that the author put some time and effort into this book. I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading books about the future and books that are a little out there. In the book, Jonas' world was a little weird. They had certain rules for everything. They were very precise and they wanted everything to be that way. That's the part of the book that really didn't appeal to me that much.

I know you'll love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"this book is great!! it has meaning....","review":"i think 'the giver' is a really cool book. i love the way it takes place in what seems like a whole different world than the one we live in--no weather, choices, everything on strict rules. the way that jonas thinks that it would be a good idea to let everyone share all those memories is great, and the whole book is very memorable. i would definately reccommend it, but you should be a fairly good reader and have and open mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent book for our modern society","review":"As a seventh grade English teacher, I am always on the lookout for books my students will WANT to read. This year we read The Giver. And while not every student enjoyed the book, many were touched by its themes. This is a book that brings up many issues our society struggles with today: drug abuse, depression and pain medications, euthanasia,abortion, and the power of government. I believe every young person should read The Giver--if for no other reason than to be provoked to thought about these issues."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was soooooo good!!","review":"This book was definitly one of my favorite books.

Jonas wants the people of his structured community to experience feelings, and choice. And maybe with the Giver's help he can do it.I highly recomend this book, it combines exceptional writing with a fascinating concept, and it really makes you think"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Giver Lets Your Imagination Soar","review":"In the Giver, you can let your imagination soar.You can pretend you are part of Jonas's world.Where everything is the same and plain. Wherepeople have to buy babies from birthmothers andtheir career is chosen for them. Where everyonehas the same \\"birthday\\". Everyone is trapped withno knowledge of the outside world.

I love it !!!","review":"This book, to me, was another happy-go-lucky book with a perfect society. Until the character \\"The Giver\\" exposed to Jonas how cruel the actual world was, and used to be. The truth about release, and how this one receiver carries such a huge responsibility. The last 10 chapters are what makes this book a certain classic.

It is prophetic in fortelling a possible future, but I just read This Perfect Day, and Ira Levin's reality seems more feasible."},{"rating":"2","title":"this book is great.","review":"It is good because it makes you think, it's not just there for pure intertainment.

After reading, The Giver, I am very happy to live in such a wonderful world filled with colors, emotions and feeling. It was terrible to think of the world without these precious neccessities which we usually take for granted. I am glad it had a happy ending, where society was restored to how it should always have been!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not a childrens book!","review":"It is not hard to understand why the content, though seemingly complex, is in fact shallow. It is written for mentally careless or untrained people, especially children, that can be easily led astray if the content does not bring attention to unresolvable problems.

It was a 5th grade assignment. They thought it was not believeable and just played a little game of which would be the lesser evil, reading this book 15 times or \\"The Lovely Bones.\\" I haven't read it, just reporting their sub-optimal reactions.

The only use for this book was for a coaster. Also, when I was cold, I made a fire. Lois Lowry is a disturbing author whom I think belongs behind bars. This selection would have been rated less, however (just like the Giver) there is a lack of choices for negative stars.

I Think Not","review":"My opinion of \\"The Giver\\", is the same opinion as theone I have about Puley Shore movies. They're quite entertaining in thebeginning, but after awhile, the plot gets dull and eventually loses its flavor. The idea of having a perfect society is a good idea for a story, but dragging out the idea that the characters have no emotions gets a tad bit annoying. I get the idea that the characters have no emotions, but Lois Lowery has to tell the reader every other sentence. She acts like the reader is going to forget or something. I admit, the beginning of the story is good; how Lowery tells you about the society's rules, and the Giver's job, but after all that is said, she says the same thing over again. And the ending was the worst ever in the history of literature. This is a horrible book.

Suggesting that imperfect young and the imperfect old can be removed from a culture is a scary idea.

Now he is chosen to be the recevier then he finds out everything from what objects are colors are to the different types of weather. This story is a weird one. I personally dont care for it.

And, if the author is trying to teach me something, I sure didn't pick it up. In the process of reading this book another thought came to me. If the author really put thought into this book, where there is everything from baby killing to a person burning up, then perhaps she needs a bit of R&R.; The Giver reminds me of what I think of after a real bad day.

It has lots of feelings present. I could really connect to the characters. I could understand how they felt about certain topics. For example, Jonas, the main character, felt that there shouldn't be sameness. There was lots of description in The Giver. I could see mental images in my mind of when Jonas sled down the hill. Lois Lowry does a superb job giving you a description. There was also interesting details. You knew every aspect about every event in the story. She depicted every memory to make sure you knew what it was like as if you were there. For example, Lowry stated, \\"The brutal slice of pain...\\"This is why The Giver is a book with good literature."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Giver Review","review":"The Giver was good literature; it had lots of interesting details, lots of description, and full of feelings. It had lots of interesting details when it told about each memory that The Giver gave to Jonas. It had lots of description when it said, that the Giver was going to give Jonas a memory of the war. They give a good description of it, they talk about the blood, guns and people dying. It was full of feelings when it said that Jonas asked his parents if they loved him. One quote was, \\" Do you love me?\\" Jonas said. His parents said that love doesn't exist anymore. As a result, The Giver is a good example of good literature."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Giver Review","review":"The Giver was not an example of good literature. It was confusing, and it had to many unanswered questions. Also, it was difficult to understand. The Giver was confusing because when she had the characters speak, it was hard to follow who was speaking. Also I think that the end was confusing as well because no one knows what happens. It's one of the many unanswered questions that could easily be answered; she never cleared it up so you don't know what happens to Jonas at the end of the story. It was confusing because when the Giver speaks about Rosemary and why she applied for a release it gets confusing because you can't tell weather they are flashing back to the past, or the present. \\"One for here, one for else where.\\" Lily chanted. The quote was hard to understand because when she was talking about it, we don't know whether she meant for one of them or the twins that were being brought into the community. All in all, I think that The Giver was not good literature."},{"rating":"1","title":"funny","review":"the main characters of book is Jonas,the reciever,and Jonas family. The title of this book is The Giver by Lois Lowry. The setting of this novel is in a small cummunity. The main conflict of this story is basically Jonas trying to get away from the community cause it's not utopia. The utopia of this book is for every thing to be safe and no critism and the dystopia is that they released you if you do something wrong.the award of this book is that it receive a newberry award.

The author, Lois Lowry, is gifted, and what others have written about her writing is true - she is good at conveying degrees of pain and pleasure, astounding at introducing a concept as if the reader has never come across it before (color, music, etc.). The problem is Lowry's agenda, maybe only one an adult could see. The deep dark secret of Jonas' community is euthanasia - unwanted or unfeasible babies and the extremely aged and fragile are injected with death-inducing drugs. This seems to be a veiled attempt to poison the impressionable reader against abortion and the right-to-die, by playing on his/her emotions - Jonas is so stunned by what he sees his \\"father\\" do to a baby that he refuses to go home, and runs away from the community.

This book tells about a perfectly planned community. The community was planned from their jobs to their families. I also liked the one part of the story when a kid named Jonas, who became the new receiver of memory, tried to escape from the community and save a baby's life. The receiver of memories is someone who gives memories of events that happened before the community was perfect to the new receiver of memory. He also tells the Chief Elder what to do when the Chief Elder doesn't know how to settle something.

The book really isn't terrible, just cliched. The old horse of 'they had perfect lives, but they did not love' is trotted out once again, and the entire 'supposedly utopian but secretly evil' society that the author crafts is self-indulgent and unconvincing. In short, this is \\"Look everyone! I'm writing serious material!\\" work, a dumbed-down 'Anthem'. Yes, it's nicely allegorical, but there are other books that carry off the utopian theme much better, such as '1984', 'Brave New World' or the aforementioned 'Anthem'. It's truly painful to see teenagers learning this in school and taking it as the epitome of Utopian allegory."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why do teachers keep assigning this book?","review":"With all the great literature that is available for middle schoolers, it is mind boggling that The Giver, a mediocre yet sensationalist book, keeps getting assigned for fifth graders. Suppression of puberty, commercialized breeding and other features of the story are, I hope, beyond the realm of understanding for 10 year olds. There are plenty of great dystopian novels out there to read for older students, but this is certainly not one of them. To all you teachers who are simply following the pack on this front, look into some other options and teach Orwell, Swift and the like when students are ready."},{"rating":"1","title":"Caution","review":"This book is not for everyone. My child had nightmares after reading chapter 19 which I would easily rate R for graphic detailed violence. For parents who take their responsibility of monitoring the material their children are exposed to, be sure ahead of time that your child will not be emotionally upset by the \\"how - to\\" description of the actions. In my opinion, there are no redeeming qualities to this book. My child could not evaluate anything to do with the book because she was obsessed with the murder of an innocent new-born baby. While other people may say that it's not real, the subject of euthanasia is real. I would never recommend this book, however, I would caution parents, and teachers alike to evaluate the person for whom the book is being selected and determine if he/she will be negatively affected by it ahead of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work for me","review":"After looking at all the rave reviews...it must be me.

In fact I liked the polite world so much that I wouldn't object to ...the bad things behind the curtain, that make the society possible.The latter book was so unsatisfying, like how could there be no sun, but stuff grows, and how could there be no color?This book has a great story idea, unfortunately it doesn't flesh out.PS I especially liked the dinner scenes where each member of the family has to politely wait for other family members to share their day and then they comfort each other!

This took away from the development of the scenery and overall plot. I thought this because the story did not have much description about the scenery so every time there was anything about scenery it was amazing, but there was not enough detail for a person to be able to imagine what the place looked like in her mind. On the other hand the overall story was wonderful the characters were well developed and the suspense was well created. Like the memory of the poachers and the elephant and the elephant's mate. Another example would be the memory of warfare."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Giver","review":"Have you ever wondered what the world would be like if everything was the same, and there were rarely any choices? Lois Lowry does an excellent job of exploring a society without the freedoms and the decisions most people have today. With detailed looks into the mind of one teenager growing up in a society of sameness, The Giver answers many of the questions that people have about giving people complete freedoms and choices. By not giving all of the information about the society at the beginning of the novel, Lowry keeps the readers intrigued and waiting to see what Jonas will decide to do. The Giver is the perfect book to relax with while stimulating questions of why society is the way it is and how is could be incredibly different."},{"rating":"2","title":"the giver","review":"i was really interested the moment i started it.

I think that Lois Lowry is a wonderful author because she writes in a way that intrigues but helps the reader maintain clear comprehension"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply, Wonderful","review":"If you grew up reading The Chronicles of Narnia series, you will love this book.It's based on a created utopia, where you are destined to live as you are told, but I wont go any further, please read the book. I loved it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I had high expectations for this book, because Lois Lowry's Number the Stars was phenomenal, but these expectations were just not met. Jonas is an interesting enough character, and the giver/receiver concept of inheriting memories is interesting, but the ending of the book fizzled out, and I was very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"I couldn't put it down!","review":"I first heard this book when my teacher read it to the class. I found it to be >THE< best book I have ever read. I first hear of how good the community in this book is,but I become shocked by the freedoms denied to it's people. When Jonas finds out, he feels as if the life he had experienced was just a lie. When he decides to leave, he takes a young baby named Gabriel with him. Going on a long journey filled with never-ending pain. Yet, at the last parts he feels the best joys he has ever experienced."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's worth reading.","review":"I had to read this book for a class. I had no clue what the book was about when I started it. But I actually liked the book. I thought that the main character Jonas made a great change in his character from the beginning to the end. The plot was great and it was a fast, easy read. Anybody who wants to get away from the world for a couple of hours should definately read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's the best possible book of its subject.","review":"Hello, my name is Alex Brunk. I'm in the seventh grade at Cadillac Middle School. I have read your book, The Giver. I thought it was interesting and unique. I don't think it needs a sequel. The reader having to make up an ending is another reason why I like it. Thank you for your time"},{"rating":"2","title":"interesting","review":"This book is interesting with some life lessons.

It was an assigned book during the course that I took in summer. I when I first start reading the book it was kid of boring, but later the events attracted me to read it. Sometimes I read this book on the train while I am going to my class. One day I was almost miss my stop because this book made me live in its story.Especially, the part when Jonas had discovered the truth about the release, and had seen his father had released new child. However, the end is still confusing.I am thinking to read this book one or maybe two more time, for I Enjoyed reading it. I wondered why some authorities are frightened from keeping this book available for schools."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of best books we've ever read!!!","review":"Our seventh grade reading class was assigned this book to read. Lowry did an excellent job of describing the events so that you felt as if you were there. Our teacher blushed during the \\"Stirrings\\", and we laughed. (at her)We were all saddened when we found out what \\"released\\" meant and, we were shocked when we discovered Rosemary's identity. We had mixed feelings about the ending. Some of us liked it, and some of us didn't. However, we all agreed that it was worth the time to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Book is ok!!!!!!!!","review":"I think the book is ok, in the begining it is very boring and confusing, but in the middle of thr book it gets very good.I really hate the ending of the book..........:("},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"The Giver\\"","review":"This is a wonderful book showing what possibly may happen in the future. Lois Lowry opens the readers' eyes to the possibilities that life may not always be as we know it now. Jonas, the main character, is an apprehensive eleven year old at the beginning of this book. He turns into a very wise, knowledgable twelve-year-old. The Giver and Jonas live in a dull community without individualism, colors or any change at all (in weather, land, people, etc.). Jonas and the Giver are the only people in their community who have feelings and hold the memories (of pain and pleasure) of the past. To see how Jonas tries to save the memories of the past, read this thought-provoking story by Lois Lowry!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kaitlyn Soligan, VHS Folklore Classroom Review","review":"Lois Lowry's tale of a future without choice, without pain, and without love is a cautionary tale for every generation. The main character, Jonas, learns the value of emotion, growth and choice through memories of the past, highlighting the oft-repeated quote, a favorite among social studies teacher, \\"Those who forget the past are doomed to repeat it.\\" Though few of the characters develop into anything more than examples of how a wrold without a past can go terribly awry, the world Lowry creates is a fascinating, frightening example of how choice and freedom are invaluable resources."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Book Crituque","review":"Lois Lowry's book, The Giver, was a really good book. I really liked the way she described the \\"Community.\\" I also liked the way she put everything in order. She didn't skip around from in the middle of one of Jonas' sessions with the Giver to school the next day. I thought the ending could've been much better though. She left us on the edge of our seats when she ended the book. She never told us how Jonas liked Elsewhere or if he and Gabe even made it to Elsewhere. THERE NEEDS TO BE A SEQUAL! Overall I think the book was really good. If Lois would've added all the parts she left out including the ending, the start of life in Elsewhere for Jonas and Gabe, how the community reacted to all the memories, what Lily's assignment was, and if Asher and Fiona were put together in a family unit, it would've been that much better! 7.3 jrm"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Giver's Words","review":"The Giver was a very good book, although it made me think a lot about how Jonas would start a new life with Gabe in elsewhere. I tried to think about what could have happened, but Lowry gave a little sense of mystery. The Giver got me a little confused with being released because in the begining it sounded like they would put the person in another community. In the end it said they killed the released people.My opinion about The Giver is that it was very detailed and that it has a lot of mystery to it. The details were excellent because I could picture the red sled going down the snow hilland then stopping, perfectly. Also the mystery was just enough. When Jonas found elsewhere, it told enough to show that he made it to a better place. Overall, I Think that Lois Lowry's, The Giver, was a very well writin tale!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Releasing is not always positive","review":"I had to read this book for school.Exactlly I had to read it for the subject english. First it was a big problem to understand the text, because my english is not the best. But under hard work I tried to understand everything. Now I am glad that I have worked as hard as I did. The Book is really a exciting. It is a very interesting thought of future. Furthermore the book stimulates to think about life in our world, about life in future and I thought very much about communism, beause of the sameness in the book. But I give \\"The Giver\\" only 4 stars because of the end. The book ends very suddenly. You get the empression that Louis Lowry wanted to end the book very fast. General: It is a good book and if you want to understand my topic you should read the book :-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Giver","review":"At first I think this book will be a funny book but it isn't. It's a very hard and sad story. You have no own opinion and you miss all the beautiful events in life. The people in the community live in a prison from which you can't escape. For me the book is very interesting - but sometimes a little bit boring. It's a different style than other books have - that's one important reason for me to read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Giver CD","review":"The Giver CD was a nice addition to my reading class. The speaker on the CD is easy to understand. However, I was disappointed because the chapters were not marked. You had to search for the chapter each day. If the publisher had been smart, he would have marked the chapters like songs are marked on CD's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly executed and abrupt","review":"Felt like the first half of a longer book. I might have liked it if it weren't for the childish writing style. It reminded me of a the way a 10-year-old tells you about his day-- \\"First this happened. And then this happened. And then this. And then this.\\"Just not really good overall. As some of the other reviewers suggest, read 1984 or Brave New World, or countless others instead. One might argue that this book has more of a metaphysical leaning but those concepts weren't really given the proper treatment. The lofty ending might not have been as bad if the first 90 percent of the book weren't so matter-of-fact."},{"rating":"2","title":"I think the giver was...","review":"As I read through the first few pages I felt kind of confused because what I thought the book was going to be about it wasn't really about that at all. Then as I hit the mid pages I liked and understood it. I think that the book was exciting and you were always wondering what was going to happen next. It wasn't such a fighting war type of book, but it also wasn't such a mellow, comfy type of book. I like how the author wrote each chapter. He used very clever and interesting words to describe what each character was feeling emotionally, physically, and mentally. Over all I think I liked and enjoyed the book because I didn't understand everything right when it happened, but by the end it all had woven together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Individuality and freedom.","review":"The first time I read this book I was in fourth grade, and most of of its meaning was lost on me. I have reread this book and a lot of connections were made that I simply was not mature enough to see before. At the ripe old age of nine, I simply did not understand the ideas of freedom and the ability to make choices. Now at 18, I see many of the ideas that went through Jonas' mind paralleled my own as I matured. The sense of individuality and freedom, which I now take for granted, were completely removed from the society Jonas was raised in, yet he found the ideas buried within him. It shows that the breaking away of a maturing child is archetypal in nature. And that, i believe, is the fundamental basis of this novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was a great book...","review":"...With an awesome plot but it was one of those books that leaves you sort of hollow and with a new look of what the world may become. You know your so engrossed in thinking it over in your head you walk into walks and can't talk for about an hour. A world without color, love and choices, is a scary thought. It took me only a day to read this mostly because it was too good to put down but also because I'm a very fast reader. Even if it is a very good book and thought provoking, I don't think younger kids should read it. It may not make a lot of sense to them and that ruins a story when you have to come back and read it later after a failed attempt. By now your probably wondering why I gave it only four stars. The reason is no matter how many times I read the ending I still wonder: What the hell happened?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Book No Matter What","review":"Personally I think this book is fantastic. Instead of focusing on a personality-free world, as one of the other readers might have thought, it actually shows that we need a bit of everything to keep the world going. We need war, and we need rebels. We need conflict and we need pain. We will always need change, and, like the book says, we will always need love, no matter how corny that sounds.This really is a great book, so I strongly suggest that you should read it and/or reread it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is a well written book.

Don't listen to it; read it instead. First off, they used cheesy music on and off throughout the book, probably to make it dramatic or suspenseful but all it did was detract from the seriousness of the book. Also, the reader did not say the chapter numbers so moving back and forth between the audio and print book was very difficult. I think the chapter breaks were identified by the cheesy music. The reader was OK but not great. All this put together did not make for an enjoyable listening experience. The book is easy to read and rather predictable for a well-read adult, but this did not detract from the story and my ability to enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mlée is going to be huge someday!","review":"I've been following the band for a little over two years, and let me tell you: Everyday Behavior is one of the best albums I own.

It's a blend of pop and indie rock which creates incredibly powerful and moving songs. They know when to jam, and they know when to slow it down. All of their songs are uplifting.

The books loses focus and forgets who its audience is over and over. There are discussions about the mandatory features that need to be implemented when writing a database driver, Visual Source Safe, and many other topics that don't have any thing to with writing a C++ database application.To make matter worse the book is also riddled with typos - both grammar and code. The book spends more time discussing MFC than it does implementing the database code. The coding style displayed in this book is that of a beginner. If you are an beginner programmer this is an example of how NOT to program. The code is very inconsistent and poorly laid out. Functions for common pieces of code are never created and instead copied each time that it is needed - sometimes 3 or 4 times in one tiny example application).This isn't the typical book that you would expect from Wrox.

It probably would have played better as a 1/2 hour episode of Night Gallery. For reference purposes on 50's horror, I prefer House on Haunted Hill or Tingler to this film. Screaming Skull is not bad, just uneventful with a lack of real scares or creativity.One thing to note on the Good Times version - it has a decent transfer, the sound has a hiss and crackle and there is a GoodTimes 'GT' logo that stays in the bottom corner of the screen the entire picture.

My guess is that, next year, he'll use another slightly different angle and try to sell you the same basic information.What I find truly onerous about his books is the condescending tone that Schneier adopts when addressing the reader.Recently I spoke with a PhD, from Brown, who performed decades of research in number theory. He recommended \\"Cryptography in C and C++,\\" by Michael Welschenbach. He also said \\"I don't know why people think Applied Cryptography is such a good book. He [Schneier] doesn't seem to understand the mathematics very well.\\" Pick up Applied Cryptography sometime and compare it side-by-side with Welschenbach's book. You'll see what that PhD was talking about."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read","review":"Beyond Fear is a must read for anyone who wants to figure out what's really going on when security issues hit the news. Reading Schneier's clear explanation about how security decisions usually get made helped me understand why so few of the ones we hear about seem to make any sense! In addition to his insightful analysis and handy five-step rule for making security decisions, the book is filled with fascinating anecdotes and stories that make for an entertaining and interesting read. Every member of our government needs to read this book - and you should too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just like Texas: a whole lot of nothing","review":"Some pedants may decry Bruce's many semantic flaws, but these same people have neglected to realize that their biggest mistake was to buy the book to begin with.BZZZT. Thank you for playing.The basic lessons of this book are so painfully obvious that I have no idea why anyone in their right mind would buy it, especially in this economy. I kid you not, I literally stood in an airport gift shop, in my civies, and read this book while waiting for a flight back to base. The book is riddled with filler material, which was probably necessary to pad the book to 250+ pages. You could easily summarize the book in ten pages (but that would prevent the publisher from charging you $17.50).If you already have one of Schneier's books, then there is no reason to buy this one. Pogie bait is cheaper and more satisfying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth reading","review":"I'm a computer scientist and this book didn't teach me anything.

So, if you set your expectations low enough you will be set to enjoy this movie.The absolute cluelessness of the characters lets you put your brain in neutral and let it idle a bit.However, the one thing that I found really unique about this film was that Hollywood did time travel right for a change, as opposed to all of the paradoxical situations that it has produced in the past (Back to the Future etc) Not that those films were bad, but it wasn't so much time travel as semi-controled sliding between alternate universes...Bill and Ted. 1 time line, No paradoxes, and a time-traveling phone booth (think TARDIS but not as cool) -- just good plain fun...."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good movie worth most people's time","review":"If you can watch the movie without being totally drowned out by the low brow dialogue and 80's rock references, you should do just fine. As for me, I eat that stuff up, so it made it easier for me to enjoy the real meat of the film.People who can't handle a light hearted movie with a few catch phrases belittle this film, but it has a lot going for it. The acting is pretty good- George Carlin is terrific, and Alex Winter and Keanu Reeves do quite well (even though they didn't truly nail their characters until Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey). The Time Lore presented here is, actually, quite thought provoking. Really think about what's being manipulated here, and to what degree it is or is not feasible given generally accepted time mechanics. It's quite fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"We bought this for my son, to show him what Keanu looked like in the 'olden' days. Cute movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the funniest movie, but extremely charming","review":"I'm not going to go over what happens in this film. All I can say that this film is extremely charming, albeit not laugh-out loud funny. Parents, this is a film that you can let your young teenagers watch, and not worry about what they will see or hear. No nudity. Very light on sexual innuendo. Little, if ANY profanity. I think some of the bad reviews are from older, tight-booties, who can't appreciate a cute, highly amusing, and charming film.

It still is great fun to watch today, and it definately brings back major memories of the 80s. The DVD has a decent picture and good sound but its lacking in any kind of special features whatsoever. I would still reccomend getting it though, its worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whoa!!!","review":"Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure has never looked better. The true venue for Keanu's talent.

(Literally)","review":"Finally, one of THE funniest movies ever made is coming to DVD. This is one of the movies that helped launch the career of now mega-star Keanu Reeves, and spawned a bunch of copy-cat movies like \\"Wayne's World\\" and \\"Dude, Where's MY Car?\\", but this was the original DUDE movie! Dim-witted high school friends Bill & Ted don't realize they are destined to be the great ones who will change the course of the world through their music, bringing about world peace (as well as clean air, and more excellent water slides than any other planet we communicate with!) Right now, they have to pass history! With help from cool futuristic dude Rufus and a time-travelling phone booth, they travel back in time to assemble the greatest historical figures for the greatest history report of all time! Its a hilarious romp through the past and present (and you may learn a thing or 2). Wyld Stallyns rules!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure","review":"You cannot watch this movie too many times! You can rationalize it for anyone who is presently, or has in the past, taken Social Studies (Global or American). Even though this movie was made in the late '80's, the two main characters, and the George Carlin character, remain recognizable (as types) and hysterically funny in their doinky, or jaded, way (as the case may be). The historical figures are played to perfection."},{"rating":"2","title":"As a teacher, I find this movie hysterical. And....a friend of mine is in the movie.","review":"My favorite scene in the whole movie is when \\"Ted\\" offers \\"Genghis Kahn\\" a Twinkie.

(Note, he actually prefers \\"Sno Balls\\" over \\"Twinkies\\")."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ruefully hilarious","review":"Familiar scene - two dudes in high school, dumb as a rock about anything important, stuck in a bind and suddenly learn a lesson. The sad thing is that the situation depicted here is sadly true in a lot of schools today. My kids loved the movie- thought the guys so stupid as to be hilarious. Dude, it was awesome...(you know). Not much history taught here - Socrates (pronounced by the boy wonders \\"So-crates\\") and Joan of French fame (Noah's wife - cute). The rest - Beethoven, Ghengis, Billy the Kid - are all window dressing. Strictly a \\"forget your troubles\\" flick but still good for young teens."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dated...","review":"This film was recommended by a fellow teacher for an end of the year reward for my students. Some of them enjoyed it, but I will never watch it again. The dialogue is dated and painful to listen to...I know it is a parody of the times, but I can't imagine ever finding this film enjoyable. Another teacher did...she enjoys watching it. I truly am surprised she recommended it.I love George Carlin...he was a redeeming feature for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comedy that ages well! Go San Dimas High!","review":"I've probably watched this movie five times. I laugh every time! The acting of Keanu Reeves and Alex Winter is so down to earth... these guys are not the sharpest tacks in the room, but they make use of what they have to work with a futuristic George Carlin to bring piece and balance to the universe.All they have to do is to learn to play music (and, of course, pass their history course).I've got (I admit) a VHS tape, and you certainly want to get a DVD or other digital recording. Those VHS tapes don't age too well (mine is probably 15+ years old).The jocularity of the movie is worth the investment to me to upgrade one of these days. And I certainly like this film better than I like the sequel,Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey.Be excellent to each other!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Most Excellent!","review":"Bill and Ted are two defunct high schoolers who have been stuck with a horrendous history assignment (I never knew Joan of Arc was Noah's wife!). With a little bit of help from the future they travel back in time, picking up famous historical characters on the way (Miss of Arc, Mister the Kid). I think my favorite part was when Bill and Ted were in the old West, when Ted says, \\"Dude they didn't even card us! We got to remember this place.\\" Or maybe it was when they met So Crates (in their book under Socrates). A classic in my book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A funny history lesson","review":"Although wacky at times. Bill and Ted take an excellent ride to pass a history course.

Sure it's dumb, put parts are funny and overall was an enjoyable film to kill some time. Unfortunately it's transition to DVD format is quite mediocre.

I love stoner films and I can handle the dumbest of dumb when it comes to stuff like this, but this film is really boring with no laughs to be had. The two stars have no chemistry or charisma and considering the premise the film goes absolutely nowhere.

I just don't see how people can get this. It's not funny in the least. The plot is retarded, the acting even more so. It obviously took the main characters no time at all to memorize their lines. \\"Heinous, dude, like, excellent!\\" is basically the whole movie. It takes real effort to make a movie this monotonous. For that I applaud the director. The first time i saw it, I thought it would be funny, but I fell asleep. REAL COMEDIC."},{"rating":"1","title":"Radical in all the wrong ways - snapshot of modern America.","review":"Friends of mine I respect adore this film, so I guess I should judge it on its own terms. It certainly captures a moment in post-modernity when history became a flat nothing, reduced to propaganda for the great project of American amnesia. I'd like to think the whole thing was sarcastic, never mind subversive. I wouldn't mind, but they get a relatively good idea and do nothing with it. You've got all these famous people from history, and you don't try to see how they'd spark off each other, or how they'd genuninely react to 'our' world. I suppose there is something subversive about taking self-important Great Men (and token woman who dressed like man) and making them ridiculous, but that would be satire, and this settles for sniggering. The inane script, thumpable acting and non-existent visual style are meant to be endearing. I guess I'm old-fashioned - it made me feel violent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"How could you not? I know some people don't get the humor in this movie, but I think it's one of the funniest movies of the 80's. :) The sequel on the other hand... well, let's not go there. I only give it 4 stars in this review though, because the DVD has absolutely nothing special on it. The trailer, that's about it.

As if that weren't goofy enough, she decides to construct her monster using the brain of her father's assistant (whom she's just married) and the body of the hunky village idiot. It's a movie that could only be made in Italy and only in the '70s. Recommended for Euro-horror fanatics only.The picture and sound quality on this DVD could be better, but I've definitely seen worse on bargain-priced DVDs like this.

Joseph Cotten looks completely embarassed most of the time, while Hartigay (Jayne Mansfield's ex) just looks happy to be working. Bay/Neri is actually quite fetching. She's also an abysmal actor, as is the fellow who plays Marshall. As are, in fact, pretty much everyone in the movie. There are some interesting lab scenes, some nudity, a goofy-looking monster, a few double entendres, bad FX, lotsa murders and a seriously abrupt ending.

The rhymes and rhythms are bouncy and fun, and they gently slow down as you go, so that by the time you're near the end, your heart beat has slowed and so has your breathing. It's designed to get kids ready to fall asleep, even if they start out filled with energy- but it's still got all the silly and zany imagination of all his other works.

As it is, they've survived through sink disposal trips, dishwashers, being dropped, bent, and otherwise abused. But the thing is, I don't think they SHOULD bend. I found a really nice, heavy set of metal measuring spoons at Sur La Table that I like a little bit better. Though those don't have the nice grips that these ones do. Just don't put too much pressure on them or drop them in the sink and turn the disposal on like I did, or you'll end up with the grips all slashed up.

The quality of the songs are also very low. One of the singers pronounces Pokemon \\"Pokeman,\\" and the other sounds like he is singing into a jar.

Unless you take care to entangle them inside or under heavier items before you start the dishwasher, they will fly around inside!After discovering this, I purchased heavyweight stainless steel measuring spoons, which I do not have to worry about when putting them into the dishwasher.

Not all sets contain a 1/2 TBSP option, and I really prefer to have one. They also look nice, initially. After a while, as others have mentioned, the labels wear off. The 1/2 tsp also started to fall apart in the dishwasher. I've had these for a couple of years and guess I need to replace them. I prefer to be able to glance quickly at my spoons and grab the one I need. I didn't mind the size, actually.

They are plastic, and the set even includes the 1/8 teaspoon (smidge). They are slightly enongated to help facilitate reaching into spice jars.

Unfortunately, those bright dots wore away very quickly and I found the spoons to be bulky and the hanger to be awkward. I have small kitchen drawers, and these measuring spoons never lay smoothly in the drawer and often keep my drawer from closing or keep it from opening.

We were victim of this with a set of the OXO measuring cups, they lost their markings and it's very hard to see what they are.However with the newest set of OXO measuring cups, and with these measuring spoons, we haven't had any issues. The markings are raised up, so even if the markings had come of (they haven't) you would be able to tell what it was still. They've been through the dishwasher multiple times, and still there, so I think they've finally fixed their issue.Other than that, these are great measuring spoons, easily pulling off the ring without having to open the entire ring up, and work great like I expect OXO products to."},{"rating":"2","title":"best spelling book","review":"this aagain is a wonderful book,when i was a kid i used this same book,even though it changed a lot,and of course my son wanted to burn it,i saved it from a bonfire so i coould tell you this review,but i encourage all to buy this great spelling book,its beautifully illustrated and easy to use weekly lessons with 30 words each lesson"},{"rating":"1","title":"Works, sort of","review":"I bought this because I needed an inexpensive way to balance my mower blades.

The new songs have no time put into them and the rest are last-minute remixes. Another thing that disturbed me is that the whole CD is edited! If I buy a CD i want the straight-up version. They dont even give you a warning or notice that the tracks are butchered. This whole soundtrack is a disgrace to rock and rap both."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Soundtrack SUCKS!!!","review":"The song \\"Heckler\\" by primus is the only good song on this soundtrack!

For the naysayers, the clear proof of my assertion is in this DVD, and they will be proved wrong and left speechless. Celine has the whole package: she sings, dances, and entertains, in a wide range of repertoire, with class, versatility, and all these to perfection. The single most important trait that separates an elite singer from others is the ability to convey a unique depth of emotion when performing, and Celine's performance here clearly shows that she is the undisputed reigning Queen of pop music. If you are looking for the highest quality of entertainment, watch any of Celine's videos, and especially this concert. For details on this DVD refer to the other reviewers, however, I would like to note that Celine opens her show with that beautiful white dress shown in the front cover, and she really shines in it as she sings \\"Let's Talk About Love.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a Must Own !!!","review":"I purchased this import at a local store 3 weeks ago, for any Celine fan IT IS THE BOMB!!! almost 3 hours. the full concert,and some backstage rehearsals for the 2 albums L.T.A.L. 56 minutes.then for the album Sils.d'aimer\\" 25 minutes then 11 minutes , you get a karaoke version (words in french) on the bottom of your screen for the medley acouistque.. same 19 songs as the videocd dvd ,but the quality is superb picture wise..this should have allready been released in the U.S. or anywhere else for that matter,ah but you know how good old Sony/Columbia is to make that allmighty dollar..what's really funny is it is cheaper and better than the more expensive generic 1 ..?? go figure..(Noticed ;the cbs special isn't out yet) read my review on that 1..be warned i tell it straight from the heart..."},{"rating":"2","title":"celine-au couer du stade","review":"How amazing is Celine Dion in this concert.The power of her voice,stage presence,her simplicity and being genuine will really capture your heart.I got tears of joy watching this.I feel that i am connected to her too like her live audience.Although my french is limited but i got her message.Celine is extraordinary,strong impact in a music scene yet she remains so humble.I love her.To celine fans..what are you waiting for!"},{"rating":"2","title":"DYNAMIC !","review":"The very best concert you will ever see!

I've been listening to them for the last 3 hours while I nail the most difficult of Sudoku puzzles one after another. I'm supposed to be at work tomorrow morning at 0600, but I cannot put up the CD's. They're a compilation of 2 seperate jam sessions done in April 1950 and July 1955 in some music producer's home in California. They're noticeably the very best jazz piano I've ever heard and every song is awesome, some beyond belief. I cannot imagine anyone duplicating or matching them.

Tatum's playing is very intricate and dense with notes; it is not a cool, swinging sound. I think it is beyond dispute that Tatum was one of the most technically proficient pianists who ever lived. The question is then, does all that staggering virtuosity serve a purpose? For some, hearing somebody play what almost nobody else can play is enough to justify the purchase. For others, myself included, it is beautiful music as well. For me that is an intuitive reaction-- it sounds musical and organic to me, but I am not trained to understand structural and harmonic nuance. I think DG represents a small minority of people who believe that Tatum's playing is not sophisticated or musically nuanced. I would not want a steady diet of this, but on the right day it is perfect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too ever done.","review":"This is nothing more that Art Tatum trying to show off his fingering skills on the piano for his girlfriend.

Sometimes the BRS series is the best thing in the world, and sometimes it just bites. Unfortunally this book falls into the later. It is overwhelming to try and read through. It is ridden with detail after detail that makes it horribly difficult to read. It isn't even feasible to use this book along with class because it would take longer to read through this book then take the class that only last a couple weeks.

Kaleidoscope's debut is heavily debted to Syd Barrett in both lyrical and musical sense but in many ways theres a more orchestrated approach here that makes this stand on its own rather well. Sometimes theres a hint of very early Bee Gees and the Byrds. Bonus tracks and great liner notes fill this cardboard flipcase remaster- and if youre a fan of any summer of love or LSD fueled recording this is a must own- out of the original tracks almost all are great- nice vocal harmonies quirky story telling and interesting arrangements. Ofcourse it has all the trappings of psychedelia- the effected vocals- chimy organs and guitars and sound effects but again the songs are memorable.

Definitely cop this cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Album Ruined By Tape Hiss","review":"No doubt this is a 5 star performance. Armstong's vocals are sublime, as is Peterson's piano playing. But be forewarned, this remastered cd has an overbearing amount of tape hiss! I don't know anything about the modern technology that goes into these \\"remasters\\" but it is hard to believe there wasn't something that could have been done to reduce this horrible tape sibilence while preserving the overall sonic quality. I have never heard this 1957 album either on vinyl or its original cd issue; all I can tell you is that if you are at all bothered by tape hiss, you're not going to derive much enjoyment from this remastered cd. Too bad, because it is a nice performance (if a bit light on Louis' trumpet solos) from what is my favorite Louis Armstrong period - the late Fifties."},{"rating":"2","title":"Meeting of jazz masters","review":"The songs are standards, done by many other musicians. Performances are - as expected from these musicians - good. It's relaxing, nice, enjoyable, mostly slow tempo. But I'm not sure this is among their best work, I think both have been more sparkling and imaginative elsewhere (Louis plays W.C.Handy, Plays Fats, and Peterson with Clark Terry etc). Sound quality on the Verve Master Edition remaster is decent, but with more hiss and less soundstage than Verve's best of the period."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I'm a big fan of Louis Armstrong and also have great respect for Oscar Peterson--they are great musicians. But I was disappointed in this CD. The music is lackluster (bordering on boring) and the sound-quality is not great. (I have the 1990 issue on Verve.) I have tried listening to it several times but I simply cannot stay interested."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sizing is a big problem","review":"The fabric itself is acceptable but not great as you could see for the price tag of ~ 100usd, so the price after discount is even still a bit high compared to its quality.The sizing is a big big problem, size S is way far bigger than same size of any other's brand. Recommended to buy two size smaller than what you normally wear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as Described","review":"Condition was much worse than advertised.

The value and shipping were very inexpensive so the sound of it was my only disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Musical Selection","review":"Bocelli's voice salvages this CD - but barely. I am not particularly fond or contempuous of opera but I was not, to be frank, overly excited with the arias on this CD. I'll blame my lack of enthusiasm on my take it or leave it attitude relating to opera."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry to say this...","review":"I adore Bocelli, but this is a huge disappointment. What was the record company thinking? Everything he's done up until this release was just so wonderful; Sogno blew me away. This is like a throw-away. Who cares? Perhaps it will sell better world-wide, but I think he's really reaching and there's nothing new here. Too bad. I guess they'll just release anything with his name on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Make my arias profane","review":"A wise man told me years ago that the reason the Church banned so much operatic music at Mass was not that it was distracting, but because it was so bad.I find this selection to reinforce that judgment.

I would give it away if I knew someone that I disliked that much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wan, boring, inexplicable","review":"What is the appeal of Andrea Bocelli? He's cute, he's blind....but can he sing? On the basis of this CD, I'd say he can't. He carries a tune adequately, but the quality of his singing is enervated, listless, thin and monotonous. Asking around to some people who adore him, I've found that his fans are mostly those who don't like real classical or opera singing -- Bocelli's brand of light crooning does the trick for them. If you like that, too, this CD may be for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Christmas Nightmare","review":"What else can you say about someone who can't sing without massive electronic amplification and blending?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Astonishing!","review":"I have had this CD now for a year.....every time I go on a long trip, I'd listen to it....it just makes a ride nice and smooth. Bocelli is simply \\"music to your ears.\\" you never get tired,even after listening to it 5-10 times in a roll."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite lovely.","review":"I've always been fond of Bocelli. I find his voice and style to be pleasant; for my everyday listening he is more, well, *listenable* than, for example, Pavarotti. This album has its occasional weak spot if you're listening with a trained ear. My trained ears also like to just listen, and for that, this is a superb album. I'm not sure what it is about Bocelli that gets under the skin of the classical music reviewers--maybe it's Bocelli's history as a pop musician. In any case, I'd recommend this CD to anyone, including those who don't like classical music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ethereal Performance","review":"This CD is amazing. Andrea Bocelli has taken some of the world's most sacred music and given it more emotion than I thought possible. This CD is romantic, inspiring, and uplifting. I highly recommend it.

Sends chills down my spine...."},{"rating":"1","title":"As an avid Bocelli fan; I am disappointed in this effort.","review":"While Andreas' artistry is unquestioned, this is what happens when a record company feels they have to release product. Many of the tracts are from previous releases and I am finding little emotional reason to listen to this CD again. His previous efforts are much more interesting and satisfying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Each piece recorded at drastic varying volumes - ouch!","review":"I made a special trip to pick-up \\"Sacred Arias\\" for a gift. I played it and each piece came on at a drastic varying volume from the one before. One piece even had a chatter voice skip. Others, the volume jumped within the piece. Did I get a bad recording or did someone turn out some quick junk?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Voice failing to serve the music well","review":"Bocelli has always wanted to sing opera and in this album, he tries to perform some heavier stuff. Unfortunately, his voice and style let him down. His voice doesn't possess adequate tone colour for the pieces and the sound he produces can even sound constricted at times. As a result, not only is he unable to express fully the meanings and emotions behind the pieces with his bland singing, on a purely vocal level, his performances can't even be termed beautiful, let alone inspirational, even when one is prepared to disregard all those electronic enhancement involved to beef up his voice artificially. Such performances just can't do the music any justice and, in some instances, are a downright misrepresentation of the works featured. Thoroughly disappointing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"As seen on TV?","review":"The sticker on the celophane wrapper notes this was \\"seen on TV.\\" It sounds as though it were recorded from TV, with a single microphone in the middle of the room.

This CD is a beautiful, soulful rendition of the beautiful, sacred songs that I remember while in Church as a child. There is a pleading in Andreas voice almost in an attempt to reach to the very heavens to compel God to reach down and touch his child with the love of a Father. I love this CD and all of my CD's by Andrea. I also have CD's from Mr. Pavorotti as well but the two voices are very different and rightly so. Every artist has his own signature and Andrea's voice is indeed his own -- gifted by the heavens. If you love Andrea's voice, then you will love this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful music","review":"This is my second copy of this CD, I burned the first one out!!Andrea Bocelli has a very gorgeous voice that is a gift from above. His voice is not affected or braggadoccio but naturally magnificent. I could and do start my day listening to this spiritually uplifting CD almost everyday. It is a wonderful way to get off to a pleasant peaceful start, but also a nice way to come home in the evening if you have a CD player in your car. I highly recommend it to all."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent addition to my collection","review":"Andrea Bocelli is a great new talent when it comes to tenor voices, and this is another excellent album. He does more than justice to the three versions of 'Ave Maria' here (including one which wasn't familiar to me), and altogether this is a very appealing choice of arias to listen to during a quiet evening by the fire or - my choice - at full volume in the car! The inclusion of a couple of Christmas carols is no doubt because of its original release just before Christmas, but that still doesn't stop me enjoying it in June."},{"rating":"2","title":"Andrea Bocelli,Has the voice of an Angle.","review":"Andrea sang these Sacred Arias from His heart to our hearts.

He wouldn't know a phrase if it hit him in the mouth. His voice is weak, as his his line. He needs about 2 years at least to get his voice good enough to actually start to learn classical voice. On the other hand, if you like Sarah Brightman, and want to waste entirely the 15 or so dollars on this go ahead be my guest. The fact remains that he is a terrible singer. He may be a nice pop soloist, but he is not a singer. That title is reserved for people who actually know how to use their voice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good.......","review":"This guy doesn't have that great a voice and says the same things over and over again. Not inspirational or emotional, just plain. Two stars because Celine Dion (one of my idols) loved him enough to sing \\"The Prayer\\" with him and they did it at the Oscars. So, unless you like emotionless opra, don't waste your time and money. Spend it on the BACKSTREET BOYS! They RULE FOREVER!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pleasant \\"Arias,\\" but why settle?","review":"Andrea Bocelli has a beautiful voice that sounds wonderful in pop songs but comes off as pleasant, but light-weight, in classical songs and arias. Thomas May's article mentions that Andrea Bocelli found inspiration from listening to Franco Corelli's recordings of sacred arias. If you really want to hear how thrilling these sacred arias can sound, listen to Franco Corelli's \\"Songs & Arias\\" and don't settle for \\"Sacred Arias.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Good purchase","review":"Andrea Bocelli is one of a kind genius. Watch him perform and see the effortless magic that comes from his voice. No work just born to do what he does so well. This cd is not my favorite but he is very very high on my list of magical singers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Once more, here's the greatest voice in the world.","review":"So what else is new? Obviously, Andrea Bocelli gives his fans a collection of Christmas music, namely, \\"Sacred Arias.\\" Andrea as always gives an excellent vocal performance, for the most part. The minus one star is because sometimes the album gets too powerful. On the whole, however, Andrea Bocelli fans won't care. Until his next album, baby!"},{"rating":"1","title":"a little disappointed","review":"I am a Bocelli fan. I looooove his Sogno CD. I think his voice is extraordinary.

It was terrible as classical music and even poor as popular music. It was \\"plastic\\" AS IF on sale for $2.99 at Wal-Mart! This one was much better with an excellent selection of pieces and more color and variation in his voice. The Mozart \\"Ave Verum Corpus\\" and the three \\"Ave Maria\\" selections were all performed magnificently. I could have done without the two Christmas carols on the last two tracks, but otherwise it was very enjoyable. Just maybe I'll buy a Bocelli CD with my own money next time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seattle Slew","review":"This model is great for anyone especially if you love history horses. The Seattle Slew model is great not only because of his neck thing of roses and his tall dark and handsome shape but because he was a TRIPLE CROWN WINNER! He's just an awsome model and would be a great addition to your collection. The only complaints I can think of are that you have to be very delicate with the flower thing or the flowers start falling off and Seattle Slew's back left leg bends in a little bit which prevents him from standing on carpet evan though he can stand on a hard evan surface.

Please don't listen to others who gave this a good review. This book has no concrete organization. The exercises are horrible. And they assume so much. Instead of convincing us that a mathematical step is valid, they ask us to trust them, because the proof is too advanced. The problem with this teaching style is that there is nothing, no logical understanding, to grasp onto, which is what students need to retain something in their brain! Please if you are a professor using this book, just take a little time during class to ask your students what they think. I guarantee you wont be using this book again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible book. Does not properly explain even the most basic topics","review":"Unless you happen to already be a math PhD or child prodigy, do not listen to the 4 and 5 star reviews. For us mere mortals, this is a terrible textbook. Instead of laying out proofs as formulas, almost everything is in paragraph form. In addition, the author has a terrible habit of saying \\"Given premise A, one can easily come to conclusion Z\\" with no mention of steps B through Y. This is not for the problems marked difficult at the end of the chapter. This is the first thing that he will say at the introduction of a topic. Do yourself a favor and look at Springer's undergraduate math series books in partial differential equations. Also, you can google \\"Paul's Math Notes\\". This will at least give you the basic introduction you need to understand the heat, lagrange, and wave equations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Astonishing error","review":"The book tries to \\"prove\\" the maximum principle resorting to an argument based on steady-state solutions to the Laplace equation. This makes no sense whatsoever because time does not enter the Laplace equation. I found this error so astonishing that I gave up on the text.

Maybe it is the only such error in the book..... but it is hard to believe it has survived to a 4th edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Applied Partial Differential Equations - Review","review":"The book was in very good condition when it arrived.

Coming from a student who's done very well so far in all his other engineering courses, nothing in this book makes any sense at all. They jump into topics you've never even heard of, and expect you to know everything right off the bat.

If it were up to you, we'd all still be listening to Fats Domino and Chuck Berry. AC/DC didn't just jump out of the ground, you know. You're against progress, man. Don't get me wrong.

Then there's the \\"music,\\" if you could even call it that! This is the worst screamo band ever, and I know screamo bands.

The story is enchanting and you are swept up into the pages about the ecstacy and agony of drug usage. The realism presented here no doubt stemmed from Crowley's own dabbling with the various powders. This book won't appeal to everybody, but it is a good novel with an important message about what drugs can do by an eccentric, unusual character."},{"rating":"2","title":"Detailed ride of addiction","review":"This story is a detailed account on addiction, which just goes to show that addiction today is the same as it was 100 years ago. It gets into the nitty gritty of addiction: the beginning, peak, end, the highs, the lows, and the recovery. I was really skeptical about this book; it being written by Crowley (a well known occultist), but this story doesn't really touch upon the occult, it sticks to the subject matter and the nature of human will. A good book overall, I Highly recommend to anymore dealing with substance abuse or knows someone dealing with substance abuse"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hope for Today In This Novel of Yesteryear","review":"Drug use and abuse is a common enough theme in today's society. Yet Crowley's novel is still compelling for its detailed description of the effects of various drugs on the body and mind over time.The storyline is interesting, and anyone knowing anything of Crowley's life will have fun trying to put real names to the characters (I think Crowley wrote himself into the novel in at least two of the main characters). The cure of addiction is of great importance to many, and Crowley's ideas on the subject are worth considering. The novel also serves as a good introduction to some of the main ideas of Thelema.I think the novel is a brilliant case study of both the psychology leading to addiction, and the recovery process required to achieve a cure."},{"rating":"1","title":"kindle version is incomplete","review":"I bought this for my kindle.

It is King Lamus' considered opinion that drugs are tools, to be used wisely and with a specific purpose in mind, going on to make the analogy that the best way to avoid drowning is to learn to swim-- not to avoid bodies of water. An intriguing-- though possibly specious-- theory. Fun and entertaining read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good book.

I bought it anyway- i honestly hate this product and its not worth the price. ive tried cheap drugstore eyeliners that have worked way better than this 20 pencil! It WILL run...smears terribly. Once applied do not touch ur eye. Within an hour it will smear so if u purchase carry around tissues to keep your eyes clean so you wont look like a racoon. Sharpness doesnt last long.

It is loaded with typos and editing and formatting errors. The straw that broke the camel's back came when I encountered-- without explanation-- a several-page section of the book printed twice in a row. This leads me to fear that some parts may have actually been left out! Not sure what the deal is, or why this is so carelessly printed. I imagine that the copyright expired and the publishers payed some undergraduate to transcribe an older version into a Microsoft Word document which they printed in cheap paperback without going over it beforehand. If you're considering buying it, don't. The inconvenience and unreliability is not worth saving several dollars.

The edition from this publisher was a disgrace to the world of publishing. All diacritics (accent grave, tildas, etc.) were replaced with random ASCII characters.

I read this for my book club and based on the conversations in that group, and comparisons with other editions, I'm not even sure that all of the original text was present.

The publisher seems to have written the text in about three minutes flat: \\"your\\" becomes \\"you\\", \\"my\\" becomes \\"me\\" (except during Henry's dialogue - then it's supposed to happen). There are also a large amount of accented letters ( like \\"é\\") that ended up being something like \\"\\" which makes reading words as simple as \\"Opéra\\" very difficult as it now reads \\"Opra\\". The publisher didn't even bother to put in the standard chapters that other editions have, which leaves you reading approximately 89 pages without any place to rest the eyes.

It is also very stain resistant, as on a couple of occasions I got it dirty with a few scratches and I thought the shoe is now looking worn, but after cleaning and polish, they turn beautiful again and the scratches disappeared.

With the four eyelets, this shoe rides too high for a truly comfortable fit, plus it looks goofy. The leather, if it really is leather, looks fake. I would never wear these shoes to work or to a function where style mattered. I also would never wear these shoes with jeans (if you do, wear white socks so everyone will know you really are a geek).

After purchasing the CD, I found that most of the songs weren't the best by the selected artists. The best song on the CD by far is Brooks & Dunn's How Long Gone. I was somewhat disapointed to find that Tim McGraw was left off this CD as well. As for country music, the CD is very mixed, between modern pop-country, and other forms of the genre. It's the kind of CD that you can listen to over and over again, but it has to be on in the background. I would say that it was worth the price, but just wished that the producers found the artist's more comerical friendly songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent summary of late-90s country","review":"The 18 tracks on this CD are a perfect summary of country music as it sounded in the mid-to-late 90s.

Both are geared more towards the advanced screenwriter and those who've had essays of structure and characterization up to the gills and are now ready to write something good.One caution here: If you are looking to teach you zen, forget about it. Go buy a book on zen. If you are looking for more advanced thoughts and exploration on screenwriting, this book is it. William Froug is a wonderful teacher with much wisdom and experience to share.Similar to another book of his, \\"Screenwriters on Screenwriting\\", you see writing through the eyes of the accomplished screenwriter, which can be very helpful for the aspiring writer to pace their careers, goals, dreams and life accordingly. Maybe that's where the zen comes in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really about Zen at all.","review":"I thought that this book was going to be about getting in touch with your own creativity.

I had enjoyed the first season on blu-ray, and bought the second (on dvd, because blu-ray was not available). Unfortunately, instead of actual police drama and case-solving, each episode has now become a vehicle for building up to the main characters gunning down large numbers of people, instead of orderly crime solving and appropriate action as a result. The contrast between the nicey-nice depictions of the attractive-by-design characters and their death-squad behavior is something I find jarring and inappropriate. I'm gone from being a fan of this show, or ever watching or buying it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Turned up fun and action..","review":"As always I love Chris O'Donnell and LL Cool J. The really revealing character here is Mr. Deeks Eric Olsen and Daniela Ruah. They are such a funny combination and they look very good as a couple. Hats off to Ms. Hunt as well.

I was skeptical at first, but Julianne Margolies (spelling?) is fabulous. This show does a great job exploring some of the motivational factors that influence a decision to stay or terminate a marriage in the face of infidelity. It explores the family stress and impacts, especially since that \\"cheater\\" is a public figure. The martial and family story aside, it also offers a pretty compelling legal drama. I am a fan of Law and Order, and though this show lives more on the legal side than in the law enforcement the cases are compelling, draw from current events, and leave you sometimes questioning our legal system."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful video duplication quality kills a great season.","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed the first season on DVD and was looking forward to seeing how things developed in year 2. Unfortunately, CBS DVD allowed Good Wife Season 2 go to the disk duplication plant with a set of video masters that look like someone had boot-legged them off a low-bandwidth channel of YouTube. And the problem isn't just in one or two episodes. The abysmal video quality ruins your viewing pleasure for all six (count em, six!) disks. Season Two brings great new story lines for Alicia, Kalinda, Will and company yet I find myself constantly distracted by the fuzziness and pixelated image quality.

Just pop it into your computer and you can see that they've compressed 4 Eps down to 4.35 GB!! That's less than a DVD-5 can hold. This is DVD production malpractice.

I had no trouble mounting it to the PDA. I have a soft leather case, so the extra bump in the back was no problem. For the same chemistry (Li-poly), a higher capacity pack is just going to be larger; you have to be able to accept that. Also, charge time is proportionately longer; no gettng around that either. The battery seems to work well and give much longer life. After 2.5 - 3 hrs of continuous use running a baseball scoring program, it only used 1/3 of the capacity. The stock cell would barely make it through 7 innings. I do not have wireless networking on this PDA, so I can't speak to battery life with Wi-Fi running.

A sports cars should fly down the road, but in this game a sports car never went that fast.The handling is horrible!! It is an effort to turn a corner without hitting something.The on foot missions are weak.In all fairness, I only played the game for one hour, so I may grow to like it more, but so far it is not worth buying. Rent it first, if you like it then buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS GAME SUCKS ASS","review":"WHEN I FIRST BOUGHT THE GAME THOUGHT IT WOULD BE FUN.BUT THE GAME PLAY IS SO STUPID.

Ive been a long time fan of the driver series and the gta series & love both, but all of these reviews comparing it to gta are misleading. I went against the reviews & bought it & was glad i did ! If you like the previous driver games, you will not be dissapointed with the 3rd ! The missions arent as simple as some may say, & theyre interesting as well as the story line. The handling of the cars is just like the previous driver games, great weapons, so Ive been very happy with this one. I was almost instantly addicted. My one & only very very minor complaint is that your character could run a little faster than he does, but it doesnt cause any game play issues, id just like to run faster. So yes, Driver fans buy this game & overlook any review that complains that its not grand theft auto!.....because it is not grand theft auto, its DRIV3R & its well worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"driver 3","review":"Have you ever thought of street racing?

I have tested many different games and that proves it.Free will is a option in driver 3.You can get out of your car or truck and go stealing stuff and many more.(...)Out of all the game I have ever had this on a challenged me the most.

Well first of all thats not true because driver has been out sence 1998 so it came out before Grand Theft auto. This game is going to almost be the same exept you will be able to have guns when you get out of the car and you will be able to get out of the car when you are getting away from the police. You have new cars such as muscle cars,4 by4's,motercycles, sports cars, police cars, police patrol boats and many more. There are three new levels. Pitsquare, Miami Florda, and Istanbul. This driver will still be a third person shooter game. Also when you're in the car you are alawed to do a drive by. This game will be in stores Late March.

I don't like repeating myself over and over again through the course of several days. It is definately not for the novice of for people with little patience. The only reason I got the game because, according to the advertisement, this is the series that inspired Grand Theft Auto. Please, I beg of you, do not get it because of that.

Game play is awful and clunky. Nothing smooth about this at all. The driving is horrible. Car's don't react that way and it feels as if the car nevers gets out of first gear. Shooting and aiming is dumb as hell. You get shot a few times before you can even aim at the guy you need to. Moving around is even worse. You have to use a combo of both analogs or 1 analog and the thumbpad in order to really see where you're going.Atari: Don't even go back to the drawing board. Burn the drawing board. Don't try to take an awful game and throw money at voice overs for characters on actors that people perceive to be cool. If you spent half of your talent (whatever there is of it) on the game rather then the animated sequences, you might have something worth 2 stars here.

It is repetitive, limited, glitchy and buggy. The chase missions merely serve to prolong the frustration, offering no opportunity for creativity in the way you tackle the game, and overall the whole limited universe of the Undercover mode is akin to Dragon's Lair or Space Ace. They had the excuse of being linked to a Laserdisc for gameplay; this title has no such excuses.Reflections may indulge in their little jokes about GTA, but really - Driv3r is the biggest joke of all.

This game is too expensive for what it is so rent it or wait until GTA San andreas comes out and buy that one.And the person who said he had a very rare movie is an idiot cause its not rare at all. and its ryan not Ron.

Yet most good things can be dragged down kicking and screaming by one flaw. Driver 3 is a brilliant game, ruined to the point of frustration by it's difficulty. Many missions require days of wall punching, radiator kicking repetitive memory tests to complete. There is one mission: Tanners Escape where there is nothing but luck to aid you. It is this flaw that ruins Driver 3. If it were not for this Driver 3 would be a game of higher standard than that of Vice City, Metal Gear Solid 2.

And I also liked how they mixed them up from all different years. They should of put another episode in Creepiest Capers and saved that's Snow Ghost in this winter one. That way Scooby-Fans could have more stories on DVD. I also didn't like the fact that it just ran into a cartoon with out the opening.

Although the attraction was written on the pages between Schyler and Veronica I just couldn't feel the chemistry when reading it. I also think the characters were written way beyond their years. Veronica was only 32, and Schyler 36 and he said things like:\\"I'm a man who believes in making people live up to their notices, and I've got a fistful of yours. You with me?\\"and\\"I go for a woman who has a hearty appetite and doesn't pick over the food. It doubles my pleasure in her company\\"I know this book was originally published in 2000, but I don't think women would go for these lines then or now. Veronica had some awful punchlines as well.

The picture of the band standing under a chimney with only the logo LOVE on the cover enthralled me and I had to have it. I have been a Love fan ever since. Michael Stuart-Ware does a very good job at exposing why Love never became a super group like the Rolling Stones or the Doors even though Love could have easily been more popular than both those groups if Arthur Lee hadn't shot the band in the foot. My only criticism of the book is the slight undercurrent of bitterness (maybe my imagination) about what could have been. Mr. Stuart-Ware could have made a career in music in spite of Love, but he chose not to. It was probably a good move for him to leave the music business and I'm glad he has given the world of an insider's look at an truly extraordinary band."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOODBYE STEVE AND HELLO JOE!","review":"Well it had to happen eventually but after many years as Blue's partner Steve is now off to college and coming into the house is his kid brother Joe.

Instead, I found the book was 90% geared towards 'high-rollers' who would be able to play blackjack for hours at $100 per hand.In my casino experiences, if you have the bankroll to play at that level, a) you have enough money that comps don't matter and/or b) the casino will make certain that you get the 'attention' you deserve.There was nothing that I found useful for the smaller player.

It was not even worth the gas to get to the store. All the \\"online compatable\\" feature is is just sharing replays of levels. The levels are hard and frustrating. I enjoy a hard game, but this was just stupid. Every try is \\"he got away\\" or \\"you Lost him\\" If you want a good game, get the GTA double pack for the same price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying","review":"This game would have been ok if it didn't FREEZE EVERY 10 SECONDS! The graphics were good but that's about it. I rented this game from Blockbuster and I looked at the disc.. seemed fine. But sometimes it wouldn't even start up on the Xbox, and when it finally did, it would freeze about every 10 seconds. If you like being annoyed, buy this game!"},{"rating":"1","title":"beautiful game with extremely difficult gameplay","review":"this game has excellent graphics and physics, but that doesn't make it any more fun to play the first 30 seconds of a level 30 times because if you miss one turn or clip a tree and have to start over. Even missions that should be easy like following a police car to a crime scene are easily blown by one mistake. I've only played this game to level three and I'm already setting it aside."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks great but Falls short","review":"First off I have to say this game looks great, driver 3 set's the bar for how GTA 4 should look. The detail of the cars is top notch as well as the city's , but it all ends there. I enjoy playing a game that will allow me to actually play and interact in the experience of the game , Driver 3 does not do that by far. I don't want to say its a HARD game , its just poorly designed. When you play missions over and over and over constantly failing to even get close to the car your trying desperately to chase because your burn out or hit a pole that completely stops you and with in seconds the title says \\" You lost him\\" or \\" He got away\\" , the frustration is unbearably constant , I just want to play to get close not to get shut down within seconds. I can't believe the game testers allowed this flaw to get pass . Within and hour of me playing the game for the first time I shut it off and installed GTA vice city , thank you ol RockStar Thank You...."},{"rating":"2","title":"For fans of racing games","review":"First off, I'm not a hard-core gamer I just play when theres nothing else to do. I normally play racing games and occassionaly halo. So far, from what I've played I really enjoy this game. I like being able to just walk around and then the ease of getting a vehicle :D Overall....good game"},{"rating":"2","title":"Driver 3 is fun","review":"I must be one of the only people that finds GTA not that fun. When I played 3 and Vice City, I got bored of the game in like 5 minutes. My main complaint is the driving physics. I thought Driver 3 is a better game because the driving physics are great. People may get frustrated becuase they have to master how to do power slides and and use the ebrake but I believe it makes the game more fun. If you don't then you will never catch people. The driving A.I. is great I think. When someone is fleeing from you they are not just going to drive straight and slowly make right and left turns. They make sharp turns and weave in and out of trafic. It's just like controling the case car in a movie. I do however agree with the others that trying to shoot people was hard, but I got used to it pretty fast. Overall I would recogmend this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Driving is cool","review":"The Driving in this game is cool and semi-realistic. The damage to the cars looks amazing. But other than that it all blows. The missions are so unbelievably hard it's not even fun. If you don't have auto-aim on then you aren't going to get anywhere because the shooting is extremely unrealistic and also hard. The cop cars are ten times as fast as yours so have fun running from them. There is no good rocket launcher except some dinky thing that shoots out little grenades and they only go like 30 feet. Overall I and it looks like many other people say save your money or get GTA."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost Perfect Driving Game","review":"Driver 3 is a driving adventure game that plays like an interactive movie. It is a worthy sequel to the earlier Driver games. It has cinematic gameplay and great graphics on three open city environments. There are issues with video glitches, control issues, locked-up consoles, etc. but most of the time it is a lot of fun. You also have the \\"Take a Ride\\" mode for easy driving practice. The mini-games allow for replay value even after you beat the game. If the game had less glitches, we would be talking an easy 5 star rating. The PC version should be even better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Drive to live","review":"The game is very good. The game is not as bad as other people say.

The car handleing sucks, the take a ride sucks which is just you driving a round doing nothing fun, and I can't even get past the 2 level because you have to chase some guy down and you cant even do that. Don't even rent this or buy it for 1 dollar its not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even worth the price of a rental!","review":"I was a fan of the Driver series, I even put up with some glitches and AI issues in prior issues. This is not fun, my girlfriend is threatening to return it to the video store because I can't stop cursing at the TV! It's not fun, it's painful. A cop just fell on my hood...right out of the sky.I love driving games, that's pretty much all I play. I can't even like this. Cars, people, objects randomly appear about a block ahead of you. Handling is unrealistic. You can't ride the motorcycles and shoot. The sound for the motorcycle sounds like a blender stuck on high speed, the cars sound like an out of tune lawn mower. Actually, now that I think about it, the bike sounds like the cars in Pole Position. I'd rather be playing that right now.If I did my work half as bad as the guys at Reflections and Atari, I'd be out of work!

I say this because it's barely any fun. You can't go into a single building, too many invisible walls, non- realistic, bad gameplay graphics, horrible shooting controls, things appear out of nowhere too quickly. For instance, I was being chased by cops, I took a shortcut, and a cop fell right on my car. Also, unlike Grand Theft Auto, only cops come after you, no S.W.A.T, CIA, the army, only cops. I only give this game a 2 because kids who aren't allowed GTA Vice City, this is mildly fun for about five minutes."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Complete Disastor","review":"Well first off, the car graphics are very relistic, when you crash stuff flies off your car and other stuff like that. But other than that the game was aful. In Undercover mode (also known as basic mission mode) It is really hard to do car chases, and you retry missions over and over untill you can not even tolerate it, and you just stop playing it. The character movements are completly unrelistic. You float in mid air sometimes if you try to jump on something. Your Character can only jump like 1/2 of a foot high, which makes it hard to do anything other than walk. You can not move while crouching, if you try you roll foward. I was really dissapointed when i figured out that there is no hand-to-hand fighting like in GTA (grand theft auto). This game is like A GTA Poser."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hunk of crap","review":"This the worst game I have played in a long time. Do not be fooled by commercals, it is not that fast paced and the controls are garbage. So in conclusion- PURE GARBAGE! The people who made this should be forced to play it forever."},{"rating":"1","title":"A broken game","review":"Just bad, plain bad the only thing saving this game is its theater or replay mode. And using cheats in this game is fun too. But the single player is the worst I've seen in a video game. Its like the developers spent more money on the cutscenes then the actual game. Because the controls handle poorly the missions are structured poorly everything in this game feels shallow and has that \\"been there done that feel\\". Just avoid this game and please save your money don't support badly designed games like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seller was rude, book was awful","review":"I was referred by a friend to buy this book. When I got it, it wasn't what I expected. It's high level religious studies type of literature which is fine if that's what you expected. I asked for a refund or exchange, but the seller wanted me to refuse the shipment or send it back in the original packaging. Since it was a couple of days later that was impossible. She inferred I was lying to her, and said that if I returned it and it wasn't in perfect condition as it was sent to me in, that she wouldn't give me full credit. I could see where that was going, so I didn't return it. I wouldn't buy from this seller again. Very rude!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A excellent popular treatement of the subject","review":"Patai's The Hebrew Goddess is an excellent popular treatement of a subject he takes up in more technical depth in other writings (like in his Jewish Folklore, a collection of his essays). This book is enlightening; it takes an area of study that is easily overlooked or distorted in the popular imagination and the religious mind-frame, and exposes it to light. The role of the divine female and divine figures in the Abrahamic religions was a frequent stumbling block for those faiths, but more often than not, an area of expansive cross-fertilization with other religious traditions and source of profound (and at times humorous) creativity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outdated book","review":"This is outdated scholarship that continues to be reprinted because it is trendy and publishers can make money. Raphael Patai is not a \\"noted scholar\\", but a learned rabbi whose understanding of the topic is based on comparative religion models from the turn of the last century. He is an amateur who has done some research and woven a popular account on a trendy topic. For a noted scholar's popular account, people should read Dever's Did God Have a Wife? A much better book by a much more qualified author. Or, get Carol Meyers book, Households and Holiness: Religious Culture of Israelite Women."},{"rating":"2","title":"now that is talent","review":"This CD is definetly worth buying.

John Mills is an accomplished composer and performer with a particularly solid technique when it comes to subtle shadings and nuance. The album opens with the sound of wind in the trees, and the cover art is actually indicative of the overall tone of the CD, i.e. late autumn nights, bare trees, and a time for reflection.I can't say the album is filled with \\"sad\\" music, but it does have a melancholic feel to it at times. Of course, I enjoy that in music, so I have no problem recommending this album to people who like low key guitar music that isn't just someone noodling around. Mills is a talented artist and Hallowed Moon is a superb album for listening to during the late evening hours or on a rainy afternoon. It also makes great background music for dinner or conversing with friends in front of the fire."},{"rating":"2","title":"excelente","review":"definitivamnete funciona, no es hermoso ni es una obra de arte, pero hace muy bien el trabajo,de hecho ahora si esta el equipo completo de espatulas y cucharas oxo en mi cocina son robustos,de gran tamaño y muy buen grip.lo recomiendo, sumelo a su set y tendra un gran performance en su cocina,eso si solo para aluminio (teflon )nunca,pero nunca con ollas de hierro (logde) ya que se derriten en una fraccione de segundo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not care for it.","review":"I ended up sending this item back.

Can you tell I'm not a fan?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mad about the Madman","review":"Two words should do it: Classic Elton. But I'm a man of many words, so... The first album I ever bought - back when there was ONLY vinyl - was Elton's Honky Chateau. That started a love affair that I thought would never end. Unfortunately, it ended 15 or more years ago when Elton seemed to stop trying, but everything up to and including \\"Reg Strikes Back\\" has amazed me. As for this disc, there's a reason that \\"Tiny Dancer\\" and \\"Levon\\" still get constant radio play - they are totally awesome. But my favorite track is the title cut, a haunting song that Elton delivers with a passion I miss, but fortunately preserved for all time. Now remastered, it stands the test of time. \\"Goodbye Yellow Brick\\" may be Elton's career-defining disc, but this disc, although more raw, is a worthy addition to anyone who has even the slightest interest in the Great Sir Elton."},{"rating":"2","title":"Madman Genius","review":"Madman Across The Water completed a trilogy of albums (including Elton John & Tumbleweed Connection) that rank right up there in rock history.

One of Elton John's classics for sure and is heartily recommended to all."},{"rating":"2","title":"As good as it gets","review":"This, along with yellow brick road, is certainly the best ej album. Every single song on it is a masterpiece, superb musicianship, arrangements, and singing. Admittedly, it's not extremely varied in terms of production and style, most of the songs are ballads and otherwise slow-tempo songs, quivering with strings sounding like one of Mozart's Requiems, in other words a very dark feel (like the moody blues' To Our Children's Children's Children). Along with tunes that have become standards, like \\"Tiny Dancer\\" and \\"Levon\\", there is beautiful acoustic picking (Holiday Inn), melodrama (Indian Sunset), beatlesque brilliance (Razorface, All the Nasties). If you like albums that must be enjoyed in their entirity (like dark side of the moon, wind and wuthering, crime of the century) you'll like it. If you like albums where every song is different (sheer heart attack, peter gabriel #1) you'll probably find it a bit relentlessly dreary and spooky.

I can only add on songs when John uses an orchestra, the sound level of his vocals seem more realistic in relation to the size of orchestra.John has set the blueprint for what a 5.1 SACD should be. It is simply amazing. Perfect separation and clarity without being gimmicky. While other 5.1 mixes may simply use the rear channels for echo or effect, John perfectly places instruments in each giving a true surround sound effect. John truly shows the potential for SACD 5.1 when in the right hands. Like Peteyspamucket, I too wonder what it would sound like if Greg Penny who did the 5.1 mix on this and Tumbleweed Connection would get his hands on the master tapes for other artists. Imagine a Hendrix, or period Beatles or Stones, it boggles the mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"His best album","review":"Forget what you hear on the radio today from Elton John.

Ellen Burstyn's looney curator may be her worst performance ever and name stars like James Wood, Richard Dreyfuss and Geena Davis collect paychecks.

Her grandfather was the legendary Dr. Wheeler who is remembered by the older staff. She quickly discovers something wrong is going on the hospital, the only question that remains is who can she trust. This should have been a a movie that examines the moral and ethical questions of \\"death panels\\", the common good, and embryonic stem cell research. Instead it only glosses over the topic and then inanely makes a mockery of the whole thing.It is really ashamed because they had good actors to support this script and failed to deliver the goods. They managed to turn scenes which should have been shocking into the mundane.Made for TV, TV-14"},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute, total waste of time and talent. Sad.","review":"To call this movie bad would be the understatement of the century. The lead actress is very good, but the big name supporting cast is wasted. The original wasn't great, but it's far more watchable than this. I can't imagine ever wanting to watch this again, let alone paying for it in the first place."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ibetter than book","review":"I saw this movie on TV and trhis DVD is the samething plus I love watching this kind of movie"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick with the original...","review":"What a waste of time watching this four hour A&E; production; and now they actually will try to get someone to buy a copy of this?Though I haven't seen the original in a long, long time, I do remember some actual drama in that movie; while this series had none and constantly asked the viewer to suspend disbelief. What's with the nutcase guy? The whole thing was just a mess, mostly incoherent. And People magazine gave this like 3 1/2 stars? And the Washington Post even rated it favorably. Is it me, or has our threshold for entertainment gotten really low? Do yourself a favor and watch the original."},{"rating":"1","title":"just plain bad","review":"just finished watching this 4 hour assault on an otherwise good book. everyone is entitled to a bad day at the office and this should rank for the scott brothers as their worst ever. if you like the book and like movies made from books then watch the original. this is 4 hours that you will never get back. did i mention i didn't like this effort. bad, just plain bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting, suspenseful mini series","review":"Loved this mini series. Not many good miniseries produced lately but glad they did this one. It keeps you on the edge of your seat and makes you think what could be in our futures if some have their ways for us baby boomers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"I am very happy with my purchase. I owned this item on VHS a few years ago and lost it during a move. I find his instructions clear and I was able to follow them soon after without having to verify I was doing them correctly. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to give it a try. Once you do, you will understand why it is so popular."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dear David Dorian Ross,","review":"Dear David,I have never had the urge to write a review before, but after viewing and trying to follow your Tai Chi Beginning Practice....I decided to take the time. I have taken dance classes for many years and I have never had to learn a routine from 3 different camera angles and face to face with my instructor. Your video could have been very enjoyable if you had turned around so I could follow. That means turning your back to the camera which I realize is not in your best interest, but it would make learning your routines a snap....which in the long run WOULD BE in your best interest. I am very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to follow","review":"I enjoy tai chi but when working with an instructor on video/DVD, it is so much easier for me if they let me \\"mirror\\" them. Meaning we move opposite sides of the body, they move left, I move right, so we face each other. I have the DVD and after trying to use it twice (and I am not new to Tai-Chi) I couldn't be bothered any more."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT A GOOD INTRO INTO TAI CHI","review":"I feel a bit releived after reading some of the reviews on here. I thought I was too uncoordinated to get this down, but the left to right on this DVD is REALLY confusing. Once I get messed up, there's no getting it back. I DO NOT recommend this for anyone who is just starting out. It's not easy to pick up the flow. He goes from showing you the name of the movement and how to it, to telling you to mix them all together by name. I'm sorry, but when I am learning a movement, I can't remember what to do after only being told once. I am paying more attention to the movements and doing them correctly than I am to the names of them! I'm just left frustrated and wondering which DVD I should start with instead!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a well thought out DVD","review":"My wife got me this DVD to help me get back into a routine. I did T'ai Chi some 10 years ago and was looking to get back into it. I don't like the way this DVD is set up. The instruction moves too fast and (though it's a minor complaint) the moves are not mirrored to your position in front of the TV, like the better Yoga DVDs are. The way the video is shot doesn't really show the proper positioning of the forms, I didn't like the fact that the moves are bunched together in groups of 5 and there is no warm up to speak of.I would not recommend this to a friend."},{"rating":"1","title":"So I DO know my Left from my Right","review":"Thank you other reviewers. I thought I was going crazy there. I know there is a mirror image when watching yoga and other work out DVDS...but this really bothered me. Perhaps it is because it is a BEGINNERS DVD! I don't want to hear left and then see you go right on the screen...especially not when I'm trying to coordinate feet, legs, arms, and hands all at once! And, then I come to read that he actually does make mistakes...very, very, very confusing. I got frustrated and gave up on the beginners section.I do like the scenery better on the a.m. workout--Maui beach...but I think I might just watch it once, and then turn the sound off, maybe even put on my own music, and do it. After all, I don't need to be frustrated while doing my relaxing Tai Chi!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing","review":"I bought this DVD a number of years ago. In reading some of the other reviews, I agree that the instructor using *his* right and left is very confusing. I did the workout one time, and may have not even completed it because of this. Several reviewers stated that with practice the right/left confusion can be overcome. If someone is marketing a DVD for their profit, the consumer should not have to \\"overcome\\" deficiencies in the presentation on the DVD. I expect to be able to concentrate on the movements and not have to overcome an inefficient instructor's inability to communicate effectively to his audience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horribly Shot","review":"Besides what other reviewers mention about the confusion of \\"left\\" and \\"right\\", the camera work is also terrible. It is often shot from a mixed angle that makes it almost impossible to grok what is going on without watching the video many times. Instead of mirroring what is going on (whether you are confused about the left or the right), you have to try and study what is happening. You don't get a mirror image of what you are doing because of the peculiar angle much of this was shot in. It's quite frustrating. This isn't the first poorly put together Gaiam video I've seen. Those guys really can't get it done right.I gave it two stars, because the instructor seems quite good. Unfortunately the technical aspects of the video forfeit his effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"confused 2","review":"I totally agree with red hatter ..The intructor says one thing while he's doing another its confusingadn im not even sure which way is the right way now..."},{"rating":"1","title":"PAID FOR - NEVER RECEIVED","review":"Notified them that they used the wrong address for the type of shipping they used. But never received it. Paid for but Not received. Will Not shop here again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mistakes in saying 'left' and 'right' make this confusing","review":"Several times on my initial run through I had to rewind, rewatch, rewind, rewatch, rewind, rewatch certain parts because I thought I was just not getting it right. Then I realized that sometimes the instructor was saying left, but moving right. He was not mirroring the entire time, however, he was just making mistakes. It was terribly confusing.This gets 2 stars (instead of one) because I like everything else about this video - the way he speaks is soothing, the music is soft, the background is pleasing. It's just a shame the instructor is not clearer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tai Chi","review":"This is an OK beginning practice of Tai Chi. There are two sequences you can watch. The first if a complete beginning sequence/routine. The second is more of a follow-along.One thing that decreases the quality of this beginning practice is that in the first sequence he does not use mirrored left and right direction. So if he says do something to the left, he does it too the left and you need to do it to the left as well. However, this becomes a little difficult when focusing on learning new movements.Furthermore, in the second sequence he does use mirrored direction. This makes the second sequence quite a bit easier to follow along."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good for beginners","review":"There are way too many cuts and edits in this video to see the whole routine through. Even playing it at half speed I'm having trouble seeing the full body positions.There needs to be static shots of the person teaching you. This one constantly cross fades and only has half body shots. Can't see his feet, can't see his other hand. Not helpful at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Need a mirror image to follow instructor.","review":"I really like David Dorian-Ross but when you are teaching beginners they need to be able to follow the movements. That is why aerobics instructors lead the class behind them.If you are a beginner it is too hard to follow the movements facing the instructor. I have to follow the DVD in a mirror or I get lost."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to follow","review":"I tried this DVD for the first time this week. I must echo the sentiment of other reviewers in regards to the \\"mirror\\" issue. I find it very hard to follow his movements when they are the opposite of what he is describing. Had I read reviews, I would have purchased a different beginning Tai Chi DVD and wish I had. It is high quality video production."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Frills, No Filler","review":"It's a shame bands like the Brandos fall into obsurity when sh*tlike 98 degrees get's all the hype and popularity; these guys were ahead of their time (any band that can cover a CCR tune and make it their own deserves airplay and critical accolades!);at 14.98 this cd is a bargain, you won't be disappointed..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Driving guitars, every song on \\"Thieves\\" is good","review":"I too saw the Brando's open for the INXS \\"Kick\\" tour in 1986.

I like the cd \\"Hangups\\" better but it's still a great cd. I just can't wait for there new stuff to come out."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Night Stand","review":"This album is incredible. It really shows how tight a band Goldfinger really is. This was for the most part recorded in one night on a whim after a three hour show. It was the first time most of the band members had seen the charts. Any band that can pump out excellent covers like these on a whim is worth listening to. Nite Klub and Downpressor Man are extremely catchy and Feel Like Making Love is just awsome."},{"rating":"2","title":"SO GOOD!","review":"This EP is GREAT and the sound quality is PERFECT since it was recorded onto DAT. They do amazing versions of all the songs- this is a must for any Goldfinger fan.Buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quite right","review":"Other than 3 things this would be a great watch. First the second hand on the stop watch does not index on the second marks. Second there is a pin on the clasp that has come out 3 times in 4 months. And last this is not the band it came with. For some reason it came with a plain stainless band instead of the black PVD inserts. It does keep good time and the illumination can't be beat so, I guess you pays your money and takes your chances."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the two books I have read over, and over.....","review":"The Golden Road and its prequel, The Story Girl, are two of the best books I have ever read. I never seem to get tired of them, either...I have read them countless times! If you enjoy L. M. Montgomery's novels, such as the Anne of Green Gables series, these books are a must. The Golden Road tells the story of cousins, Beverley (who narrates the story), Felix, Cecily, Felicity, Dan, and Sara Stanley, also known as the Story Girl, plus their friends Peter, the hired boy, and Sara Ray. The adventures these eight have are sometimes exiting, sometimes sad...but mostly really funny! For instance, one time, they have the governors wife to tea...but they think she's their deaf Aunt Eliza and comment on the governors big nose and such things! And Felicity accidentally bakes tooth-powder rusks...oh, I can't tell you the whole book! Read it for yourself!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My absolute favorite of all Montgomery's books","review":"The Golden Road, which is a sequel to The Story Girl, is beautifully written. It will make you laugh, and even shed a tear or too. It will bring back memories of childhood, or of the childhood we wished we'd had. Of all of Montgomery's novels, this is the one I return to most often. A true little gem, for all ages. The sotry of great aunt Eliza's visit is one of the funniest chapters I have ever read. Delightful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Read immediately after finishing The Story Girl!","review":"I enjoyed The Golden Road, but not as much as I enjoyed The Story Girl. I recommend you read the two novels together, one right after the other. If you enjoy reading books set in a long-ago era, the books have a charm to them. If you like action, these books will not appeal to you as much.In my opinion, it is not possible to enjoy The Golden Road unless you have just recently read The Story Girl. Not all of the characters and actions in TGR will be understoon unless you have read TSG. The characters are a lot of fun and are well-written. The adventures this group of friends have together will stay in your memory forever."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice, quite, delicate book","review":"nice, quite, delicate book; its good break after criminals, thrillers or historical novels.

Definitely much better than Discharge. I've listened to GBH songs for 15 years now and I never get tired of it. This is a good sized collection of songs although it did leave a lot of the other good stuff out like \\"Bellend Bop\\", \\"Boston Babies\\", \\"Do What You Do\\",\\"Alcohol\\" and \\"Prayer of a Realist\\". On the other hand, it has quite a lot of the other tunes here that are good like \\"Generals\\" and \\"I'm the Hunted\\". To all the kids out there who want to learn and experience hardcore music from my generation of the 80s, stick to the old GBH which is this one. Get this CD and if you can find a CD of City Baby Attacked By Rats, by all means pick that one up too."},{"rating":"2","title":"TIGHT, DEFINITIVE UK PUNK","review":"THIS COLLECTION EASILY DEFINES WHAT EARLY UK HARDCORE WAS ABOUT.

It is about 50 minutes of documentary on the interaction between the Concertgebouw Orchestra and Conductor Riccardo Chailly. It has some very good moments, but appears desultory, never settling down to state clearly its point.The second half, Luciano Berio's Voyage to Cythera, is like an old-fashioned analog radio, not tuned to the proper station. You hear snatches of Mahler's music, simultaneously accompanied by static, talking, and various loud noises that distract you from the Mahler.It really sounds to me like a pseudointellectual attempt to \\"cop a free ride\\" on Mahler's music, when one has no significant music to write on his own.If the title leads you (as it did me) to believe this dvd will expand your Mahler collection, then please borrow it from the library to try it before you buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"not so good","review":"The new vampire and werewolf do nothing for the show... did not enjoy it at all.

Not only bizarre \\"Hocus Pocus\\" with amazing vocals and great guitar play, but especially \\"Eruption\\" - an eclectic 24 minute suite with some classical influences, smooth melodies and a drum solo incorporated place this album high below average.

Simply one of the most inventive and exciting albums in the history of Rock. Firstly there is the wonderfully tongue in cheek Hocus Pocus. I have a video of the band falling about laughing as Van Leer yodelled to the wider British TV audience for the first time on the Old Grey Whistle Test. Then there is the haunting Focus II and the amazing Eruption, which is noteable for the searing guitar of Akkerman especially in \\"Tommy\\" and \\"The Bridge\\". The rest is pretty good too. Look out for excellent versions of Eruption and Focus II on the Jan Akkerman solo album \\"10,000 Clowns on a Rainy Day\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Masterpiece!!","review":"This is a hidden gem among prog-rock albums of the 70s. It features some of the BEST musicianship ever heard. This is why such great bands of the 70s STILL resonate today. Bands like Yes, ELP, Genesis, Pink Floyd, Jethro Tull, Deep Purple AND Focus are still being explored and played today. These guys knew how to play their instruments and relied on their skills instead of programming a computer. Course, they didn't have those toys back then. But, even the analog synths sounded more organic than the digital ones of today.But, I digress. This album sounds GREAT on headphones or played at low volume at work. The arrangements are incredible and the talent doesn't lack. Sure, we've heard Gary Hoey play \\"Hocus Pocus\\". But, there is something about the original that makes the hair on your neck stand up.

I regret I never discovered them before now; I only remember hearing \\"Hocus Pocus\\" on late-night radio.I'm hooked; although I hear they've re-formed and are recording again, I'll be playing catch-up for a while, and I'll try not to have expectations of their new work.

Beast:Anyone that can take footage from their ski vacation and turn it into a movie deserves an Oscar. Just goes to show how corrupt Hollywood is, I guess.There is a certain charm in watching these people try to act as if they are in a ski resort by bumbling about in front of projected footage. But the kicker is watching them depict warm breath by, get this, stealing drags off of cigarettes and blowing the smoke out while they talk! Yep, a classic.Brain:Wow, stunning. The world has never seen special effects like this before, and probably never will again. If silly tubes and vials filled with percolating fluid and dry ice are your idea of a mad-scientists lab, you're in for a real treat. There are a \\"few\\" plot holes that you could probably drive a Mack truck through, but why would you watch this for deep meaning? Kick back, grab some popcorn, and prepare to laugh yourself silly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Other reviews said it right - inconsistent quality, wrong length","review":"I should definitely have heeded the warnings of others. I ordered a pair of the 517s and upon receiving them, was rather dismayed that indeed the length was way off. Upon measurement, the inseam is 31.5\\" instead of the 30\\" that I ordered, and what the jean claims to be. Back to Amazon it goes. Such is the QA of a global brand. People have been fired for way less.The search for the perfect fit continues."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"Very pleased with the product that I received and would definitely buy it again and would recommend it to others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pros and Cons","review":"Pros:- Reduces flare and ghosting when shooting in bright light.- Helps protect your lens from dirt and scratches.- Somewhat protects the lens in case of a fall. Better to break the hood than the front element.- Makes you look more like you know what you are doing and helps to keep others from carelessly walking in front of you.Cons:- Will increase lens movement in windy situations, kind of like a sail on a boat.- Takes up more room in your bag, even when reversed they still add to the diameter of the lens.- People take more notice of you, will help to blow your cover if you are trying to keep a low profile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Should've been included with lens","review":"It does what it is supposed to do; greatly reduces chance of flare and also serves as some protection to the lens. Fits well and easy to put on and take off. As usual, Canon did not include it with the lens. I imagine there are suitable knock-offs but I didn't research it as I bought the lens and hood at the same time."},{"rating":"1","title":"This lens hood is NOT for 16-35mm f/2.8L II","review":"Under Product Description:This lens hood is designed for use with EF 16-35mm f/2.8L III got this for my Canon 16-35mm f/2.8L II USM lens but it is NOT made for it. I should have done my homework instead of trusting the false product description here. What I really need is the Canon EW-88 lens hood."},{"rating":"2","title":"Robust lens hood","review":"It is a good lens hood and has a great quality. However, it is a bit pricy. If you compare it to competition, quality is better, but there the hoods are usually included and you do not have to buy it separately. Nevertheless, quality is better and it fits perfectly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not sure I needed this","review":"I have read (after purchasing this) that is it not needed with the 10-22mm lens for which it was purchased. I have also read that you should use a lens hood with every lens. In any case, it is as stated, a lens hood for the 10-22 and the 16-35 lenses. It will reverse on the lens for storage but you will need lots of room as it is quite large. The interior is coated with felt-like material. I can not recommend for or against this product. After a little more use I will update this review."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for the Canon 10-22mm","review":"This hood is a perfect match for the Canon 10-22 lens. I know - it should come with the lens, but get over it and just buy it. You need the hood to prevent flare, and more importantly, for constant protection for the front element of your new lens."},{"rating":"1","title":"Small - an ingorant author","review":"Small makes a few valid points, but he seems too closed-minded.

Suspected, but never charged, in the drowning death of another victim during 1972 (Not many people are aware of this fact!!!). Sentenced to life imprisonment despite a bizarre insanity defense. The DeFeo home has subsequently become the central object of novels and films in the \\"Amityville Horror\\" series, alleging that Ronald 'Butch' DeFeo was possessed by demons.This book presents the DeFeo case from the prosecutor's point of view. Especially revealing in regard to the suspect's lame insanity defense.I found the book to be of great interest to the student of criminology. If you are obsessed with the so called 'Amityville Horror' gibberish or are looking for ghosts, then look elsewhere, this book is definetely ***NOT*** for you. This is a 'serious readers' crime case study in line with Bugliosi's 'Helter Skelter'"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn Fest","review":"The first part of this book kept me reading, when it got to the trial it turned into a big brag fest about the author, who was also the prosecutor.

The acting abilities of these two women sure impressed me though... especially Megan's performance in several scenes. I gave this 4 stars only because the sound of the movie...it wasn't very good and sometimes I had to turn up the volume to catch what they were saying. I loved the music playing at the beginning! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"worth it","review":"Pros:Battery charger and 4 batteries worth the 10 bucks I paid at once. The rest is just bonus I think. Tripod doesn't work exactly as the famous gorilla tripod but it was able to hold on to a baby stroller handle nicely when we took a picture at OC fair, costa mesa--the point is, the stroller was left near a walk way and people didn't pump the tripod off.

You really do get what you pay for. I have been very pleased with it. The cheaper one I got locally would melt along the edge when I used it to stir fry or flip things in a hot skillet. This one has no such problem. It is a good weight, is comfortable in your hand, and is firm enough to turn things easily. And no melting!

She successfully presents both sides of the arguments by summarizing the work of other scholars.But: That's basically all the book does. Chancer doesn't offer much of her own opinion, and where she does, she merely offers a rehashing of another scholar's work. This book fails to dive into the true tensions behind sadomasochism or pornography, and I found myself skimming sections in search of new, exciting ideas.This is perhaps a decent resource for someone studying the birth of third-wave feminism, but otherwise, the book is simply dated and fails to illuminate new ideas."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING","review":"This is an amazing book, especially if you are involved in Sociology, sexuality, gender and sexual deviance.

His descriptions of the action and the battle's aftermath are balanced and interesting.

I kept thinking it would pick up its pace. The pace picked up after half way through then settled back to a numbing pace. I loved the ideas of the two unrelated stories which combined lafer on. I liked the character depth. The handling of some sensitive topics were done well. Lets just say this story put in the hands of a different writer who could grab you off the pages and keep you compelled would be great.

I bought this item with the intention of giving to Toys 4 Tots, so I can't give you any feedback of its actual play value in the hands of a child, but I feel this item will give hours of quality play time in the hands of an imaginative child.

I disassembled the compressor the first time only to find that you can't removed the reel to clear the jam. By firmly pulling on the cord, I got it to unwind both times, but the insulation was damaged the first time and I had to patch it. You need to pull the cord out completely and to smoothly rewind it in the right direction to prevent the cord from winding over it self. The compressor has not been idiot tested. Don't buy it!!!!!!!

It feels really sturdy, and is the perfect size for my Canon A540. I can even fit four extra batteries in the little pouch, although it would be nice if the pouch had it's own closure so that the batteries would be secure while taking the camera out or putting it back in.

It covers why parrots talk, which parrots talk and lots of stories about talking parrots, but no real information on teaching my bird to talk. The only chapter I liked was the one about the Model/Rival-method, which is a detailed chapter on teaching a parrot to talk with cognition, understanding the words it uses. However, the bird must alredy be talking for this method to work.What I wanted was an answer to these questions: Do constant, out of context, repetitions work? Does plaing a casette work?

The best part is that the padded camera section is actually an insert that can be removed allowing it to be used as a non camera pack or the insert to be used in a different carrier.There are two issues I have with it:1. It is just barely too small to hold my Dell D830 in the laptop sleeve.2. The rubber on the shoulder straps is very similar to the stuff you can buy to line your kitchen cabinets and is very \\"grippy\\".

Especially when they're BAD special effects.This movie was predictable, flaky and pathetic. Jet Li's martial art skills were diminished by this film's cheap special effects. I didn't care for Mr. Li's bland acting performance either. He is NO Jackie Chan and I mean that in every way. At least Jackie's movies and stunts move the story along. The stunts in the this film were to cover up for bad dialogue, a TERRIBLE script and even laughable characters. I got this movie pre-viewed and I'd give it away for free. I'd caterogize that part where he smashed the motorcyles together the WORST SPECIAL EFFECTS JOB I'VE SEEN.

Where is Wong Fei Hung when we need him?..."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK stunts can't save a stupid script.","review":"The One was Jet Li's attempt to break into the Hollywood mainstream, at least as much as Jacki Chan has managed to break into it. Unfortunately, it's a dismal failure. The script is completely banal, a rehash of movies I'm sure I've seen before. Jet Li's talents are wasted, as instead of doing actual fight sequences, he has to fight against himself (meaning lots of fights with computer inserted images, or other stunt men who get their face replaced), and it robs from the intensity of the fights. For great Jet Li, go back to the \\"Once Upon a Time in China\\" series. Skip this one, as fast as you can."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sci-fi-martial arts","review":"To be honest I much prefer seeing Jet Li kicking ... in a more ancient China setting (ie. \\"Twin Warriors\\"). I must also add that I'm not a Sci-fi fan however Jet Li being the martial artist that he is won me over. He plays a double role of good guy vs. bad guy. Although he was a bad guy in Lethal Weapon 4 the brand he portrayed in \\"The One\\" is much different and shows another side of Jet Li's talents.

However if you'd like some story with your movie then you're going to be a bit dissapointed. The One was beautifully done and the idea is great. It's just that the story is just a front for the action, not the action being a part of the story. I love Kung Fu movies and I love Sci Fi.

I mean, did keanu reeves ever fight himself in the matrix, (and who would have won). I think if you are an action die hard, this is the movie you must see.

Carla Gugino, Jason Statham, Steve Rankin and Delroy Lindo also star, in which they cant save this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Action, and more action!","review":"This video is every bit of The Terminator, Timecop, and the Matrix, all wrapped up into one.

For the moment you'll be seeing doubles. A good Jet Li, and a bad; battles one another. The bad battles the good Jet Li to become ruler of the universe.

The fight scenes were overall boring and had that \\"seen this before\\" feel, the acting was bad (Jet Li needs to shut up and just fight, not act :) and the story was rushed and overly simplistic. You might enjoy this if you are in the right mood, don't expect much if anything, and/or aren't very critical of action flicks. Otherwise, don't waste 2 hours.

Now if you live in the same universe as the one I live, this movie is cheesy. I think some of this movie's praisers are actually from another universe. This movie is the worst thing ever, in this particular universe.Jet Li is a good fighter. He could fight. All the movie magics used in this movie, only weakened his supposed-to-be-solid performance.

The story involves alternate universes in that one particular individual has found a way to travel to alternate time lines, kill himself in these alternate time lines, and increase his own power by doing so. He is being persued by agents from an agency that regulates this type of travel and such. The action is great, and the special effects look amazing, but the story seemed to be lacking.

I'm sure jocks all over eat it up, though.So basically:-stale to forced acting-ok story line-mediocre fight scenes-corny music-cheesy special effects...beyond a doubtYeah, this was a real cheese-fest.

I noticed that the disc \\"The One\\" was loose inside it's case, but because it was a gift I didn't open to check it out. I realize now that I should have and I will be doing that with future orders. Once my brother reciceved it,opened it, he was unable to watch it because it was so scratched up it wouldn't play.When I tried to see about returning it, I found that I only had a few days left to return it. There was no way I could get it back from Hawaii in time to send it back to you in order to get my refund.

So the reviews are NOT specific to this product.I purchased the mp3 thinking it was the movie sound track as it is also linked to from the zorba the greek movie sound track page, and some of the reviews state it is. But the mp3's are NOT the movie sound track and do not include the movie dialog, to my great disappointment.If you are looking for just the music in mp3 perhaps the digitally remastered would be a better purchase.Zorba The Greek: Digitally Remastered, Bonus Booklet EditionAmazon is clearly using deceptive practices in their advertising and reviews submitted by users to make you think you are getting something your are not.

Wonderful film, great music. The soundtrack on this CD, however, is terrible.

I love the soundtrack, I love Zorba the Greek and Theodorakis music, but this CD is completely mono. I have a couple of copies of the original vinyl recording. On the original the dialogue is mono and the music is stereo. Despite the cracks and pops on the original vinyl, the overall sound quality is better on my old records and the stereo imaging is wonderful vs. the mono one dimensional quality of this sad excuse for a CD. Amazon should check with the copyright holders, I strongly suspect this is a pirated copy and a poor quality one at that! I would love to buy a true stereo recording. Meanwhile please make the mono recording nature of the CD obvious to buyers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the soundtrack but just as good as the original","review":"I am reviewing the music from the film Zorba the Greek, on FM records. As far as I can see all the reviews here so far pertain to the original soundtrack recording, which I have as well. This is a modern, digital stereo recording conducted by the composer Mikis Theodorakis. I am glad Amazon is finally carrying it, as I couldn't find it anywhere and I had to order it from FM Records directly from Greece. If you like this music, the sound and the playing couldn't be better and it's recorded under the aegis of the composer himself. It matches the original soundtrack issue track-for-track. I found the performances a shade less 'dramatic' perhaps than the original film soundtrack, but no less enjoyable, and the sound is MUCH better. As the other reviews note the sound on the reissued soundtrack CD is not the best.. but then neither was the sound on the original UA LP US issue. If you want better sound, this is the one to get."},{"rating":"1","title":"yuck, Yuck, YUCK -- save your money","review":"Mono, thin, narrow band, with poor s/n level.

I guess the best part is that I can leave it on the counter and it doesn't look dirty. You know how coffee grinders look after a few days. This one stays nice all the time. This grinder comes apart for easy cleaning. The grinders I have used in the past didn't come apart and had to be wiped out by hand. In the morning I make my coffee and rinse out the cap and the blade. No trouble at all. In the past I have had trouble with residue from old beans getting mixed with the new beans. Since most coffee grinders do not come apart for easy washing, they start looking grungy. I agree with one of the reviews that said she had trouble with ground beans getting on her counter when grinding. I've only had that problem if I fill the grinder too full and try to grind too much at once. Otherwise, I haven't had any problems at all. Matter of fact, I plan to buy two more as Christmas gifts. I would definitely buy this coffee grinder again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Just For Coffee","review":"I actually bought the appliance for grinding whole spices and flax seeds. The removable stainless steel bowl cleans easily and doesn't retain odor (great for strong spices like corriander and cumin). It also looks nice and doesn't take up too much space. The only catch I've found is the mess this thing makes. Grinds come out over the top of the bowl and fall down under and all over the lid. But all you have to do is put a small piece of plastic wrap or foil right over the top of the bowl before tuning on and everything stays in. While this is a pain to do every time it works better than my old one-piece grinder that I never could get completly clean."},{"rating":"1","title":"uneven grind & messy","review":"I bought this machine a couple of years ago due to the great reputation of KitchenAid products, (I own 3 others) however, this grinder is mediocre when it comes to performance. First of all, every batch I put in, large or small load, is very unevenly ground. Powder at the bottom and large mostly whole pieces at the top. It doesn't seem to matter how long or short a time I pulse it. Also, the fine powdery grains fly up and under the the edge of the lid making a mess all over the base and the countertop while the machine is running. Either the lid is poorly designed or just a bad fit. And, I don't reccommend it for use on spices, what a mess. I have since purchased a different brand of grinder put out by the Food Network. It works great! Very evenly grinds everything you put into it. And the lid covering the grinding chamber is screwed on so no more leaky mess. I love all of my other KitchenAid appliances but this one is a big disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't grind evenly--leaves whole coffee beans behind","review":"This product is not up to snuff by Kitchen Aid standards. The coffee grinder does not adequately grind coffee. It grinds some beans to a fine powder, while leaving other beans untouched. You can't get the grind inbetween, for a French press. In fact, you can't get any size you want uniformly. I usually put in about one inch of beans to grind enough for myself and my husband in the morning. It's disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid grinder, sticky grinds","review":"Nice solid construction. Grinds coffee well though my previous Braun ground the beans more consistently. Only issue I have is that the finer grounds tend to stick to the bottom of the grinder. I generally have to dislodge them with my finger."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story about an interesting team","review":"I just finished reading this and really enjoyed it. It provided great insight to the background and chemistry of the 1965 Twins team. I was about 8 years old then and I remember rooting for them to beat the Dodgers and collected many of their baseball cards.This book fills in all of the gaps in my memory and gives a nice summary of the team and how they fit into the world of baseball and the world as a whole. I hadn't realized there was such a strong Cuban connection on this team put together on the heels of Castro's takeover. Also interesting to learn about how the owners of those days (The Griffiths) often struggled financially to make ends meet. If you are a fan of 1960's baseball, you'll enjoy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"FIVE STARS","review":"THIS BOOK IS ABOUT THE 1965 MINNESOTA TWINS WHO WON THE AMERICAN LEAGUE PENNANT. THE BOOK CONTAINS INTERVIEWS WITH THE REMAINING PLAYERS AND COACHES WHO WERE ON THAT GREAT TEAM. I FOUND THIS BOOK TO BE A GREAT READ FOR IT BROUGHT BACK MANY MEMORIES FOR ME. I AM A CLEVELAND INDIANS FAN AND THEY WERE ACTUALLY IN THE RACE THAT YEAR UNTIL JULY, WHEN THE TWINS PULLED AWAY. I THINK THE AUTHOR JIM THIELMAN, DOES A GREAT JOB DESCRIBING THE EVENTS AND MIXES THEM WITH THE INTERVIEWS TO MAKE A GREAT BOOK. IF YOU LIKED HARMON, MUDCAT, KITTY KAAT AND ALL THE REST, THEN YOU WILL LOVE THIS BOOK. FOR ALL TWINS AND BASEBALL FANS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Twins Win First Pennant","review":"This is a great book about the American League Pennant Winners in 1965--The Minnesota Twins. I remember lots of players on that team, and how as a little boy this team broke my heart by beating out the New York Yankees, my beloved Yankees, signaling the end of the Mantle era. It could have been better though. At times the book seems a bit sketchy. The author should have interviewed opposition players and coaches about key series with the Twins that season. I especially enjoyed some of the stories about future Twin heroes like pitcher Jim Perry--trying to find himself and save his pro career (he later wins a CY Young in 1970) but nobody in majors wanted him at start of 1965--and Coach Billy Martin teaching players how to slide into second base using opposite hip. I wish there was more stuff like that in the book. Instead the book is filled with lots of fluff like what a great guy Harmon Killebrew was etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"kind of bland writing","review":"I do love baseball books that look at a season especially one of a team with such interesting players as Cesar Tovar, Tony Oliva and Harmon Killebrew. Plus I thought I could finally find out just who this Zoilo Versalles guy is who won the AL MVP in 1965.Sadly, this book is beyond flat. I didn't find the writing at all engaging. Maybe it's the team itself. I mean, there really weren't a lot of characters despite many of the players who had character.I've also got to say I'm not having much luck with books on Minnesota's pro sports teams as the Klobuchar book (Knights and Knaves of Autumn) on the Vikings also did zip for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gifting","review":"This was bought as a gift and I think my Aunt will love it as a Christmas present.

I always think that the next season cannot be as good as the last, but somehow the story, the characters and the plot continue to grow and evolve. Season eight was my favourite season so far. I think the running plot of the port to port killer really added an extra element to the series, especially when he seems to have focused his attention upon Gibbs. Some of my favourite episodes happen in this series and I think one of the most shocking episodes that rivals, Kate's Death, happens in this series.

Pleasanlty, I was surprised! The plot is realistic centering around a richly developed Catholic boy.

Ostensibly a quest to find the man who knows where there are valuable Thorite deposits in Norway, the Hammond Innes reader knows they are in for some very rich scene setting. This book covers in depth sailing including in bad and icy conditions, a whaling station (ie slaughterhouse), and an icy trail on foot and skis across Norwegian mountains. Each is described with the eye of one who has lived it, and that is the primary treat in every Hammond Innes book. He went there, he lived it, he flensed, he gybed, he trekked. The story is a standard one with bad guys and good guys and a pretty girl, but the characters are deeply enough drawn to make the experience vivid and alive. If you see it, buy it. If you're new to Hammond Innes, then dive in and enjoy..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superior espionage mayhem -- one of the best","review":"Innes's thriller is one of the finest espionage novels I have read.

I was looking at the 5 function remote online first and my Vizio TV was listed. I decided to go with the 7. I went to program it and Vizio was not listed. The learning function did work after a few time. I would suggest putting in new batteries in the old remote first and do it in a area with no direct light. I was able to put volume and PIP commands for my TV on the cable box setting. I'm also able to put stereo functions with my DVD and media player. Why do you need to spend over $100 and remote when you able to do it with this one. If your not able to program something it's because that device uses different type of frequency."},{"rating":"2","title":"good for the price","review":"Got mine through Gold Box deal, so it was a great price. It worked like a charm once I figured out one small detail that they left out - once you find the programming code you don't check to see if it's correct by hitting the number keys, you check by using the up and down channel keys. Once you \\"set\\" the remote, the number keys work fine. It took me a while to figure this out.My only other complaint is that I cannot seem to figure out how to change the size of my PIP, which my old (dead) remote could do. Otherwise, it works perfectly on my getting very old Panasonic TV and VCR/DVD player."},{"rating":"1","title":"not universal enough","review":"Pros: sturdy, illuminated buttonsCons: those nice, sturdy, illuminated buttons don't do what I want. the pre-programmed codes were sufficient to get basic functions working on several devices (TV, VCR, receiver, DVD player), but when I tried to get this remote control to learn some other functions on my Denon AVR-3000 receiver and Sony XDR-F1HD tuner, it refused. I followed all of the tips in the owner's manual: I put new batteries in both remotes, I turned off the fluorescent lights, I moved the remotes closer and farther, I tapped the button instead of holding it, I stood on my head (just kidding). I tried dozens of times with no success. So I went to Radio Shack and bought the cheapest learning remote in the store (Radio Shack 7-in-1 Universal HD Remote Control); it learned those functions on the first try.

I get the thing out of the box and it feels a little bit light, as if made entirely of cheap plastic, I install the batteries and I sit down to program some functions and NOTHING. I changed the batteries and tried again and still no luck. It's too bad that the first review of this product has to be a negative one but I am sorry to say I will be returning this plastic piece of junk in favor of the less expensive Sony competitor.

The problem is that code 122 doesn't work and there is no working code for dish in the remote. You will have to make it 'learn' every key on your old remote. Not all that hard, but it took over 20 try's for it to learn the info button. Quite a pain, but what really made me give this product only 2 stars is their technical support (or lack there of). After having the same problem with 2 different R7 remotes and being told several times by their technical support that it was a problem with my sat box, I borrowed an R6 (also made by Universal) and programed it with the 122 code. It worked perfectly. After confronting their technical support with this proof that their is something technically wrong with their programming their response was that I should buy an R6 instead.

Originally it lasted less than two months, then the amp stopped working. Two and a half weeks later I recieved another amp from KLH for free. After installing the amp the sub only worked for less than two weeks. I have in no way abused this sub by playing it too loud, it simply lacks quality. Unfortunatly I have nothing to show for the $ I spent since amazon's return policy is 30 days. Whatever happend to the amp I also like to add that it is possibly a fire hazard as for my room smells like something has caught on fire."},{"rating":"1","title":"POOR QUALITY","review":"When the unit worked, it worked well.

I played with all the dials and made sure the wires were plugged in correctly, but it didn't help. After the warranty expired, so did the subwoofer. I have to give the subwoofer a rating of 2 stars because it did perform well during action scenes, but that is the most I can give it. I will never buy KLH speakers again. It wasn't worth the aggravation and added expense in the long run."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Horrific, Disgusting Movie","review":"I could only bring myself to watch the first hour of this horrific, disgusting movie. This movie is done in very poor taste and graphically depicts unspeakable events (young children being shot point-blank in head and graphic rape). I highly recommend NOT watching this filth.

It pollutes your mind and the graphic scenes are scarring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not sweet at all","review":"This offering from the queen of lesbian romance is pretty disappointing.

Buyer beware!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy this if you enjoy tedious cleaning","review":"What were they thinking? Most kitchenaid products are attractive, well designed, and work in just the way you want. Although this one does a reasonable job of grinding (how hard can it be?), it creates such a mess that you will wish you hadn't because the cap doesn't fit tight. Even the most careful grinding spreads powder everywhere, especially in the hard-to-reach places of this device. The only reason for the second star is that you can remove the bowl (fortunate, given the mess it creates). Give this loser a pass."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly what I wanted","review":"What features are most important in a coffee grinder? I have no idea. For me, I wanted something a bit more. I want to be able to grind spices as well, without the extra expense of multiple grinders. I could care less about all the fancy buttons and settings that give you the \\"perfect\\" grind. I wanted something universally functional and classic,... simple. This is the grinder I ended up purchasing. It is simple to use and has a stainless steel grinding vessel that detaches from the base for easy as pie cleaning. That means I can grind whatever I want without picking up the oils and dust that remains in the grinder when I choose to use it for a different sort of coffee or spice. I am extremely please with my purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stylish, Easy to Clean","review":"Sleek and stylish looking on the counter next to stainless steel or black appliances. Extremely easy to clean. Just 2 large parts to rinse after use, they disassemble quickly. Contrary to some reveiws, it does NOT make a mess, so long as you do not fill it to the brim. Strong motor for its size and grinds the beans quickly and evenly. Nice size, 9\\"H x 4\\"W. Almost the size of a half gallon milk container."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top Quality but noisy","review":"This unit does a great job on coffee and appears to be rugged. I do agree with the other reveiws that it is noisy but I have no regrets about my purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"Pretty much what everyone else who gave it a 1 star review said: Overheats, smokes, smells horrible (burning synthetic oil smell) doesn't grind nearly as well as my Melita (which was 1/2 the price) motor is underpowered, no thermal override, impossible to get a fine grind, just a dreadful product. What ever happened to Kitchen Aid quality? Makes me very wary about their other appliances."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good grinder, looks pretty, unfortunately no fine/coarse setting","review":"Sturdy, looks nice, the lid is kind of a pain to clean since it fits over the grinder and is used to hold the ground coffee after it is ground. There is no setting to change how fine or coarse the grinds are so you have to \\"eye\\" it for espresso or french press."},{"rating":"2","title":"KitchenAid BCG100OB blade coffee grinder","review":"This coffee grinder is powerful and easy to use. It holds plenty of coffee beans (enough for at least 16 scoops of coffee). It can also be used to grind spices."},{"rating":"1","title":"MAJOR DESIGN FLAW","review":"The lid has been designed with a major flaw such that a small ground of coffee stuck in a lid crevice stops the grinder from operating. You must use a tooth pick or other tool to clean out the groove after every grinding. Also after 2 uses, the motor smoked and burnt out. It is a real \\"lemon.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Best coffee grinder we have ever had!","review":"We LOVE our KitchenAid coffee grinder. It is the first one we have ever had (and we have had several) that does not leave a mess all over the counter when we use it. The grinder part is deep. We grind the coffee and pour the grounds directly from the metal part of the grinder, not from the plastic lid, which I think makes this one so much nicer to use than most. We like ours so much that we are ordering a second one to keep in the RV so we don't have to transport the one from home back and forth when we travel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly designed","review":"I own a number of KitchenAid appliances, and have been happy with all except this one. The unit is noisy, to begin with. More importantly, it makes a mess because of the way the cover fits over the outside of the unit (rather than recessed as in some better designed models). Inevitably ground coffee ends up on the counter. Get the Krups grinder instead--it's smaller, quieter, and cleaner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great coffee grinder for the price.","review":"After reading the various reviews, I thought twice about buying this item, but I'm glad I did. The grinder does a great job, is much quieter than any I've had before, and does not create any mess or waste. The dishwasher safe feature is great. The complaints I read in other reviews appear to have been from people who did not read the instructions or used the grinder for a use other than grinding coffee."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reliablie and nice looking grinder... missing features?","review":"This is a grinder that looks great, it grinds beans evenly and it even can handle a larger amount of beans than other comparable grinders. Why 4 stars and not 5? It's pricier than the rest, it doesnt have an automatic setting (u have to count seconds to get the level of grinding you need), it also takes some trial and error to figure out the amount of beans you need to grind for the number of cups you're making. Once you figure that out, and its class."},{"rating":"2","title":"Efficient and easy to clean","review":"This coffee grinder is a replacement for a similar model that lasted for many years of daily use. It is easy to use and comes apart so that the grinder blades and the cover may be cleaned in the dishwasher. Grinding is done by pushing down on the lid; it couldn't be simpler."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top GRIND","review":"This little puppy works great. I would buy it again. Only two things bug me. One: Very noisy....have to lock myself in the bathroom and grind so I don't wake everybody up. Two: coffee \\"powder\\" sticks to the bottome around the blades. You can use your finger to loosen them, but there is always some residual left overs. I like it though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grinds go everywhere","review":"At first I thought, wow, this grinder looks so cool, how could I go wrong? Well, it turns out that coffee grinds accumulate at the top of the lid and spill out onto the counter when the top is lifted. I am sick of cleaning my countertops every time I want a cup of Joe. It also doesn't play region 2 DVDs. See kitchenaid red toaster."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed - all the stars in the review....","review":"I used this product one and only time within - four hours of its arrival - to grind cardamom seeds. The chamber was filled of half of its capacity.The grind was uneven (more than 60% not ground), coarse and the grinder started smelling and smoking. The stainless steel chamber was hot to touch and on the fifth hour I requested to return it. Definitely not worth the price and hype..I have had $10 worth grinder last for 10 years after each day of use for various spices.I am still looking for a good product"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Great.","review":"I bought these as gifts for my fiance and mom well over a year ago, and they are both still going strong. A bit noisy, but actually much quiter than some of the other brands we had owned previously. If it should ever break down, I would definately purchase another just like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment, lose whole beans","review":"This disappointing grinder leaves dozens of whole beans untouched. This morning, when I ground coffee for my 4-cup French press, I lost a tablespoon of whole beans--from PEET's Coffee. For people who treasure their coffee beans (not to mention the people who picked them) this is a waste. My brother tells me to shake the thing as it is grinding, but it still misses this much. Go with the Capresso instead. I expected more from Kitchen Aid. ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Messy and can't grind spices","review":"I bought this because KitchenAid ususally has wonderful applainces. I would not trade my food processor or stand mixer or dishwasher for that matter for anything. This grinder however is horrible. It is messy with inevitable cleanup of the counter necessary after every grind. i finally bought a new one of a different brand and made the kitchenaid my spice grinder but it could not grind smaller quantities of spices and still made a huge mess putting spice dust everywhere as the seal on the lid is not perfect and it has a wierd static effect where everything clings to the side. I would not reccommend this at all. It did however do a decent job of evenly grinding the coffee i put into it which is why i gave it two stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but...","review":"Like many of the other reviewers noted, this thing does make a mess. I bought this for grinding spices and when griding cinnamon, I ended up with cinnamon all over the place. That being said, it is a very good grinder. Very powerful and a nice big stainless basket. Also, unlike many grinders, you can remove and wash (in the dishwasher even) the basket/blade assembly. Just one more thing that I've noted is that this grinder is somewhat larger than my Krups grinder that I use for coffee, and consequently, the blade sits higher off the bottom of the basket. When trying to grind a small amount of spices (and I'd imagine coffee beans), it had some problem grinding everything, just because the blade didn't hit it. With larger amounts of materials, it works like a charm, however.Overall, great, but messy, and not so good for small quantities."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Mess Is Not Worth It","review":"Grinds coffee beans beautifully. But the mess it makes is not worth it ... especially given the price. When you take the cover off after grinding, chaff from the beans flies everywhere and sticks to the Bowl and Base due to static. I learned to remove the cover over the sink and had to wipe down all the parts each time I used it. Not worth the aggravation, I kissed good-bye my $29.99+ and tossed it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed","review":"I was truly dissappointed with this grinder. Grounds are ALWAYS getting packed down in teh area under the blade and have to be scraped out every day. The basin is hard to remove from the base. Easy to clean and looks nice on the counter, but a pain to use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poison??","review":"OUCH!! This stuff kills my skin! This is the second time I've used the Truefitt & Hill Ultimate Comfort Shaving Cream, and it is the second time I've walked away from my shave with a horrible rash on my damn face!! I don't know what I was thinking giving it a second try.Using this product achieves a result similar to rubbing poison ivy on my face.I do have slightly sensitive skin, so maybe this could work for you. But really: if there is something in there that causes the skin on my neck & face to respond like that....is it really something that you want to be using?On the plus side: it lathers very nicely and the lavender scent is enjoyable but not overpowering.Finally, for the skeptics out there that are thinking \\"hmm, maybe it is not the shaving cream but some other step in his routine that is causing the reaction\\"...not the case. Today the only change to my routine was substituting in the T&F; shaving cream, and the result was painfully different from the norm."},{"rating":"1","title":"It Burns!","review":"Rash,redness, stinging, irritation.

Plus the lather is 10x better with much less work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unsurpassed Quality & Value","review":"It is amazing how little of this product you need to get a rich, full lather to cover your face (multiple times). My tub has lasted five full months of once-daily use, and I still have slightly less than half of it left. As for quality, I have never experienced as close or comfortable a shave as I have with T&H Ultimate Comfort Shaving Cream. I use a Merkur Futura DE razor for days when I have time for a full shaving experience, and a disposable two-blade for the days when I am rushed, and the results are always top-notch when I use this cream on top of a Proraso Pre-Shave Cream. Do not be put off by the price tag on this product, as it is really an investment in nearly a year worth of close, comfortable shaves."},{"rating":"2","title":"believe the hype","review":"Recently got this and it is as good as most of the other reviews make it sound. It gives you a very thick and lubricated shave and you hardly have to use any of the cream to get it to lather up impressively. I used to shave with a lanolin based shaving soap and I would nick myself all the time. I just attributed this to me not being careful but since I've gotten this cream I haven't nicked myself once. Like everyone else mentioned as well, it does smell faintly of lavender so if you are expecting a completely unscented product this is not it.One thing to note is the packaging is slightly different than you see in the image here. Not that it matters to me but the packaging I got was actually just a plastic tub, not a metal top which is what the picture here looks like.I docked it a star since it's pretty expensive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't hesitate","review":"This is great stuff.

The second worked but they charged me $1000 because they thought I didn't return one of the receivers. It took an hour on the phone to clear that one up. DirecTV is putting up new HD satellites that are not compatible with this receiver making it possibly useless in the future. I canceled my service because I wasn't getting good satellite reception and when I tried to sell the HD recorder, I found out it wasn't worth half what I paid for it and the access card is not transferable. Any new owner must buy a new card for $89. For 9 months of DirecTV I am out $800. I am done with the dish!!I am only giving it 2 stars because the TiVo software is so good.

An inspiring and touching tale of the colorful life of an American girl who became a powerful woman. Along the way she conquers alcoholism, finds her soul mate, and lives out her life 'happily ever after.'"},{"rating":"2","title":"on the same level as Blink182's Enema of the State","review":"I got this CD because I'm a fan of Travis Barker's drumming. When Your Heart Stops Beating has the same vibe as Blink's Enema, but I think it's a little better. I like the +44 songs better than Blink's. This album is packed with powerful punk pop, and is an easy listen all the way through for me. I wish Carol Heller stayed on as their full time singer I'd like to hear that combination. Or at least if she was half-time singer that would be a cool mix. If you like Blink182, Green Day, or other \\"pop punk\\" this is a great CD to check out. Standout tracks include Lycanthrope, Baby Come On, When Your Heart Stops Beating, Make You Smile."},{"rating":"1","title":"I miss blink-182","review":"I liked only 6 songs from their album.

Though I miss Tom's voice on some tracks, I can easily have seen this album as a followup to the self titled last Blink 182 album. Though it has the fun punk-pop songs I love, it also has some maturity and experimentation. I like this much more than the Angels and Airwaves album which seemed so far removed from the Blink sound which I will always be a fan. Though I would have made Lycanthrope the first single, When Your Heart Stops Beating is a good up tempo song as well. If you purchase the album over at iTunes they include a bonus song which is just an acoustic very of \\"Baby, Come On\\". Pick this one up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Quite Blink","review":"+44's debut is worth your time and money. I was heartbroken when Tom left Blink 182, I always liked Blink a lot. +44 is definitely not Blink without Tom, Mark and Travis have gone in a different direction. However, it is a direction worth exploring. +44 is more lyrically driven with Mark's husky vocals highlighted. Travis is, as always, technically spectacular - the drumming is tight as ever. +44 isn't going to knock your socks off, you're not gonna rock out, the tunes are still pulsing punk, but they're softer. Stand out tracks are:When Your Heart Stops Beating155No It Isn'tMake You SmileAfter a few days of listening to the album I also really like:Baby Come OnLilianClifdivingChapter 13That's eight solid tracks. Check this album out, support Mark and Travis."},{"rating":"1","title":"WAT?????????","review":"I heard soooooo much hype about this so i bought it (stupidly without listening to any samples but the title song).

Im seeling mine on Ebay its a disgrace to my collection"},{"rating":"2","title":"a must buy","review":"If I had to say anything about this album it would be that I'm sure Tom Delonge knows how Mark Hoppus feels about him. While I did think that AVA was okay, I certainly didnt think it was a life changing experience like Tom said it would be. This album isn't either but it wasn't meant to be. This album is definatly a must buy for any blink fan and if your not a blink fan trust me you will like what you hear. My favorite tracks: Baby come on, lycanthrope, weatherman, 155, make you smile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Average...but still better than angels and airwaves","review":"Rather good....i believe it is overproduced a touch,just like some of the latter 'pop punk ' blink albums ...but otherwise a good album....a mix between last album blink 182 ,take off your pants and jacket both without tom and some strange electronic influences which are refreshing...but still ..lay off the pro tools a bit and it would be a brilliant albumBest Songs 'Make You Smile' 'Cliffdiving' and 'Lycanthrope'"},{"rating":"2","title":"very good","review":"this cd is really fun to listen to. it has a lot of great tracks like lycanthrope and make you smile. originally the band had a female guitar player/singer and i think it wouldve been cool to hear more of her. she was featured on the song \\"make you smile\\".while i dont love this cd like i love blink, its still a great cd and i always make sure to include it in my blink related playlists."},{"rating":"1","title":"Left us wanting more","review":"I bought +44's first album right away, and wasn't going to get Angels and Airwave's. When Blink-182 was together I wondered what would Mark do if he had the lead vocals all to himself. I thought he'd do a lot better than this first try. Don't get me wrong it's ok, but it's nothing special. I know they were selling this album as the \\"night sound\\" but there greatest fault is sounding bored and tired. Where's all the energy? Where are the solid, interesting lyrics? Know I realize Mark needed Tom to add some edginess and energy, and Tom needed Mark to break up his repetitiveness and bring a solid foundation in to balance off Tom's vocal limitations.

In truth, they are beautiful, and very vivid. Now if only they had spent more time on various fish instead of the primary focus being on scuttlefish, sea eels, and sea snakes....none of which do anything for me, or my husband. Or anybody else who has watched it with us. Most people ask us to turn it off eventually because the snakes/eel get to be too much. And there's at least 15+ minutes of scuttlefish. Interesting how they change colors, and all, but 15 out of 40 minutes?? And Jim Carrey, while I love him as an actor, sounds a little too gleeful as the narrator. All in all, a pretty odd show."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"First 3d blu ray I watched and my girlfriend and I were mesmerized. We were swatting at the different animals swimming towards our face and the clarity was just awesome. I may be addicted to 3d now. I've added a bunch more 3d movies to my wish list and will review them as I watch them. One dislike in the feature is that Jim Carrey is slightly depressing at times. You will see what I mean if you watch it but still 5 stars easily. One recommendation for the full 3d effect is to make the room as dark as possible. I watched some midday to get a sneak preview and I just wasn't the same as a pitch black background."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing work","review":"The vivid colors and spontaneous movements of life under the sea makes me want to praise God who never ceases to amaze me.

The only complaint I have is that I don't care for Jim Carey as the narrator. The movie is quite beautiful and you really do feel like you're swimming through a coral reef.

This was one of the first 3D movies I bought. I am a huge fan of snorkeling and diving, so take into account my love of the subject matter. This video makes me feel like I am right there under the water looking at all the sea life in person. I guess that is what I am really looking for out of 3D - does it make me feel like I am part of the scene. This video does that. I've watched it about 8 times and it continues to delight me every time I view it. It is the one video I use to show the potential of my TV to guests. They always seem impressed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great 3D Experience","review":"The family and I enjoyed watching this DVD in 3D and we had a great experience. The picture, sound quality, music, and narration are all 5-star. And the 3D effects are perfect.

I have snorkled alot off of Oahu, Maui, and Kaui and I can truthfully tell you that this video comes extremely close to being there in person. The underwater scenes are vivid and the fish seem to come right out of the television screen. It seemed as if one could touch them. It's really amazing. Jim Carey's narration was very good, my only criticism is that it could have been a bit longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor 3d, bad script","review":"Wow, I really wanted to like this movie, and bought it off of the reviews. But sadly this is just a bad movie in almost every aspect. There are moments when the 3d works and things look good, but 75% of the time you find yourself straining to focus and unable to see what is going on. It is one big eye strain. My wife had the same terrible experience with this movie. On top of that, the script and Jim Carry's voice over is horrible. I have a 2012 LG 55\\" passive tv, and other 3d looks fabulous on it (such as Prometheus).

Almost all scenes had convergence issues where you felt like you were squinting. To illustrate what I mean, focus on your forefinger and bring it close to you eye and you will fell onset of a headache...Not sure if this is the best they can do with under water cameras, but 3D was horrible for almost all underwater scenes.

Life and Planet Earth Blu-ray look much much better unconverted from 2D to 3D. Again, maybe it's better with active shutter TV, but with LG passive 3D, the images just do not pop and tend to Ghost."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding 3D Presentation on my Sony VPL-VW90ES","review":"I purchased this 3D Blu-ray disc shortly after having a Sony VPL-VW90ES front projector displaying on a 100 in. wide Stewart StudioTek 1.30 screen installed in my home theater. This was the first 3D Blu-ray disc watched using the new home theater set-up. It was a splendid 3D presentation, even better than my memory of seeing Avatar in 3D over a year ago at the local IMAX. The 3D image was sharp, highly detailed with no ghosting whatsoever. Colors were brilliant and fully saturated. I noticed no flicker or annoying artifacts at all. My wife and I both greatly enjoyed this 3D IMAX presentation in our home theater. If you enjoy outstanding underwater photography and want a demonstration 3D Blu-ray disc, then this is the disc for you. It is certainly hard to watch a 2D documentary after having seen this disc in 3D in our home theater. This shows how good 3D can be when care is taken to film properly for 3D presentation."},{"rating":"2","title":"great learning dvd","review":"My son loved this dvd.

Dreadful narration.","review":"IMAX Under The Sea 3D is the second movie I watched on my brand new 3DTV (the first was Ice Age 3). The three-dimensional, real-life imagery in this film is astonishing! As a scuba diver and a home theater freak, I was thrilled with the visuals.I'm also a Jim Carrey fan but WOW his narration was poor. He actually sounds disinterested in the script he's reading. Further, the narration built gradually to a disaster-forecasting crescendo, damning humans for destroying the planet. This was an unnecessary, biased distraction.In summary, I highly recommend this Blu-ray to anyone who wants to enjoy the vast capabilities of 3DTV... just turn the volume off first!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it!

Very well done but not to everyone's tastes as you do need an open mind.With a beautiful concept of Norse myths and beliefs etc they took their music to new levels along with varied instruments (harp, cello, flute....) to create some good substantial folk music, these and electric guitars, pounding (programmed) drums and bass (probably to portray the anger in those barbaric times), the vocals are also varied to suit.Deorth (vocals/bass) is now I believe part of The Meads of Asphodel. But if Ragnarok sound like they might be your thing don't hesitate to pick up the albums!!In 1999 they also released \`Domgeorn', along the same lines but with a more fuller, mature sound with some lyrics in Saxon (also with a bonus cover of Heart of Steel by ManOwaR).

The first tooth I molded stuck out too far. I noticed that I needed to put more of the molding goop at the back of the tooth than the front to get it to fit right. The second one I did worked great. If you're a little nervous about screwing up a tooth, order two packs and then you'll have a back up just in case. The one that molded well stayed on all night and was easy to pop on and off so I could eat and drink. The one that didn't mold well still stuck on, I just had to pay more attention to it to make sure it didn't fall off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice looking, easy to use.","review":"I bought these as a Halloween costume.

I mean, natural for vampire teeth. My kid is really bummed they don't come in her size."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the price","review":"So glad I ordered these instead of the usual sized fangs because they are the perfect size. Blend in perfectly with the rest of my teeth and look very real. The only issue is that my packaging didn't come with stir sticks so I had to improvise. Make sure you wait the full amounts of time listed on the instructions and DO NOT tamper with them until after sitting for 24 hours.

I am a radio engineer, since the last 20 years, but have spent almost half a decade, building line modems for a living.

However, I was not succesful. The text starts out well with a practical illuminating example of the use of multirate signal processing. However, I was not able to absorb much knowledge in the subsequent chapters and gave up on continuing. There are very few equations in this book, which to me was initially promising as I am tired of DSP math books. The author relies more on graphics and figures to explain his point, but I found that the detail was lacking. Perhaps someone with stronger background in this area would be better served by this text."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Reference Standard for Multirate Processing","review":"I wish this work were available when I was implementing multi-rate, multi stage filters with MSI integrated circuits and a wire wrap gun! But we are now in the FPGA world, and professor harris's work is in tune with today's hardware implementations. His attention to implementation efficiency with realistic comparisons is valuable. My only minor \\"ding\\" would be that some of the MATLAB code is not well documented and the results take some effort to interpret. That said, having the MATLAB code is a BIG plus. Even better would be to have Simulink models of the filters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Multirate Signal Processing for Communication Systems","review":"Since fred harris is my all time favorite professor I may be a little biased.

His arms AND legs can be moved from inside and I just love the wide range of facial expressions that can be made. I noticed one reviewer mentioning that he wished the kitty looked angrier but by moving the lower mouth up a bit you can definitely get that nasty kitty expression. I think most negative comments came from people who didn't attempt to work with the puppet long enough to realize it's potential. I love it and so does my 3 year old son."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks good but mouth is bad","review":"It looks great, really funny, but the movable mouth is useless.

In the past, we have dealt with other types of coffee grinders and have not been exceptionally pleased.

It also matches my daughter's kitchen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very uneven grind","review":"Like most Kitchen Aid products, this grinder is very sturdy and seems like it would hold up to commercial use. That being said, it produces a very uneven grind. The consistency ranges from a fine dust to WHOLE BEANS THAT HAVEN'T EVEN BEEN TOUCHED BY THE BLADE all in the same batch of coffee.

Takes up very little space on counter top and low price.Best part is, it not only grinds up coffee beans quite nicely, I use it to grind brown rice and barley to make hot cereal ( porridge).Works great on whole grains.(I grind up 1/2 cup at a time).

I shake the machine whilst grinding to ensure an even grind. It works well for the fine grind needed for a cone filter as well as for the coarser grind for the press pot. It looks solid and looks good on the countertop. I use a little brush to get the grounds out of the grinder, thus avoiding taking off the stainless steel cup each time. Oh, the large capacity is really nice too. I had a burr grinder for a bit of time, but I burnt it out. I'm not going back, because I did not find them reliable.

The plot is based upon a technology the author has thoroughly researched; it is presented in a way to make it plausible. The heroine, Toby Harper, is a likeable, if naive character you can root for all the way. I loved this book until the last ten or fifteen pages which include at least one event that makes no sense and exclude at least one badly needed explanation. I get the impression that the author ran out of time, perhaps to meet her publisher's deadline, and just \\"slapped the ending together.\\" I still recommend the book as great entertainment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two thumbs down","review":"This was, I believe, the second Tess Gerritsen book I have read.

But Tess crosses the line: with scientists creating chimeras of various body parts, inserting them into prostitutes, wait for the chimera to grow, then kill the prostitutes (and then catch the chimera as it slithers across the floor, so you can harvest its parts). It was all just way too graphic for me.If you find the concept of cloning reprehensible, then you will NOT enjoy this book. If you want to read about scientists doing the above things in the name of science, then maybe you would like this book. But I don't recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Gerritsen","review":"If you reach for a Tess Gerritsen novel, you know what you're going to get -- a psychological thriller cloaked in enough medical terminology to have you sounding like an ER doc, with some graphic blood-and-guts scenes thrown in for good measure. While Gerritsen's books are not for the faint of heart, they are well-plotted and well-written, with strong characters and plenty of action. Because they're all written from that recipe, they do tend to run together, and \\"Life Support\\" is another one that fits that bill. The storyline involves tracing a killer virus whose roots lie in \\"fountain of youth\\" hormone transplants. With all the recent talk about biochemical warfare and killer viruses, this book is sure to strike a chord with the public.One question -- what's with the naked babe on the cover of the book? I guess Gerritsen's having a hard time letting go of her romance roots."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great story!","review":"Tess Gerritsen is my new favorite author.

While the medical jargon lends authenticity to the read, it quickly overwhelms the very thin story.

Let's just say it's no Tempur-Pedic but we didn't have $5000 for a bed either. That said, it pretty much is what it said it was.Update: We have had this bed since April of 2011. It has not soften one bit! Still hard as a rock and causing both my husband and I pain in the morning. My husband says he likes a firm mattress but not a bed of rocks. It is too heavy to return and would cost a fortune on shipping plus we would only get a partial credit. Don't buy this or any bed like it unless you really like a very very hard bed!! I even purchased a 4 inch pillow top and that didn't even make it better. We are stuck! With a mattress we hate!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"I absolutely love this mattress. It is fantastic. My wife on the other hand, thinks that it is a bit too firm. She weighs between 105-110, and I am up around 215, so the weight difference may matter when considering if you would like to purchase it. We eventually put a feather bed topper on the mattress and now it is perfect for both of us. You won't likely find another mattress as comfortable for the price. The only down side was that it had a bit of a chemical smell that we had to let air out for about two days and cover with baby-powder."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"My husband and I love this bed! I've slept on firmer mattresses and it's not too firm like the other reviews said. Product received within a week, and price is just unbeatable!

I received this as a gift, and am dreading my in-laws asking about it. It died precisely one day after the warranty expired. Very slow to crank up compared to others, frequent freezing, unresponsive remote control (you could get married and divorced waiting for it to respond to commands!) Poor picture quality with frequent waving and picture edge disintegration. Finally, it refused to give up a DVD, forcing me to take the cover off to retrieve it. Believe me, I have 2 other DVD players, and you can do much better for the price. Try Sony, Panasonic, and Toshiba. I'm sure you work hard for your disposable income; don't waste it on this. My Sony has been playing flawlessly since I bought it, and it is over 2 years old now, and really wasn't much more than this, and in fact, the prices have come down since I bought it.

Maybe because I had a defective unit, but from the look so fit - I don't think so.I returned it and went out and bought an RCA DVD player which is the cheapest DVD player from a company I recognized.

I've read close to 50 parenting books in the past 2 years and this is easily in the bottom 3. I guess if you are a single parent or didn't have good parenting role models growing up, you might find some of this information helpful.

This book is daddy-centric. I'm a single mom and I don't discount the importance of having a good dad around, but this book really did not help me to understand my son or his behavior all that well... it just told me to find him some men to hang around with. Also, it did that by adding unnecessary -and annoying- exclamation points all over the place (!). I'm all for exclamation points, but they really don't need to be placed everywhere!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good review of boyhood...","review":"The stories are enchanting, and the information interesting. This is not a \\"how to\\" book, however. Instead, it is a general overview with many particular examples and explanations. The author's recommendations are straightforward and affirming, to fathers, mothers, and sons. He cares for and accepts the foibles and modes of boyhood. Biddulph has a whole chapter on the effects of testosterone, and I thought that was a little overdone, since our humaneness, as he notes many times later in the book, is not biologically determined."},{"rating":"2","title":"good reading","review":"Overall the book is worth the purchase. I got the most from the sections of the book on early childhood. I did disagree with many points about early adolesence in the way of handling homosexuality and pornography.

I do agree it is easy to read however much of it IS common sense and quite frankly some of the statements turned me off a bit. I almost quit reading the book after the first few pages. For example, the author says boys should NOT be in daycare for the first three years of their lives. I think many working parents, like myself, would find that remark a bit preachy and generalized. I think I know kids pretty well having taught for many years and some of what the author writes had me going, \\"Whaaaat?

I also found as I am a single mum, it had little to no consideration to me (2 pages), and most children these days are brought up by separated parents or single parents, and generally the mother is the sole carer. Luckily for me my mum is a psychologist for relationships and children and clearly expained all you need to give is love and good base foundation with clear rules and be available for your son, and also agreed that this book should not be taken as gospel nor correct and it is very one-sided. for a best selling book, i thought it was terrible"},{"rating":"2","title":"Oriental Secrets Series is Excellent!","review":"This program teaches one of the secrets of Taichi, Qigong and Yoga - the \\"anus lift\\" exercise - in which slight muscular force with regulated breathing is directed to eight energy areas of the body.The program opens with a short but interesting introduction of qigong \\"at large.\\" Warmups include adjusting the 18 points of the standing posture, meditative deep breathing and the abdominal massage.

However, his advice on how to deal with specific emergencies leaves a lot to be desired. In a few cases, he does not provide correct and accurate information. In others, his recommendations are in poor sequence. Other than for the brand new pilot, I think this book is merely a reiteration of what most pilots already know. He didn't have many stories and learnings from them either. AOPA Pilot's Never Again series is a much better learning mechanism."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money, folks!","review":"Yet another collection of so-called \\"Best\\" erotica that only seems to be the best in Susie Bright's opinion. To be fair, there might be one or two inclusions that are acceptable. However, it seems to me that this series has run its course several years back and should be given a rest. Where are the true artists of erotic writing? I see no excerpts from M.S. Valentine or Don Winslow or indeed, any recognizable names in the erotic literature field. Does Ms. Bright collect stories from her friends and neighbors? I think this is yet another prime example of overkill. I have loved and read erotica for 25 years and find nothing much positive to say about this book. I would instead recommend to those readers who like a variety of voices, check out Joyful Desires, A Compendium of Twentieth Century Erotica.

When I tried to take pictures in my home under normal room light, auto focusing failed quite often and the images are terribly blur.

Alison is a great character and Liz Ireland wrote it so you do root for Alison and want the best for her in the end. Liz Ireland also does a great job of creating characters so you know who to root for and for who not to root for. The title does make you think of something different than what the book actually is but the phrase \\"How I stole her husband\\" does tie in with what happened to Alison in the book-you'll just have to read it to find out how.

I felt so sorry for every character in the book.... except for Alison's friends.. Nola and Jess - who were poorly developed. I found myself flipping back pages/chapters to see if I'd missed something about these random people. The middle part of the story dragged on and on.... and then in a matter of one or two chapters.. everything was resolved ... but I still felt unresolved since the resolutions were so weak."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not much of Dream in here but still a great read","review":"So Morpheus doesn't really show up much in this one but it was still a great read. Very entertaining and highly imaginable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid read","review":"Like Fables and Reflections, this volume focuses on a collection of stories. I liked the short stories because it was a nice break from the main plot, and we could enjoy stories from this same universe and learn a bit more about minor characters we have seen before. Following Brief Lives, this was a definite solid read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Gaiman Masterpiece.","review":"Neil Gaiman has established himself as one of the great writers in the world of graphic novels. Volume 8 of the Sandman series takes a side step to view the universe of the Endless from the point of view of a handful of (relatively) small beings stuck in an Inn at the end of the world. As the Reality Storm rages outside, these travelers share stories that reveal the depth of the characters that Gaiman has created. Although not focusing on Morpheus, aka Dream of the Endless, their stories give the reader perspective on the Lord Shaper that cannot be seen in any other way.The last few pages are haunting and urges the reader into Volume 9 like few other literary pieces. This is a MUST BUY for graphic novel fans and fans of a wonderful story."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst entry in the series.","review":"This is the only volume in The Sandman series that I actually had to force myself to finish. Although \\"Worlds' End\\" includes some foreshadowing to the far superior \\"The Kindly Ones\\", the story just doesn't seem to go anywhere. Needless to say, earlier volumes that focused on minor/supporting characters were far more successful."},{"rating":"1","title":"The construct is more important than the tale","review":"Interesting structure to a series of tales told by travelers stuck at an Inn during a storm. Cantebury Tales was the inspiration and Gaiman employs many levels of stories within stories and even eventually brings the story full circle, which is cheeky. However it seems that the stories were given little precedence and therefore come off very weak. Now part of this is expectation. Fables and Reflections blew me away and may be my fav of the series so I expected this as a series of individual stories to be just as good. So with it being just average I was overly disappointed. There are some good moments and the few appearances of Death and the Endless are captivating. However they are not enough.One note: the end of this book overtly hints at the plot of Kindly One's so if you want to be surprised, read this after that one. I wish Gaiman hadn't done that, myself."},{"rating":"2","title":"As good as it gets!","review":"Wireless 2.4 GHz gamepads? Wow!

I bought this as a programmable gamepad for Ghost Recon (which doesn't allow you to set up a controller inside the game)...and I can't get most of the buttons to work right with the game. I tried using it with Jedi Knight II, which does allow game controller setup inside the game, and I couldn't get both analog sticks to work with the game (aka using the left stick to move and the right stick to look around/aim). In short: the software is unreliable and also difficult to use, and the most non-flight games don't really support two stick gamepads (aka 4 axises)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Gamepad","review":"Agreed that this is a much better gamepad than the corded wingman.

It's amazing how some people will be so quick to judge and make that judgment based off of ignorance. I have read the bible and I have also noticed that that's more than most Christians do.

In this book he failed to mention he was a spiritist church minister, a BISHOP in both the Old Catholic Church AND The Roman Catholic Church while being a high grade witch and satanist!For some reason he recalls it later in Lucifer Dethroned. I found most of the material in \\"Lucifer Dethroned\\" impossible to swallow, needless to say.

As a practicing Wiccan for several years, I can tell you this man has a very shrewd imagination! According to Schnoebelen, even Catholics are Satanist, as well as anyone else who doesn't follow whatever faith he \\"claims\\" to be into at the time. As for Wicca, unfortunately, he has twisted the facts just enough to make his lies sound credible to anyone who isn't educated enough on the subject as it fits his agenda.

The book is poorly written, based on information that has long been rendered irrelevant (since, say the 1800s), and is mostly just propaganda and hate mongering. Much like the Young Earth Creationists, this author and the individuals he represents should be viewed as the Christian equivalent of Al Qaeda...dangerous extremists who sole purpose in life is to hurt others.

It is a scurrilous, uninformed attack against a gentle, legitimate, recognized religion. Wiccans follow the Wiccan Rede, which says \\"An it harm none, do what ye will.\\" In other words, harm no one. It is all right to defend yourself or someone else, but even then harm should be kept to a necessary minimum. Anyone familiar with Wicca knows this to be the case, both in books and in practice. The purpose of this book is to keep people from investigating the religion on their own. Wiccans do not write tracts warning people to stay away from hate-filled fundamentalist cults. We let people make their own decisions and do not lie to them or put out filthy propaganda. Amazon should remove this book from their online shelves, as they would remove anti-semitic books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Author clearly out of his league","review":"Mr. Schnoebelen's effort is at best amateurish. The least he might do is study Wicca and Paganism to understand what they are before he attacks. As it stands, he shadowboxes an imaginary enemy that he inaccurately labels Wicca and Paganism. His book fails to describe any particular pagan belief system with even minimum accuracy. That being said, to what pagan belief does he object, and for what reasons? I mean, really? And since his book does not address actual issues, to whom does he write except other Christians who probably don't know any more about Wicca than him?Anybody who understands the Old Religion surely will find this book irrelevant. Those who suffer to find relevance will come away with same the nagging feeling:To wit, that, gosh, although we've heard it before, many times, it really is true -- some Christians really are arrogant and stupid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the NEW Lego Friends","review":"My daughter wanted a computer game for Christmas and since she loves Lego Friends I thought she would enjoy this CD.

After receiving it, I changed my mind. Although it promises to be an easy cleanup with a \\"special tool\\", it is way too hard to clean up. The pulp basket contains a ridge that makes it next to impossible to get out all of the little strains of pulp. The special tool is great for getting out the big stuff, but not the little stuff. Also, there is a TON of juice left over in the pulp that gets thrown away. This is a result of the poor design, which filters the juice through the pulp before exiting. The product had a nice design and looked good on my counter-top, but it did not deliver.

The piece of foam keeps excessive water from flowing into the motor housing and allows quick-easy clean up. KitchenAide does make excellent, durable products; quiet and dependable. The only thing that would make this perfect for the gallon juicers would be a pulp extractor port, otherwise for someone like me who just makes a quart of juice at a time, this is not a problem.

If I don't do that, then it will shake and spill the juice all over. Well, that does happen occationally leaving a big mess to cleanup.Finally, very messy and time consuming to cleanup too.Kitchenaid should pay owners of this juicer to just use it.

On this CD there are some exceptionally sentimental, sweet songs like \\"Love At The Five And Dime\\" and \\"More Than A Whisper.\\" The latter is my favorite track on the CD: I hear feminine strength pushing through the sentimentality. Very charming. Some of the tracks are straight forward country and western music, like \\"Lookin' For The Time\\" which are not special to me.

There are minor errors in formatting, but they didn't distract me from the intent of the text. And, honestly, for $0.89, I don't think there's much room for complaints on these minor points. I also love being able to click on the \\"Morning and Evening\\" title and go directly to where I left off. It's even easier than the print version, and since I read so much anyway, there's no chance that I accidentally left my copy in my car or at the office.

He has the God-given ability to let humility be the foundation of what he presents on every page. Rewards?

The title track sums up lost opportunities to build a great and just society and gives lessons for us in the States, \\"Old Bugger Charlie\\" is on a similar theme. Probably the most moving track for descendents of immigrants in the new worlds is \\"Two Strong Arms\\". It tells a familiar story really well. I laugh and sing along to \\"Harry's Wife\\" - another familiar story. Musically it's well done, alternating pace and using tempo and melody to tell the stories of ordinary lives in an extraordinary and entertaining fashion.

The rest of season 1 was good, and season 2 was great. Season 3 is a major let down. I'll watch the first few episodes of season 4, but if it gets no better, I won't keep trying. I watched the entire 3rd season and was really disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"bummer","review":"I was really looking forward to season 3, but it's disappointing, to say the least.

That's just one problem I have with season 3. It's really just a drudgery to watch, compared to seasons 1 and 2. I hope season 4 and 5 are better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really?","review":"I watched season 1 and season 2 with such excitement and then the finale of season 2 happened. It totally and completely killed the series for me. I was already starting to get irritated that the series went off on a tangent and forgot about the FRZ or whatever it's called. I tried to like it and then the real Olivia got stuck in the alternate universe. I cannot watch this anymore. Things were going fairly well. Watching this series is way too much work -.-"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Well I'm sure it's obvious by now that I don't like season 3, but THIS episode is the most boring of all. There's nothing new here that we didn't already know or could guess. I suppose they can't all be golden, but this one is definitely a throw away and it wouldn't be missed whatsoever. How many ways can I say boring?? Bummer, characterless, cloying, colorless, commonplace, dead, drab, drag, drudging, dull, flat, ho-hum, humdrum, insipid, interminable, irksome, lifeless, monotonous, moth-eaten, mundane, nothing, nowhere, platitudinous, plebeian, prosaic, repetitious, routine, spiritless, stale, stereotyped, stodgy, stuffy, stupid, tedious, threadbare, tiresome, tiring, trite, unexciting, uninteresting, unvaried, vapid, wearisome.All those words ALMOST describe this ridiculous episode."},{"rating":"1","title":"Features menu locks up Blu Ray player","review":"First, all of the episodes play fine. They look great in Blu Ray. 5 Stars for the show, however, the disk menu functionality leaves much to be desired. This is the first Blu Ray disk playback issue I've had w/ player Sony BDP-BX38 - whose firmware is up to date. \\"BD Live\\" and most of the \\"Features\\" lock up the player, which then has to be restarted. So, I guess this review's as much of a slam on Sony as it as on Warner Home Video. Apparently, BR development isn't all that commonized yet. My options are- wait it out and hope that Sony's next update fixes the issue or to exchange the blu ray for DVD. Undecided."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Show for pure entertainment on television","review":"I started watching \\"Fringe,\\" well into the first season and was stunned as to how good the show was. I made it a point to always be at home when I knew that it was going to be on. As soon as I had a DVR installed, it was the first show that I set up to record at all times! It's so different and keeps you sitting in complete silence & on the edge the whole time that it's on. I just wish that Fox had enough sense to promote this show as it's quality that we don't often see on that network. It's so good that it honestly makes you wonder...........\\"what if?\\"....Please FOX network, keep renewing this show.....it's the best you've ever done!! AND YES, I've bought both seasons on DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"It just gets better and better","review":"I just love this show, and it keeps getting better and better.

I don’t know if I can even describe how much I like Fringe. The level of creativity just keeps getting better.

Lot's of science, love, and destruction!","review":"Fringe is always pretty good...but than sometimes it's great. This is one of those episodes. I suggest to watch the previous episode too because Alternate Olivia is almost better acted than original. It's kinda cool that they started making her good.

With today's advances in technology the program is of much better quality. This team is wonderful together, Walter as the mad scientist is superb, you can't help feeling his pain and frustration of losing his son Peter, and why he took Walternet's son in replacement. Olivia is a very capable agent, and you really want Peter and Liv to get together. The agent assistant, Astrid is also an integral part of the team. I could go on adnausium as this show stopped our household. The whole family sat down to watch the next episode. We recorded each episode on the hard drive to rewatch so as not to miss anything! We are all very disappointed as the show has been taken off - in the middle of the season = not happy! Can't wait for the DVD to become available. Highly recommended if you like Sci-fi/drama/crime fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fringe- Season 3","review":"There is a flaw on disc 5 which made it impossible to watch the first episode on that disc to completion.

Terrible show to begin with, totally off the wall but manage to get some good ratings due to its initial time slot. The show's ratings start going downhill once it was move out of the original time slot. But yet it gets renewed year after year while much better shows with better ratings get cut by Fox one after another."},{"rating":"2","title":"cgreen","review":"I purchased and watched all of season one and season two because I came across this show after season three hadalready started. I was so amazed and couldn't get enough of fringe. I think this is science fiction at it's very best and it is one of the best shows on all the major stations. I hope and pray it doesn't get cancelled. I think that would be a big mistake for Fox."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best show on TV","review":"Better than House, Chuck, Castle, Bones, and any other 1 hour drama on network television. The only shows I have liked more in the past 10 years were Firefly and Lost. The show really started to hit its stride in the back half of last year and it is the only show that I can't let stack up on my DVR. They did a great job of casting Anna Torv, Joshua Jackson, and the real star of the show...John Noble. That guy is awesome.I will say that to truly enjoy this season you need to have more backstory. You probably need to at least watch the back half of season 2 to appreciate season 3. So, kill two birds with one stone and buy the seasons of fringe for a Christmas present for someone and then offer to host a marathon watching party with them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seriously watch if you haven't","review":"Fringe is a really good show that has both overarching and episodic plots. It's not your typical show, but brings some really cool aspects of science (mostly theoretical) and incorporates them in layers of storylines that intertwine. I think it's definitely worth your time to check out, but start with season one. You'll need to watch them mostly in order to really catch everything's that happening."},{"rating":"2","title":"Consistantly great","review":"I used to like The X-Files very much. Fringe is ten times better. More interesting characters, Stories, Special effects, and more. There are great puzzles in the story lines that, unlike The X-files, are answered down the road. The level of mystery is excellent and the characters are very likeable. The unpredictability of the show is another bonus. I hope this show goes on for years and years and hopefully they will keep the same level of writing skill."},{"rating":"2","title":"great series","review":"I love fringe it is a great syfy. it seems to have a little of everything in in. most of it is based off science and the stuff that is not they try to apply to science."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasing","review":"\\"Child of All Nations\\" is excellent reading for those interested in history, more specifically, the history of the Dutch East Indies. The reason I gave this novel four stars, however, and not five is because with all the historical references in the novel, it masks the underlying plot and also does not allow the reader to connect personally with the characters. The writing style in this novel, like it's predisessor,\\"This Earth of Mankind,\\" is impressional, and moving.The message in the story is also very moving. The novel makes you think and helps the reader come to understand humanity more effeciently than they did before reading the novel. This set of novels (The Buru Quartet) are a comprised collection of intellectually stimulating and touching peice of literature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Indonesia, not Malaysia","review":"I want to correct a serious error in the last sentence of the first review posted on this page. It says that Toer's books \\"are banned in his native MALAYSIA.\\" This is not the correct country. Toer is a native of INDONESIA, and the Buru quartet chronicles the emotional, political and social emergence of that nation. I met the author when I had the opportunity to translate for him during his trip to the US in 1999 -- I strongly feel that he would want people to know that his country is Indonesia!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Wonder","review":"Even more compelling than his first in the series, this book continues the story of Menke, Nyai, Darsam et al. and the Dutch sugar baron occupation of Eastern and Central Java. More detail on the odious treatment of the natives in the name of European corporate greed. As a Dutch descendent married to a Javanese woman I now understand much better than she could tell me about that oppression, and marvel that they don't seem to stll hate us. Human love and concern for one another are seen to shine through though and it is hard to end this book without a tear. In addtion to a good story and interesting history, springled through it are jewels of universal wisdom worth quoting. These books should be required reading and a part of any world citizen's education. On to book number 3 - then I may re-read the 4th, which I read first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Think twice about your HMO","review":"Robin Cook again shows us that his novels contain an element that may affect you. In Fatal Cure, he questions HMOs and the morality about it all. Like most Cook novels, a few of the \\"mysteries\\" are easy to figure out from the beginning, but the book will still keep you in suspense. A great read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cook Must Be Kidding","review":"This is an unbelievably bad book. The story, including the identity of the villain, is obvious within the first chapters. The characters, dialogue and situations are so unbelivable as to be ridiculous. If the protagonists in this story graduated from medical school, I might consider sending my hamster, because they seem to have about an equal intelligence level. David and Angela should have figured this whole mess out even before I did, but they were too busy listening to their daughter's improbable dialogue, answering her with trite, cutesy nonsense, and putting her into situations that should have made them lose their parenting privileges. Cook should leave polemics about HMOs to the analysts and concentrate on basic writing techniques - plot, character development and dialogue."},{"rating":"2","title":"JUST GREAT!","review":"I thought the plot was great and he developped the characters very well.I'm reading Vector now - it's quite good so far!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous Dialogue","review":"This book was unintentionally laughable. The dialogue was absurd - I guarantee that no one in the world has ever uttered the words these characters do. Of course, the bad dialogue is only half of the problem - the ridiculous plot is the rest. The synopsis should read \\"Two doctors, thought to be brilliant, behave like idiots in a quest to solve a mystery.\\" The plot was so transparent that I kept reading, hoping that there would be a twist or something worthwhile to take from the book. Sadly, that was not the case."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fatal just about describes it!!","review":"Complete waste of time! I am done reading Robin Cook books for now..The story line for this book is so stupid I am amazed Mr. Cooks editors even allowed it to be printed..I'm not sure about the hospitals where Robin lives or works at, but in the area where I live, if just one patient died there would be an immediate investigation, but here we have several patients die from unknown causes and the characters just move along like it's no big deal..The Wilsons even allow their daughter to be admitted!!! Give me a break!! Like I said..don't waste your time on this one!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Preachy as all heck - okay storyline.","review":"While the story line was tolerable and interesting at times, the preachiness of 'educating the reader' about the favorite 'special interest' of the author really comes across to clumsily that it detracts from the overall flow of the book (every few pages there seems to be a jab here and there thrown in to meet some sort of a PSA quota.) The story line is not as good as Toxin, but this title is slightly less offensive in the constant regurgitation of the 'healthcare system= evil' message than it is in Toxin."},{"rating":"1","title":"A thinly disguised rant about managed competition.","review":"A thinly disguised rant about managed competition, seen of course from the Doctor's point of view. The two protagonists are unbelievably stupid, but then they would have to be for such a week plot to survive the full length of the book. This is the first Robin Cook book I have read and is likely to be my last."},{"rating":"1","title":"Badly written and predictable","review":"Robin Cook has a political message, but is not content to let the message come across with anything less than the force of a sledgehammer. He has rammed the same message about managed care down the readers throat one time too often. I found this book was extremely annoying to read, despite the fact that I agree with the message! Dr. Cook does not seem to even try to develop his characters, and the writing is what one would expect from an eighth grader, not a mature author. Don't waste your time reading this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"absorbing thriller","review":"Dr David Wilson and his wife Angela Wilson(also a doctor) seek employment at Bartlet Community Hospital,Bartlet desiring to live a quiet and peaceful life in the countryside away from the hustle and bustle of Boston only to find out later that Bartlet is not the mini-heaven they had made it out to be.For Bartlet Community Hospital is a place where people are actually killed by radiation !

The child comes off as being the smartest and most intelligent of the family. No more Robin Cook for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful if mistitled collection","review":"The reason I give this a four-star rather than five-star rating is that it uses the inferior trio version of L'Histoire du Soldat, rather than than the more familiar and certainly more interesting version for high and low instruments of various timbres. There are indeed some rarities on these two disks, but most of the pieces would be familiar to anyone who knew Stravinsky's work well. The first disk has a variety of works for small ensemble, conducted by Vladimir Askanazy, the best of which is the \\"Septet.\\" I found the performances on the second disk more effective (mostly by Charles Detoit, but one each by Chailly and Ansermet), although some of the pieces are quite familiar. I purchased this disk because I had most of the music on vinyl, now inaccessible to me.

Done largely by studio greed to make more money and that's all.Ignoring that however and the violent nature of this movie, coming down to film content itself. There is no story. There is nothing here at all that counts as story. No acting, no script, lots of MTV style work here, but no story at all.

Why the four stars? Because the DVD will have nothing on it! I'd give the film 5, but this DVD itself is as naked as the girls of Sin City!

Sin City looks and feels like a comic come to life.Why only 4 stars you ask ?................WARNING VAGUE GENERAL SPOILER BELOW...........................................The only reason I give the movie 4 stars instead of 5 is the same reason I quit reading Miller's comics in the first place.In his dim \\"Sin City\\" world, the heroes rarely win the War, they only win the battles.Now I don't always want a cheery happy ending... but from time to time it would be nice to see a hero in Miller's world actually survive !"},{"rating":"2","title":"A different kind of comic novel movie","review":"I was expecting the same kind of Robert Rodrigues movie such as Desperado and the Spy Kids movies but found that this was not the case. I have to say that it was very well put together visually and the many stories were scripted well to make the story cohesive. I liked it very much. I love all the characters even the Eric Stahl character. It was very good it showed a different side of top notch actors that some avid movie goers have not seen, this was fabulous. It was well scripted and well directed it was true to the title and the graphic novel. This was good work Robert and Quentin, but that is to be expected with these two directors, bravo.

But this DVD contains nothing other than a seven-minute featurette. No commentary or anything.Buy this DVD, as the film is worth seeing many, many times.

It has breathtaking cinemography, superb acting, and gritty dialoge. This is my favortie movie! You probaly know the plot by know, so, I'll just tell you about the expierence. When I first started watching it, and i saw what the film was going to be, i felt excitied and gitty. I felt astonished by the time the credits started rolling. The movie is so visually stimulating, it actually will leave you breathless. Now, i would not reccomend buying this edition. I know for a fact That \\"Sin City: Directors Cut\\" will come out in the late Fall/Winter. If you enjoy Sin City, you might want to buy this and the other one to. On this one you can pick which cover you would like."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sin City","review":"Sit back and fasten your seat belt.If you want original then this is for you. This won't be the last you see of this new way of filming. This is the future. I look forward to the next installment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different and Fun. Sin city is a well produced movie","review":"Not everyone will like Sin City, but if you grew up reading Frank Miller comic books you might. Or, if you are looking for something different to watch. Sin City's landscape and cinematic appearance is well done. It's kind of a cross between a black and white comic book and real actors...no not Roger Rabbit! What really makes this movie great are the emotions and personalities of the characters. You have really seedy bad guys and people that are in bad situtations who are at the end of their wit and have to do everything they can to survive. I wished it had been a little longer but oh well. I hope they make another one."},{"rating":"1","title":"May be good for die-hard geeks","review":"I can't believe this movie.The dialogues consist of endless one phrase pre-killing warnings, like \\"You just made the greatest error of your life\\", \\"You will regret it!\\" and so on, after which the actor/actress throws a \\"meaningful\\" dramatic look at the bleeding victim and pull out their big gun/sword/bazooka...The women have of course their own bazookas stuck in their leather G-strings and their hair always has wind in it and they are really really badass.Everyone's voice is low and dramatic and it becomes kind of monotone and makes you want to sleep, especially whith the movie being always so dark.I found it terrible and predictable. But if you like computer games with women fighters you probably will enjoy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"It Looks Like The Comic!...wowee zowee.....","review":"The main purpose of the filmmakers was to make it look, panel for panel, EXACTLY like the comic. Mission accomplished.As for plot and characters that we care about what happens to, this movie is a complete failure. The film is a mish-mash of several of the comic's stories. It all ends up as a complete mess.The make-up for the more bizzare characters looks ridiculous next to the more human-looking in the cast. And as for Miller's tenth-rate, \\"hard-boiled\\" dialogue...some things are better read in a comic book than actually spoken. It comes off real cheesy.Stick with producing over-priced comic books, Frank."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smells too much like wine","review":"And no, I'm not talking about good wine, but rather cheap crap. Face it my \\"peeps\\" you've all be duped. This so-called movie barely passes as a collection of moody pseudo-arty black-and-white poppycock. My ex-boyfriend - yes, we split amicably and are still friends - told me that this movie was nothing more than a contractual obligation for Robert Rodriguez and partially funded by yes, your least favorite liberal and mine: Michael Moore. The agenda is clear as many shots are taken at the Catholic Church. Don't get me wrong, I'm far from Catholic but I still respect those people more than most religions. Bruce has done far better work in movies like the \\"Die Hard\\" series, and let's face it this is basically the same performance he gave in \\"The Sixth Sense\\". I for one preferred it the first time around. Shame on Quentin Tarantino, who I hate besides, for making a bad movie worse. This is the cinematic equivalent of toilet paper - wipe yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fot the video game generation","review":"I wanted to like this film, i really did. But it just reaked of some lame video game storyline all linked together. It is true to the source material but when adapting a comic to another formal you need to adjust it to that format. This has not been done here. In essence you get a moving graphic novel. If this was to be adapted to a novelisation would the source material be used so literally. I think not. This film was all style over substance. Bad story, lame characters, lame action. It gets one star for Rutger Heurs great performace."},{"rating":"1","title":"I GIVE UP!!!","review":"No more buying DVD's for me... this double dipping crap is just unbelieveable... it's bad enough that come next year or so when I can actually afford to get a nice spanking new HDTV, I'm going to have to either buy an HDMI compat. DVD player, or re-buy most of the films in my current dvd collection on BLU-Ray, or whatever the newest new format comes out... this is pathetic, from here on out, my dvd budget is going to the nearest rental chain..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low Entertainment","review":"I pity all the poor idiots who enjoyed this movie, because their IQs aren't even high enough to understand how stupid they are. This is, without a doubt, the lowest form of entertainment I have ever been subjected to. I only regret that I didn't walk out of the theater sooner. The sex, drugs, and violence are uncontrolled and take over the entire movie. The plot is minimal at best. The visuals are revolutionary, but who cares when that's the only good quality? Sin City is common, unremarkable, and fit for white trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very violent.","review":"This movie was the worst piece of garbage I've ever seen. I loved Resoviour Dogs, Dusk til Dawn, True Romance so I'm not adverse to violence but this was awful. Even though it was not a true color film, it was just sickening. Not for teenagers!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid, Stupid, Stupid...","review":"This movie was absolutely ridiculous, if I could have given it a negative star I would have. I can not see how people sit through it. I tried to watch it once and it was so stupid I couldn't even do it. I finally forced myself to sit through it and it was even stupider than I originally thought it would be. I don't know what kind of people like this movie but I'm not one of them... Rent it first before you decide to buy it!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"C'mon, it's not *that* great!","review":"In my opinion this was a good movie, but in now way deserved all the hype. The plot felt a little stupid and forced.Want to see this movie? Save money by renting it from Blockbuster, because you'll only need to see it once."},{"rating":"1","title":"Visually striking but....","review":"The visuals are great but the endless worship of violence is sick and pointless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Visual Style, Nothing More-Junk Food For the Eye...","review":"Wow. Robert Rodregeiz, Quentin Tarantino together again. The big failure of this film is its screenplay. It reads like a porno novel, using dialog no one would ever use. The second failure of this movie is there are NO characters in this film that is likable. The animation/live action blend is great and the action is pretty non stop. Also, the film is very violent. It would make Freddy or Jason flinch!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stinko!","review":"Possibly the worst movie ever made. I hated it, and was thrilled when it ended.

I can't wait for the sequel which is in pre-production I'm told."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great movie, but shun this release","review":"Now, I actually love Sin City and I think it should herald a new era of quality adaptations of works. However, this dvd release is simply the pits and deserves to be ignored by any self respecting fan. Double dipping is a low practice, but it's not beyond this disc's distributors. I'm waiting for the special edition, which should have been the first, last, and only edition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning before you buy!!!","review":"There will be a special edition out before christmas for this awesome movie! If you REALLY like the movie, save your money and buy that, itll have a lot more scenes and special features"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait for the Special Edition!!!!","review":"Do not let the slip covers and giveaways fool you! This is the rushed version of the DVD! In a short time the 2 disk S.E. will be here with more extras than you will know what to do with!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's not double dipping if they tell you ahead of time","review":"With even a small amount of research, you could have (and most of us did) known that this expanded DVD was coming. The fact that the first DVD had next to no special features should be enough to fill you in. But even if it wasn't, the studio and the filmmakers have not made a secret out of the second DVD release.Anyway, can't wait to see the full versions of each story. And Rodriguez' commentaries and extras are always incredibly interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stylish and highly stylized","review":"As a major fan of Robert Rodriguez and a fan of Frank Miller, I think that I was expecting a bit more from Sin City. It's hard to know exactly WHAT I wanted more of, since the film is suffused with style and violence, cheap broads with hearts of gold and mugs who never got a fair shot.But for all the style the film oozes, its extremely stylized dialogue is sometimes hard for the film's cast to get out and sound plausible doing so -- this is particularly true of some of the lines placed in the mouths of the actresses.Still, the film is ruthlessly true to Miller's vision and is easily the most hard-boiled noir movie ever made. As a result, Sin City has to be strongly recommended to fans of either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Movie, Crappy DVD","review":"This was one movie I couldn't wait to have, so I pre-ordered. Movie is perfectly acted, violent, and graphically beautiful.This DVD, however, comes with almost NO extras. Spend the extra US$5 and get the \\"Uncut, super-duper, extended\\" version."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Extra suff is worth the price.","review":"Ok, forget the film. The extras on the DVD are worth the price.I now know how to(1) make fresh restaurant style chips(2) make 2 different kinds of breakfast tacos.(3) How to shoot Green-screen.(4) What a small independent studio looks like.(5) create better lighting techniques.(6) do more camera tricks.(7) and a bunch of other stuff.Oh, the movie was pretty good too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than I expected","review":"I bought used and the quality was better than expected. It came with comic book in new condition. I was very pleased."},{"rating":"2","title":"great content....and bonus","review":"amaing box cover art , same as 300, love the quality and content, must have box set for all of frank's fans ,"},{"rating":"1","title":"1/2 Good","review":"So maybe I'd give it 2-1/2 stars if it was possible.The good: The visual. Very stark. Very arresting.The bad: You HAVE to convince yourself to leave believability at the door. From beginning to end.Yeah, yeah, I know this is comic book stuff. But to sit through two hours of getting beaten over the head with over the top violence gets pretty damned dull for the viewer. In my case it took me only 30 minutes to pull the plug on my DVD. Why? Because Rourke's superhuman character gets pulverized by a speeding car THREE times and walks away virtually unscathed, save for a bloodied face. But then, a few scenes later, get's knocked UNCONSCIOUS by a sledgehammer to the noggin.Huh? Direct impact by a speeding automobile inflicts almost zero bodily harm, but a hand held piece of hardware k.o.'s him?!?Safe to say I won't finish this movie anytime soon. If ever. Zzzzzzz."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much violence!!!","review":"I remember when a friend of mine told me about a movie (I'm not going to say the name) in which one of the characters is a hitman and killed people with a smile in his face and adding a sarcastic and cynic remark and he didn't stand it because of that , he said, human life is a precious gift. I watched Sin City last night and I think that it is one of the more violent trash-movies I've ever seen. Violence is always a bad thing but in this case is senseless and really stupid. Americans should realize that this country is one of the more violent in the world. People kills each other sometimes only for the pleasure of killing (think about the sniper in the Washington DC area 3 years ago) One of the reasons for this is what we see in the movies. And this movie is an example of that. Frank Miller is a mental-illed guy and his stories should be avoided at any cost. Don't buy or see this piece of garbage!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugly, depressing, and quite vulgar.","review":"First of all my friends had to drag me to the theatre with them to see this movie. The violence was completely disgusting at points. The scene where that freak \\"Marv\\" severs Elijah Woods arms and legs, restricts the blood flow by tying off his arteries to keep him from bleeding to death and prolong his agony, before finally severing his head was a real turn off. Marv is someones idea of what a hero is supposed to be I guess. But he is clearly not mine. Bruce willis has a strong role here but its not enough to save this movie. Overall Sin City was such a downer that it left me wishing I had stayed home and popped \\"Return of The Jedi\\" into my dvd player instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"SHOULD HAVE NAMED IT SICK CITY.","review":"I tried to watch, some of this mess last night, on the advice of one of my co-workers in which he said, was a pretty good flick. Now, I'm asking myself why? Why did he do this to me. Most of the violent scenes, killings in this movie, are just plain ridiculous and stupid!!!For example, the one with the lesbian probation officer, did it make any sense to have her shot that many times like that?I mean, just plain OVER KILL!! After that, and with the beheading (which he deserved) of the serial killer, I said, O.K. I HAD ENOUGH!!I took this B.S. out of my DVD player, put in Sade' Lovers Live concert DVD, to get my sanity back."},{"rating":"2","title":"JESSICA ALBA !!","review":"I want Jessica Alba to do a playboy layout , sooooooo bad!

THIS ABSOLUTELY RUINED THE INTEGRITY AND THE BELIEVABILITY OF THE FILM. FIRST OF ALL, SHE WAS NAKED IN THE COMIC BOOK, AND ABSOLUTELY ANY CHANGE IS UNACCEPTABLE AND IMMORAL. SECOND, AS IT IS, THE STRIPPERS IN SIN CITY ARE ACTUALLY DRESSED IN A LESS SUGGESTIVE MANNER THAN THE WOMEN THAT ARE JUST STANDING AROUND. WHAT THE HELL SORTA SENSE DOES THAT MAKE? ANYWAY, RODRIGUEZ SHOULDA CANNED HER WHEN HE FOUND OUT THAT SHE WOULDN'T DO IT AND FOUND SOMEONE ELSE WHO WOULDA GOTTEN NAKED. NAKED AS HELL. HAD HE DONE THAT IT WOULD INDEED HAVE BEEN THE GREATEST MOVIE EVER, BUT AS IT STANDS IT IS THE WORST MOVIE EVER.

But, if you have any comapssion for the human race don't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Technically flawless but still boring","review":"Don't get me wrong, the movie looked great but it was still a major bore. It was slow and the comic-book dialogue only made it cheesy. I saw it in the theater with digital projection and I still found myself checking my watch. Unless you're a comic book dork you're probably better off finding something else to watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fancy Visual Hot Air & Story Scribble","review":"yeah, that about describes the movie 'sin city'.don't be taken in by its hard hitting razzle-dazzle visual nonsense and its self-important comic book story telling.why this movie got so much attention from people and critics alike beats me.not impressed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only here cause I'm not buying this one","review":"Ok...I'm seeing a lot of mentioning about the \\"double dipping\\" with the extended version coming out in December. Most of the comments negative. The thing is 1. maybe if people took the time to do research before buying a movie they wouldn't complain about it. It was all over the net prior to this version being released that there would be another edition coming out in the near future for the \\"true collector\\". 2. Maybe some people just want to see the movie as it was in the theater and really don't care about the extra stuff. Heck both versions of Lord of the Rings movies still sell and they have just a regular version and a directors cut."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible....a waste of time","review":"Although the photographic style shows originality, some of the violent scenes were fun, and the actors did a good job, the story is boring. By the time the movie was almost over, I was waiting for relief from watching this stinker. When it was over, the only satisfaction came from not having paid movie theater prices for the entire family."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't know how anyone can sit through this","review":"I am so glad I rented this rather than follow the advice of most of the reviewers on this page and buying it. I didn't even get past the first 20 minutes. It is truly disgusting. I guess if you are a big fan of this kind of comic book you will love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"fell asleep watchig in the theater...","review":"thought maybe I missed something - so I picked up the DVD. I didn't miss much. It's an awful film that looks great. Rourke gives a stunning performance. Too bad it was in such a waste of time film. I liked the books by the way...but a load of the dialogue comes off as ridiculous when it's said out loud rather than being filtered by your brain in context of paneled art. Glad that people dig it, maybe this kind of stylized film can be built around a good screenplay. Did I mention the music gave me a headache?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sin is In","review":"Sin City is one wild ride of a movie. With it's black and white filming, the unique use of certain colors such as red for blood and lipstick to accent certain people and things, it's rough but sometimes brutally funny dialogue, and it's riveting action sequences, there is nothing that has come before it that I can compare it to. It is a feast for the eye and you won't want to turn away for fear of missing a moment. Not for everyone as there are some very graphic scenes of violence but this is basically a comic book come to life. All the elements I've mention go into creating a wonderfully dark mood where the people of Sin City live and die, some heroically, some as cowards. I can honestly say there is nothing out there in the world of film like it. My best advice is, if you are uncertain about this movie, rent it and then make up your own mind if you want to add it to your home library. I'd be willing to bet at least 7 out of every 10 people who do so will buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best","review":"Sin City is one of the greatest films i have seen. It is like no other and its style is unparalled. Yes it is violent and such but a very good film with a lot to offer. Great action, acting, story, and amazing visuals."},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST movie EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Theme: Protect what matters to you most by any means necessary.That means alot of blood and gore. enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Film Noir!","review":"I really enjoyed Sin City when I rented it.

So, think you can wait a few months?"},{"rating":"2","title":"There are morals here!","review":"This movie has a moral center, and for that I love it. It's definitely a man's film (and graphic novel), and at the center of each story is a man who will give his life to protect a woman. What's morally ambiguous about that?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaait.........","review":"WAIT for the SE! If you are not a DVD collector, and don't care about double-disc sets and extras, then go right ahead. Otherwise, this is a bare-bones ploy to get your $$$.

At least, not now","review":"The director promised a big 3DVD disc that lengthened the story on each of the episodes. The DVD they are releasing now is actually a barebones one.

Girls won't get it and they'll hate it!Besides, who talks like this? These characters say things guys wouldn't say to themselves let alone out loud. Okay, never mind the cartoon dialog ---- this is a cool ride.The movie is broken up into 3 segments and wrapped in the introduction amounting to 5 minutes in the beginning. The movie starts with one character and ends with him.So, sit back, have a couple of bruskies and a shot of whiskey and strap in. It's going to be a bumpy ride.If this review was helpful, please add your vote."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Frank Miller die-hard fans only","review":"...the rest of us skip this movie. I'll admit the best thing about the movie is the way it looks. Rodriguez did an excellenct job in bring a comic book to life. However, some things need to stick to their original medium. I'm counting these illogical wrecks of mini-stories as those that fit in this catagory. After Micky Rourke's short (the best one, IMHO) I was ready for this movie to end. Clive Owens seemed miscasted, but Benico sort of saved the day on that story, but it was still riding on the so-so part. After that, I'm thinking surely that's the end...BUT NO. It keeps going and going, until I'm practically begging the DVD player, please no more. Then there's just one more bit, that I was so close to pulling my hair out, that I was relieved that it only lasted less than a minute. Oh, Thank God. If over the top violence is what gets you off, then this is the movie for you. If not, please, please avoid this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the..?","review":"Billed as a hard-boiled contemporary noir--not an homage, but the real deal--Miller's story gives us stuff in the vein of cannibals, ninjas, and hookers. As authentic to the genre as putting dragons and wizards in an espionage film. The characters have false voices, as well--Miller actually has an eleven year old schoolgirl talking with such a clipped, bad-ass cool, it makes Fred MacMurray sound like Wally Cox. He also seems to enjoy portraying castrations of many types, such as gunshots to the groin, knifings, and so on. A fun time for all. A brilliant work, if only it was written by a highschool prodigy, but for a major Hollywood work, it only serves to reinforce the stereotype that it takes little to impress fanboys."},{"rating":"1","title":"What do you know... Art CAN be garbage","review":"I borrowed this from a friend and am shocked at how much I despise this movie. If you are impressed by a black and white movie containing red dresses -or- beds, than by all means. But if you are person who sees movies for PLOTS and character development, RUN AWAY.It disturbs me that the person I borrowed it from also lent me the TRUE work of art \\"Sky Captain\\" and implied this had similar magic is a sort of unconventional manner.... well it doesn't. Sin City didn't fool me."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great movie","review":"Whether you like it or whether you don't, if you like movies, you \\"must see\\" this film. Whether you like Roberto Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino or whether you don't, this film raises the bar for comic book and comic book concept movies for the future. From this movie on, there are only two credible, if widely divergent, paths to take in bringing a comic book concept to the screen: \\"Spiderman 2\\", or \\"Sin City\\". One can make a movie as earnestly, beautifully real, full of genuine human feeling, and as lovingly put on screen as \\"literal truth\\" as \\"Spiderman 2\\", or one can make a movie as stunningly surreal and hyperbolically drawn as \\"Sin City\\", but most other attempts will seem poor pretenders. Not to belittle the critic's darling \\"American Splendor\\", but that small comic gem, quirky and unique, will truly seem like a quaint anachronism after \\"Frank Miller's Sin City\\". This movie will be as influential on future movie-making as the original \\"Star Wars\\" was in its day."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT VISUALS, WEAK PLOTTING, GOOD PERFORMANCES!","review":"The film adaptation of Frank Miller's \\"Sin City\\" graphic novel is one of the strangest film experiences ever. The visual style is unique, probably one of the first films whose images are similar to those in the books.However, the plotting is weak. The four stories that encompass the movie are too short, and when one ends, we immeadiately jump into another one. For a normal film-goer, this could make it a confusing movie.Another draw-back is that the film is just too graphic. Some of the violent images are needless, and seriously detract from the film.The acting is good, though. Bruce Willis, Clive Owen, Mickey Rourke, Rosario Dawson, Jamie King and Jessica Alba give some of their best performances to date.Overall, this is a strange-but-good film that will mostly appeal to fans of the comic book.Movie/DVD Grade: B"},{"rating":"1","title":"Double-dip coming soon","review":"Buyer beware--the director has already stated there is a expanded 'special edition' coming out in the future.

I'm sure it helped that one of the directors is a big fan of the comics and the other is the creator himself. I saw this movie at a screening last night and everyone there loved it. I didn't hear one person say anything bad about it. Even my manager, who is supposed to be staying by the phones in case anyone calls, came in to watch the movie. Normally he will watch a few minutes to see if everything is running smoothly, but he watched about half the movie. Every one should watch this movie and see what a real comic book movie should be like."},{"rating":"1","title":"Damaged","review":"The DVD arrived in shoddy packaging that did not protect it from getting squashed.

It's another highly stylized ultraviolent movie from that dynamic duo Rodriguez and Tarrantino. I've read a little Frank Miller, but was unaware of Sin City the graphic novels. From what it sounds like they took a lot of care to stay true to the original graphic novels so I guess I should really be crediting Frank Miller for the way this movie looks and feels. The stories are also quite good, though thematically typical of at least a few of graphic novels I've read. In a world where perverts can be the next president, corruption goes to the very top, love is bought and sold, and life doesn't seem to be worth very much, What does one cling to? Live for? Die for? Kill for? All in all, once you get past the bullets, blood, and dismemberment, the stories are really kind of sweet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Feels Just Like a Graphic Novel","review":"I really enjoyed watching Sin City. It is just like the Graphic Novels came to life. The special effects are wonderful.This movie surely stands out in the crowd. No other movie that I can think of has looked this way.The movie is made for the comic book crowd, and stays true to form.Some of the blood and guts got to me alittle, and I had to shut my eyes. But still a good flick."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great addition to your Blu-Ray collection!","review":"The film is great and looks awesome in HD, this goes without saying.

I just put Sin City's writer,Frank Miller, together with a film and script that I have greatly admired since the late 1990's titled Ronin. This film \\"Sin City\\" depicts the dark side of life in a lite style manner. It reminds me of taking a \\"R\\" rated movie such as Roger Rabbit to a \\"R\\"plus more violence rated status of the same genre. The special make-up work by K.N.B. EFX GROUP,INC. is excellent. I am so impressed by their work I felt compelled to make sure I give credit to the proper group of artist which created this work.

There wasn't much added in terms of extending the film, a few comical parts with Marv and longer credits, which honestly, who needs that?Special features are really nice, it's cool to see them break down parts of the movie especially the part that was specially directed by Quentin Tarantino in the car.Maybe it's because the film is mostly black and white (minus a few color accents, mainly red), but it looks really good in HD and worthy of an upgrade if you're a fan of the film or bought into the original release which was movie only with no features whatsoever."},{"rating":"2","title":"The truth within...","review":"This movie is a stunning piece of work, if it doesn't win any kind of Academy Award for at least special effects, then there's something wrong with the world.The cast is perfect with the slight exception of Alba, who while does a good job of acting, doesn't live up to Nancy in all her black and white glory, if you get what I mean. She seems slightly out of place.Bruce Willis owns this movie, Hartigan is one character who you will feel for, especially with the emotionally gut wrenching scene at the end.I don't want to give too much of the story away, but whether you're a comic freak or a moviephile, go out and see this one opening day. For once, both sides won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont get fleeced by the greedy fat cats","review":"I really wanted to get this dvd but was alarmed to see the only 'extra' on the disc is a lousy featurette, I mean these sort of discs were made 5 years ago not now. When I read about a multi-disc version coming in a few months time it just goes to show how greedy the movie studios are and they will continue to do this unlesss gullible, impatient sheep stop buying these plain discs and demand and wait for the proper full version.It wouldnt be so bad if they made a load of extras now and then released the later one with different extras and more scenes so at least you would have 2 different versions. Also does anyone know if the later discs will include extra/deleted/extended scenes? Better yet why couldnt they release just one, full, definitive version like the star wars trilogy? Just be patient guys and resist the temptation!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than it should be","review":"A comic book, by whatever name you wish to call it, is low art. But it is a true art form. To take its elements -- such as voice-over; choppy corny dialog; unevenly rendered details; and gritty, realistic, but seemingly arbitrarily arranged compositions -- and apply them to motion pictures, should be a disaster. But SIN CITY really does work. The images are dramatic, the acting intense, the plots thoughtful. The presumed-crude elements lend a throwback sense to the movie, almost as if one is back in the early silent era and the director is experimenting with the medium and struggling and stumbling to get his story told. Yet it's probably mostly state-of-the-art special effects!And the DVD looks great on a bigscreen TV! Everything's vivd. The blacks and whites, the few colors, the details, the emotions, the heroism and villainy! Violence, nudity, very adult themes: it's very deserving of the \\"R\\" rating. But for those who can stomach it, it's a must see."},{"rating":"2","title":"ONE OF MY FAVORITES OF THE YEAR!","review":"This movie gets it right on all levels.Though I've never read the comics by frank miller,I think now's good time to catch up.Visually impressive,editing is top-notch,acting I would give 100 on any scale.Just Mickey Rourkes' part alone deserves at least a 'GOLDEN GLOBE' nomination.Make sure you have plenty of popcorn around for this one people!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sin City","review":"Loved tyhe way it shot. The black and white mixed with a dash of colors added to its great plot, and helped make this movie even better than it already was."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two words - JESSICA ALBA!","review":"This movie is dark and surreal, the way I like it. Without a doubt the best thing about it though, is Jessica Alba in her leather chaps doing her stripping routine. This movie is worth buying for that alone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, please.....","review":"This sad mess reminds me of the kid in elementary school whothought stringing random obscenities together made him the BMOC.The violence wasn't offensive, just silly and impotent and without direction. I actually found the Sin City comics passable, but inferior to Miller's previous works. The film however is nothing more than pointless frames filling the gap between literal translations of panels from the books.there is no creativity or vision at work, just 126 mins of static images in motion for no reason. I see people pointing out instances of allegory and symbolism in defense of this embarassment, but these translate to little more than a desperate attempt to put tinsel on a turd. I could go on but this film has cost me $8 and two hours of my life. Learn from my poor judgement and don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 Fading Star of Hype","review":"While yes I know Sin City is based on Frank Miller's graphic novels and does indeed work hard to look like a comic book in all its noir glory. Unfortunately, a movie should do more than just look great. The throwaway dialogue and cliche self-destructive characters coupled with the non-stop over the top violence, seems to have no point, other than to overload us with bullets and blood, not to mention enough view of skin, to keep teenage boys busy for awhile. Rent it first, before shelling out money for yet another inflated movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"Perhaps the worst movie of all time. Unwatchable. My wife and I made it through about 20 minutes before we shut it off. It's classic \\"Terrantino\\" garbage - shock value and that's all."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT A WASTE OF TIME!","review":"This movie is the most disguisting pile of manure I've ever been sujected to.I gave it two stars only because Amazon policy mandates that every product reviewed receive at least 1 star,the second star is for,the all to brief appearence of,the beautiful and exciting Rosario Dawson."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie is no Pulp Fiction","review":"This movie was a big disappointment for me. It kind of just dragged on. I didn't get bored with the movie, but I was excited watching it either. It had a touch of Quentin to the movie, but not near as good as Quentin does it. Its almost like a weird bad version of Pulp Fiction. Except Pulp blows this movie out of the water. The only thing I enjoyed about this movie was Elijah Woods. His part was super groovy. But thats it. I would suggest renting this movie before you buy it. All the people I've talked to did not like the movie, but there are a lot of reviews on this site that do like the movie. I guess its just a acquired taste. I'll stick with Quentin as opposed to Robert. Never been a big fan of his except Desperado. And bewarned, this movie has a lot of sexuality in it. If you don't like a lot of senseless nudity, you won't like this flick. That alone will keep me from ever watching this movie again.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting concept used for mindless violence","review":"Once you get used to the style, which is great without question, you realize how boring this movie really is. That's except if you love guns, bar fights, hookers, swords, drugs, horror, dead people and every possible combination of these. I guess lot of folks do like to see this sort of stuff, hence the amazing 8.4 average rating on IMDB, amazing to me that is.Anyway, the one thing I liked about the movie is Mickey Rourke's acting, he just outcooled everybody. Benicio Del Toro was pretty good too. Token appearances by Michael Madsen, Rutger Hauer and others. Can't say anything about Jessica Alba, she didn't really have a part in the movie until the end, and by that I just wanted it to be over."},{"rating":"1","title":"not so good","review":"I found this movie generally annoying. It was shot beautifully, the sets are really cool and comic book-like, and special effects were not bad. However, the story was very cliche and I really didn't care for any of the characters. I felt like it went on for hours and hours and nothing really happened. However, the one big plus for lovers of the female body is that there was no shortage of scantily clad hot-bodied women, and, of course, Jessical Alba in chaps."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Perfect Film","review":"Utterly flawless. Like modern day shakespere but with guns. Truly a treat. Buy it today!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"gory shock value sex nudity naked women murdered or tortured","review":"Let me be straights, I liked \\"pulp fiction\\" it had a story to it.But, Sin City was nothing but gratuitous violence, bodies cut up, people tortured for no reason other than psychos wanted to. Beautiful sexy women turned on by blood and gore. Sex, rape, murder, torture, cannibalism all glorified like these are the best ideas a person can have to make their life more meaningful.It should have been rated X, and the commercial should let you know how much nudity, blood, gore, sex, and violence is in the movie, instead of showing it as if it were artsy and clever.There is no story, or very little story. If it weren't for the constant violence the movie would be nothing but black and white boring depressive scenes. You feel no sympathy for any of the main characters through they certainly tried to make you feel sorry for them by beating them half to death."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best movie of the Year?","review":"It just might be. Sin City's visual flair is what sets it apart from other action films. It is dark and gritty, and it should be, definitely because it based on the graphic novel of the same name. Sin City also boasts a superb cast, and with Frank Miller at the helm, this new film should be the epitome of excitement!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful waste of time and energy","review":"Sin City is, perhaps, one of the worst films of the year. I was amazed to discover that others found the so-called \\"story lines\\" compelling, for I was left utterly disinterested. In fact, I barely made it through the movie with my sanity intact. I am less amazed at those who found it to be visually compelling. But the visual interest is quite buried beneath a wealth of pointless violence and a truly horrendous script. I would give it zero stars if it were allowable!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Movie I've Ever Seen!","review":"I have to be honest and say I've never seen the comic that this film is based on. So, I probably wouldn't be interested in seeing the comic for this. But I have to say that this is absolutlely, the most stupid, pathetic, movie I've ever seen. If I could rate it with 0 stars, I would. After about 5-10 minutes, I completely lost interest. For the first time in my life of watching movies, I felt like getting up and walking out. However, I didn't as I was with a friend. Partway through the movie, my friend told me she didn't care for the movie either and we both said that we couldn't wait for it to end. Afterwards, my friend and I talked about how horrible the movie was. Other people in the theatre also mentioned their displeasure with the movie. I felt like I completely wasted $6.00, and if it were possible to get it, I would want a refund. Don't bother wasting your time to see this movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Possibly The Worst Movie I've Ever Seen","review":"Despite the all-star cast, Quentin Tarintino's guest directing, and attempt to make the movie \\"artistic\\" and stylish, it was unbelievably horrible.This is a movie with a plot (if that's what you want to call it) that was based AROUND the violence. Basically, it's just that--a movie about violence. Everyone's a killer and they all enjoy being killers. Not five minutes go by (literally) without chopped off limbs flying, eyeballs popping, blood squirting, heads rolling...you get the picture.I've never been one to shy away from a film that shows violence and gore, but when that's all there is to the movie it gets boring real fast. The only good thing I can say about it is I liked the crime novel style of dialogue. But really that's about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of time!!!","review":"I can't believe that this film is rated so highly. There were three types of males in this movie: Bad guy, bad cop, and good cop with a bad attitude. There were four types of females in this movie: Hooker, dike, stripper, and whore.What kind of a freak could like a movie like this? Once again, Tarrantino is overrated because of his shock techniques, and not because of any viable talent. When I realized that there was no plot to this film, I looked for art. No art was visible. Basically, this film is a freakshow that freaks will enjoy...GAG!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disturbing","review":"I got the dvd as a gift and with all of these teen movie actors in the film (Josh Hartnett, Elijah Wood, Brittany Murphy, Alexis Bledel, etc.), I was expecting something completely different. I was expecting something light-hearted and silly, but Sin City is one of the most disturbing movies I have ever seen. There are some amazing visuals, but they're so shocking and brutal. Lots of nudity, blood, gore, violence. It was too much for me.I guess the storylines are interesting and there's lots of interlacing and they tie together near the end. Some of the storylines are somewhat trite and not that intriguingIf you're really into visual violence and fantasy, this is a good movie. But definitely don't watch it if you're under 17 or if you can't stand the sight of blood."},{"rating":"1","title":"Got ripped off!!! On demand does NOT load","review":"Had to watch film for school project so I rented it for 24 hours. Have spent over two hours trying to load but all circuits have been busy. Tried to contact customer service but can't find a phone number anywhere. This is my first and last experience with on-demand video viewing through Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love SIN City","review":"I saw the movie at theaters and I love it just as much on Blu-ray. I love the extended footage as well. A great purchase for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over the top, too taratino-ish for me.","review":"Movie is a little annoying, and is overkill as far the violence is concerned, pretty graphic, Rosario dawson is super hot, other than that, there is no incentive to watch, I felt like I was being dragged to through another Quentin Taratino-ish flick."},{"rating":"2","title":"action, beauty, best cast and crew","review":"this movie is totaly grate, special fx, script, adaptation, the edition of the storys keep the atention of all public.if you like action movies, this is one of the best.Robert Rodriguez and Tarantino, this names says all."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Sin City\\" is brilliant and beautiful looking!","review":"\\"Sin City\\" is brilliant and beautiful looking! The all-star cast headlined by Bruce Willis, Clive Owen, Mickey Rourke, and Jessica Alba, are impressive. The directing by Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller and special guest director Quentin Tarantino is brilliant. The visuals are astounding and brilliant. The music by Rodriguez, John Debney, and Graeme Revell, is impressive. This is a film that is different and unique from all other movies. It has a sight \\"Pulp Fiction\\" feel to it. This is one of the best pictures of the year!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I wouldn't buy it if I were you...","review":"Don't get me wrong, I really like this movie. While there isn't a great plot, it's so stylish and beautifuly done it's hard not to enjoy. But, in what is quickly becoming a tradition in Hollywood, the studio plans on releasing this and then a two-disc special edition several months later. Talk about greed! If I were you, I'd wait. If you really love the movie, why not rent it or watch it On Demand in the meantime?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Minor corrections","review":"For anyone who is interested in reading the graphic novels of this movie after watching it, which I highly recommend, the three books are \\"Sin City\\", \\"The Big, Fat Kill\\" and \\"That Yellow Bastard\\". As a fan who has read all three of those stories many, many times, I simply felt that the proper titles should have been given, since the editorial review, and another review mixed up the titles. Marv was in \\"Sin City\\", Hartigan was in \\"That Yellow Bastard\\" and Dwight was from \\"The Big, Fat Kill\\". Unfortunately, this was not a direct translation, and as always, the books are far better. I look forward to the director's cut to see if some of my favorite lines that were absent make it in. At which point the movie will reach five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Comic Book adaptaion to date!","review":"This movie was directly adapted from the graphic novels of Frank Miller. The movie story-boards consisted of the.... graphic novels... the dialogue was written by... Frank Miller's words directly out of the graphic novels. Artistically, this movie felt like a graphic novel. Filmed in Black and White with a splash of color here or there to accent specific elements.Movies like Spider Man and X-Men are very good movies... but do not hold true the comic world. This movie does and it looks and sounds great with a great cast. This movie is definitely going to be a must have for me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything You'd Expect","review":"If you don't like violence, scantly clad women or graphic comics in general, then this is probably not the movie for you. But the fact is, this film (based on Frank Miller's graphic comics) and its directors (Rodriguez, Tarantino and Miller himself) should be commended. Shot entirely behind green screen technology this film does, in many ways, what the Matrix did by redefining movie-making and what we will see on the big-screen in the future. Simply stated, this movie is an unapologetic feast for the eyes; everything you'd expect from a movie titled \\"Sin City.\\" But because of the recent split within Miramax the \\"Special Edition\\" version of Sin City won't be out until next year some time, but if you're a fan or could care less about the extra features (for now), then jump right on in, the water is fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good cinematics. Degenerate story.","review":"This movie exhibited interesting cinematic creativity. This visual interest is as far as the movie's value extends unfortunately.There is no redeeming value to the storyline. This movie revels in perversion, sadism, and immorality. This is yet another movie in these troubled times that only adds to the fire and will further twist people's minds.Let's support good, wholesome, uplifting movies and art! When we focus on these things, then people's thoughts will be on these things. Inline attitudes, thoughts, and behaviors then result.Let's not wallow in this filth."},{"rating":"1","title":"All about style and special effects. But where was the story?","review":"The film is all about style. It is a comic book brought to life.At first I was intrigued. The characters are larger than life and the plot is about the hero trying to find the killer of a woman with whom he spent one romantic night.The film is shot in black and white and uses color to make its point. Blood is always red. And so is lipstick. Eyes are green or blue. And there really is a yellow bastard. The acting is good too and the sets complement the film.However, Sin City lacked one important thing - a story I could get my teeth into. The special effects and style overshadowed everything. And I was left wondering what all this was about. I watched this film for over an hour, hoping that it would make some sense. Finally I fell asleep.Perhaps this film would be interesting to film students. It certainly is a departure from the norm. But I need more than experimental techniques to hold my interest. I need a good story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stingy studio-double-dipping","review":"You already know that this is going to be the first of about 3 dvd's released for this film. With virtually no special features, the only one of which is a behind-the-scenes featurette which was available for FREE at Best Buy, this is the studio at it's greed point. You know there will be a super-ultimate-limited-for-the-fans-only 10 disc set coming just in time to piss you off because you've already spent money on this craptacular bare-bones disc.Count me out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review of the DVD...","review":"When a studio releases a quickie bare bones disc then a special extended edition later it's called \\"double dipping\\". They expect Sin City fans to shell out once then when the cool edition comes out to shell out again.This practice is becoming increasingly uncool. Tell them you aint gonna play by passing on this disc and picking up the special edition when it comes out later this year.What can you expect on the special edition? Well, if it's anything like the two \\"Hellboy\\" releases, everything that's on this plus a little bit more.Worth the wait? Up to you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awsome Movie - Pre-Announed Double Dip DVD","review":"This is a Great Movie, but the director announced months ago that this movie will be a double dip.

If I want to use my brain, I see The Usual Suspects.When I want to be visually stimulated I reach for my Sin City dvd. It's amazing. Everytime I watch it, I hear or see something new.The plots in all three stories are very simple, maybe even thin. But it's not the story that's the masterpiece here, it's the way the story is told.Ofcourse it's violent, we are talking about Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino afterall, but it delivers. Totally.Buy this dvd, it will continue to entertain you for years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Visually great, but the story not the best.","review":"This was visually one of the best films I've seen in years. This is definitely a different kind of film and I'm sure we will see many copy cats in the next few years. But the stories were not that great. This special disk takes the stories and sets them apart which makes it easier to follow. But if this story was told in a different way (the way all movies are filmed) I think most people wouldn't like this movie. It wasn't the best story wise, but it's great visually. I would suggest renting it first if you haven't seen it, and then decide. I give the movie 2 1/2 stars, and the special edition disk four stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"A violent, thrilling, stylistic thrill ride","review":"The movie took place in Sin City, a city so corrupt and violent that a large section of the city was abandoned by the police and was protected by scantily clad hookers. It was film noir at its finest. The movie consisted of several loosely connected vignettes. The heros were the following: an old, tough, but straight cop; an extremely ugly and extremely tough ex-con, with his own moral code; and a murderer on the lam, he had plastic surgery, but his sense of public duty led him into trouble. The villians were extremely evil and powerful, but there was a cosmic justice in this world, and the bad guys got a type of justice. The movie was extremely violent, but its surreal nature and its graphic novel type character buffered the viewer.The movie was a unique and fun experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product, tardy delivery","review":"There are no problems with the DVD (it rocks).I just had to wait a fair while to get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"uh...dud","review":"goods: stylebads: everything elsethe eye candy-look wears off when the first sentence is uttered.overall: no thanks"},{"rating":"1","title":"Can I get a refund?","review":"How can anybody take a star-filled line-up and produce a clunker like this one? Fantasy films, shot in black and white, with a splash of color for effect, went out of fashion before they ever could be fashionable. I'm a Bruce Willis fan to the nth degree, but this loser almost replaces \\"Hudson Hawk\\" as the worst film he has ever taken a part in. I thought I had seen all of his movies and was surprised to have discovered this movie. Now I wish I hadn't. I'm not sure if I even want to add this to my Willis collection of DVDs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could I Give This Zero Stars?","review":"This was copiously awful movie; one of worst I've ever seen.

Truly bad!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring & uninteresting","review":"First time in my life I walked out of a movie! Boring, dull, uninteresting! If I had not paid $1 to see it, I would have been angry. I wasn't the only one that left early. Even if free, it's not worth watching."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Complicated","review":"This movie certainly has an allstar cast but I think the movie itself was too complicated. You have story segments here and there so if you watch this movie while doing something it is difficult to follow.

I was fooled in to thinking that this was a great movie. I watched about ten minutes and just left. What I didn't like was just the bad acting and the long drawn out boreing begining. I can get over the cartoonish style as I loved 300 but this was just a horrible movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"nauseous","review":"A star is far too much for this pathetic movie.I wanted to leave after 5 minutes and then i hoped it would finish( it never did).It was like a butcher's stall; this movie is just about people cutting each other apart. Violence is omnipresent and valorised.The roles are stereotyped: all women are whores in sex-gear, and all men are brutal, pitiless drug-addicts that spend their time killing each other. It's not realistic: Dwight jumped from a building and didn't get hurt.There is no point because the movie is just a massacre so it's not entertaining or interesting.This movie is only a waste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is like the worst thing I've ever seen","review":"Well, I'm sitting in the theater waiting for this to start and thinking about how great that last movie I saw was. It was The Pacifier btw and it rocked unlike this carp. Well, this thing starts and immediately something is wrong. I yell to the guy and tell him to turn up the color or something but he says that's how the movie is. WTFzzors? I just saw The Pacifier which was awesome in color and now I have to watch this carp trying to be a relic from the 1950s? If I wanted to watch a boring movie with bad dialogue in black and white, I'd rent Citizen Kane or Seven Samurai. I come to the movies to be entertained not to watch boring talk with no color. Pass this carp up. Go see The Pacifier with Vin Diesel instead. He's a much better actor than anyone in this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"The longest peice of trash not to see","review":"The only reason i gave it 1 star was because of the visual vibrance of color. This movie is complete trash, it had no story whatsoever. It was too long and too boring. This movie is more for the guys because there is so much female nudity, i as a female, do not care if a film has nudity, but this film as unneccisary nudity. The lack of a plot really made this movie make me want to leave the theater, i could not wait until it was over. it is very comic book style, because the action, and blood bath scenes look so fake and ridiculous. Certain actors like Elijah Wood, do not fit the role they were cast in. in all, the acting, no plot and no story, and the unneccisary nudity makes this film an utter piece of mindless trash."},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting concept come to life.","review":"This movie is too incredible to describe, to vivid to even detail, the feel of a graphic novel come to life. Robbie Rodriguez, Frank Miller, and Quentin Tarrantino have created another \\"Pulp Fiction\\", and broke the mold with some actors.For how is one to take a loving sweet hobbit, who is.... cannibalistic ninja. Elijah Woods is super twisted in this movie.The women were as strong as the men, and the men as evil as cold black hell. There were no heroes, there were no villains, it was a group of people who had their agendas.Why not five stars? Because Michael Madsen, and Bruce Willis were dialing in their performances. Mikey Rourke? Rutger Hauer? WELL DONE!As to the femme fatales? Oh My!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Widescreen Only, HA","review":"I am so proud of Robert Rodriguez and Quinten Tarnitino for making sure their movies get widescreen only releases. They want everyone to see the movie the way it was supposed to be seen and not this garbage full screen versions that exist. Other than that, this movie is fantastic and everything a comic book movie should be. You say it is too gory? It is rated R for a reason and if you were to read the comics, they are exactly the same way. Fantastic movie, and if you don't get it because it is widescreen...you are a fool and uneducated about movies. Widescreen should be the only format and everyone else should cry themselves to sleep."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ciudad del pecado","review":"the only thing a said about this movie is simply \\"amazing\\", with 3 excellent directors, Frank Miller, Roberto Rodriguez and a small participation from tarantino, go buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked 2/3 of it...","review":"The Bruce Willis section didn't do anything for me.

This DVD gets a 0. Why? It is the typical bare bones release of a great movie. People will buy it, but will soon realize that the DVD is horrid and has no special features at all. Then a few months later another one will be released. Typical hollywood and thier double dipping. Do not buy this version. Wait untill the special edition. You know it is coming.Hope everyone reads this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great film, one of the best dvd packages around.","review":"If you love this film you have to get this special edition.Robert Rodriguez has put together an massive collection of making of's and commentaries and the stories separated into their own short films. I REALLY LIKED THE CINEMA AUDIENCE COMMENTARY TRACK DESPITE WHAT ANYONE SAYS, (Hearing an audience cheer when Marv kills someone aint something you hear in UK cinemas!). Of course Rodriguez' and Frank Miller's commentary track is the most revealing, and the long take, is a great insight into filmmaking as you see Quentin Tarantino direct a scene in real time.One of the most impressive Dvd packages I've seen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Adaptation","review":"This film is simply the best adaptation of a graphic novel in existence. The \\"cool\\" visuals and over-the-top action sequences are complemented by classic noir themes and (especially during the \\"That Yellow Bastard\\" segment) subtle and intelligent symbolism. The characters are processed and amped-up representations of their film noir archetypes, and the actors play their parts perfectly. Mickey Rourke's performance is undoubtedly the highlight, much to my surprise. The DVD is lacking in aspects such as special features, and I had trouble playing it in a certain DVD player of mine, but that might have been the fault of the (rather old) player. It worked fine in all other players I've tried, so this shouldn't be a deterrent from buying it. This is a great film and well worth owning for repeated viewings. Due to the violence subject matter, it won't be for everyone, though. Keep the kids away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Has recut and theatrical versions","review":"\\"Sin City\\" is now on Blu-ray on two discs. One disc has the \\"Recut\\" version which adds about 6 minutes of story content, and also presents each story as a separate feature. There's not a big difference between this and the theatrical version. I think the theatrical version flows nicer, because it blends the stories together, so I recommend that for a first viewing. I enjoyed watching the \\"recut\\" version as a second viewing, because it's changed just enough to keep it feeling fresh, like listening to a favorite CD on shuffle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Frank Miller Fan","review":"This is an amazing two-disc release. Director Robert Rodriguez brilliantly brings to life Frank Miller's graphic novels, and does not hold back with the development of these gritty characters. Mickey Rourke alone deserves 5 stars for his portrayal of Marv. This set is worth having strictly on the merits of the development of that character. For anyone who has a love for the making of films and the time consuming processes involved in the \\"behind the scenes\\", the bonus disc will satisfy your appreciation for the multifaceted areas of story telling. Let's hope that when Frank Miller's \\"300\\" is released to DVD, that the extras will be just as enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very artistic, very graphic","review":"Frank Miller's graphic novel is truly graphic in every sense of the word.

The characters are all, well, comic book cutouts and some are supposed to be \\"protagonists\\" and some \\"antagonists\\" (there are no good guys or bad guys, they are all bad), but you really don't care what happens to any of them. This movie was one of the rare occasions when I almost walked out in the middle..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Movie","review":"Without a doubt one of the all time WORST movies ever made. There is nothing at all positive to say about this film. Between the terrible plot, horrible acting by EVERYONE and the most difficult move to watch because of the bizzare filming style I want to give it a negative rating, but they do not allow this. Not even worth buying to use as a frisbe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could barely sit through the theatrical release...","review":"Ranks high on my list as one of the top worst movies of all-time. An incredible cast in a swampish, dark and disturbing movie. This is clearly a movie made for fans of the graphic novel and not a film for 98% of the rest of the world.Between a scene of a person having their head dunked into a toilet full of stool and the storyline of a young girl that avoids molestation only to fall in love with the old man that saves her...there's just not a lot to like here.You've been warned!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away from this movie!","review":"This movie was a major dissapointment. It's in black and white except for the color red and yellow.

If you could take the graphic novel into the theater with you, you could read along. There are shots straight out of the book on the screen.It helps to be a fan of Frank Miller's work when you go see this movie. The movie has some great scenes and dialogue. Marv steals the movie, IMHO. Most of the movie is in black and white (as the comic). This is a beautiful movie to watch. It has a little Pulp Fiction feel to it as the stories intertwine (also, Bruce Willis is in the movie).The stories in the movie are all very gritty, violent and dark, mostly about people driven by revenge. A woman killed, a cop set up and jailed...not very hard to follow but made interesting by the way they tie together. All the acting here is well done and Frank Miller makes a cameo as a preist. Miller was given co-director credits and the way the movie mirrors the graphic novels, almost shot for shot, he deserves it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bleh!!!","review":"This movie has style. Tons of it.It also got some great actors and some well written dialogue.But I did not like it at all.This is a summary of the plot (WARNING: spoilers ahead): In Sin City ugly villains torture young and scantily clad women in very sadistic and degrading ways. And then old and ugly heroes save or avenge these women in very sadistic and degrading ways.In the end I could not bear to see another ugly old man sacrifice himself for another young and \\"helpless\\" woman. Boring, stupid and sexist!!!If you like stylish visuals, extreme violence, good dialogue and acting - buy Kill Bill. It's much more fun, somewhat less sexist and got a mean Darryl Hannah with an eyepatch!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did Not Like It...","review":"I've been a Frank Miller fan since I read \\"Batman: The Dark Knight Returns\\" for a composition seminar at UCLA, so I imagine I was expecting a lot from this film. I was truly disappointed, finding the characters one-dimensional, uninteresting, and completely disagreeable. Add to that a script which did not go anywhere, along with terrible dialogue, and you have that unique sort of creature: the completely myopic, pedestrian action thriller which puts you to sleep.Forget it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ain't all that.","review":"If you're into black and white comic strip stuff with gruesomeness and cute techy show-offs, this one's for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I ordered","review":"I purchaced this item thinking I was going to get a Blu-Ray because thats is what it said but instead i got two DVDs I did not want."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"I will put this plain and simple.

My biggest amazement was, that high quality actors would want to be associated with."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Movie Sucks Donkeys","review":"Seriously, this movie sucks so bad, there should be some kind of reverse Academy Award for it. I don't understand why Bruce Willis agreed to be in this steamy turd of a movie, because he is a good actor and he's been in some really good movies. But this movie is dumb, and it's so violent that it's ridiculous. And the directors seem to be unable to decide if they want to make a live action movie, or an animated movie, so what you get is a weird combination of both. It was ridiculous how the characters in the movie were so hard to kill, especially Marv (Mickey Rourke). And the movie had cannibalism in it, and people being hacked up with saws. And Nick Stahl's character had his sex organs shot off, then surgically replaced, then ripped off again. And Nick Stahl had become this ridiculous-looking yellow man with a round, bald head and yellow skin. It was so stupid!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rosario's Dawson sucked big time in this one.","review":"I have never seen an actor so in over her head.

I have to admit that the creation of the comic book atmosphere is well done, and the acting isn't bad within the requirements of the plot. What turned me off was the over-the-top non-stop sadistic violence, and the total lack of any character that one could empathise with. The film works startlingly well at creating its sick dirty world. It just isn't a world that I think any mentally healthy person would want to spend time in.PS Judging by the percentage of people rating this review as unhelpful, I guess only fans of the film are reading this review! Well, it's your mind..."},{"rating":"1","title":"The first film I ever walked out of","review":"Okay, so I have to be honest. Maybe I can't really review this film.I have sat through a lot of bad films and I usually make a point of not walking out but this is the first film I ever walked out on. I do not object to the violence. What bothered me about this film is that when characters basically cannot be injured by weapons, I don't care what happens anymore. I like films where the appearance of a weapon makes me tense. In this film characters can get shot repeatedly without being killed, so the appearance of a gun no longer becomes thrilling.My point is that, ironically, the excessive violence of this film made it one of the most boring films that I've ever watched."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gross and dull...","review":"which makes this one of the worst movies I have had the misfortune of viewing. Who cares if the visuals are stunning--there is barely a plot and the characters are repulsive. You just don't care about them *at all*. I couldn't even finish it. If you want stunning visuals get Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow. OK, so it isn't blessed with a great plot, but who cares--it's beautiful to look at and has way more charm. And unlike Sin City you won't get nauseated watching it."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME","review":"This is one of the best movies I've seen since Kill Bill.It's funny,violent,interesting, and all around fabulous.SEE IT NOW!"},{"rating":"2","title":"kill kill kill","review":"If you like violence, you may be a little bit disappointed like myself. The movie is not really violent becasue most of the killing are done by the good guys. There is no comparsion to the real violence in the HBO Spawn TV series. Beside all the killing and sex and stuff like that, the movie is full of motion. Things move in this movie. They don't stand still by the dialogs. They really make a comic book alife. This puts Stan Lee's The Hulk to shame. Well... he tried.They have a wonderful casts. I was WOW by the number of familiar faces in this movie. The reason for me to go see this movie is Jessica Alba and Bruce Willis. Jessica Alba really can dance and she is very sexy in the movie.The only thing that is not that good in this movie is that about 3/4, the movie is getting a little bit boring. After that, it gets back to action. And the most terrible thing is that they only give Jessica Alba very short screen time. They should show her dance longer, and give her more dialogs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute TRASH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Sin City is an empty, hollow, incoherent, poorly edited, pathological piece of snuff porn; it tries to gloss over this with lots of beautiful camera work, but it's just like putting a silk dress on a rotting corpse. Each of this movie's stories are so morally childish they seem as if they were written by sixth-graders. None of them are truly coherent, nor do they make any real sense; there is an almost total lack of real human emotions, motivations, etc., that would explain the Road Runner-like violence. The acting is so hammy and heavy-handed that even if it were intended as a satire on the whole film-noir shtick, it still fails miserably. The horrendously bad dialogue would have been funny if it wasn't for the film's violence, which, by itself, speaks volumes about its creators as well as the people who praise this stinking piece of trash. Great stuff, if you think like Lynndie England."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rip-off! Thanks a lot, Miramax!","review":"This review refers to the earlier single-disc edition that was released back in August. As much as I am lauding the special edition that is released a mere few months later, I abhorred the way Disney/Miramax treat their clients and customers with such contempt. Do they hate the consumers so much that they expect all of us to double dip each of their title that is released?

As a previous reviewer stated, the exercises really work. Therefore, I must warn any casual dabblers out there - this is not a game!

It diverges greatly from the principal teachings of this system, most notably the Sepher ha-Gilgulim and the Sepher ha-Bahir. It has taken some of the ideas introduced by the Golden Dawn, a system which, I might add, does take proper responsibility for the material it is propagating, and mutates it into something convenient and simple. The Qabala is about disciplined study, not dime-a-dozen charlatanry"},{"rating":"2","title":"I Want To Play In The Monkey House...","review":"Being a fan from the start, I totally admire The Dandy Warhols for making their own music in good taste that all mankind couldn't get enough of. Bought this album today (in the Netherlands, that is) and they keep amazing me. Each album is slightly different, and they are willing to try to stretch their talents just slightly over the edge of regular pop/rock. They are really refreshing (again), hip and this album is going to accompany me for the next period wherever I go... Dandy Warhols Rule O.K.!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dandy Warhols-Welcome to the Monkey House CD","review":"Great CD from 5-6 years ago.

So I took a chance and decided to buy the new album instead of 13 Tales From Urban Bohemia. BAD choice. \\"Welcome to the Monkeyhouse\\" sounds like the Warhols were forced back to the 80's and aren't very happy about it. The sound here isn't trippy, it's just narcotizing. It pretty much put me to sleep behind the wheel. The CD captured all of the annoying synth sounds of the era and none of the power. As one reviewer noted, if I had wanted to listen to some new wave, I would have bought the real thing, not a tired tribute.Some reviewers seem to think this CD has merit becuase it's \\"experimental\\"-- well, that's fine, but I wish the experiment came with a cash back guarantee."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's Alright in the Monkey House","review":"These guys have the corner on strange listen to me if you are curious music that most of the time makes you wonder if it makes sense, or if you are really entertained.

I bought Urban Bohemia and could not stop listening to it for months, then bought Monkey House and that one is still on repeat in the player. I see no relation to \\"lame 80's music\\" and especially not Duran Duran whatsoever- they use keyboards, but in a completely original way that they make their own. This album makes me extremely happy and I am glad to have discovered the Dandies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Newly Addicting","review":"Before early this year, I had never even heard of the Dandy Warhols. That is, it wasn't until my Psychology professor played \\"We Used To Be Friends\\" on the first day of class and I immediately fell in love. It was just catchy and innovative. I ran out and bought \\"Welcome to the Monkey House\\" right after class and it never left my CD player for almost 2 weeks!This band is unlike anything I have ever heard before, and I am a HUGE music fan. I don't know how this band ever stayed out of my listening range for so long, but I'm glad I've discovered them. Every song on this CD is unique and amazing, and that seems to be kind of a difficult thing to accomplish for some musicians, but the Dandy Warhols have achieved it with flying colors! They have quickly became my favorite band, hands down. As far as I'm concerned, there's a song on this album for everybody.

At first listen to this album, I thought maybe Monkey House was a little \\"too\\" catchy but after a couple of more listens, I smartened up quite a bit. This is quite the album that is truly enjoyable to listen to from beginning to end. I found myself just wanting to listen to the songs without constantly advancing to the addicting \\"The Last High\\" or other highlights such as \\"Scientist\\", \\"We Used To Be Friends\\" and \\"Rock Bottom\\". This album is sonically meaty, with much to sink your teeth into and savor. Give your ears an especially euphoric and funky treat you'll find yourself going back to again and again....pick this CD up immediately!"},{"rating":"2","title":"got me on the second listen","review":"This is a really great and different album for the band. However if you listen, they still sound like themselves. The songs have a more electronic production but the upbeat pop, slow build ups and other dandy trademarks are all here. Don't take the first single as an indication of what the whole album sounds like. Highlights are Plan A, I am a Scientist, Insincere Because I, Heavenly and You were the last high. This album still rocks like there other albums. The only downfalls being The Dope (wonderfull you), courtney taylor-taylors falsetto. Why wasn't this album named after track 7!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just buy it...","review":"Just an amazing song set... on par with 13 Tales.

The naysayer's just don't get it; which basically is exactly the point.There is a downside to the CD, it'll be year-round in the rotation, eventually meld itself into my player, into my brain, into my social nomenclature and qualify as audio addiction.Over the top...

Other than one or two songs that I like, 'Welcome to the Monkey House' seems to combine futuristic-type beats alongside guitars, perhaps a sign of a band wanting to experiment a bit (and perhaps a sign of the recent electroclash trend) Personally I like the Dandy's which played high-energy rock and with swagger.

This album is unlike their others, but is that, in itself, a good thing? Some people seem to want to give them points for \\"doing it differently\\", as if that in itself were of value. Well, to this listener, the only thing that matters is whether it actually sounds good sonically and lyrically, and whether it actually moves me at all. To me, all three questions are answered with a resounding \\"No\\". This recording does nothing for me except make me turn away from this band, and perhaps wax nostalgic for the time when they constructed and played music that really made me feel something, songs like Genius or Morpheus or Big Indian. Am I living in the past?Perhaps I can't see the greatness of this record, in the way that I can't seem to ever get into the majority of Radioheads' music? I guess I just don't \\"get it\\".

That album was so good, it played through incredibley with great instramental music, and each song worked into the next, something i haven't been able to appreciate since Pink Floyd. They took everything i loved about them and fed it to a really fat women along with a couple angry crabs, gasoline, a live blender, and out she [vomited] this.

Gone is the country-rock, gone are those classy hooks and stoner-like grooves - now the Dandies have brought Duran Duran and other 80's like sensibilities to their world.When this CD is good - it is brilliant. \\"We Used to Be Friends\\" is 80's throwaway pop at its best. But when the CD - it is just plain boring.

The album is great from start to finish, those who take the time to give it a chance will agree.

Allthough this album has some cool songs like \\"Last High\\", \\"We used to be friends\\" and \\"Plan A\\"(produced by Duran Duran), the rest is not bad, not good. If you expect this album to be like Thirteen tales, you'll be disappointed.

This is a challenging book, make no mistake. I've taken a long time to complete it.

I have no problem with it. I would, just as quickly, take up a similar discussion of the Craft from a Judaic or Islamic (or even Buddhist or Hindu) point of view, because one cannot fully understand a concept until one looks at it from many different angles.\\"The Meaning of Masonry\\" is just but a small footstep into a larger world.

It did keep her attention a good bit the first day but, since then, she shows only occasional interest in the ball. I guess I'm not clear on how the treat-dispensing component of this ball works--or perhaps you have to use Kong brand treats.

On shore, a man and a woman acting as shore patrol steal a bit of touchy-feely (can't have a man and woman together without sexual tension, right?) and then terror strikes.Off in the English Isles, a man with a deep, dark past is teaching others how to kill . . .It doesn't take long - perhaps a half-dozen pages - to realize that you've read all of this before in other novels.The characters are not only paper-thin, but retreads as well.

He mentioned that he reconstructed the last few months of FDR's actual life to see how an assassination attempt might have fit in fictionally. It sounded like the focus of the book was FDR's last days, with an assassination plot woven in. Just the kind of historical fiction I'd be interested in.However, I've read over 60 pages and am giving it up. FDR has barely been mentioned. The dialogue and description have a modern flavor, rather than putting you back in the 1940's. There are none of the details of everyday life one would expect in historical fiction. The guns described in an early chapter almost have more personality than the human characters.It is what it is, probably a good thriller if that's what you're into.

Although it hits all the usual highlights, this book rises above the Time-Life standard, sinking neither into sentimentality nor into thoughtless platitudes. I would recommend this book to people who are building image collections. Additionally (and I mean this in the best possible sense), this is the kind of book that should be in doctors' waiting rooms: it can be read in fits and spurts, and is a smart picture book.

Also known poor Epson support.Now if you print from desktop, the Epson driver will still somewhat crop your picture, even after you crop to 6x4 in Photoshop or something like that. That's because the printer driver increases the size of the print to allow for sloppy alignment and the edges of the photo are oversprayed (printed off the edge of the paper) when borderless is selected.If this is a problem for you, there is a work around.

I would have liked a LCD screen, and I feel it needs a few more editing capabilities while standalone. While I wish it could be battery, or electrically operated, I won't hold those things against it.I set mine up to print pictures I needed quickly that had been loaded to my computer, and deleted from my cards. The lil workhorse printed them all beautifully. I love it.I then printed a couple more just to see how well it printed. When my husband saw them, he stated, oh these were not taken by your digital. I said oh yes they were.If it had a few more editing capabilites, and the screen it would be perfect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mac users beware!!","review":"This printer does not interface properly with iPhoto. Won't print borderless photos. Printer also resizes photos so the picture you print isn't the one you see on screen. Also, getting nowhere near 100 photos per ink cartridge. VERY poor customer service. They blame the computer, the software, the camera, even the person who took the pictures but they refuse to acknowledge that their product may be flawed. Very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Immediate malfunction","review":"I tried my Picturemate for the first time last night and it malfunctioned almost immediately. It claims that it has a paper jam, but it doesn't. I've tried pushing \\"OK\\" to clear it as suggested, but this does nothing. It still insists it's jammmed and refuses to operate. I've tried the suggested \\"troubleshooting\\" to no avail, so I'm now on hold for an estimated sixteen minutes with the Epson support center. All of this hassle for a brand new fussy appliance makes me wish I'd gone with another brand. The few pictures I got out of it looked very good, but the macine took a few minutes to print each one, so even when it's working, the machine is still flawed. I would strongly suggest another brand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Printer!","review":"I've owned my Picture Mate for about a year now. I couldn't be happier with it.

It has taken me a little time to learn my way around the software that came with the machine but it seems to be doing the job. The main reason I didn't give it 5 stars is it seems to print a slight bit crooked if the paper isn't in there perfectly every time. Yet it isn't enough to ruin a print either.... and the software does take a little time to learn and I wish there would of been a booklet with some quick info in it on how to use the software to its max.

I got one about a year ago and it was silent and clean running (warm 'though). But about 2 months ago a HUM appeared and remained no matter what I did, including disconnecting EVERYTHING except one speaker and trying every other outlet in the house and turning off everything else in the house. Everything. I sent the unit back for repair and four weeks later it came back from the factory. The HUM was still there, as loud as ever, maybe louder. I'm going to have to take it back again and probably exchange it for something else. It's unusable as is. I've researched the blogs [...] and apparently (although I didn't know it before I bought the SR705) this HUM problem has shown up on units more than a few months old. What's wierd is, the factory 'fix' didn't fix it at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Onkyo TX-SR705","review":"This a great reciever.

After extensive research, i decided to throw caution to the wind in terms of heat gerneration and the idea that this model was being discontinued. I took a chance on the 705. It arrived Wednesday and all I can say is WOW. What a difference. I have connected a PS3 and a uverse decoder with the output run to a 56\\" Panasonic HDTV. I am using HDMI cables throughout. I have it set up in a 5.1 configuration for now but will soon be adding the additional speakers to achieve the 7.1 experience.

There is a quick setup guide that runs you through the basics. Mine doesn't run hot even though my main tower fronts are 4 ohm.

My only wish is that the remote was a little more user friendly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Receiver","review":"I recently purchased the Onkyo TX-SR705 to replace an older Kenwood THX receiver. Setup was very simple and was made even easier due to the HDMI inputs which simplified connection to my satellite receiver and my HD-DVD player. The automatic speaker setup/levelling worked very well even though I only have a 5.1 speaker configuration (no rear surrounds). After setup, I played snippets from several movies (both HD and SD) and I was amazed at how much more \\"live\\" my entire home theater room became. The sound definition was spectacular and I was hearing things that I had never heard before. I can't wait to do some more indepth testing of this unit, but so far, I am extremely pleased. Definately two thumbs up to Onkyo on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Onkyo TX-SR705 Rocks","review":"Onkyo TX-SR705 7.1 Channel Home Theater Receiver (Black)This receiver rocks. Easy setup and was up and running in no time. Haven't had any ticking noises like some posted about or any lipsync issues other then what is normal with some of the HD channels on Directv. Receiver does get hot in right rear corner but I fixed that with a adjustable powersupply from Radioshack and 4 spare 80mm case fans that I had. Now it runs at about 77 F according to the internal temp. monitor. (Hold Display button down and hit Standby/Power button once then release display button and hit tone. Must do quickly to get it to work)Takes a bit of time to go through Audessy setup if you do all 8 positions but well worth the effort. Way better then my old Yamaha 6.1 receiver.

Read the first time setup section to save you some trouble in setup."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Receiver if You're Looking to Upgrade!","review":"The Onkyo TX-SR705 is a great replacement for my older 5.1 receiver. There is an on-screen setup, and a microphone to auto adjust the speaker levels for you. This 705 can decode THX Select2, Dolby TrueHD, and Dolby Master Audio sources. The HDMI inputs fully supports 1080p. All in all, it is a fabulous addition to any home theater.However, there are a couple things to mention about the receiver before you go purchase one. The 705 is about 28 pounds. Ensure your shelf, (or wherever you plan on placing it), can support the weight. Additionally, I found out after purchasing that it requires a powered sub-woofer or amp to an unpowered sub-woofer. Lastly, this receiver gets hot in a short amount of time. In other words, make sure you have adequate airflow going around the receiver to keep it below 100 degrees Fahrenheit."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST RECEIVER FOR MONEY","review":"I bought this receiver about 3 weeks ago.I am really impresed how good it is, ofcourse in this price range.My opinion the best for the price on today's market.Well build and looks beautifull.

After trying to get it to work correctly for two weeks, I finally gave up and wrote to Onkyo tech support. What they said was that if I wanted to get the high definition feature, I needed to buy the SR875 or the next one above that (for $$$). I also had several issues with the lip sync changing from one day to the next. This was probably the biggest reason for returning the unit. I don't mind setting the lip sync once but having to change it every day is a pain.On the plus side, the auto speaker setup was great and the surround sound (I have a 6.1 speaker setup) was great. Hopefully the Sony that I'm replacing the Onkyo with will be equally as good.Bottom line: I know that a lot of reviewers ranked the SR705 very highly (that's one of the reasons I bought it) but I did not have a good experience with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"HDMI Hum","review":"Very prone to hum due to HDMI connections. With my old house wiring I didn't want to have all my equipment and the TV plugged into the same outlet but with this receiver such a setup can cause HDMI loops and will introduce ground loop hum. Supposedly the 805 doesn't have that problem but I would stay away from Onkyo products due to this problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"CUSTOMER SERVICE/WARRANTY SUCKS","review":"I purchased this receiver 4 months ago. Started having some issues after a storm, mainly related to the remote control. After calling their customer service, I was told that I would have to ship the unit, and of course pay for it to a location in Corpus Christie, TX. (I live in Dallas)They were not helpful at all to me in solving the problem which was under warranty.Please think about it. Why would Onkyo choose a warranty repair facility in the farthest away location in Texas with a very small population when they could have chosen one with a much greater population concentration such as Dallas, Houston, etc..I think they want you to not want to ship it, so basically NO WARRANTY!Onkyo 705 may be a good enough product, but if you need their warranty, you are out of luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"HUM in power supply","review":"I've loved this Reciever, till about a month ago a low 60hz HUM appeared.

It also is 7.1 and 100/channel RMS.The receiver is really easy to setup, Sounds great, and is flexible in the sense you can assign different types of surround sound to different inputs(dvd, xbox360, cabletv, etc). Also with a built in adjustable crossover you are able to send lows to your subwoofer and keep your other speakers with mids and high freq.

I don't know if this is an issue with the Onkyo's remote sensor, or if the Harmony is not doing what it should.

Thanks to Bill Smith for writing it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"Got the opener and charged per instructions. The first can I tried to open was a standard sized dog food can. The opener wouldn't pierce the can lid and the piercing arm broke off. I reconnected the piercing arm 3 times and kept trying, but it fell off all 3 times. I wouldn't reccomend anyone buy this product. I saw other negative reviews, but it was so cheap I figured I would try it. Next time I will take other reviews in serious consideration."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"After opening only 3 cans, the cutting blade retracted and would not extend to cut another can.

The charge lasts a long time, and is easy to operate, once you figure how to load the can. You have to tilt it just right. I like how it travels,and cuts along the top of the can. It doesn't matter how large the can is. No can is too small, or too big."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"Do not waste your money on this item. First time I used it the lever broke off.

OUT OF 50 TRIES TO MAKE IT WORK, ONLY SUCCESSFUL TWICE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless product","review":"I had a can opener similar to this one, the difference: it had a handle. That handle made the can opener easy to use. I could not pierce the can with this can opener...and the 2nd can my husband opened, he had the same problem & believe me he is no wimp. We discovered the point on the cutter was very dull, so naturally it was not going to work. Unfortunately the 2nd can we opened was later than the return authorization date, so I have the darn thing.I do not recommend this product, look elsewhere for an electric can opener."},{"rating":"1","title":"couldn't get it to pierce the can","review":"This is a good concept, but, I could not get it to even line up to pierce the top of the can.

Nice idea if it only worked!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"I will admit it is hard at first to line it up right. But after you get the hang of it that little [opener] just cuts on around the can so fast. It is fun to watch!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE! Always keep a backup!","review":"I have had this opener less than two months, but I could have written this the next day and testified to how horrible it is. Even after having a full charge (24 hours), it only lasts 1.5 cans worth- it dies in the middle of the 2nd can! Whats even more irritating is that when it dies, it stays in a locked position on the can making it almost impossible to remove without flinging the contents of the half opened can everywhere...or worse- cutting yourself! FORGET making chili or anything that requires multiple cans. I opted for this opener after having multiple manual crank openers break on me, and I did not want a counter mounted opener because I did not want to dedicate one of my precious kitchen outlets to an opener...but even if I left this plugged in all the time, it still wouldn't do it's job!I cannot tell you the amount of frustration this stupid gadget has caused me. I just want an open can!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate this product","review":"This can opener is definitely inferior to the Black and Decker Gizmo (no longer in production) that it replaced. It is hard to operate and the blade cannot be removed for easy cleaning."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bust","review":"What seemed like a good idea proved otherwise when we recently packed this portable can opener for a trip to Death Valley. On our second day at the exquisite Furnace Creek Lodge and Inn, I put the quite small mechanism to task for about the fourth time on a small can of chicken for my service dog as part of setting up dinner with Paul Newman (!) kibbles. It broke into pieces about five inches along the way and could not be put back together again. My Swiss Army knife saved the completion task. I have no interest in replacing it. My feelings for the Swiss, however, are improved."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the arthritic!","review":"Looks like a cute little can opener, but it's awkward to use and definitely not for someone with small hands or limited use of their hands."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like it overall","review":"I bought this to replace my first cordless can opener after my husband dropped the removable part in the garbage disposal. I would have bought another of the same kind I had, but it was no longer available. This one lasts a LOT longer than my first. I can open as many cans as I want during one recipe and not run out of charge. It doesn't take up as much counter space either, and my old one had an annoying base that it was very hard to get a good contact with for charging. This one just had a cord you plug it in to. My only complaints are it's pretty loud. If I have a sleeping baby, I have found myself just getting out the manual crank in order to avoid waking her. Also it is a little difficult to line it up just right, but once you get used to it, it's fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Can Opener","review":"Excellent can opener. Works as promised. Only improvement would be a safe cut feature that would leave no sharp edge on the can lid. Size is perfect. Just open the can and put the opener in a drawer or cabinet afer use. No counter clutter! Used daily, we only have to charge it every two weeks or so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still trying to get it to work","review":"So far I have not been able to use it as it will not connect to the can and start working, but I will try again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"It's very difficult or next to impossible to clamp down on a can. It's not worth the effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hands Free Can Opener","review":"It works ok for the price, but is a little difficult for me to use. It takes a little \\"pressure\\" to push the blade piece down onto the can and is difficult for those with bone/joint/muscle issues-disabilities. I also did not realize that the can opens from the top, not smoothly from below the lids. So at times, I have had \\"splash-overs\\" from the liquid on the can. Would only recommend it for those who want a \\"hands free\\", but do not have any medical issues with use of hands/wrist. This item is definitely not for the \\"physically impaired\\"!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic little can opener","review":"I gave one of these to my parents about three years ago. They are still using the thing on a daily basis. They have used many can openers over the years, electric and non-electric, but they swear this one is the best they have ever used. So far it has been very durable and has been used daily. They have even bought a second one for the eventuality the first one fails.Contrary to what people are saying, it is very simple to use. They must have never used electric models before. This one has a long battery life when charged and has a pretty good overall design."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I could only get it started...!","review":"If you can get this thing to attach and start cutting, it works fine. I fumbled with this thing for about 5 minutes per can. Now, I'm pretty mechanically inclined and have never had trouble with a can opener before. I bought this because of the great reviews. I finally gave up and I sent mine back! I'm going back to my $4.99 Swing-Away..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money!","review":"I am mechanically inclined, but no matter what I did, I couldn't get this thing to open a can. As a matter of fact, I couldn't get this thing to stay together to even start opening a can."},{"rating":"1","title":"do not buy","review":"Do not by any Hamilton Beach Opener. They have a faw in design and will fail to cut after some use.

It is so hard to push down the lever when you get it lined up on the can."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me","review":"The reviews I read previous to ordering this were mostly positive, so I guess this is a really good little guy. (It looks like a cute, funny little guy.) It seems very strong so it's probably durable, and when I could actually get it to engage the can, it did a very good job and performed as described. I guess it's too strong for me, because I was able to get it to engage a can only twice, after much, hard effort to push it down into the can. I was cooking a big pot of soup and opening several cans. Finally, in exasperation, I tried to use my old, worn-out can opener, but it really was worn out. So I went out into the night to the nearest store I could find, bought a tall Hamilton Beach electric can opener that stands on the counter (model 76380), came back home, opened my cans and finished my soup. The cute little guy was sent back to its home."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy","review":"This is very hard to use, hard to clean, hard to push down to get to start........not much good about it. I used for about 3 month and then threw it away!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this can opener!","review":"This can opener holds only a charge for one or two cans.

Could not get it attached to the can. Had no problem returning this item to Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hamilton Beach 76500 walk'cut cordless can opener","review":"If I could, I could rate this \\"no\\" stars. I thought that the persons who wrote that this product was useless must not have followed the directions. But after I received mine, I will agree with them. I could not get it to work. I had other people try it and they were not able to get it to work. I bought two, so I returned the one I had not opened. I tried everything according to the directions. Nothing worked. I know the battery was charged because I could turn it on when it was not on the can. I wasted good money on something that was useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Loud","review":"I find this item to be too loud and hard to get started opening cans...i would NOT recomend this product..."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth it","review":"The can opener stopped working within 3 weeks of purchasing it. I tried charging it but it still would not work. I would never buy this product again. I don't blame the seller i blame the company that manufactures the item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disposable Can Opener","review":"This must be considered a disposable item. It did not even last a year before it broke. I like to buy items and keep them forever so I would rather pay more and have it last at least 5 years so I am not wasting time at the checkout."},{"rating":"1","title":"not ideal for daining tuna.","review":"this would be a good product if opening something that doesn't need draining but because it cuts from the side it doesn't leave the ring from the lid in order to drain something like tuna, olives etc. I returned mine. Also, it is akward to lock onto the can to start opening."},{"rating":"1","title":"Battery does not hold charge","review":"The product works as described but the battery last only one opening. You can't simply plug it in and use it as the motor draws all electricity through the battery. Basically, unless the product sent to me was defective you need to keep this plugged in all the time. Not good."},{"rating":"1","title":"How do you make this thing work?","review":"I try to attach this device to the top of a can and nothing happens. I keep trying over and over and over and finally it starts and does a nice job, running all the way around the can until it reaches the starting point and stops automatically. But let me tell you, I am totally frustrated by the time this happens, I dont know why it ultimately starts, it just does.I can't take it back, I have opened the box, used it to open 4 cans now, but it is not getting any easier. I will be buying a conventional electric can opener today. I would not recommend this for anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great can opener","review":"Love this can opener, its small compact and also very handy! The battery seems to last as well I bought this about a month ago and it still hasnt had to be recharged!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too difficult to use.","review":"Even when properly positioned,this product it is very difficult to activate. It requires two hands and more hand strength that others that I have tried. I ordered another kind which worked much easier. I hope to return it for a refund"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hamilton Beach 76500 Walk 'N Cut Cordless Can Opener","review":"We had a B&D (same type) can opener before this one. The battery died and B&D stopped producing them. This one works just as well, has a replaceable battery and hopefully will last longer than the B&D. It takes up no counter space and is easily cleanable. There is really nothing bad that I can say about this appliance, if you need a new can opener, I would highly recommend taking a look at this one. BTW, Amazon had the best price on the net, beating out eBay and everyone else by a mile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of junk","review":"What waste of money. Very difficult (if not impossible) to get the edge of the can properly fitted and I had to remove and restart four times on a large can of tomatoes. What the heck has happened to good old American appliances, my previous Presto can opener last over 10 years, this thing is worthless right out of the box!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Evil can opener","review":"This is the worst can opener I have ever bought. It's really loud, hard to set and the handle is so sharp it cut my hand. I was very disappointed for a Hamilton Beach product. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"ONE HAND OPERATION \\"??","review":"My wife and I are wondering which one of the three hands they are talking about that it takes to operate this thing. Trying to get this opener to pierce a can is an exercise in frustration. My similar Black & Decker gave up after 7 years and I thought I would try Hamilton Beach. BIG MISTAKE!!! Due to past experience, I'm not a big fan of B&D quality but the B&D was easy to use and didn't tip over on the counter for no apparent reason. Save your money on this one, a manual opener is preferable to this thing. I'd give it a ZERO if possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy the Gizmo","review":"I had read the reviews on this, and thought it would be as good as the Black and Decker ones I had gone through several times. It's not. Biggest problem is getting it to pierce. Runs great not on a can. It's particularly hard to do on small cans. Cuts okay if you can get it to pierce.I've gone back to using my old electric one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst opener I ever had","review":"I'm sorry, I don't know what's wrong with me, or rather my tin cans, but I couldn't get this to work most of the time.

I'm throwing it out and shopping for a new opener as you read......"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this discontinued product","review":"As a person with disabilities (have use of only one hand), I need \\"assistive devices.\\" Instructions accompanying this product are completely inadequate. Even my two-handed aide was unable to operate it. Fortunately, Amazon's return policy saved the day by refunding my payment, providing a return address label, and reimbursed me for postage. No wonder Hamilton Beach discontinued its product.I went back to Amazon and purchased a \\"batteries-free\\" mechanical can opener that works perfectly with my one hand. It's called Chef'n EzSqueeze One-Handed Can Opener. And it's only $13 including shipping!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"In order to get this can opener to work (sometimes) I have to sit down at the table and plan to spend 10 to 15 minutes fooling around with it. I put the opener on a can and when I push down it does not engage and punch a hole in the can. It does nothing. This is very frustrating when you are in the middle of cooking and have to take so much time out to just open a can. It is not a problem with the battery being charged. If I take it off the can I can tell that the battery is charged and working. Back to the manual can opener for me. I would not recommend this item."},{"rating":"2","title":"It does the job and looks like W.C. Fields.....Seriously, it does.","review":"I bought this thing to replace my B&D; cordless Ergo that finally bit the bullet and they don't make that model anymore or I would have replaced it.I have fallen in love with cordless openers. I do not have a lot of counter space so a big plugin model was out of the question.I bought this one in hopes it would work as well as the B&D.; It does the job as well as the B&D; did if not better except for one point. It's a lot noisier. I don't mind this aspect since generally no one is trying to sleep when I'm cooking.Overall, I would give it a 5 star, but I'm knocking 1 star off for the noise. But, I'm adding another star because it looks like W.C. Fields.Total 5 stars!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too hard for me","review":"Just packed this up to return. I got it because I have a bad hand & a manual opener was too hard to use. Well this is even worse. Even my husband struggled with it. You really have to press hard to get the blade to engage, then it kept falling off the can."},{"rating":"1","title":"Manual can opener works better","review":"I got one as a gift from a friend of mine & it's the same one her husband uses all the time. I have arthritis in both hands & had major problems in trying to use it... Once can is pierced it works like a dream. Problem is getting the opener to pierce the lid in the first place. I tried using it on 4 different days: the 1st time I finally gave up on opening the can; the 2nd time I spilled tuna juice all over me but it worked; the 3rd time it worked just the way it is supposed to; after the 4th & final time I tried to use it, I decided the manual can opener was really much easier & less frustrating to use even though it hurts my hand to use a manual can opener. As I said earlier, my friend's husband uses the exact same can opener & never has a problem, but after my experiences I wouldn't recommend this can opener to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"do4es not work. very hard to catch on to can. I gave up!","review":"This can opener does not work like the other one used to. Unfortunately you do not carry the model I have had for years! This does not catch on to can. I struggle with it and finally gave up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many flaws.","review":"Very hard to hold if you have any kind of arthritis, hand issues. Hard to connect to cans and once it does pierce the can, be aware that it's not the kind of can opener that goes around the outside of the can lid in which you're able to reseal. VERY sharp and ragged cut. I also found I couldn't do low cans like tuna/cat food size.So wanted it to work because I was so tired of the battery operated ones jamming up when the battery decides to die halfway through the cycle.I hope this helps."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money","review":"Thought I would give this product a try and replace my 15 year old Krups electric hand-held model #404. Can't find them anymore. Anyway, the Hamilton Beach is difficult to use and does not work the way the directions state. Making several attempts, I could not get the \\"pierce-point\\" to pierce the can. Anyway, I have sent it back. For all the frustration, I would rather use a hand held crank style."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful waste of money","review":"Don't buy this--very hard to use.

And when it's cutting, it sounds like it might just die at any time. But the thing takes the lids off, even from 3 lb Coffee cans, and it's about the size of a fist. I don't really need to use it over and over without charging, so can't comment on charge life (plus, the charger is right there, so I just leave it plugged in, mostly)."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you don't keep it charged you better have a backup","review":"Cute little can opener that works well enough as long as it's charged. Unfortunately it won't work with the power cord if the batteries are dead. You have to charge it up after every use or it might be dead the next time you use it. Because it requires charging and you have no idea how much juice is left in the batteries it's kind of a hassle to get the charger cord out and deal with charging it up before putting it away.I would not recommend this device as the main can opener in the house. It might be useful on a camping trip if you have portable power that you can charge it up on later. Otherwise get a can opener that uses AC only and you'll not have to deal with dead can openers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to use","review":"It takes two people to attach the opener and get it to start turning. I used to have a Gizmo and I went for a less expensive option. It was a mistake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good product","review":"This can opener is one of the most difficult to use. Although it is small, it is very hard to get the opener on the can in order to begin. Once on, after much work, it does work without being held. Additionally, it will not work unless plugged in. When purchased, it seemed to be one that could be battery operated.Not happy and will look for something different."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can operner","review":"Doesn't work worth a damn.

Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless","review":"It is clumsy, dies quickly and doesn't do a very good job of opening a can. I was really hoping for something small I could put in a drawer that would work well. This was not it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many drawbacks","review":"Bought this when the battery in my Gizmo gave out. Big mistake. The Gizmo had a modern lithium battery, which meant you could continuously charge it, the HB has old-fashioned NiCAD batteries, which you must charge and then use until completely discharged, meaning every so often (fairly often) it gives out on you in the middle of meal prep. The Gizmo had 4:1 leverage which was easy for my strength-impaired wife to use. The HB has pathetic 2:1 leverage which is difficult for even me to use sometimes. Yeah, the Gizmo is expensive (over $100) but if you need a can opener that seriously understrength users can use, it's the only way to go. I would NOT buy this can opener again... I will probably get rid of it before it stops working, it's THAT unsatisfactory."},{"rating":"1","title":"Everyone is right! Can opener is a PAIN to open cans with!","review":"Horrible can opener, you have to play with it to get it to line up after piercing the can.

STAY AWAY!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dream opener","review":"Well, I got a replacement without a sweat after 30 days. The tool worked OK right off the charger... Thats the only time. Actually it sounds very labored even when it works. That could be the problem, it just has a physical handicap by design. Anyway, the second one did the same thing. I charged it for a few days on arrival... Three or four days later it would not even budge a can lid... Stone dead. The dilemmas are these; you never really plan to open a can so it's not going to be ready and you don't ever want something endlessly plugged in so it works on demand- especially if you think the battery is funky anyway. Maybe its an old factory run so ALL the batteries have failed. Either way save your money. It looks cool but is a non-starter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to Handle","review":"I don't have enough hands to make this work.

It finally ended up in the garbage!I would never recommend this opener to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"good idea but more difficult to use than One Touch","review":"I like the idea of this can opener and that it is rechargable instead of battery operated like One Touch. Also that it opens the can the conventional way instead of on the side like One Touch because the sharp edge is dangerous on One Touch. However it is difficult to position it and push the lever down on the cans to open them. I really struggle with it. One Touch you just place on top of the can and push the button.

The little lever is a bit awkward too. Once you get the hang of it, it's not so bad.. But I'd have to say the most frustrating thing is, it needs recharging after practicallly every use.. Kind of defeats the purpose of it being cordless, don't ya think?? Also very irritated when it dies while in mid cut, if you try to plug it in to finish, it still won't work until its been charged again.. Be sure to have an alternative method available."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works well but doesn't last and no replacement parts","review":"We had fun with the Walk 'N Cut, using it occasionally for about 10 months. When it didn't work one day, I charged it only to find that it still didn't work. Opening it up revealed that the batteries had leaked badly. I called Hamilton Beach and they said it was a discontinued item and could do nothing for me. It's disappointing to have to throw it away after such a short time with no recourse for a warranty replacement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hercules would have trouble with this","review":"I had wanted a cordless can opener and received this as a gift. Sadly it did not live up to the reputation of Hamilton Beach.

I wanted a can opener that was easy to use and that I didn't have to hold onto. After practicing on three cans, I found it very easy to use. We are still in our first charge after a month and five people using it all the time.However, after 6 months, it will no longer hold a charge. It will not cut cans anymore. I'm guessing the plastic parts were unable to hold up with regular family use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Design","review":"I bought this can opener because it is small and cordless. However, my husband and I have a difficult time getting it lined up correctly to open can. It is especially difficult with small cans.

I guess that's what I get for buying in online."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Battery Life","review":"The concept for this can opener is cool and it works, but the internal non-replaceable battery cannot hold a charge for any amount of time. That means you need to charge it for 6 hours before you use it next. It also will not work while plugged into the wall. All the power has to comes from the battery and it just does not. Do not buy it unless Hamilton Beach upgrades the battery to something that can sit in a drawer for more than a day unused."},{"rating":"1","title":"STAY AWAY!","review":"This product is junk. It worked maybe a dozen times, but didn't do a thorough job of cutting through the lid even then. And forget opening a short can like tuna - the opener is taller than the can, so you have to juggle the can in your hand to get the can opener to work. As other reviewers have noted, it's also hard to get the opener positioned to cut. But the worst thing is that the opener stopped working after about a dozen times. It started not holding a charge well, now won't work even with the cord plugged in. Thank goodness I bought it from Amazon and they allowed me to return it.

I was initially pleased with the Hamilton Beach 76500 Can Opener until it started rolling off the counter. While of great utility, this is a case where the technical design is great but the stylist created a problem. The fact is that most of the can opener's case is round in shape except for two little feet that try to hold it up-right. If a heavy steel lid is still stuck on the magnet and the unit is placed on the counter, the whole thing will roll over. If it is close to edge of the counter, it will fall on the floor. Now I have a big cut in my foot from the steel lid that was attached to the can opener at the time. I reserve the right to cook in bare feet but now I have a big gash because of this product.

There are many similarities in the British public with the American public. However, a lot of the charm comes from the British accents in the given context.

These guys have the energy end technical ability of bands such as No Use for a Name, NOFX, Pennywise, Lagwagon but better vocals than any of these bands. I have had this album in my primary rotation for several different periods during the past two years. It is one of those albums that if you dont hear for a while, you will go looking for it. The album to me is much more impressive when one considers the young age of this band. The only negative of the album would be the at times slightly off beat drums, but this is easy to forgive in light of all the positives of the album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sick of Change brings full-on rock","review":"Sick of Change blew me away from the first time I listened to their CD about 4 years ago. I'm usually not pleased by mainstream rock (early Relient K, some MXPX, Sanctus Real, etc.) but these guys got my attention. They offer intellegent lyrics that tackle issues and back it up with driving, high-energy guitars. This is the kind of CD you'd snowboard/skate to! Their sound can be repetitive, but if you like fast, driving punk then this band offers something original."},{"rating":"2","title":"Garage Band Goddesses","review":"\\"C'mon\\" is a nice outtake from the \\"Queens Of Noise\\" album, a rare display of Cherie Currie's rock vocals(Currie was relegated mainly to the slower stuff), so this harder collection is mostly Joan Jett's turf, and she's hellbent & enjoyably surly as usual. Cherry Red recently put out nicely-packaged editions of each Runaways album(and they didn't feel the need to splatter the liner notes with neon paint)but this is a terrific place to begin for those who weren't there."},{"rating":"1","title":"absolutely, utterly awful","review":"These guys are middling proficient performers, but what really kills this is the awful songwriting. Hard to conceive of worse songs if they had tried for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great intro for Runaways newcomers","review":"A nice sample of this ground breaking band from the seventies. Eventually a springboard for Joan Jett and Lita Ford, this group provided a major pathway for women in rock. Cherie Currie was touted as the lead vocalist at first, however Joan Jett attained stardom about 6 years later. This CD primarily has Jett's leads (which were shared with Currie), which is a bit of a let down, as much of their greatest stuff was with Currie on vocal. However the LP \\"Waitin' for the Night\\" has never been available on CD, and there are some awesome cuts from that. That particular album was recorded after Currie left the band, and Jett took over all of the vocals. The live cuts definitely leave something to be desired, however there are only two. Much of this materiel is very difficult to find, so it is a great collection to have. Note that the average age of the band members upon recording this materiel was about 17, which adds to it's charm. Add it to your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Raw, Fun, Fast, Loud Rock N Roll","review":"This is an outstanding album. There are no lame ballads, no synthesizers, no pianos, no over produced studio songs, no weak 'showing their range' songs, and thankfully no patronizing 'socially conscious' songs - just great adrenaline rush rock n roll.

What I discovered is that this is a gem that is completely overlooked by way too many rock fans.

Sadly, she only appears for a few seconds, in the only role that isn't detestible. The plot is simplistic to the point of non-existance. The characters are miles beyond idiotic, to the point where you suspect the scriptwriters are. There isn't enough suspense or finesse to fill a teaspoon. The only appeal Busey's character holds in his brief appearance is to those who find the extremes of gross amusing--in short, adolescent mentality that laughs at anything disgusting and cruel that Hollywood's been shovelling their way for the past few years. Makes some of the bad B-movies of the 50's look positively sophisticated and artsy. If it was meant to be a vague Blair Witch rip-off, it has more in common with the story of Hansel and Gretel (except that was scarier).

It's very different from a regular ball mouse - if you are switching, be prepared for some frustration for at least a few weeks. This mouse has a lot of adjustable settings. Almost TOO many. The feet on it need to be a bit higher to use with a standard mouse pad. I've resorted to just using the desktop surface to get the proper 180 turning radius needed for an FPS game. The Logitech G9 might have been a better option."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very smooth and nice but not worth the price tag","review":"This is definitely the smoothest most comfortable mouse I've ever used but I don't think it's worth $50.00 I guess I expected a much better improvement in my online gaming for this price tag.Again it is extremely smooth and incredibly comfortable."},{"rating":"2","title":"so far so good","review":"I have owned this product for about two weeks so I can't really so it is a durable thing.

They won't dissapoint you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great mouse","review":"I have tried many different gaming mice...mouses... whatever you get it. This one stands out as my favorite by far. It isn't overcrowded which is a big flaw I find in many products. Some folks might like this, but for me the two side buttons plus your standard mouse 1 + 2 w/ wheel is fine by me. The blue glow makes it pretty to look at when your hand isn't covering it. Most importantly, it is incredibly smooth. Plus it can be tweaked to your liking if that's your cup of tea. 5/5"},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this piece of plastic...","review":"Will only work on the most pristine surfaces, which would be okay, but then it offers no real benefit for gaming. The button count is average, and the size is cumbersome.

What a complete waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"Great mouse for about 2 weeks.

I have had it for three months. I contacted the company and they suggested doing all kinds of different things, try it on different computers and it still does not work. They said the only thing to do would be to exchange it--no money back. HOWEVER, they keep sending automatic emails and having me fill out forms and never have sent a Return Authorization Number. I am just getting the run around with the company and if you want customer service you better buy somewhere else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Product is a Dud","review":"Like several other reviewers here, the mouse died on me after only about 1 week of usage. It worked fine out of the box, then simply stopped working after a while (light wouldn't go on or anything).

Needless to say I will not be buying another Razer mouse."},{"rating":"1","title":"If your used to a G5 or any Logitech might not be good!","review":"Ok so this mouse is a tough one. I am saying right not it is being returned but not due to it not working or being horrible. It is just not my style. It is a very flat and long mouse so if you are used to Logitech mouse this may not be the one for you. After about an hour of gaming my hand began to cramp. Never happened with my G5 that this replaced. Also i find myself when trying to move the mouse accidentaly clicking buttons and being a gamer this is not a good thing. I just got my G9 today and it is so much better. So if your used to a Logitech and looking for an upgrade go with the new G9."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Product","review":"My parents got me this mouse for a Christmas present in 09. I had a friend who had one, and I wanted a high-quality mouse for cheap. This one turned out to be really good! My hand no longer aches since my hands now sits over the mouse instead of cupping the entire thing. Also, since I mostly browse the web, I have the extra buttons set to switch tabs and refresh the page. It's a good product for the price and a good product all around."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Mouse I have ever owned!","review":"I have been gaming for 20 years and I am also a gadget freak. I have owned most of Logitech's line and some other's and while all offer something in different area's this one is great in ALL area's. I mainly play shooters and do some spreadsheets and photo editing and it works perfectly in all area's. The smooth design on top as opposed to having buttons seems to quicken response time as well as giving it a more natural feel. Like I said I am a gadget freak and my system is an Alienware Aurora, so I have all of the lighting in my computer set to match the lighting of my mouse and it is a very cool looking set-up. Also when the mouse is idle the light on top slowly dissapears and reappears giving it a \\"breathing\\" appearance. It works really well on everything and IMHO it's the best out there right now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good little mouse","review":"I got this mouse for my Mac and its working great.

However the reliability of this equipment is horrible. Over the past year alone two of their keyboards and two of their mice have developed hardware flaws preventing their proper function. In the case of this mouse the mouse started to list in an upward direction whenever I would stop motion.Unacceptable performance, even worse customer support. Love the look and feel but for this price the thing needs to actually work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolute best mouse you can buy","review":"Title says it all, I have owned 10 different mice over the years, and this one blows them all away. It handles like butter. The Blue breathing effect is nice, but I turn it off the lights anyway. The memory for this mouse is onboard, so you can set it the way you like and then transfer it to another computer and it will keep its settings, how cool is that! The button response feels just right. I immediately got my highest score in crysis, its as if this mouse was made for me. If you are deciding between an MX518 and this mouse, trust me this is is better in every catagory. I own both. Good job razor."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Web Designer Review","review":"I'm not a gamer, but I do live on my computer because I'm a website designer. I wanted a mouse that was perfect, and I have to say this mouse is the closest thing to it. The feel is absolutely perfect, very balanced and great texture. The click sound is perfect, the scroll wheel has perfect slight click feel with no sound. The mouse is light, but not to light, and is very easy to control. I have vista, and the default settings for the mouse worked great for me so I didn't bother installing the software. I also love the pulsing light haha. The side buttons are great too, perfect size unlike many other mice. All in all, it's practically a perfect mouse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Product Quality Issues and Support.","review":"The mouse worked for a while then started to malfunction. Dealing with Razer support was a nightmare. Trust me when I say they do not back their products. They will do everything in their power not to replace defective product. Many complaints on product quality..not worth the money and hassle. Just to give you an example they told me that online purchases are NOT covered under warranty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good mouse","review":"I bought this mouse to replace my old one(logitech mx510) because of the worn scroll dial and wanting to try out a razer mouse. The biggest niche I noticed was that the *click* sound of the Deathadder was somewhat loud( at least compared to my mx510).I think that the glowing logo can be irritating to some, but it can be turned off. The drivers for the mouse are USB specific, meaning the drivers will only work for the USB port that was used to first install the mouse. The mouse looks very sleek and I liked the non-slip surface of the Deathadder. The infrared used for tracking is cool because it is invisible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as it looks","review":"Great looking mose and feels great in hand. Downside is mouse failed after a month and software does not like to coincide with Microsft Outlook and iTunes. I had to reload support software several times during short life of the mouse.I bought the mouse at Amazzon and they do not accept returns after 30 days. Razer seems to also not accept returns.Razer customer support is abismal. They do not seem to want to accept a return of a dead mouse. After a week of hassleing, they still have not agreed to replace but have given me a form to fill out so they can consider what is the correct action. After 2 weeks I still have no idea if they will replace the mouse or if I just have to accept 45 days of life for $47."},{"rating":"1","title":"low price but low quality","review":"I was attracted to this recorder because of its low price. I should have known better. The pitch is off on some of the notes in the higher registers and it is more difficult than most recorders to get a clear sound in the higher registers. The tone in general is ok but not great. I have owned several other wooden recorders - a low cost pearwood recorder and two expensive (Moeck) rosewood recorders. Even the pearwood recorder sounded better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money","review":"I notice there are reviews in here for the Soprano. It should be for the Alto.This Alto recorder was a terrible waste of money for me.It is a nice looking instrument, and that's about it. It only plays o.k. in the first octave, and the sound was pretty nice, what with it being made of rosewood. Then going to the second ocatve, it was completely off. I figured, give it another try the next day, as recorders have to be broken in, and I was thinking maybe the wood was wet. I was really hoping it would sound better, but somehow knew that I got gypped.So, if you don't want to waste your money, don't buy this product. It will only be nice to look at and not good for much else. Maybe firewood.It also plays a 1/2 octave lower, so would be o.k. for playing for yourself, but if you are playing with other people, not so good. It would sound \\"off\\".I should have sent it back.

This author does a spectacular job of critical research while generating a work like a novel. The work is long but reads very quickly. The suffering of the Leningrad people is very much like the events of Greece after the Nazi occupation except there were no Italian troops to add some semblance of civility. Mr. Salisbury's insight into the '37-'39 purges adds a great deal of depth to the understanding of why Leningrad suffered as it did. I loved his captions of the lives of individuals during the seige. This, I believe make the effort as good as it is. Although first published in 1969, it is timely and well worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"900 Days...it takes about that long to read it ;)","review":"It's a long book, but worth reading. Most books about the Eastern Front are written from a German perspective, so it was refreshing to see the Russian side of the story (and what a side!). The last thing I would want to be would be a Soviet officer during that time! If the Nazis didn't shoot you, the Communists would!Overall a good book. It got dull at a few points, but the author keeps it interesting by blending stories and anecdotes told by people who were there.

Also, I think that anybody reading the book will find the story of a little girl confronting segregation with her white socks compelling.

All other songs credited to Eleanor Powell were actually sung by Majorie Lane. Ms. Powell lip-synched songs in all movies she starred in from 1935 on. She sang a couple of short ditties before 1935. After track 15 of the 1940 movie, the finale -- a reprise of the \\"I've got my eyes on you\\" song -- is completely omitted. Audio quality is not good. This is a sloppy production.

But all that hassle about the criminal sidetracks them from the matter of real importance- the universe's most valued world, Florina's imminent destruction by the explosion of a prenovae star. The only way to find out how this breathtaking mystery, political and suspence masterwork by Isaac Asimov ends is to read the book- or buy the Kindle version, like I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insanely Expensive","review":"I'm with SA (Alabama)...

He referred me to a FAQ, which does not mention the issue at all (their on-line support says to call Customer Support!)

I find that it does a great job of being light,durable,and compact. It keeps the camera clean and scratch free. However I wish the case had a better carrying capacity. I would have liked a bit more space for spare batteries and chips. I use different ones for different pictures or video. Batteries do tend to give out after a long day shooting and convient extras would be handy.The case has beltloops but not a good shoulder strap for times when a belt is not worn. That can be a bit akward. Otherwise this case is a good protector of my camera and fits it well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reppin Louisiana","review":"Some people that don't know their music may think that these g's are from Texas.

Visually it is just so well done. Nothing else like it! Difficult to do the recipes, not for beginners or the faint of heart. Ingredients most of us have never heard of, nor know where to go to find them. But inspirational, and some of them even from our homes can turn out for that very special occassion when some dazzle is needed at the end of a culinary adventure. Try Mango Compote with Green Tea Creme Brulee or the Peach=Polenta Upside-down cake with almond sherbet. Also, pick up his new book as Charlie Cooks at Home. Much more friendly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useful only for photos & inspiration","review":"I can say that I am a reasonably competent home chef with an above-average knowledge of technique and most necessary equipment to get the job done. Having said that, I was impressed with the photos of nearly every featured recipe in this book and find the recipes to be admirably aggressive in their taste and texture contrasts. The recipes, however, are nearly all flawed in some significant manner in that following them verbatim will result in poor results. Even when this is not the case, I find these recipes to be \\"out of whack\\" from a taste perspective by any gastronome's standards and in need of serious tweaking. If you have good kitchen skills and seek to be inspired by the ideas in this book, then I would suggest it (USED!!) ... otherwise, there are much better cookbooks that will yield far superior results."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent photos,but...","review":"...Charlie Trotter's dessert is of limited to no use for a Continental/European Chef/Cook. Weights and measures are all in cups and ounces.Still maybe undestandable for a European Chef but impossible to work for instance a Russian Chef (These are the people who buy these books because they want to learn.They have little chance to travel yet,so have to rely on books to improve their skills) I have checked ,quickly only, through the recipes and gave up,there are also certain facts not right (Original Linzer cake you don't make with raspberries but with 'red currants'.Also recipes are using to many US specific names and terms,i.e. what is a Meyer lemon?

It could be described as \\"Retro Rock\\" or \\"Rockabilly\\". It could also be described as wonderful, powerful and impressive. Stand out tracks for me are \\"Take A Chance\\", \\"I'm Gonna Be Strong\\" and \\"I Had A Love\\".If you are a fan of Cyndi Lauper and you haven't got this CD yet, your collection is incomplete. Buy it now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"5 Stars for Content, 3 Stars for Recording Quality","review":"I have loved this recording since I discovered a cassette tape of it in a cutout bin in 1980. I was extremely excited when I found that it was available on CD - and don't regret spending $40 for it. But even though this is my favorite recording of Cyndi (the performances have a fabulous energy - and she rips my heart out on \\"I'm Gonna Be Strong\\"), there is a lot of tape hiss - which I can only assume was on the original master. So, despite the audiophile price, it isn't an audiophile recording. It is, however, a collector's item - with a priceless performance."},{"rating":"2","title":"In The Beginning...","review":"Blue Angel was of course the first band Cyndi Lauper sang in before prior to going solo. An album she declares sold so much it went 'lead'. She also says the record company told her the 50's rockabilly they were doing was not going to sell and then a year later Stray Cats hit big doing the same thing.So you can tell where this music is coming from, but it's not really so much rockabilly, as it is a mixture of 80's pop, doo wop 50's style and the Shangri La's 60's. The album was released and done and gone in just a matter of months and our girl ended up bankrupt and all until her 1983 record contract.But the album is really good - there are versions of \\"Maybe He'll Know\\" and \\"I'm Gonna Be Strong\\" two songs Cyndi would later re-record on her own albums and the highlights to me, \\"I Had A Love\\" and \\"Fade.\\" Cyndi's vocals are in full form and the band is pretty tight and fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cyndi Lauper and Blue Angel: Excellent and Cool !","review":"This disc is really great. I recommend 100%. Cyndi Lauper was ready to be a super star of Pop Rock in the age of MTV. This was just a preamble to what they were in 1984. Blue Angel was a good band. I think it is a real pity that it was not recognized at the time. This recording is excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"If Only","review":"Great novel if only I could get it delivered.

And who was the little girl at the end. And what was the cause and effect in this movie. Yes there's nudity, hers only, and sexual acts. You really don't hear anything but see the visiuals. I'm still trying to figure what was the point into making a movie like this and what happened in her past that we don't see at all.. And yes she did help others see what was missing in thier lifes. The movie itself just plain stupid, and trying to feel sorry for her isn't the answer either. But my favorite part was the end were her best friend punches the sh---out of her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst movie ever made","review":"There is no plot. No kind of ending. Never comes together.

And, I've wanted to view the movie again, but it apparently isn't on VCR or cable. In the Tyne Daly CD, Daly sounds like she had been carousing for three days and nights, did a quick once-over runthrough with the orchestra, and recorded. She sounds tired, more laid-back than Peggy Lee, and disinterested in the entire production--perhaps because it wasn't a real show in the conventional sense, with sets, props, and costumes.The other vocalists are also singing by rote, totally devoid of emotion. And finally, the orchestra is very thin, almost like a band from a junior college drama department production. Aarrgh! But, it's better than nothing at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"As a belter, she's just LOUD","review":"A belter should have a brash, pingy and IN TUNE sound. Tyne Daly cannot sustain a pitch without a serious dip in intonation to save her life. She does okay as long as the line keeps moving, but G*d forbid she should have to hold a note. She ruined the ON THE TOWN recording, particularly \\"Some other time\\" for the very same reason."},{"rating":"2","title":"To correct Jeff-BroadwayJ@aol.com","review":"Ethel Merman had an exclusive contract with Decca. However, RCA Victor had the rights to the cast album, and Decca wouldn't let Merman sing for RCA Victor. So RCA Victor hired one of their biggest stars, Dinah Shore, to sing all of Merman's songs. Merman, in turn, made her own album entitled \\"Ethel Merman: 12 Songs from Call Me Madam.\\" Dick Haymes accompanied her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tyne Daly brilliant for authentic \\"Call Me Madam\\"","review":"I couldn't let one review spoil the chances of this superb recording. I have been to see light operatic society productions of many musicals of this era and Call Me Madam is one of my favourites with so many memorable numbers. When I heard a recording with Ethel Merman I was devastated to think this was all that was available. It may have been written for her but I found her voice overpowering and strident.How refreshing then to find a recording with ALL the songs from the show, a beautiful sound from the band and Tyne Daly giving her all. I would rate her voice as the ideal \\"show\\" voice, powerful, brash enough but not too much. The rest of the voices on the recording are super too. Thank you very much - this took me back to my show-going days and brought back some happy memories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Please try!

If this were a heterosexual romance it would be completely unremarkable and hardly anyone would pay attention to it.

The scenes, seperate from the book (as seen on in the movie trailer) is actually quite beautiful, but once it's put back into the novel and subjected to pages of plotless, mindless writing that has no moral and no endearing connection to the reader, the scenes lose their value. It's a cheap love story, the main problem being that the book is unable to convince the reader that between Christian and Aaron there is truly a love beyond physical attraction. It's shallow and uses the age-old, used and abused idea of the series of \\"miraculous incidents\\" in which, at the very end (and only by chance!) do the two lovebirds come together \\"as one\\". The author's stab is humor is pitiful, and the book is so horrific it may be hard to put it down.

It lays out a lot of science that is very alarming but also manages to put it in an easy to understand context. The story telling style is easy to read and the topics well arranged.As a novel whose purpose is to educate people on the science of climate change and a call to action this book really hits the mark. If you have a climate change sceptic friend or relative then please buy them this book and ask them to argue the science.The 'what you can do' section at the end is pretty light on so if you are looking for answers to the issue this isn't going to fill the void. The main point is that until we get a common consensus that this IS a major problem and that we need to do something about it, the best thing we can do is to alert others to the problem and this book did that for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"must read","review":"This book made me finally commit to a green likestyle.

This book outlines the science underlying the damage the human race is wreaking on the world's fragile, inter-connected ecosytems and atmosphere in a compelling, inspirational way that the lay person can easily understand. While I never doubted that global warming was happening I now have a much clearer understanding of the urgency of the need for action and have committed myself to doing what I can to address the situation. I fear not so much for my own future but for that of my children and yet-to-be-born grandchildren. While Tim Flannery spells out very clearly the dangers we face if little or no action is taken, he is optimistic that the human race has the ingenuity and intelligence to address the problems if we act immediately and decisively. We all need to do what we can as indiviudals and lobby our governments to do what they need to in order to save the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Weather Makers","review":"Weather Makers is written by a meteorologist and is a step further towards the technical than Al Gore's book Inconvenient Truth.

I wanted to get a solid, firm understanding about global warming and climate - a scientific and historical perspective to be able to sort out all the noise. Interestingly enough, I heard Tim Flannery on the radio and it was his book that steered me to the purchase of these two. I stopped reading The Weather Makers about halfway through. I got so tired after reading about the one thousanth, four hundreth and thirty second CO2 readings over the past that I just stopped reading it. While the empirical data was presented, the discussion on climate and how civilization was and is affected over the milleniums was weak at best and often missing.

The prose are not streamlined and there is no substantive thread to tie the quote-fronted chapters together. Of particular annoyance was the author's obsession with going through a qualitative and repetitive laundry-list of species that are rare and in trouble. Perhaps if this list were presented in conjunction with some historical perspective this could have worked, but as is, it really doesn't.I would recommend taking a look at Ruddiman's recent book on climate and humans if you want a real perspective on the role that the \\"weather makers\\" have had on the physical climate system, but I have no suggestion for a good and historically-grounded book on the biological effects of human-induced climate change."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good not Great","review":"The author does a good job of describing the current dire situation but falls short when it comes to the solutions.

I think they are fakes.UPDATE - I did contact Keds and they admit they are not making these shoes like they used to. No support, no padding, more narrow, thinner canvas. I've bought Keds for almost 35 years so I know the difference. Save your money. You can get this same sneaker in any cheap shoe store for between $5-$8, it just won't have a Keds tag.

There seems to be no consistency of sizing, however, between colors or styles, and I have had to try different colors and styles due to \\"not available\\" items. Several years ago I had a Keds size 8 M and it was a little bit too long and slightly snug. So this year I tried the Chambray blue 7 1/2 W and it was too long, but wide enough. I returned the Chambray and got stone 7 W (no Chambray available in 7 W) and it was waaay too short and very tight. I don't think a size 8 W would even fit. This idea of shoes \\"running small\\" or \\"running large\\" makes no sense to me.

This is what you could expect a few years ago, that Keds were STRONG shoes. Well surprise, they barely lasted one season. The bottom sole of the shoe came unglue from the rest of the shoe, and most of the white leather chipped off leaving patches of brown.

They have been making subtle changes for the past several years. This last one was too much. I have been wearing Keds sneakers for about 60 years and absolutely loved them.

Time for new ones - pictures showed the flared soles were gone (GREAT). Ordered a pair. The toes are still too pointed, but the insole is as hard as a rock (maybe not quite) and the built in arch support was gone! They had a perfect product and really ruined it. I could just cry.

The sole is stiff and clunky, the canvas fabric is thin and poor quality and they are in general, junk. No quality of any kind left in this previously reliable brand.My usual size in these is a 7 and that has always been 100% comfortable and a perfect fit when worn with a pair of sport socks.

These are a very cheap version of the sturdy, supportive Keds of yesteryear that fit like a glove and lasted forever.

John Culbertson certainly admires the 5th Marine snipers but they weren't the saviors that he makes them out to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointing","review":"This book seemed to me to be a platform to fire off complaints and accusations at other more famous snipers in Vietnam than anything else. I understand that there were other snipers served in Vietnam, just tell the story and leave it at that. Don't make your story your personal soap box against the government and Carlos Hathcock. There was some good story in here, that is the only reason I give it two stars instead of one. I don't reccomend this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I was hoping for...","review":"I purchased this book hoping to get a detailed look at the legendary Marine snipers in Vietnam, and how they fought. And while Culbertson does well to honor the comrades he fought with, I found this book more of a recruiting pitch for the Corps, rather than a historical account. Even more annoying was Culbertson's attempts to revise military history... telling us how the Marine's won WWI for the French, or how Hanoi could have fallen if we'd just sent in an airborne division and a Marine Assault Force.When the author manages to stick to the subject, we get to see Culbertson's ample knowledge of firearms, sniper tactics and the conditions these men fought in. But unfortunately for readers, we have to wade through pages of jingoistic and Christo-righteous tangents to find it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Propoganda and hearsay","review":"I purchased this book thinking that it would give me either:a) a personal glimpse into the world of the Marine Sniperb) a report of stories and circumstances of the Marine Sniper from an objective source.The book offered neither of these. It appears Culbertson is writing from the perspective of one who was there, but had little involvement. He speaks at the beginning of the book, of a get together with some of his sniper buddies many years after the war. One gets the impression this book was written as a result of this get together. I would like so much to have read about the authors experiences rather than much of the politicialy commentary and Marine propaganda that the book expounds upon. The book really taught me nothing about what these men went through. It represents the vague recollections of the author's and other experiences. Not enough meat in it for my liking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sniper books","review":"Extreamly disappointing. I have read several other books on snipers and I would recommend all before you read this one. He rambles on and on with details about broader subjects than the sniper action. Very little about sniper activity. He does set up the way that snipers were used in war, but very little story about the actual action that snipers were involved in. Read any book about Carlos Hathcock and you will enjoy those 100% more. I will read no more books by Culbertson as his writing style is booring. Seems as though he is telling the story to a well informed high ranking officer who is interested in all the division names and who reported to who. Was hard to follow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many repetitions","review":"'13 cent killers' suffers from too many repetitions, from chapter to chapter and even on the same page - even the explanation of the title's meaning is repeated. Why? All this - filler - seriously takes away from the reading experience. This is sad because the narrative is excellent and all business when it comes to the details of various missions and the task of being a sniper in Vietnam. However, many other details are probably aimed at other Marines and offer little meaning for other readers. The final disappointment appears when you flip through the 12-page glossary and conclude that it carries no entry for the M-16 assault rifle."},{"rating":"1","title":"MAC MARINE","review":"John Culbertson never served as a sniper in Viet Nam in my opinion, He went to division sniper school and came back to H 2/5 and was in my Platoon untill he left Nam. I can not recall ever using him as a sniper! His purple hearts was also under suspicious circumstances. I was with 3rd Platoon H 2/5 from Jan 1967 untill Feb 1968 and as a leader I can tell you that PFC Culbertson was never entitiled to as much personal info as he indicates!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another opinionated book by this author","review":"Here we have yet another book by Culbertson. It's poorly written, has a tendency to jump around, and is, basically, a biography of this man's lover, Tom Casey. It's sad, really, how much this author tries to make a martyr out of Casey. As a sniper in the U.S. Army, I've read just about every book about snipers, and this book, along with SHOOTER by Jack Coughlin are by far the worst written. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn...","review":"While I am glad to see another book about the 5th Marines in Vietnam, the saying goes, if you don't grab a reader within the first few pages...well, they tend to quit reading or throw the dang thing against a wall. As painful as the ordeal was, I actually read it and my opinion remained unchanged to the bitter end. I mean no dishonor to the valiant Marine snipers the author writes about. Every single Marine Sniper who served in Vietnam is a hero to me--not just the infamous Carlos Hathcock. Sadly, the author's writing disability gets in the way of the stories he recounts. To me, 13-Cent Killers pales in comparison to earlier books by some of the Marine Corps finest--other true heroes, including the author himself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't anyone read these before printing?","review":"I seldom write reviews, but this book cries out for it. The actual \\"13 cent killer\\" part is ok, except the author repeats himself throughout the book. But the book constantly puts in the author's personal opinions about the war and the people running it, and he makes potentially libelous remarks ... without citing a shred of evidence to back it up. If he wants to write a political commentary on the Vietnam War, with supporting evidence, a bibliography, etc., more power to him, but defammation unsupported by any cited evidence is inappropriate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perpetuates silly stereotypes and firearms myths","review":"I am not an authority on Vietnam, but I am an avid hunter and competitive rifle shooter. Many of the details in this text are wildly inaccurate and more fitting for a hollywood b-movie than a book that claims to be historical. Just one example is the reference to Vietnamese soldiers being lifted off their feet and thrown backwards through the air by .308 or .30-06 rounds. This claim and many others like it are laughable to anyone who knows anything about firearms. Mr. Culbertson needs to stop watching re-runs of \\"The A-team\\" and research his facts, or else drop the pretense that he is writing history."},{"rating":"1","title":"bitter and disjointed.","review":"For a book about a deadly business, this one is boring. it switches from place to place, is repititious, and switches from first to 3rd person, for some reason.For some reason, without naming names, he denigates Carlos Hathcock, another Marine sniper, claiming he either did not exist or did not do all that was claimed in the 2 books written about him by Charles Henderson. The Marines thought enough of Hathcock to name a building after him. A Marine Officer I met, who wrote 2 books of his own about his experiences said Hathcock was real and probably did a lot of stuff not in the books.For a extremely interesting book about Marine sniping I recommend Silent Warrior by Charles Henderson"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written, bitter, amateurish","review":"John Culbertson is a novice writer who is so desperate to fill pages that he intentionally tells the same story twice; at the beginning and the middle of the book, because the story \\"bears repeating.\\" He blethers on about hippies, Army Generals, The President, the Military-Industrial complex, college professors, the Army and Navy, REMF's, until he reaches the conclusion that himself and his close associates were the only true patriots in the war.

Lightweight read, nothing deep. Generally poor writing, on what could have been an interesting and insightful series of events. The author repeats himself a few times and I got the impression the 'book' is a combination of a series of essays, often on the same topics/people/events. The author is in desperate need of a good editor and guidence. A fascinating theme but the result is disappointing. Nothing outstanding and full of the usual American fixations.

While there are some fine photos which cover, naturally, the entire 20th century (the subject was born in 1900 and still lives!) their chronology in this book is immensely flawed, as if seemingly by a mixmaster.

Well, you've found it. 'How dare you?' stands up against the very best that 10cc has to offer. With only the occasional lapse in concentration, the band present us with another classic body of work. With enough hooks to snare the harshest critic, it's all aboard for a ride through pop standards, lavish production numbers, tight harmonies, and technically adept guitaring. 'Art for art's sake', 'Lazy ways', 'Rock and roll lullaby', and 'Don't hang up' stand up to the test of time particularly well, but if that's not enough for you then 'I'm Mandy fly me' should do the trick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chronograph works... doesn't tell time","review":"I received this watch with much anticipation.

My old Dell desktop give-away speakers seem to be as good as these, you know, the ones that seem to stack up with all the old computers one seems to have over the years.

The title track is actually good and the close of the album is good, but there are too few bright spots in between."},{"rating":"1","title":"how oarful!!!!!!!!!","review":"When my mother plays this albun she is 'all over the place' . when mah fatha cums in da barthroom jibbering 'when ah get aulder loosening mah heir man, Years from now' I think hees attit again.There is nogood songs here at all and there4 this CD is bleeding oreful!!!!!!!Eric Sykes. age 4"},{"rating":"2","title":"not good enough","review":"When I listen to this album it sounds like the Beatles were jaded from too much songwriting that they felt like being sarcastic and pretending to be fictitious characters and that left George Martin with the creative responsibilities of making average material sound interesting with his studio tricks and distinctive psychedelic/classical production and that's what people see as being revolutionary about this album.Sgt.

IT SOUNDS DIFFERENT, DISAPPOINTED."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Cover is Great, the Music Drags","review":"It is primarily nostalgia on the part of 40+ year olds that results in the high ratings for this album. The times were different and the cover of this album was a breakthough. Unfortunately, the music contained herein wasn't so inspiring, as it is dominated by ditties such as With A Little Help From My Friends, Fixing A Hole, and When I'm 64, and supposed innovation on Lucy in the Sky, Mr. Kite and A Day in the Life. Other bands were producing much better music, and this record really hasn't stood the test of time. Sounds dated. 2-stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't Play On A Computer","review":"I can't comment on the music quality because I can't get it to play on my computer. The file format is .exe, not .wav or .mp3 or .ogg or any standard audio format. I can't believe they used a proprietary .exe format that only works with Windows! I've tried four different music players but the only thing that will play is the little video. My computer can't see the audio files to rip them to my harddrive, either. The same holds true for the remastered Revolver CD. Very disappointed!EDIT: I found a keyboard hack that allowed me to access the audio tracks in .ogg format and rip them to my HDD. So it can be done, but nobody should have to spend hours researching the internet just to play a CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Observations","review":"Just a few observations on the album and the reviews.On the album: The music alone simply cannot account for the popularity of this release. It isn't that consistently good. I've noticed that everyone who says it's great tends to overlook its obvious flaws (Within You, Without You anyone?) The popularity of this record has more to do with its release being at a memorable time (the war, summer of love, psychedelia, etc.) than the music. Nostalia sells.Finally, sorry, it's not a fact that everyone loves the Beatles. And yes, it is up for debate regarding the appeal of their music. 2 stars"},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent recording; FAIL on packaging","review":"This is a great CD - the sound is crisp and clean. If you have an older CD, then this is the one to get.EXCEPT.Whomever decided to save a few bucks by replacing a jewel case with a cardboard sleeve should be taken out back. The point of the case is to PROTECT THE CD. A cardboard sleeve not only doesn't protect it, but it actually damages it. Wherever there's a seam in the sleeve, the CD will get scratched. Wherever the seam is glued, glue will leak out onto the CD when the package sits in a hot delivery truck.This is what happened to me. The CD arrived scratched and covered in glue. Fortunately, the damage was on the data track, so I had a chance to listen to the music before I had to return it.I will avoid buying any CD/DVD/BluRay that comes in a non-jewel case like the plague. Sure, it is eco-hostile (plastic never goes away, it just floats in the great garbage patch forever), but there's no point in buying a plastic disk only to have to return it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning","review":"For those who here have \\"reviewed\\" this masterpiece of modern music, and found it too trippy, retro, or whatever, you are sorely mistaken. In fact, it is in my view impossible for someone not around in the late '60s to have any appreciation at all for what this album did to popular music---it turned it on its head and changed everything. This album simply cannot be judged from today's perspective--so much of what has transpired since the release of this record was born of it.

I have to say it is one of my least favourite Beatles albums, and I would urge anyone not to make this their first purchase, try Rubber Soul or A Hard Day's Night instead.Lucy In The Sky is a decent enough pop song, Fixing a Hole is quite good, but there's little else here of note. It's a bit of a sloppy album, and the Pepper concept is a little pathetic.I'll get shot down in flames for stating these opinions I'm sure, but I stand by them, it's a heavily over-rated album. Ask a room full of Beatles fans what their favourite Beatles album is, and very few would say Pepper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sgt Pepper revisited.","review":"I bought this remembering what I thought about the Beetles and boy was it a disappointment. My gosh they weren't very good were they; rather amateurish and just not very good musically.The songs were good and I did enjoy revisiting the album which I hadn't heard in over 20 years.

It's just not that great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Masterpiece???","review":"It strikes me amusing how beatles fans nitpick other bands albums and call something like this a masterpiece. A masterpiece huh? based on what? A day in the life? that's a good song but most of these songs are just experiemntal. The rolling stones, the doors and led zeppelin made better albums than this and they're not considered masterpieces. So stop bashing other bands albums to justify your love for the beatles.

The voices pop out at you, and the instrumentation is clear, crisp and complex in its' simplicity. It becomes evident just how much of a range John and Paul's voice have. For the first time I heard Paul's technique and mastery of the bass; I finally hear how integral and necessary Ringo's drums are. I can't wait to hear the other cd's I recieved and order the remaining ones I need to replace my older editions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be Honest About It","review":"With all due respect to nostalgia, if one is honest about it there are two (yes, two!) good songs on this album: Sgt. Pepper and A Day In the Life.Given the artist and the time that's lapsed, this piece has become bigger than life, and it's really unwarranted. There is a try at psychedelia with Lucy, but it's really only the title that invokes anything psychedlic, and the rest of the album is just filled with average offerings: Mr. Kite, Fixing A Hole, Getting Better, Help From My Friends...zzz. We also have to suffer through George's Within You, Without You.Look, the cover art is neat, but don't confuse it with the music. 2-stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"CLEARLY OVERRATED","review":"Why so many people keep saying this album is so great ?? It's nothing more than the great Beatles playing around with studio techniques and, consequently, losing all their spontaneous creativity. The sound is very bad, RIngo Starr's drums are worse instead of better !!! Most of the songs try so hard to be great that they are boring most of the times ...I prefer even the album \\"HELP\\" or \\" ABBEY ROAD\\". I admit that the album opened up possibilities for rock."},{"rating":"2","title":"MASTERPIECE!","review":"We will still be talking about this album and listening to it in awe a 1,000 years from now. This is the APEX of popular music. Its finest hour. Forget what they say about Revolver, Abbey Road and all the other outstanding Beatles albums.

And, \\"A Day In The Life\\" IS THE MOST AMAZING POP SONG EVER RECORDED."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Pepper album...........","review":"It is always interesting and amusing to read all of reviews written by mainly Kids that were never even around, when this recording was made. Lennon himself made no bones about this, at the time. He scoffed at the notion that this was a \\" Concept Album\\". He always said that it was a collection of Songs, and that it \\" didn't go anywhere, other than the Opening, and the Reprise, at the end\\".

It is clean, crisp, and far more spupperior than most remixes of this Album I have heard. Also, there was a copy of the Beatles \\"LOVE\\"CD with this CD. Not sure if it originally shipped that way, but it was a very pleasent surprise. Having never listened to \\"LOVE\\" I found it to be an ecclectic mix of some of the finest Beatles' songs ever written. Some wierdness on it, but George Martin and his sone were definetly experimenting, as if the days when they originally were mixing Pepper were back. I will be enjoying this for a long time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"BETTER MEMORIES","review":"In order to take a trip down memory lane, when the Beatles were at their (drug-induced) prime, I bought Sgt Peppers.

I just wish I would have heard from the seller a little sooner. In this day and age with scams and all, it made me a little nervous when I had to send two emails to confirm my purchase. Other than that - awesome!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pushed the Boundary and Succeeded","review":"This is the Beatles' signature album. If not considered their best, it is considered one of the most important in pop music history. Originally produced as a response to the brilliant \\"Pet Sounds\\" (can you top this?) the Beatles extended the limits of music. To argue whether \\"Pet Sounds\\" or \\"Pepper\\" is better is irrelevant as both are great. Unlike the CD packaging of the other Beatles CDs, this one is good. It contains background info, alternate photos, etc. The music does not seem to have aged as well as some of the other Beatles' CDs. Perhaps this is due to this album's over-familiarity. However, this does not diminish the fine quality of the songs and does not take away from the historical significance of this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little overated? Yes. Bad?

Only bad thing here is that this cd is open to immature people like MTV Supporter saying that no videos from this get played on MTV. first of all, I don't think they made videos of it, and second of all, even if they did, MTV wouldn't play them because MTV has no idea what good music is.I know I didn't have much to say about the cd but I can't say much about this that hasn't already been said.out..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dated audio trash","review":"This is a worthless album.

Its kind of weird that i dislike Sergeant Pepper so much because I really liked the Stones Their Satanic Majesties Request and Pink Floyds Piper at the Gates of Dawn. To me those albums had more beauty and imagination. Sergeant Pepper is just very dull and cutsy.The songs are all trite and petty,the album has no mood and little atmosphere. The songs are so childlike that I cant imagine kids enjoying them.The main problem that I have with this album is that its just not interesting.Even the cover is dumb. It has no beauty or darkness, it is pure silly drivel. Even A Day in the Life is dull and well, lifeless.

The only reason people think this album changed music forever is becuase it sold more then others. But a lot of other records that came out at this time sound not to diffrent from this album.

If you're in search of \\"rock as art,\\" consider Led Zeppelin, a band whose best albums make this seem like the stuff of a middle school talent show.

What it is, however, is a marvel of artistic and technological achievement; a better album than anyone is likely to ever make on 4 track tape machines and analogue editing. With this album, the group took POP music (a much larger genre than good ol' ROCK) by the collar and yanked it abruptly into an entirely new environment, one that high brow musicologists and low brow stoners all had to acknowledge. It changed the way everyone has listened to or made pop/rock albums since. Sure, 30 years on in an era of extreme cynicism, alot of folks hear this and wonder what all the fuss was about.

As other reviewers have noted (but still give the CD 5 stars because it's the Beatles), these are weak tracks.The CD recovers strong with Sgt.

Pepper was heading out into the world...\\" (speaking of the summer of 1973). Well, I have always wanted a copy of that album -- so that I could listen to it straight through, and get a better idea what the Kevin Arnold character was talking about.

I put it on our Sears StereoPhonic Turnable (how modern!) amd adjusted the bass and tremble controls.Of course, I had every album to date, and was nervous about this new one. Would it be better than the last one?? Would I like it?I played all the songs....and then.... \\"A Day In The Life\\" came on. I was mesmorized! It was the BEST song I had ever heard!

It is full of silly and forgetable songs. With the notable exception of Sgt. Pepper..., With A Little Help..., Lucy in the Sky..., and A Day in...That is it. The rest are fillers. That is four great songs against seven mediocre at best. I will never understand the hype surrounding this album. It is regarded as the best Rock and Roll album of all time, a real masterpiece, a piece of art, etc, and it really is a let down to me. Rock or Rock and Roll it is not; pure pop/bubblegum stuff. I dig the cover, though. I know the majority of you Beatles fan out there will disagree with me, but this is my opinion. You must admit, as I did as a fan, that this is The Beatles at their worst."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sgt. Pepper","review":"The oom-pah band behind behind When I'm 64, the fumbling sitar on Within You Without You, and the orchestra behind She's Leaving Home don't exactly make for great rock music.

Overall, many releases from the late 60s have held up much, much, better."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Undisputed Champion of Overrated Albums","review":"I fell for the hype myself a long time ago, but it didn't last long. Apart from A Day In The Life and A Little Help From My Friends, who really listens to this anymore? It's pretty damn fluffy and incredibly pretentious at the same time. A triumph of production to be sure, but stuff like Lovely Rita or Being For The Benefit Of Mr. Kite haven't aged at all well and led to further silliness like Magical Mystery Tour. The most thoughtful track is George Harrison's Within You And Without You, but even that is a tough slog to sit through. Antiquated and often cutesy arrangements are also a problem, and maybe a product of too much acid on everyone's part. If you want prime Beatles, go to Past Masters, Abbey Road, parts of The White Album, and a couple of tracks of Let It Be. This is really overblown and not worth it at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sgt. Pepper","review":"\\"If it weren't for Sgt. Pepper, progressive rock would never have existed\\"?.

The lyrics and melodies are infantile and grating, not to mention repetitive. When I hear songs like Lovely Rita, or Good Morning, Good Morning, I cant help but think they are best suited for kindergardeners. The one exception to the album is \\"A Day in the Life\\", one of my favorite songs of all time. This song is brilliant beyond description or compare, and redeems this album, making it a necessary purchase, unless you're willling to tape that one song.

This album just flows so well, and it's a joy to listen to simply brilliant songwriting - something you don't get much of these days. Everyone knows of the revolutionary production techniques. Unfortunately, this was probably the last time the Beatles truly worked together as a team (arguably \\"Abbey Road\\").

Vocals and instruments faded in and out or are missing altogether. Doesn't anyone listen to these before they are sold to the public? The poor mixing and production were no where close to the vinyl original in what I consider a blasphemy. I know this album by heart and as a long time musician I am sorely dissapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sgt. Pepper","review":"Far, far, far from the best album ever made. People say it captures the feel of 1967 psychedelia, but not as well as Hendrix's \\"Are You Experienced\\" or Cream's \\"Disraeli Gears\\". People say it is the world's greatest concept album, but it's not even in the same league as Pink Floyd's \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\".The fact is that there are some good songs here (A Day in the Life, Sgt.

This album, even if you hate it is worth the respect of serious music lovers, yes even classical music lovers. I do not own a Bob Dylan album, but I respect his talent and his influence on pop music and society. Think he influenced the Beatles at all?!?!? Sgt. Pepper is not my favorite Beatle album, but it is a classic and a must have for any one considering listening to the Beatles catalog. Because it is so far removed from MTV, it seems trite or maybe out-dated, but believe me, in 1967 it was a master piece of gigantic proportions, and is still five star listening material. It changed the way everyone made or listened to music. Yes, there is a reason why the Beatles are still popular, but do not hate them for it. Listen to their genius. Sgt. Pepper is good listening because it is well produced, well written and performed, and yes...it takes you back a little if you are old enough to have been there in 1967!"},{"rating":"2","title":"you had to be there when it was released","review":"...to fully appreciate how revolutionary this record was. The advance press had everyone prepared for something out of the ordinary but Pepper was still a jaw dropper because it sounded so different from everything recorded before it. The biggest pop act in the biz ignored all conventions, including the love song, and ignored many recording and songwriting conventions in the bargain. As usual, the Beatles set the pace and everyone else worked like mad to catch up. The proof is in the songs, of course, and some people don't like the songs because the songs are generally about everyday experiences seen from new angles. Is this the greatest rock'n'roll record? To whom and who cares! It's a great record and that's good enough for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had More Potential","review":"If Fixing A Hole, She's Leaving Home and Within You Without You had been replaced by the best songs on Magical Mystery Tour (Hello Goodbye, Penny Lane, Strawberry Fields, All You Need is Love), which was released only months later, this would have been a 4 star album.

If this is art, I'm Da Vinci...","review":"I've always been amazed how many people want to refer to this album as a 'work of art' or 'concept album' only because they've been told that's what it is; not because they've actually judged it for themselves. I've also noticed that the people who show evidence of having thought it out realize it's just a bunch of cartoony drivel. A couple of the mindless pop tunes are decent: \\"Little Help\\" and \\"Lucy in the Sky\\" for example (although Elton John's version of \\"Lucy\\" puts this one to shame). But come on, let's not pretend Sgt Pepper is anything other than what it is: a bunch of mediocre pop songs that were packaged and marketed as 'art.' The Beatles trying to be artistic have always been like Bob Dylan trying to sing, or Charlton Heston trying to act. They can't do it worth anything, but they're widely accepted anyway. Why? Who knows."},{"rating":"1","title":"art?","review":"Rock? Art? If you want to call it that. Take it on its own terms. Don't compare it to a symphony. It is what it is.And what is this music?

Some of it is pop, and the rest, well, is ragtime, Indian, etc.Second, the real \\"art\\" was being released by Jimi Hendrix (Are You Experienced) and Cream (Disreali Gears) in 1967, which have certainly stood the test of time better than \\"When I'm 64\\".The song \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\" is great. So is \\"A Day In the Life\\". You can get these on the Beatles greats hits compilations. And those are the only two songs you need out of Sgt. Pepper.

I ordered six of the new vinyl remasters and Sgt. Pepper was one of them. All of the others sounded absolutely amazing, but this one sounded atrocious. The bass won't come through without serious static, the highs sound like they're scratching on the way out of the speakers, and it just sounds horrible. Now, I don't think that all of the new Sgt. Pepper albums will sound this bad, this was just a problem with my particular copy.

In fact, they are the Beethovens of the the 20th century. There is no way around it. So, for all you Heavy-Metal, Grunge rockers, remember-you don't have to like the Beatles music, but without this, you wouldn't be listening to anything of that sort.

It's possible that \\"Revolver\\" or \\"Rubber Soul\\", or the white album, or whatever you want, are better. I just say this to show that I'm not \\"contaminated\\" by the hype that makes people react and give it only one star. And now, listen to the title track and its reprise. Listen to \\"With a little help from my friends\\". Listen to \\"Lucy in the sky with diamonds\\". Listen to \\"A Day In The Life\\", the greatest piece of so-called \\"popular\\" music of the 20th century. I mean it. People will still be listening to it in centuries to come.

While this is great, the rest of the album doesn't really rock.If you haven't heard this, don't expect the sound of the early Beatles that made them so popular. When I'm Sixty Four is like some ragtime number. Getting Better and Good Morning, well, are being used as commercial jingles now. Within You Without You is almost universally agreed upon as the weakest point of this album. Fixing A Hole, Lovely Rita, and the Benefit of Mr. Kite are OK, but kind of mediocre.The summary is that this album starts strong and finishes strong, but there's a huge valley in the middle on tracks 7 & 8 (Mr. Kite and Within You Without You) that is tough to get over.Biased Beatle fans give this 5-stars, which is fine, but it's really a 2 or 3 star album."},{"rating":"1","title":"All Time Overrated","review":"While it can be argued that this album may have proved to be the major catalyst for the flower power generation. As far as I am concerned it's the most overrated piece of vinyl ever released. I also love all the bloated, pseudo-intellectualized analysis put forth in an effort to legitimize the worth of this over produced mass of noise.

It was ground breaking when it was released in 1967 (I was 13) and is still fun to listen to today. It had all the lyrics on the back cover. It covered all sorts of styles from hard rock (Sergeant Pepper) to sitar music with George, to pop deities like Lovely Rita and Getting Better. If you love rock/pop music and want something to make you feel alive and put a smile on your face, this is the CD to get."},{"rating":"1","title":"get something better","review":"this cd is ok, but i'd recomend KoRn much more than this especially \\"follow the leader\\" or the self titled album \\"KoRn\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another remaster disaster","review":"Almost every 'remastered' CD I have bought is horrible, and worse than the original releases (with the exception of the Dire Straights CDs).As is the case with the Genesis Trick of the Tail CD, there is no bass, and the highs are exaggerated beyond belief, accentuating sibilance to the point of extreme irritation. DON'T BUY THIS CD! Try to find the older version.I am incensed at this recording and how once again the remasters are a failure.Be sure you understand what \\"helpful\\" means before you say this review is not helpful. It doesn't mean you agree with me!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Vaguely Interesting Mis-Fire From Usually Consistent Band","review":"George Martin's pristine production saves this disappointing follow-up to the classic \\"Revolver.\\" Song content consists of embarrasing odes to travelling shows, imaginary bands, and psychedelic songs about plants and nature, all with negligable emotional resonance. Band quickly saw this artistic path as a dead end and headed for more rewarding territory on \\"The White Album.\\" Still beloved by a minority for some obscure nostalgic appeal, it's lasting influence is only visible in such minor performers as Lenny Kravitz and Klaatu."},{"rating":"1","title":"knock off","review":"This album sucks. It's a total rip off of Pet Sounds. What, did Ringo write the whole thing. They should have kept Stu Sutcliffe. Enough Sitar already. Plus, what the heck are marshmallow skies. Who is this Mr. Kite guy anyway, and what posseses him to waltz with a horse. Really, now."},{"rating":"1","title":"no respect","review":"The lyrics are about all that this band had going for them. This by most definitions is NOT rock music- this is pop, plain and simple- it's this nonsense that led to the untalented Ricky Martins, Lou Begas and Backstreet Boys of today.Plus, I cannot respect a band who fires their original drummer (Pete Best) because he was too talented."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so big ...","review":"The Beatles were great. In the greater scope of their work, I don't think this album is so much better or worse than the others. Much to the contrary, I don't like it. It has so much studios gimmick running around, we can't possibly know who is playing what in each track. Boring, indulgent and mindless album."},{"rating":"2","title":"essential","review":"Believe me,I'm by no meens a diehard Beatles fan(in fact I'm more into the Stones), but everyone should hear this album. If anyone is at all into or at least interested in the Beatles then they have heard this album. Is it important? YES! Is it good? LISTEN TO IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"YOU MUST HAVE THIS CD!","review":"It is not because I want to fit in with the majority that I say this is my favorite Beatle album and one of the best over-all of all time. It's because there are so many good songs on it. Out of the 13 tracks on this album, there is only ONE that I don't like (How many other albums can you say that about?), which is George's heavily Indian influenced \\"Within You Without You.\\" The others are simply great and fun to listen to. One person on this board has said that songs such as \\"Lovely Rita\\" are \\"silly,\\" or that \\"When I'm 64\\" is \\"hopelessly retro.\\" These are two of my favorite songs on the album BECAUSE of those qualities. Songs like these help you forget all the sometimes drab realities of life and just have FUN. Another of my favorites on here is \\"Sgt. Peppers Reprise.\\" I usually don't like reprises, but this one just makes you want to get up and dance. If you own no other Beatle CD's, go out and get this one. You won't be disappointed. :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic!","review":"Sgt.Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band has it all. Clever lyrics, catchy tunes, this is very Beatles. A must for any first time buyer, songs range from She's Leaving Home to the title song, to Within You Without you. Truly a Beatles classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEATLES' MASTERPEICE","review":"One of my all time favourite albums.I love the sound of it from beginning to end.No Beatles album collection would be complete without this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is evolution at its best","review":"When you hear this album, you will be so amazed at the experimental level of the beatles. This album is not equal to any album you have heard and you will find that many groups have been very influence by these tracks. This is the beatles at their best. Excellent from begining to end. Highly recomended."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Mecca of all recorded albums!","review":"Plain simple, this could be easily the best album ever recorded, just only for its influence. 40 years and still fresh and daring.This is The Beatles as you've never heard them before, or probably after (and the first ever album to have the lyrics printed in the back cover). Psychedelic, urban and extremely brilliant. Get this album and experience not just music, but a whole cultural movement.NOTE: Im not a blind fan, and I'll be clear. To me one song of the bunch doesn't work, and that'll be \\"Good morning good morning\\". The Anthology version is far superior and cleaner although the guitar solo in here is really awesome. Its just the string and horns arrangements and the weird farm animal sounds that seems very out of place. But anyway, in spite of that, this must be the most important album ever (even if by today's standars of music sounds pretty dull). Period."},{"rating":"2","title":"This sacred cow is actually good","review":"I'm not much for worshipping sacred cows. I wouldn't call PET SOUNDS or DARK SIDE OF THE MOON masterpieces, even if \\"the experts\\" say that they are. And I don't really care if SGT PEPPER is the birth of modern pop music or important regarding the evolution of artrock.I just think that the songs on SGT PEPPER are really good. Good enough to get 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band","review":"The main reason I got the Sgt. Pepper's album is because of the accolade that it's number uno on Rolling Stone's magazine of \\"500 Greatest Albums of All Time,\\" but I don't agree with them. It's a matter of opinion of course.You have your slow catchy melody \\"With A Little Help From My Friends,\\" a song I first heard by Joe Cocker, you got the classic \\"Lucy In The Sky with Diamonds,\\" you got your optimistic \\"Getting Better,\\" you got the spectacular rhythm of \\"Fixing a Hole,\\" and the rest of the songs take you on a creative journey. Other catchy Catchy songs that I liked were the wonder of \\"When I'm Sixty-Four,\\" upbeat \\"Lovely Rita,\\" the brilliant \\"Good Morning, Good Morning,\\" and the extraordinary last track."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad pressing quality","review":"My copy of SGT Pepper had similar quality problems as described in other reviews -- horrible surface noise, one channel cutting on/off, spindle hole off center so doesn't spin properly. I returned it -- the second copy better but not great.Also had similar issues with the White Album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good But Overrated.","review":"The Beatles were one of the best bands around back then and still are today. It's essential and most of the songs are good but it's extremely overrated. I'd pick Revolver or Abbey Road over this any day. It was very unique for the time, that's why it's more popular. Some people don't like The Beatles because they think they're overrated. Their music is popular for a reason and most of their music's good, even their most overrated. It's not the very best though, their music before Sgt. Pepper doesn't get as much attention. Rubber Soul and Revolver are amazing, those are five star albums. Fixing A Hole, She's Leaving Home, A Day In the Life, When I'm Sixty Four and Sgt. Pepper are the best and are great songs however Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds and With A Little Help From My Friends are overrated in my opinion. After all this was one of the first albums in psychedelic rock and it popularized the genre but now it sounds outdated in parts. Revolver holds up with age much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Beatles Production","review":"Sgt Pepper was a brilliantly conceived and produced LP way back in 1967.There is an amazing feel about the album.It has not a weak moment on it.All saying this I don't know why the MONO mix was not issued with this CD as it is stronger and has a better sonic sound than the stereo mix."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lighten up on George...","review":"Mostly every review I've read was dissing George's song \\"Within You Without You. Lighten up, it's not that bad of a song, I like it, & it's not that long neither, I've heard songs longer then that, & they're not bad. I wish George wrote some more tracks for this album, he's not a bad writer at all. I just got this album, & it's really nice.I like mostly every track on this album; I think the song \\"With A Little Help From My Friends\\" is so cute, I can play that song over & over again, it's a happy song. I also like the title track; & \\"Getting Better\\". \\"She's Leaving Home\\", is a nice song too. Overall, this album is very well done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not their best","review":"When Sgt. Pepper came out I was 12. I liked it a lot back then. Now that I've been exposed to life I see how blatantly self-indulgent the Beatles were in this album (the fans' feedback was permanently removed from their process after 1965). But still, Sgt. Pepper is an okay effort. The tracks from this album that have stood the test of time are \\"Getting Better\\" and \\"Lucy.\\" But nothing on Sgt. Pepper ranks up there with the power of such songs as \\"In My Life\\" & \\"Yesterday.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"The most overated album in rock history","review":"I guess if you appreciate music this album is a let down. If you prefer listening to Pink Floyd's \\"Ummagumma\\" ,with all of it's \\"groundbreaking\\" soundeffects over something with more musical integrety-say \\"Exile On Main Street\\" then I'm sure Sgt. Peppers will be right up your alley. I would take any Beatles album from '65 up over this collection of corney carnival tunes. After the first three songs it's all downhill. The most overated album indeed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One word: Outfake!","review":"This caused a storm of controversy when it first hit the collector's market in the late 1980's. At that time, Sgt Pepper outtakes were very few and far between, so here comes this LP which promised alternate mixes from the LP (not just the usual alternate mixes from the released MONO version). So I bought it (my seller almost stopped me because I was such a good customer, but didn't want to say anything with another customer close by) and take it home and give it a listen. This is nothing more than a poorly done remix of the Pepper LP to give the illusion of being outtakes, but are nothing of the sort. Whoever did this should be ashamed of themselves. Bottom line, this album is absolute garbage. Don't buy it, buy the Anthology CD's instead for the real thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sgt. Pepper","review":"If you like light pop music along the lines of Fixing A Hole or When I'm 64, this album is for you. If you are looking for good 60s rock music, look elsewhere. A Day in the Life and the title track are good, but they don't save the album. Sgt. Pepper sounds more dated than any other Beatle album, with the possible exception of Rubber Soul. 2 stars"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Stones \\"Exile on Main Street\\" is a far superior album","review":"\\"Peppers\\" can't touch \\"Exile\\" as an album and should not be even considered among the top albums of all time. The Beatles work depended on heavy studio production, and this album is no exception. Go to the Stones section and pick up any one of their myriad albums and you will not be dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stick with the Vynl","review":"The songs don't flow like the vinyl. For example there is gap from SGT Pepper's lonely hearts band to With a little help from friends. The vinyl version flows right into the song were as the CD there is a silent gap.The packaging is nice and yes it's better that the CD versions from 20 years ago. But the Vinyl version is still better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sgt. Pepper","review":"VH1 did a poll of hundreds of music luminaries and Sgt. Pepper ranked #2 of albums released in 1967. While this ranking seems a little high, there are a handful of good tracks on here that can be picked up on one of the greatest hits albums to avoid the filler on Sgt. Pepper. 2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware","review":"... because while the beginning and end of Sgt. Pepper is good, the valley in between is very wide. It's as if the producer put the weakest songs (Mr. Kite and Within You Without You) exactly in the middle of the track listing. Beatle fans make excuses for them such as \\"they are different\\" or \\"if you listen to it 10 times it starts to get not so bad\\"...but they are weak..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beatles on Drugs","review":"So I bought the mono box set and heard this album for the first time in its entirety. I was prepared to be disappointed and was still disappointed. With this box set I've gained a new respect for the early albums while later work is hit or miss and this album misses for the most part. Little help from my friends is a good song that Joe Cocker made fairly great. LSD is a great song don't get me wrong but the only other one I like is a Day in the Life so I can't give this more than 2 stars despite all the hoopla. I've listened to Rubber Soul for the first time also and it is really a great album though I still think Revolver is better, Revolver being a stunning work in my opinion. Magical Mystery Tour is actually (much) better than Sgt Peppers but it came out after so doesn't get groundbreaking credit... or something. I just find the Sgt Pepper songs lacking, self-indulgent with little redeeming value."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band","review":"I think that Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band is the Beatles' best album. I first heard this album when I was six and after I heard it I wanted to hear other Beatles albums like Help! and A Hard Day's Night (both great albums). There is not even one standard song in Sgt. Pepper's, every song is great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timely, timeless.","review":"I agree with the reviewers that say it is pointless to review this album. But the Beatles' music makes me at least want to take the opportunity to say \\"Wow.\\" Sgt. Pepper is both timely and timeless. The forays into sound experiments were certainly influential and intriguing in their time (and in many instances, still intrigue) but strip all the production away and you're still left with wonderful songs. Great melodies, engaging lyrics...in fact, one of the great accomplishments of the Beatles was how incredibly well their music complements their lyrics to create something even greater as a whole. Whether you like the Beatles or not, whether you like Sgt. Pepper or not is, as always, a matter of personal taste. But you're doing yourself a great disservice if you don't listen to their music and listen again. This album is so inventive, so solid, so well-crafted, so influential and so enduring you would have to be arrogant or small-minded indeed to give it anything but a top rating."},{"rating":"2","title":"A truly creative masterpiece..but it sounds better in MONO","review":"All I can really say is....If you like this stereo mix....You will probably like REVOLVER and MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR as well....it isn't that hokey \\"music-left/vocals-right\\" wannabe stereo that I have been ragging about....This is actually listenable and enjoyable....The remastering job is pretty good...The biggest flaw is that it tends to be a bit too airey...Some people (me included) have stated they prefer the MONO version of this album.....but unless you are prepared to buy the COMPLETE REMASTERED CD SET in MONO (which is pretty costly)...You better stick with this version.....as you wont find the mono version anywhere else.....until they decide to issue the MONO versions individually.I would say....All in all...it's worth the investment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best album ever","review":"This without a doubt is the greatest album ever. It got me into music. This album changed my life. MUSICS finest hour."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sgt. Pepper - 1967","review":"\\"I gave Pepper five stars because I don't believe that the Beatles are capable of making an album with less stars.\\" Oh, please.First of all, there are a number of Beatle albums, although good, that don't rate as high as some of the best works by numerous groups of 60s & 70s including Led Zep, Pink Floyd and Hendrix. What unbiased reviewer would rate \\"Yellow Submarine\\" 5 stars?As far as Sgt. Pepper - the first track is great. The last track is great. The middle of the album is very mediocre. Two tracks can't save the album, but they each get a star. And this album has dated over time. It sounds old, while the better 5-star albums still sound fresh."},{"rating":"2","title":"A true classic, but not the best.","review":"I don't usually tend to agree with the idea that this album is the greatest album of all-time. Don't get me wrong, there are some great songs on this album that were made into even bigger hits by other artists then they were for the Beatles(Elton John:\\"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds,\\" Joe Cocker:\\"With a Little Help from my Friends\\"). However, there is no doubt in my mind that this is not the greatest album of all-time. Other then the two songs that I just listed, other good songs featured on this album are the title track,\\"Getting Better,\\" \\"Fixing a Hole,\\" and one of my personal favorite Beatle songs \\"A Day in the Life.\\" Any song that is about an LSD trip has got to be great. Other than those songs the rest of album is pure filler. It's not necessarily there worst set of songs but it's certainly not their best. Nevertheless, Sgt. Pepper will always go down in history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"This is a great album. To someone earlier who said Hendrix was better: consider what Paul McCartney said, \\"The greatest compliment was when I saw Jimi Hendrix play a club in London, and SGT. PEPPER had been out only 2 days. And Hendrix opened the show playing the song SGT. PEPPERS LONELY HEARTS CLUB BAND.\\" So even Hendrix liked this album. If he liked it, the rest of us who like it must have pretty good taste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cant Match Pet Sounds","review":"This was the Beatles effort to out-do Brian and The Beach Boys on Pet Sounds.

Break away from your generic \\"originality\\"!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dated","review":"If you were around in 1967, buy it for the nostalgia. If not, I guarantee you that it will sound old and dated relative to today's music, as well as the music of the 90s, 80s, and 70s, and even some of the good music of the 1960s.Track by track:Sgt. Pepper - good, really rocks, sounds good even todayHelp From My Friends - datedLucy - touted as psychedelic, but not reallyGetting Better - adequate song now used for commercialsFixing A Hole - weakShe's Leaving Home - not rock, weak orchestra backed songMr. Kite - very weakWithin You - self indulgent song that Paul/John had to let George put on the album64 - weak, vaudeville like song. Doesn't belong on a rock albumLovely Rita - adequateGood Morning - zzzSgt. Pepper - good, but just a rerun of track oneDay in the Life - two unfinished songs by John and Paul that George Martin spliced together. OK.Altogether was OK in 1967, but dated 35 years later as expected."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Album of the Millennium","review":"If people had been making albums for the last 1000 years they could not have made a worse album than Sgt.

Myself being a lover of rock music I realized some of the messages being conveyed were satanic. Notice on the album cover of this album, there is a picture of Aleister Crowley (top left second person)the biggest Devil Worshipper who started a satanic following. Listen to the lyrics they sound innocent but listen closely. The message given is \\"Start A Revolution\\" \\"Do What Thou Will\\", Those are teachings of Crowley, also notice the statue on the cover (bottom right under the BEETLES) That statue is mentioned in many of crowleys teachings. Guess who Sgt Pepper is... Yup Crowley!! Notice the lyric \\"It was 20 years ago today...Sgt Pepper taught the band to play\\" Just wanted to give a warning to those who didn't know!

Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band' topped nearly every single magazine Best Album list, which amazed me since 'Revolver' and 'Rubber Soul' were far superior and were usually relegated to much lower positions on these lists. But lately, music critics have realized that this is, in fact, not even close to a top-ten album.By Beatles standards, this is the second worst album they released (Abbey Road finishes dead last). While I admire the experimental recording techniques, the bulk of the songs are twee and silly. Plus, there are NO rockers on this album! At least the Stones indulged in some rock riffing on their own sub-standard psych record 'Their Satanic Majesties Request'.For some GOOD psych, research The United States of America, Love, Silver Apples, Tomorrow, Red Crayola, Hollies, Amboy Dukes, The Creation, Smoke, The Move, The Action and West Coast Pop Art Experimental Band. These bands have what the Beatles failed to deliver."},{"rating":"1","title":"If might be influential","review":"But I just can't get into this music.

Probably not, but I will add my two cents, anyway. As most people are probably aware, this album always ranks at or near the top of any poll taken about the greatest albums of all time. There is a good reason for that, because this album is a masterpiece. Is it the Beatles best album? Maybe yes, maybe no. It's hard to say, because the Beatles have 5 or 6 other albums that are contenders for \\"Greatest Album of All Time\\". There isn't really a consensus among Beatles fans as to what their best album is.

From the opening of the title track until the reprise it is clear why this is one of the classic records of all time.With such well known songs as \\"With A Little Help From My Friends\\" and \\"Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds\\" some other songs \\"Being For The Benefit of Mr. Kite\\" get overlooked. From the humorous and thoughtful \\"When I'm Sixty Four\\" to the haunting \\"She's Leaving Home\\" and \\"A Day In The Life\\" this record shows the range that makes The Beatles so special in rock."},{"rating":"2","title":"The greatest of the greats!","review":"Frankly, the album has obviously secured itself the \\"classic\\" title. Honestly, how could it not? While many feel it to be over-rated and pretentious, the impact it had on pop-culture, and the impact it continues to have, is simply massive. It is a fair assumption that there will never be another band like the Beatles, and by extension another album like Sgt. Pepper. While this is rather sad, it's also for the best. Anyone who loves the album shouldn't have a problem with this fact, as they can simply put on Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band; thirty-nine minutes of music that changed the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Country meets jazz/surf","review":"Redd Volkeart's album No Stranger to a Tele (a play on The Strangers, Merle Haggard's band, which Redd plays lead guitar in) shows off his wide range of influences, from 40's jazz to songs that sound like they came from a Ventures album. Everything has a basic honky tonk counrty base, naturally, but the instrumentals (my favorites by far) have a wide pallette of sounds from Redd-hot chicken pickin' to Charlie Christian to whammy pedal driven surf licks Nokie Edwards would be proud of. When Redd sings he has a nice, smooth old-time country baritone voice. He's not quite Merle, but them who is? All in all, fans of tasteful Telecaster guitar will find this a true delight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"While it is certainly a matter of taste, this CD is rather boring. Being the great tele player that he is, Redd could have done much better than this piece of typical draggy Nashville sound. If you like good tele playing that sounds like hell then get yourself \\"The Nashville Guitars\\". Only the title song \\"No stranger to a Tele\\" comes remotely close to the awesome sound of the guys of \\"The Nashville Guitars\\". The rest sounds more like Chet Atkins forty years ago.

I was caught up once again in the lives of the two young boys as they fought to overcome ignorance, prejudice and injustice - and of course, the most powerful, evil man in their hometown. Through scrapes, fights, dog attacks and narrow escapes, the characters learn something about themselves, and the men they want to become. The interaction between the boys is delightful. Their rough and tumble comraderie brought many a smile to my face. There is also a powerful moral lesson to be learned about shame and how it can prevent people from embracing those closest to them. \\"A Dirty Deed\\" is a book that can be enjoyed by anyone, young or old, male or female. The storyline will pull you in until you find you can't put the book down until you finish it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magical, mesmerizing, leaves you spellbound....","review":"I've heard so much of Francesca Lia Block and this is the first book I bought which was written by her. Her writing style is beautiful and unique. Tt makes you want to just go on reading and not stop. \\"I Was a Teenage Fairy\\" tells a story about a girl who, with the help of her fairy friend, Mab, explore the wide world out there and overcome obstacles in life.However, I found the book to be slightly confusing at times. Block used a lot of \\"metaphorical\\" language and it sometimes seemed as if the story line was not clear enough. I didn't quite like the ending because I found it too \\"rushy\\". Everything just ended with a woosh, like when someone talks without pausing to breathe. One thing that bothered me was that there was no specific \\"ending\\" to the relationship between Barbie and her mother. Instead, it focused more on the \\"transformation\\" of Barbie to Selena Moon. Overall, it's still a good book and will leave you feeling all magical inside."},{"rating":"2","title":"best book ever","review":"this is one of the best pieces of writing i have ever read in my life. the description is fabulous and every word written sounds like a song. its beautiful and fantastic and undescribable how wonderful this writing is. read this book now if u appreciate good descriptive writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"nice try, francesca","review":"I have read close to all of this authors books but this one left me disappointed. Block's lyrical writing fell short this time. I felt like I had read it all before. Enough about the jacaranda trees, Francesca, we get the point. Purple trees in LA. Maybe I didn't like this book b/c the writing style was just an attempt at recreating her other books. A lousy attempt. Or maybe it's b/c I live in LA and I know what it's like already. But it all just seemed to cliche to me. The stage mom and the uninterested girl. It's been done. I really didn't feel that the characters developed at all. They were presented and weren't displayed in any more depth for the rest of the book. Oh well, there's always Weetzie. (However, if you've never read any of her books before read this one. You'll enjoy it b/c you won't have such high expectations. And then read the rest b/c it will just get better and better.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Drink it up fast and deep","review":"I don't know how she does it but she does and her writing comes out liquid and dripping of Ambrosia so sweet that you drink deep and deeper until there isn't any left and then all you have left to do is sit back and sigh.Her writing style is like \\"extract of novel\\" mixed with sugarary syrup. She takes the horrible things that give us nightmares and makes them fantastical.When you read I Was A Teenage Fairy, you won't even know which parts of the story are real and which part the story teller is embelishing on. In truth the whole book could be pure fantasy, but there will be a little nagging voice in the back of your mind whispering \\"what if...?\\" the whole way through.Worth a sip or two or three..."},{"rating":"1","title":"A truly disappointing effort from a remarkable writer","review":"Readers of Francesca Lia Block's gorgeous, lyrical prose will be sorely disappointed by her latest novel. This book contains little of the offbeat charm and irreverance of Block's earlier works; even her normally beautiful language seems stilted and pretentious. The characters in the novel are one-dimensional and Block, usually so good at evoking emotion, does not seem to be able to rescue them from the confines of the page. Much of what makes the novel so disappointing is the feeling that she has rendered all of these characters much more fully and luminously in her other works. I'm not sure if Block is finished with the Weetzie Bat series, but if she is looking for a new series of characters, she hasn't found them in \\"I Was A Teenage Fairy.\\" Those new to Block's work should try \\"Witch Baby,\\" \\"Cherokee Bat and the Goat Guys,\\" or \\"Missing Angel Juan\\" to glimpse this extraordinary writer at her finest."},{"rating":"2","title":"uNiQuE & sPuNkY!","review":"I thought that this book was a lot of fun to read. I enjoyed all the characters very much, but my favorite was Mab (a pinkie-sized fairy). She was so spunky and truthful, what's not to love about a mini teenage girl that speaks her mind? The story itself was tragic, but with characters such as Mab, Barbie, Griffin, and Todd, it was a very exciting and colorful book to read. I recommend it to anyone who is interested in modern fairytales and likes to be entertained."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I have been a fan of Ms. Block since Weetzie Bat, and I anxiously await the arrival of any new book. Unfortunately, IWATF was a huge disappointment. Her choice to give her main character the painfully obvious name of \\"Barbie\\" seemed like a slap in the face. How unoriginal. And the name of the book itself was irksome, a goofy title where magic could have been made. On the whole, I found no truly loveable characters and felt everyone was too spoiled to care about. Violet and Claire continued the trend, and now I hope upon hope that her next book will return to the punk rock slink-chunk charm of Weetzie Bat or the lyrical mystery of The Hanged Man or the inspiring magic of Girl Goddess. Anything but this."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Book I Have Read...","review":"this book was the best one from all books I have read..It's about a girl named barbie who..NOOO im not telling what's it about..you go get it..you'll love it..really..trust me.. :) READ IT!! you'll really enjoy it.."},{"rating":"2","title":"inspiring","review":"This is such a beautiful book.

It has very strong profanity, sex, drugs, alcohol, masturbation and homosexuality. All of which, I feel are not suitable for young readers. As an adult, I found this book to be offensive. Our Middle School has removed the book from its shelf so that no other 11-14 year old can read this subject matter. In my opinion, it condones drinking, drugs, profanity and sex in our teenagers. Parents please be aware of what your children are reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"fairy of a teenage girl","review":"I Wasa a Teenage Fairy by Fransesca Dia Block was a very magical, invigorating, bizarre, and startling story.

Her mom didn't make it as a model and thought she could fix her mistakes through her daughter. When she was about 8 she met a fairy named Mab. Mab was about 4 in. tall with a 8 foot tall sex drive, she had the attitude of a girl with permanent p.m.s.Something happened at one of her modling shoots that would change her forever. Barbie wanted to tell her mom but couldn't, Even if she wanted to her mom wouldn't listen. If it wasn't for Mab all of Barbies feelings would be locked up inside.16 year old Barbie, more beautiful than ever still being forced to model.

I hope the next book is better then this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fairy Tale?","review":"I'm sorry, but I can't follow the crowd on this one. I really didn't enjoy it. I found it disjointed, distasteful and disappointing. Let's face it, the fairy type creature Mabs was a bitch. She was never happy, was constantly whining and was generally in-fairylike. I mean, fairy tales are supposed to be uplifting. All little girls either want to be a fairy or a princess. Had they met this Mabs character they would all narrow that decision down to being a princess.And what about the main character? Miss snooty model? I don't know, there was something off putting about every character in this book. Even if they all do live happily ever after by the end, I see divorce, drugs and alcoholism in their futures. Anyway, I would suggest this book to nobody and am even feeling leery about passing it along to Value Village in case some poor sap picks it up for $2.99."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best, most enjoyable,classic, intriguing book I've ever read","review":"First off, let me start off by warning you.

It wasn't very involved and seemed like it would have been more accomplished if it had been a children's story book complete with illustrations and such. It was like she started writing this book for a group of friends as a christmas present - complete with allusions that only they can understand in unmentionable detail - and she decided to publish. It left me the whole time wanting more. She gave everyone an out, even villains (Washed-Up-ExModel-Mother and Molesting-Fashion-Photographer) who some people would rather see horribly punished for their crimes against the Pop-Teen-Set... it was a great piece of pop culture that seemed to be written in an unaccounted for MiddleSchool style... I wanted so much more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eghads","review":"eeek. Let me start with Block's writing. It is completly prestentious and skin deep. I have read so many of her books and am yet to like on of them. She makes me feel like she thinks we will fall for her big, overly descriptive words. To tell you the truth, I don't think there's much going on underneath the visuals and words of this story or any of Blocks peices. They are very sad tales with insanely happy ending. They are written to cater the teenage mind, as if the teenage mind is a model wannabe idiot. It seems to me that the author assumes we arn't paying attention to the words... that's my opinion..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Reading","review":"I bought this book for my 15 year old grand daughter and decided to read it before I gave it to her.

This poor young girl, Barbie, has a wretched stage mom, and a completely uninvolved father. She's forced by mom into modeling, left alone at 12, then molested by the photograper!!! Her mom's answer to this is \\"life is full of problems, deal with them\\". Even the fairy, Mab, says horrid things to her, and encourages her at 16 to drink, smoke and have sex!!!I cannot believe this is on middle school reading lists, and I'm no prude, this book shouldn't be suggested to anyone under 16 at least.

The editors inspired me to branch out in my knitting, to try hats and socks, and to try new techniques in my spinning as well. Although each project is designed by a spinner for handspun yarn (and includes information on spinning a suitable yarn), the editors also provide excellent recommendations for substituting commercially available yarns"},{"rating":"2","title":"homespun happiness","review":"If you are a handspinner of wool yarns, this book is an invaluable resource. Many patterns written for use with commercial yarns simply don't work with handspun. The patterns in this little book are classic, adaptable, and well suited to the special characteristics of hand made yarns, which tend to be less elastic and \\"drapey\\" than factory products. They also work well when knitted oversize and then felted.

Only 4 tracks off this album appear on the 100+ track Onobox, and Yoko doesn't have that many albums.Avoid this and get \\"Walking On Thin Ice\\", her greatest hits set, which has Hell In Paradise anyways.

The album features a wonderful blend of that unique jazz/funk sound which fans came to know, love and really only identify with the band, as well as some deep, and seemingly very personal moments. Such tracks as \\"Lying Still\\" and \\"Good Man in a Storm\\" (incidently, my favoutites from the album) leave a most eerie yet calming refrain. Two massive hits, \\"Something About You\\" (which went top 10 in the USA) and \\"Leaving Me Now\\" feature on the album This is a record that grows on you the more it's played.

I remember getting the greatest hits album in high school and wondering why \\"Too Much of Nothing\\" was on it. It seemed so out of place. Now I understand.It is interesting to hear their version of \\"Reason to Believe\\" - a great piece of material. The two Paul Stookey tunes - \\"Hymn\\" and \\"Love City\\" are the best thing on the record. They sound true. While his solo version of Hymn on a later album was a little better, there is an introspection about this version that can't be matched.Thank goodness for \\"Album 1700\\".

It was also interesting when in one part of the book there was a group that had all humans, vampires, and withces united together as one! The book really makes you think and it tought me that not all people have the same veiws on life and how it should work! It is a great drama also... I couldn't wait to see what was going to happen to Meilinda when she was out hunting for vampires and then I also was paying attention to the thing going on between her and Christopher!!

Called Sony CS Support and because it was no longer under warranty they gave me some troubleshooting to try. One of them was to replace the battery which was done and didn't help.

There was crackling on the handset and the volume seemed to oscillate on its own. I exchanged the phone and the sound of the replacement was no better. I moved both phones to different locations and it did not seem to matter. I then exchanged the phone for the Sony SPP-SS966, which is Digital Spread Spectrum and has much better sound quality but is not as attractive or as ergonomically correct.

Often he writes, that something will be explained in another chapter. This is a bad design of a tutorial. He has some good tips and tricks in that book, but if one is a beginner with Win32-API he must read too many things a few times until he understands them. Dan Appleman's book seems to be a little better for beginners."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book for those starting out with the API","review":"If you are new to VB or just haven't used the API much and ready to start this is a great book for you. It is inescabable that this book is compared to Appleman's book which is the definitive work on API's but while I have the Appleman book I find that it is better for people who are already somewhat experinced and want to learn more. This book by Jason Bock is THE book to buy if you are starting out. Not to say it is a 'API for Dummies' type of book -API usage is a non-trivial subject- but this will give you the foundation you need in a much more digestible fashion. The Appleman book which I occasionaly dig out to try to figure out something, spends most of its time as a paperweight since I am still something of a newbie. This book by Jason I am actually using to learn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book to get you started actually doing it.","review":"While Appleman's book continues to be the definitive =reference= book. This book offers some real world examples of how to use the Win32 API to not only do things that you can't do with VB intrinsic commands and controls, but also to subtantially boost the performance of things you could do with regular VB. Specific examples are worked through and type conversions are explained within this context.I'd recommend it to anyone that's thinking the API might have something more to offer than current directory information (they'd be right).I wouldn't use every example in real life, but there are plenty I would use, and all are excellent examples of what can be done.DISCLAIMER: I was a technical reviewer on this book, and, as such, am somewhat tied to Wrox and the quality of the end product. Rest assured, however, that I don't get any perks from this review, and the opinion is mine and mine alone.Rob Vieira, MCSD, MCT"},{"rating":"1","title":"Kohler Revival Faucet","review":"This is the worst faucet ever made.

With references, (sometimes not so subtle) to the culture of blunt-loving teenagers just trying to make it in spite of what we thought was a world against us, the comedic aspect is paramount. The truth is, many teenagers poke fun at issues to help them get through rough times...relationships, sex, (self-imposed or otherwise) confrontations with peers or the police. All are issues we dealt with regularly, (in my case) in much the same manner as The Pharcyde.

As an animal artist who prefers to paint from life, I frequently need to advise my clients on basic obedience for their pets. Mr. Dibra has written his book for pet owners and not professional trainers so it is easy to read. I have painted dogs of every breed and description and when owners used the techniques I recommended from this book I noticed a considerable change in the pet's behavior on subsequent sittings. There are no frills or controversial new training methods here, just solid, proven advice. It is a must for every first time dog owner or anyone who just wants to review the basics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprisingly outdated","review":"As I read this book, I kept turning back to the copyright date because I found it hard to believe that the training philosophy Dibra espouses is still being promoted. These techniques are old-fashioned; most respected dog trainers have long since moved on to an approach that encourages the dog to think, not to be pushed into position and then \\"corrected\\" if he does not learn from the experience of being pushed around.There are so many better books out there--please keep reading to at least get a well-rounded view of dog training.

Because it teaches you how to interpret your dog's feelings, by understanding his or her verbal and non-verbal cues. Once you understand the pattern you can establish the rules of behaviors that are acceptable and those which are not.

This one was by far the most tedious, uninspiring and frustrating! There was no consistency in the storylines and the ending, well, what WAS the ending? It was a relatively long book for Grafton and the ending should have been wrapped up a little more neatly.

The plot was so thin I figured it out immediately, and it was so easy to see through Mariah that I couldn't believe Grafton had the nerve to make it so obvious. I have greatly enjoyed all the books in the series up until now, but in my opinion, this is by far the worst.

With P IS FOR PERIL, Ms. Grafton takes some chances. While the book seems on the surface to be a typical Kinsey Millhone story, Sue Grafton writes this book in peril. She tells a solid story about Kinsey being hired by a doctor's ex-wife, recommended to her by a long-ago client to find a missing person, the prominent doctor who has vanished without a trace. The story also involves a potentially dangerous near-romance for Kinsey, but Ms. Grafton's greatest risk of peril comes with her final plot twist.

In fact, the last several books (say, from \\"L\\" on) have seemed too short and underdeveloped compared with earlier books. Like many other readers, I thought a lot had been left out. I figured out who did it and why as soon as she described these characters, and I think it would have been interesting if she had developed the lesbian relationship instead of alluding to it on the last page. A lot of other characters appeared and then disappeared, such as Dow's daughter Blanche. Why did Kinsey never consult the psychic? Why did she even interview Blanche? Why did Sue Grafton even write about it?

Considering she left everyone of her readers hanging on an abrupt assumption leaving us no choice to make up our own ending. This reader feels that makes all of us co-authors and entitles us to partial proceeds of the sale of this book.

As far as I could tell, Kinsey's \\"breaks\\" in the case came mostly from luck, the deductive reasoning of Sherlock was less apparent in this character than the bumbling of Watson. Too many story lines were introduced and none of them developed to their potential. Grafton has the beginnings of three great novels in this book, and an ending that says she had a deadline to meet.

He is married to a woman named Crystal at the time of his disappearance. Kinsey investigates several motives, including some shady financial dealings at his work and an unhappy marriage. A second plot revolves around Kinsey's plans to rent office space from two brothers, who are hiding a grisly secret. The search for Dr. Purcell occupies most of the book, and Kinsey finds a lot of dead ends as she investigates his family and business connections. The relationship with the two brothers is more suspenseful but that subplot ends in a rather [bad] and unsatisfying manner. The solution to the disappearance of Dr. Purcell moves very slowly until the end, when Kinsey has a sudden revelation, seemingly something she had not considered during her investigation. Though not the best book of the series, this one is still a good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"This was a very disappointing novel from Sue Grafton.

I'm sorry I bought it. Ms. Kaye reads with ridiculous pauses that brought me back to the overdone acting of William Shatner in the original Star Treks. I do not recommend this Audiobook. Read it on hardcopy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Least Favorite of the Series","review":"Having read all the books in the series, I must say this is my least favorite. I read it on my iPad and when I got to the end of the story (or lack thereof) I thought it was a technical glitch. After a bit of googling, it turns out there is no conclusion, no final summary from Kinsey, etc. The reader was left to figure it out for themselves (which was not difficult).Interesting literary technique, but had no value add in this case."},{"rating":"1","title":"My 1st and probably last Grafton read","review":"I listened to this story on unabridged audio and the ending was so lacking, I honestly looked to see if there was a tape I had yet to listen to.The author goes into such extreme details as to tell the reader that the character used the restroom, (like I care, like it has any bearing at all on the story), but then ends the story abruptly, without details or any real explanation at all.Thank goodness, it was only $1 at the used book store (I can see why). Give me Nevada Barr or Elizabeth Peters any day over Grafton."},{"rating":"1","title":"HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED !!!!","review":"The plot of the story did not unfold basically until the end. I would have put the book down after the first couple of chapters but I wanted to complete it since I spent my money on it and now I want a refund. This was a terrible mystery!!!! actually it was not a mystery it was a very descriptive story big on detail and very wordy no action, drama, or suspense. It was a waste of my time. This was the first book I read by this author and I will not torture myself by reading another one."},{"rating":"1","title":"read at your own peril","review":"Well, as far as books go this was not really that bad of a read. It just didn't grab me and not let go as most of Grafton's works have. As usual I very much enjoyed the Kinsey Millhone character. In fact I wish she were a real person so I might meet her some day. But the overall plot and especially the ending just didn't do it for me. The first few pages held some promise. Missing doctor; ex wife hires kinsey; young current wife seems indifferent; teenage daughter is out of control...so what else is new? You get the idea. Kind of intresting, but it just bogs down and just seems too contrived for a SG alphabet mystery tome. Again, I must remind you to keep this less than flattering review in perspective. Because Sue has done better, P is for poor."},{"rating":"1","title":"P is for Pass","review":"This book was very disappointing. If you are considering purchasing it I would reccommend that you \\"Pass\\" on this one. Though I like Kinsey, this story feels old and tired.

When I finished the book, I was left unfulfilled. The two main plots never intersect (there are actually several other subplots regarding the relationship between Dow and his family members). I was left with numerous questions such as Dow's relationship with his employers and their relationship with crime, and Krystal's daughter and her relationship with Dow and his money. While I can guess at most of the main points, I would appreciate not having to guess. Please tell Ms. Grafton to go back to epilogues. In fact, I would love to have one posted to her website even now.I also found Kinsey's relationship with Dow's first wife totally unrealistic when Kinsey was hired by Dow's second wife.Like others, I enjoy Ms. Grafton's style and wit. But this is surely her worst of the alphabet series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aren't you being a bit hard on Ms. Grafton?","review":"I agree with most of the critisms others have posted about P is for Peril(the ending is vague, I'm not sure of the killer's motives,the book is padded with endless desciptions of rooms, and Kinsey seemed to discover clues as if she were pyshic) However, this book is not as bad as they would have you believe. The subplot with the Hevenger brothers is the more exiting and menacing part of the book. Fiona is a great character. (She should have been in it more) I laughed out loud when Kinsey was hiding under the desk in the nursing home.

Very unsatisfying and NO character growth for Kinsey Millhone. No correlation between the title and the plot that I can see. Yeah she eats at Rosie's, skips the gym and eats junky sandwiches but almost as a gratuitous bone thrown to the reader. My advice is to borrow it, check it out of your library or wait until it's in paperback. It's not worth the hardback price.Sue Grafton should be allowed one dud and this one is definitely it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Has it Ended Yet?","review":"I was very unsatisfied the ending or should I say non-ending of this book. I even went to my local book store and scaned several copies to make sure my copy wasn't missing the last several pages.

This book left us all hanging and my only hope is that Ms. Grafton's next book is titled Q is for Question no more the ending of P . . . I will clear it up for you in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Best in the Alphabet series","review":"Like many of the other reviewers, I've read all of the alphabet series.

Some of this book reads like a printout of driving directions from mapquest...\\"I took such-and-such road to another road and stopped. I looked left and then turned...\\" who cares??? She drones on and on with minutiae which drag out the story and bore the reader. The rest of the book is like reading the weather forecast, as the reader is subjected to minutiae regarding the clouds, the mist, the rain. Big deal. Who cares? Boring. Pedantic. Predictable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreal Characters and Plot","review":"I'm a Kinsey Millhone fan, but this novel is warped. The subplot destroys what could have been a good one. So Kinsey's attracted to Tommy? I could not believe she would change that attraction to her dumb-dumb vigilante mode INSTANTLY--on the word of a total stranger! Why didn't she at least go to Texas and nose around? Then she wouldn't have been suckered by a femme fatale con artist, who herself was unreal. (The \\"insurance investigator\\" is so smart and sharp looking, but with a dumb low-life brother?? Come on.)I guess Grafton wants us to think Kinsey's infallible, but no one is, and that's why we have a Constitution and courts, folks. Where's Grafton been? Last I heard, juries were convicting the retarded, the insane, and the innocent, and these poor (people) were getting death sentences--ESPECIALLY in Texas. Come into the real world, Sue. Put Kinsey back in jail a while, and let her see what's really going on."},{"rating":"1","title":"p is for pedestrian","review":"In keeping with most other reviewers I was deadly disappointed by this book.Sue grafton's style has become pedestrian and lacked any cutting edge to it.Kinsey's character has not developed in any way and the writing was old fashioned and mundane.Kinsey seems to have no friends apart from Henry and compared to other female PI's lacks humour.The plot was unexciting because Ms Grafton did not care about the characters.And if SHE didnt HER readers certainly couldn't.I much prefer Dana Stabenow's heroine Kate Shugak and Caroline Aguilera Garcia's sassy Cuban heroine. Sorry Sue it is with great regret that I will not be buying the rest of the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"P is for....","review":"PLEASE...somebody who pretends to have understood the ending, explain it here. Start your review with a disclaimer not to read any further if you don't want to know the ending. Those of us who seriously thought we'd gotten a book with missing pages at the end would like your insight. If you're one of the reviewers (a minority to be sure) who thought the ending \\"subtle and clever\\" you should point out what clues the rest of us missed.Until I hear from you, I'll have to conclude that this book had no ending. It was a murder mystery that (at least for me) didn't answer any of the \\"who\\" \\"how\\" and \\"why\\" questions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grafton is back in top form","review":"After a disappointing O is for Outlaw, Grafton writes another great chapter in the Kinsey Millhone saga. The story was thoroughly enjoyable, and included all the characters.The ending was different. This time, Kinsey does not \\"sign off\\" in a postscript chapter, and the last page was vague. In fact, I even compared my book with a new copy because I was convinced mine was missing a chapter. Aside from the unsatisifying ending, the book as a whole was excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Reading","review":"I think P is for Peril is a very well-written book. It's a mystery and I haven't read that many mysteries lately, but I liked this one. The main plot is that Dr. Dowan Purcell has been missing after he left a nursing home. Instead of being hired by his current wife, Crystal, Kinsey Millhone is hired by Fiona, his ex, to find him. Then there is also the part about Tommy and his twin, and Kinsey finds out about their dark past.This is the first Kinsey Millhone mystery I have read, and I think she did a great job. Grafton gets you into a book and you just want to know what's going to happen next. Now that I have read this book, I think I will go and grab one of her earlier ones before reading Q."},{"rating":"1","title":"P is for Painful","review":"I've read/listened to every other Kinsey Milhone story and liked most of them, but this one really disappointed me. This is the only Sue Grafton book I would say was a stinker. It was rambling and crammed with dull details and I had to make a real effort to finish the book. I listened to the unabridged audio version and when I got the \\"end\\" I was afraid that perhaps I had listened to the tapes out of order and had missed something. The narration was also pretty flat.It was lacking in the usual wit and cleverness, with too many characters to keep straight, vanishing plots, a whole book of red herrings. Kinsey came off as pretty unlikeable. It was as though Sue Grafton got tired and decided to just stop where she was and say \\"The End\\".I hold out hope for \\"Q\\" but will read the reviews before buying instead of after. New readers to the series should start with \\"A is for Alibi\\" and just skip \\"P\\" altogether."},{"rating":"2","title":"P is for Peril","review":"I just finished reading Sue Graftons \\"P is for peril\\" and I enjoyed it very much.

This book is a little longer than Grafton's norm, and it's really three mysteries rolled into one. The well-liked Dr. Dowan Purcell is missing, and we don't know whether he left town voluntarily, whether he committed suicide, or whether he was murdered. There is also an intriguing development with the two men who are leasing Kinsey her new office space. As always, Kinsey observes the world with her characteristic sense of humor. The characters are so well drawn, they leap off the pages. There is a surprise in almost every other chapter, the pace is breathtaking. Never before in a book has Kinsey been so wrong in her initial perceptions, but she perseveres and in the end, she figures it out--and the reader goes along for the ride. And I did love the subtle ending. Well, well, but of course, I said to myself...It is SWEET. Way to go, Sue. Can't wait for Q."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"The story wasn't bad, it's just that the book ended abruptly.

So I went to The kindle store and bought the book only to find there is no end to the story. This was confirmed by a friend with a copy of the book. So now I'm frustrated that I read the whole bloody book and the author opted to not finish it. I feel ripped off after going and buying the book again for $7.99 and I still have no resolution. Grrr. Very disappointing. Especially after really enjoying the series up until now."},{"rating":"1","title":"P is for Pathetic","review":"I like Grafton's books. They are not as heavyweight as Nevada Barr or Sara Paretsky, but I have read them all and am currently enjoying U is for Undertow.My advice is to skip P is for Peril. It seemed pointless and boring. Another reviewer wrote that she had just switched publishers. Maybe that explains it. Something in the process was definitely missing for this one. It gives the impression she shouldn't have bitten off the obligation to write 26 books in the series. Thankfully, the later books have improved."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Grafton Yet","review":"I can't imagine what I'm doing writing what appears to be the 255th review of this book. I mean, what more can I add? I feel compelled, though, because this one is superior.I've read each of the Sue Grafton books, A through P, (actually I've read Q, too) and I think this is the best one yet. The plot is extremely complex but also extremely clearly laid out. PI Kinsey Millhone makes her investigation without seeming to do much--clever lady. And further, she gets involved in TWO mysteries, one completely unintentionally. It will come as no surprise to you that she manages to sort it all out. As a retired physician, I was pleased that she tackled, among other things, the currently hot subject of Medicare fraud.I do find myself wondering, though, what Kinsey Millhone will do when she has reached Z. Maybe she'll start with primary numbers which, I'm told, are infinite.

There's no law against dragging an old manuscript out of the filing cabinet - I personally wouldn't like to live in the shadow of a contract requiring 26 books - but I think the author and her publisher could show her readers a bit more courtesy than this.

Saw II has the same style cinematography and editing (which is quite irritating), minimal character development(which is a key factor to building suspense), one predictable horror movie cliche after another, the fact that they show the mysterious killer all through the movie(whose brain fart was responsible for this catastrophic mistake), sadly the scary factor goes quietly down the drain. One good thing Saw 11 has going for it are the death scenes that are sometimes interesting, nasty and inventive.

With a wide range of traps and scenerios presented to the victims, this series is one of the great horror ones in years! This is a must buy, and forget renting movie. Remember in the 80's with all the slasher movies? After the first movie they all got really silly and tried too hard to be many things, instead of great horror.

But I had my worries. I loved the first one, but unfortunatly this doesnt come to the standards of the original. I have noticed how people have compared the original Saw to the film Cube with its similarities. Saw 2 not only has similarites, but looks almost exactly like it. People locked in a house full of traps, entering the first room to get to the second. Sure this film is a lot better than Cube, but it could have done a lot better than this. Throughout the film when something big is about to happen, it just comes across different death scenes like slasher films. Saw is NOT a slasher film. Saw 2, however, follows in its footsteps, finding an easy way out. Its like they just want to get this film over with. Saw 2 still has a neat ending but also added something a little silly to it.

The twist is so expected, even if you can't figure it out, that it doesn't have the same effect as the first movie. While the twist is mildly clever, the completely disgusting effects doom this movie from the beginning and it never fully recovers; a terrible movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ehh HD-DVD is better","review":"Glad I chose HD-DVD over the lame Blu-Ray, Batman Begins (which is waay better than Saw II isnt available on Blu-Ray.

The bad guy wants people to change their ways, so why not open a counseling center; no, instead through some source of funding and high understanding of electronics, etc...he puts together grand schemes in which people get killed. The ending of the movie was a complete joke. Why would one of the abductees work for someone that tried to kill her? She was thrown into a pit of needles and still she plays along; I think she would have just given up. Innocent people die around her and she doesn't care to help them. Also, the people in the house work against eachother for some odd reason,rather than help eachother out. Where did the bad get the nerve gas and antidote. Nothing like that is explained. I think in the next movie they should have everyone work together and then defeat the bad guy/girl. Finally give us some satisfaction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Saw was SO much better!","review":"Kind of boring, not as unique and creative as the first \\"Saw.\\" Wouldn't recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Creating/Ruining a Franchise","review":"The biggest problem with the movie is that it's a painfully obvious attempt to cash in on a surprise hit.Of course, most of the greatness of Saw was made by its twist ending. In this one, we get another one. It's a twist I found extremely disapointing and unnecessary. (But of course... it was put in to say there will be another one...)What made the first movie so great? It didn't follow a formula. What made this one bad? It follows a formula.Whereas the first one did so much with so little, this one does so little with so much.I can't honestly believe that they thought the movie was going to be better by simply multiplying the number of victims.What we get here is a bunch of pretty WB type faces, reacting overly dramatic, getting unexpectedly killed one by one.

I like the S.W.A.T team scenes and the traps and twists! After bailing his son out, Detective Eric Matthews finds out where Jigsaw is hiding, but for Jigsaw, getting caught is part of the game. Eight people are trapped in a house. Included in the game are Amanda from the original, Eric's son; Daniel, Xavier, Obi, Gus, Laura, Addison, and Jonas. They all must find an antidote for the poison gas they are breathing. Later, Xavier chases Amanda and Daniel to the classic Saw bathroom.

Slightly unrealistic characters but, nonetheless, a good edge of the seat thriller.Unfortunately, \\"Saw II\\" was a bit of a letdown compared with its predecessor. The plot was too far fetched and the traumas often too predictable. It's one of those cases where the child fails to live up to live up to the parent.

There wasn't a single believable moment. The directing / editing were atrocious. The dialogue...come on, who ever says any of these things? The acting -- egads. The villain was absolutely the only character who was remotely interesting, but they destroyed this by making him deliver the most ponderous speeches imaginable.

They seemed more focused on getting the viewer to get sick or puke, rather than making them crap their pants out of terror. I still bought it and have no regrets about doing so, but would have liked to see a more scary horror movie.

Check the periodicals index from the year (listed in the book) that the Doss's were named family of the year. The story has always been inspirational, not just because of the love shown by the family towards each other, but because of the faith they showed in the face of seemingly insurmountable problems.

I find myself drawn so fully into this story that I feel I am experiencing what it is like to be God, in a universe where \\"nobody who knew that I was... but I was.\\" Vivid illustrations splash a riot of vibrant colors to express the way spirit finds form in the physical world, as the words transport me into the mind and very heart of God. The most precious gift of BECOMING ME is summed up best in its pages: \\"Sometimes you realize that you are me.\\" This book has a message so priceless that I'll enjoy it with my daughters for years to come... and keep long after they've grown up and moved off on their own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid....is a bad word","review":"The Stupid Family....I think that is a horrible title for a story about any family.

The word Stupid in itself is awful and shouldn't be used. My 5 year old who is in all day kindergarden had a project this week...to turn off the television and to read books. I took my daughter to the library today and we did a scavenger hunt of 8 authors....Harry Allard was one of those authors. Viola Swamp was easy to understand...but the Stupid Family isn't.

Strong bop flavor, with a bit of west coast cool overtone. Worth checking out, particularly for Dexter's performance."},{"rating":"2","title":"A true classic recording","review":"This is a great example of West Coast Jazz of the 1950's with an East Coast flare. The rhythm section is impeccable, a perfect groove provided by leader of the session Stan Levy on drums, tasteful comping and soloing by pianist Lou Levy anchored by the huge sound of bassist Leroy Vinegar. The horn line is in rare form with Conte Condoli on trumpet, Frank Rosolino trombone and long tall Dexter Gordon on tenor sax. My personal favorites- Monk's \\"Ruby My Dear\\", a perfect framework for Condoli's warm trumpet sound and \\"Stanley The Steamer\\", a cookin' blues feature of chorus after chorus of hot steamin' tenor sax by Dexter. Rosolino shines through out. The charts are a perfect blend of West Coast Cool and East Coast Heat. I first heard this album as a young man in the 1950's and lost track of it until the 90's. It has held up very well over the years. Great recorded quality, a warm to hot mix of some great classic jazz. Originally on Bethlehem records. Very cool cover art."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice session","review":"This is the 2nd of three recordings Levey did for Bethlehem.

Unlike my friend who was irish, this band is from England. However, there are several similarities. Both are well packaged, spirited, somewhat funky, and know how to get a groove on. while I am not fond of rap, I found the addition of MC DET to be a nice touch. With the exception of the first track, his rap is more subdued and he isn't rapping about murder, rape or other acts of violence. If there's a downside its the inclusion and possible over use of electronics which, at times, sounds a little dated.

Listening to this album and you find yourself within the inner ear of an encyclopedia of inspiration-its sources and results. Making Bones is jazzed up with improvised and inherent energy and yet so undertoned and nuanced by the gods of chill that you can listen to it while waking or sleeping. It is a bellicose album for the passive, the peaceful search for meaning in chaos and deconstruction. Amongst the sounds of bass, guitar, horns, drugs and the minimalist use of samples, these label-dodgers, artful in their undertaking, reproduce the sound of electronic music on live instruments and take the listener past so many different styles-- so many stories-- the majority of which are pure instrumental.You never miss a voice.I'd opt for this as a soundtrack, my choice for an album for the next century."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is \\"our songs\\"","review":"Nigh fifteen years ago, Barbara and I married.

The best example of Eleanor's work that the author gives is that she \\"could shake a hundred hands in a receiving line\\" and that she \\"gave more teas...than any other First Lady\\" (3-4). The first two chapters, set before Eleanor was even born, belong in some trashy Victorian romance novel, and some of the most important characters in her life are either given only a passing mention or left out entirely. Direct quotes have no citations. At best flat and uninteresting drivel and at worst offensive, sexist and tacky, this book seems to perpetuate gender stereotypes that Eleanor fought against.

A commanding officer in the situation presented would never act as Jackson does here, moreover a marine as hotheaded as Jackson would never rise to such a command, much less the rank of colonel. Moreover, the courtroom scenes are ridiculous as they in no way resemble the procedure of an actual courtmartial. Improper argument during opening statements, questioning an ambassador as to how he would give orders to troops if he were a military commander, constant cussing during testimony etc. It would never happen.

There is no way in HELL that Tommy Lee Jone's would have won that case. Frankly, the only reason we want him to is because eventually we get to \\"see\\" the missing tape which appears to justify Samuel Jackson's actions. No lawyer would ever start an opening statement by asking forgiveness for being late because he'd been throwing up. And to base your closing arguement on the fact that you and your son would not be alive if the accused had not saved you so he must be found not-guilty is absurd.

I have no idea what Morrison was like in reality, but the man I've always imagined him to be was captured to a tee in Kilmer's excellent portrayal. Warning to biography hounds... this is a movie, and a pretty fun one to watch at that, but its not a documenary. You shouldn't view this movie if you're expectations are set on finding factual information. The truth is, only Morrison knew what was really going on in his head.

A few moments in the film, in particular, are extraordinary, where his resemblance to/embodiment of Jim Morrison is uncanny... (*If you saw the movie and you're a Doors' fan, you can't have missed that.)I agree that the soundtrack was fantastic, however maintain that Val Kilmer was the right one to play Morrison. In fact, I read that Val Kilmer was recorded singing along with Jim Morrison's voice on the last song in the film. For those who feel he was the wrong choice, go back and listen to how well he did that. I am a singer and I know what kind of work it takes to do something like that.

This product is nothing more than insulting to The Doors and Jim Morrison and the one star option was the lowest rating I could give, personally the one star is being generous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprisingly tedious","review":"The best performance in the film was Kyle McLachlan's Ray Manzarek, even though his part was small. Val Kilmer lacks charisma in his portrayal of the late charismatic singer Jim Morrison. How can a man who is perpetually stoned and wrapped up in his own little world be interesting or charismatic? I found Kilmer's Morrison unlikeable and unwatchable. The Stone/Kilmer Morrison has no redeeming qualities - casually and carelessly hurting everyone in his path with his selfish, hedonistic lifestyle. I actually fast-forwarded through quite a bit of this film because every scene was just \\"more of the same\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"a must watch for everyone born under the sun","review":"If there is any thing bad about this movie is that it does not go on forever and ever.The life of Jim Morrison is one story that can never be portrayed in words or pictures but this effort is worth a praise.Though it does not really shows what a good company Jim was but it do keeps you goin through the worst parts of life.If you really wanna see why this man was and still is a mystery,You must watch this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stone's Lone Stab at Comedy","review":"It seems like every great director attempts a comedy at some point in his career. Stone is no exception, and with THE DOORS, he makes an unfortunate foray into feature length hijinks.Don't get me wrong...the film does have some funny moments. The scene where Kilmer follows Pamela Courson home and hangs out in the window is a classic. Pamela sees him and asks why he followed her, and with impeccable comic touch, Kilmer says \\"Because you're the one.\\" Quite a sidesplitter!Unfortunately, the jokes get old after a while, and by the end, you're almost wishing that Stone had taken a more serious approach to the material. Even Morrison's wacky Indian sidekick ends up looking forlorn.My advice, if you want to see a great musical comedy, check out SPINAL TAP. As for Stone, he should leave the one-liners to Woody Allen and stick with heady dramas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Re-Issue Crap","review":"Yet another re-issue and shaft job by the movie industry making DVD's, and releasing them with a few more extras one to six or seven years later. Give these crap re-issues one star, not based off the movie, but the shaft job done to loyal DVD customers. If you must buy this release, ALWAYS BUY USED. That way the vultures who play unfair won't make a profit off you. Then sell your old release, which will hopefully deter more people from buying the newer version, with a cheap old version on the market, and will hit these scumbags where it hurts the most... bottom profit line. Voice your anger, ALWAYS BUY USED IF YOU MUST BUY AT ALL, and tell them you're sick of this re-issue anniversary edition crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"AN INACCURATE POTRAYL OF A ROCK LEGEND FOR SURE!!!","review":"I saw THE DOORS after I had read LIGHT MY FIRE by RAY MANZAREK and I could see why he hated it.The movie THE DOORS focused in my opinion way too much on JIM MORRISON'S self-destructive tendancies not on how the group made thier fantastic music. Don't get me wrong VAL KILMER while he's potraying morrison does the best he can with the inept script his performance besides the music is the only thing that saves this film from being a total disaster and don't get me started on MEG RYAN I thought she definatley was a lame PAM COURISON to say the least. I felt that OLIVER STONE did'nt really research THE DOORS either and it shows so all in all read LIGHT MY FIRE by RAY MANZAREK for the real story not this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long, Boring, No Focus on Music","review":"The Doors is not the best movie. While the begining of the movie seems to promise something good, and the end of the movie has you walk away with some emotions. After this first hour of this nearly two and half hour movie, it becomes boring.There is hardly any focus on the music. Besides the concerts, events of the movie seem pointless. Their only point seems to show how crazy the singer was. Jim Morrison, the singer and main charater, was just a crazy idiot, and thats not what he was in real life. The last thirty minutes will respark interest, but does not save the movie at all.I would recommend someone to rent this movie, not buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad DVD quality","review":"The video resolution is very poor, I in fact have to watch the DVD in \\"zoomed\\" mode in order for it to make it fit the screen."},{"rating":"2","title":"*Groovy Movie*","review":"I'll keep my review short and simple. This is one of my top 5 all time favorite movies. Val Kilmer should have won an Oscar for his performance, or at least received more praise. Oliver Stone knows that his story isn't 100% true and he never claimed it to be. This was his vision of The Doors, and with the help of Robbie Kreiger, Patricia Kennealy, Pamela Courson-Morrison's parents and John Densmore, he did an incredible job. However, Meg Ryan wasn't all that. She's a decent actress, but not worthy/cool enough to play Pamela Morrison. When the movie came out, Meg talked about how over-rated she thinks The Doors(the band) are and that Jim Mrrison was just a drunk. Well, Meg, why associate yourself with the movie then? Anyway, the movie is an amazing experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Boors","review":"I should preface this by stating I really do NOT like Oliver Stone movies (other than Natural Born Killers), for some reason I feel very disconnected to them. And he does it again with the Doors. On the recommendation of my son I watched this on a borrow and I have to say I watched the entire run of the movie and still know NOTHING about THE DOORS. The movie is instead filled with psychedelic filler of the highest order and Jim Morrison comes off as nothing more than a sullen drunken crybaby.All the relationships seemed forced and nothing about this era or group seemed interesting at all, and I have to think that's simply not true in real life. A lot has been made of Val Kilmer as Jim Morrison and for all the hype I've heard I can say I was mildly let down, which could be more a fault of the script since NO ONE not even the lead had any type of depth or worthwhile backstory, so what more can an actor do? I actually thought Meg Ryan was the stand out, and that doesn't say a lot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please stay on the side you are on","review":"I think if a really pretentious 15-year-old was asked to write a historical movie script, this is what he would come up with. Incredibly dull and full of itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Doors (Special Edition)","review":"Looks brand new, not a scratch on the DVD. One of my favorite movies so it was totally worth the $3!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"First half hour is ok","review":"This movie was ok in the beginning. It was somewhat interesting watching him get messed up and stuff but after two hours of the same thing it was just too much. I doubt much of this movie is true. So if you want to see a movie glorifying jim morrisons' drug abuse and \\"super deep\\" lyrics this is right up your alley."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Arrow Flies and Falls","review":"Being a huge Doors fan it was entertaining. Oliver Stone did a great job with the scene feel. Val Kilmer did a phenomonal job as Jim, even satisfactorily vocaling some of the live concerts. If you have read some of the books about Jim, ie. No One Here Gets Out Alive, you have noticed they did not show the artist side of him as he was in real life. They show more of the depression and self destruction. Also, Patricia Keneley was two people combined into one character. Even so this is a great film of the rise and fall of James Douglas Morrison."},{"rating":"1","title":"worthless, with the exception of what Kilmer and Meg Ryan do here","review":"If you love the real Doors, stay clear of this miasma.The Doors, I always thought were the greatest rock band of all time, but this vapid flick, created by a brain-dead Hollywood dodo makes the late, great Jim Morrison and the rest of The Doors look foolish, idiotic and talenless goofballs.This travesty of a flick basically left me fairly angry. I may just have to re-read (for the third time) No One Here Gets Out Alive, and will surely play some Doors music to get rid of the aftertaste left in this viewer's mouth by the rancid Oliver Stone attempt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kilmer is Morrison","review":"Kilmer is Morrison in this movie, he acts and feels out what the man did and how he saw the way he did. This is a big winner and I like The Doors myself and this was a good one. Hooray for Oliver Stone for making this awsome movie. Long live Morrison"},{"rating":"1","title":"It could have been so much better!","review":"Oliver Stone should really give up making movies about history. I never wanted to see this movie, but when you end up in a video store where you've seen nearly everything...that's about the only way you'd pick this one up.I think Val Kilmer did an alright job, but everyone else seemed to be portraying some cartoon of who they thought the people were.I am a Doors fan from childhood (had a lot of older brothers), so I wish the movie hadn't been made because people that don't care about Jim Morrison's memory will just believe that's how it really happened. For those of us who care, we only need to hear the music.Watch the movie, but realize their life wasn't about drugs and getting out of control. That was a consequence of Fame."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie!","review":"I think this is a great movie and Val Kilmer did an AMAZING job, the way he was able to change himself through this movie from a younger jim, to an older one, was unreal. Meg Ryan also great in this. The music, acting, the story was very entertaining, this is certainly one of my favorite movies of all time.Great Job Kilmer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a mystical shine to the film","review":"The life of misunderstood rock star/poet Jim Morrison is delivered through a hazy 1960's filter and the remaining Doors given the sketchiest of treatment. A movie worth seeing if only to hear the timeless music and feel traces of the the free tumultuous time. Though little insight is given into Morrison (he is lightly shaded as an obnoxious drunk, musing poet, charming wit and lost soul) there is a mystical shine to the film. Val Kilmer is an astonishing doppelganger of Morrison."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did I get the right DVD? Aspect Ratio problem","review":"I wonder if something is wrong with my DVD player... it seems this film wasn't encoded as anamorphic (to fill my widescreen TV like all other films) but they burned the letterbox onto a 4:3 encode. So I see the picture surrounded by black.Also the soundtrack sounds flat... I read somewhere that you have to enable a 5.1 track but I haven't found that option.I picked this up at a flea sale eager to relive my first experience with this film in a proper theatre many years ago... so far no love! I wonder if I got a non-special edition disc in a special edition box."},{"rating":"1","title":"The only good thing about this movie is the soundtrack","review":"I have watched other Oliver Stone movies before and liked them. I don't know what he or anyone else was thinking when they made this movie. It was a mess. Maybe I need to be drunk or stoned to appreciate it.This movie was very poorly written. I agree with an earlier reviewer that it makes Jim Morrison look like a drunken jerk. It was either way too long or way too slow. Either way, it did not hold my interest. Meg Ryan was a doll in other movies of hers. But in here? She just could not live up to the material. She was definitely a poor casting choice in this movie.If you like The Doors, I am sure that there are better choices out there than this garbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Head Trip","review":"This was a good show in all. Very Trippy!! Anyone notice that Billy Idol appeared in it?? heehee! Billy played \\"Kat\\". He had brown long hair and was on crutches. He was briefly at the bar. Be careful... if you blink, you'll miss him!! :o)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A visual and aural feast...","review":"This movie is driven by the psychedelic music of the Doors. In many of the concert scenes, the music is visually translated into colors and motion. The movie itself is more about Jim Morrison himself than the Doors however. When broadly displayed like this, Morrison's contempt for the order of society is obvious. Val Kilmer should've been given better parts after this movie because his performance is the best of his film career."},{"rating":"1","title":"True? A Viewer from Finland, 17 years","review":"When I saw this film for the first time, about three months ago, I started wondering was that the Doors that I fell in love with? It was so different than the Doors that I read about in the books, but I guess it was true, because John, Robby and Ray were all a part of the filmmakers. To me the movie was a shock, is that the way everything happened? I guess it was.Actors were good, music (of course) was good and the directing was good, but...something was missing."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst movies I've ever seen","review":"For anyone who is interested in seeing this movie, you would be better off reading any of the books out there on the Doors, or listening to their music. Your money would be better spent that way instead on this movie. This movie was inaccurate and poorly made. Oliver Stone, even though he had help from the remaining members of the Doors and other people who knew Jim Morrison, didn't know what the truth was even if it bit him in the behind. Jim himself is probably rolling in his grave because of this movie and how he was portrayed as a stoned, drunk, abusive jerk who couldn't keep his pants zipped, even though he was talented and highly intelligent. That part, obviously, was forgotten. I personally hope that Mr. Stone is proud of himself for accomplishing that feat.In conclusion, this movie is an insult to Doors fans, the remaining members of the Doors and those who knew them, but most importantly, to James Douglas Morrison."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stone does it again","review":"Oliver Stone has built a career on taking real people & real events from certain time periods and presenting a fictional account of said events with a few crumbs of truth sprinkled in to provide the guise of accuracy & integrity. Same here. The sad thing is, another, more talented, more devoted-to-the-truth director could make a better film but what studio will back another movie about The Doors? Therefore, sadly, this film is what stands, in some respect, as the \\"truth\\" concerning Morrison to most people who watch it and don't care to seek out more information. Val Kilmer's brilliant performance is wasted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad","review":"I know Oliver Stone has won 2 Oscars for his screenwriting...but that doesn't alter my opinion that he is one of the worst screenwriters going. This movie confirms that fact as much as anything. Norman Mailer in VANITY FAIR called this \\"one of the all-time bad movies.\\" And Val Kilmer carries himself like a handsome guy, but his face actually isn't that handsome. Jim Morrison was a really handsome guy. They needed someone with Morrison's looks and charisma to play the lead. Kilmer does have the mannerisms and voice down, but it's not enough. I didn't give it one star, only because the music is so great to listen to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb!","review":"oliver stobe makes yet another masterpiece. val kilmer is an excellent actor, and this role just defies it further. for a 2 hour film, this is an excellent portryal for jim morrison. great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"some couldn't understand him, that's why they hated him.","review":"Morrison new more about the world than we thought. I say go to ---- to all the people who said that he was a bad influence to our community, or people who fought againsted him.

Kilmer's transformation into Jim Morrison is uncanny. The music is used artfully and the editing is fantastic. The only false note is the casting of meg ryan as Morrison's wife. Otherwise a beautiful immersive movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth It!","review":"I watch about 60 movies a year. This one is long, boring and not worth your time to say the least. Very surprising given all the great reviews and Oliver Stone direct it. You could sum this movie up in about 5 min (not 2 hours it takes to watch!) and it could have been told in a more interesting way. Booooo. Terrible movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Val Kilmer, distorted history","review":"I found this entertaining and Kilmer plays a pretty good Morrison. That said, the film twists and fabricates the truth in a lot of ways which is what happens whenever Hollyweird makes a film that a lot of us were there to wittiness. I saw the Doors at Whiskey and it was nothing like it was portrayed. I was at the Golden Gate Park gig as well, also a complete fabrication. The genius of Morrison boosted by the rest of the band is hard to capture but we have the music to remind us. I am going to see Ray in a club venue in a few weeks and it will be interesting to hear him play again. I was a lucky boy to grow up only 70 miles from the City and our rescue from the sticks was to go and see music. It was a great time to be alive but Morrison's star went through the sky too fast. I always wondered what the album after L.A. Woman would have been like. It is entertainment and bad history. Nuff said."},{"rating":"1","title":"What coulda been....","review":"This film is a poor take on Jim Morrison's life.I suggest picking up \\"Riders on the Storm\\" by John Densmore or \\"Light my Fire\\" by Ray Manzarek, both books have their personal accounts and are much more interesting.I mean if you're gonna just make up scenes at least do it for the benifit of the audience and the person you're portraying. At least show a little of Jim Morrison's good side and not just jimbo.<"},{"rating":"1","title":"As a Doors fan this movie stunk.","review":"When I heard that Stone was going to make the movie I was excited, but very disappointed in the movie. It failed to capture the essence of Jim Morrison the man. His life and the fact that he was more beautiful than the actor who portrayed him. As a doors fan from the 60\\"s, Kilmer didnt play Jim as convincingly. He wasnt as beautiful as Jim. Ryan as Pamela was boring. She had more dye in her hair than Pamela ever did. The rest of the doors were not as defined as well as they should have been.

I don't think Jim was anything like that ( but Val did look like him ), too much naked women, \\"John\\" didn't look like John, \\"Robby\\" didn't look like Robby, \\"Patricia\\" didn't look like Patricia, everything happened too fast, and Jim DIDN'T drink his blood ( read NO ONE HERE GETS OUT ALIVE ).'This one lonely star is from the music."},{"rating":"1","title":"could have been much better","review":"Oliver Stone, a great director in general, really slacks off in this one! I understand Kilmer as a choice for Morrison but, Meg Ryan as Pam...only in a dream world.All the dates and many facts were either wrong or excluded. Stone even turned to making things up to fill time and help move the story along. All in all a very good story but, not nearly an accurate depiction of Jims' rise and fall"},{"rating":"1","title":"This Is an Inaccurate Movie","review":"Oliver Stone's portrayal of the Doors and Jim Morrison is extreme and in many cases untrue and exaggerated. He takes the events of the Doors and binds them into cliche rock band problems that never happened. The UCLA film by Jim Morrison was never that extreme, and there were a lot more inaccuracies in the movie. If you want a true account of the Doors, read Light My Fire by Ray Manzarek."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Travesty","review":"I can only say that this film is, as Manzarek calls it, \\"atrocious.\\"Silly, Hollywood fluff that has Jim Morrison probably rolling over in his grave to this day.There are so many inaccuracies about his character and events in this film, that it's hard to take it seriously. The worst is watching Kilmer strut around 24/7 in some exaggerated, drugged out looking stupor throughout the film. The worst is the way he speaks, as if Morrison were a stoned surfer (\\"like, dude\\").Just an awful, awful film and typical of Stone's directorial decline.Avoid at all costs. Watch the Doors' music DVD's or read the books if you want to learn about or listen to or watch the Doors."},{"rating":"1","title":"really really bad!","review":"All I have to say on that movie is that it was really bad!!! All they wanted to do, was to make Jim and Patricia look bad and make Pam look good. They took every bad thing jim made and made a movie out of it. And by the way Val was horrible!! He did not fit. Jason Patric would have made a better job at it, and Jason looks more like Jim then anybody else!!! thats all I had to say."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boo, Hiss - Fake Widescreen","review":"The movie is interesting and I think Val Kilmer did a good job.

And then you could drag out J Lo to play Squeaky Fromme, and keep the \\"reality\\" in high gear, eh?"},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent evocation of 60s aspiration and excess","review":"For those of us who grew up in the 1960s, this is a wonderful film. It genuinely evokes the sense of newness and possibility of that time, that all old forms could be swept away, that we could live love and rock and not worry about the future. Of course we were wrong, and those who embodied all the hope and excess, like Morrison, paid the price with their lives - they were drunk, drugged out, and many eventually died of it.Looking back on it, I feel amazed at how naive we were, how arrogant, but then, we were children and youths, affluent and feeling that the possibilities literally were limitless. This film accurately portrays that feeling, both in its pathetic over-reaching, but also a lot of the beauty of it.This is the best Stone film by far, and I wasn't even into the Doors.Warmly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Life of its own.","review":"Brilliant. The film starts out with The Doors, and then takes on a life of its own, becoming a cult object in the process, an objet d'art, breathless, entwined, twirling, obsessive, relentless, varicoloured...It's like a sex act that feels unbearibly good and creates expectations of a final, musical, passionate, finale."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was OK, but...","review":"I have read about a dozen books on The Doors. Needless to say they are one of the GREATEST bands ever to enter the human ear. In fact, I personally, believe they are the GREATEST band ever (Yes, even better than the Beatles), so I'd have to say the movie was not what it should have been. The Doors were art. The movie was not. The movie prefered to concentrate on the (semi-fiction) \\"antics\\" of a mentally unbalanced Jim Morrison, instead of the poetic side. Also the movie did not live up to it's own title! It's called \\"The Doors,\\" not \\"The life and times of Jim Morrison!\\" It should have concentrated on the band more (not to say Jim was not a very interesting person...HE WAS!!!) Anyhow, other than a few lies (ok, more than a few) it's overall an entertaining movie. Watch it for Val Kilmer as Jim (EXCELLENT performance!!), watch it for the WONDERFUL concert scenes, and watch it for the great soundtrack, but don't count on a truthful account of the greatest band EVER!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Impressed","review":"Well, it cuts hair alright, but it also damages my skin too.

Save yourself some time & money--don't buy this model!"},{"rating":"2","title":"First cordless I have had with good reception","review":"This is the first cordless phone I have had, where I have had no interference trouble. Other cordless phones I have tried in my apartment consistently disconnected me in mid-conversation. I hear great on this phone (I am hard of hearing) no matter where in the apartment I roam. I hear great on the terrace, which was impossible with other cordless phones I have had. The volume control is a great convenience. My only complaint with this cordless phone is it is somewhat pesky to clear the caller ID list. There are three steps involved. This is my only disappointment. As far as cordless phones go, this is definitely the best one I have had."},{"rating":"2","title":"best one so far","review":"I've owned at least 7 cordless phones, one costing more that [$$], and this has been the best. Easy operation, good feel in the hand and on the ear and totally reliable. I wouldn't be replacing the one I've had for nearly three years but I'm losing custody of it in the divorce. I like the phone so much it's the first thing I'm replacing. That's how good it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreliable...","review":"When this phone works, it's fabulous. It allows me to store dozens of phone numbers, any of which it can call with a simple press of the jog dial. It looks good, and provides caller identification. Unfortunately, this phone doesn't work about 30% of the time. All too often, when I pick up the handset to make a call, the screen reads ' CONNECTING' and the phone is dead. Also, sometimes the names and telephone numbers will become go from being represented on the screen by letters and digits to unreadable symbols. All very strange. Thank goodness I have 2 other telphones in my apartment."},{"rating":"1","title":"works for two months and THEN","review":"This phone is the worst, as it makes you think it's the best thing ever after a few weeks of use. BUT THEN... I had the same problems as other reviewers as it was always scanning for a channel during calls. Very annoying. Don't buy this phone. I've noticed that Sony is cutting the price dramatically on this phone to get rid of it from its inventory. Don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"There is little new information in this book.","review":"Despite its claim to offer the latest news regarding antidepressants, this book basically is compilation of already published information. It barely mentions the newer classes of drugs (post SSRIs: Remeron, Effexor, Wellbutrin, Serzone) and doesn't even mention the most popular SSRI in the world, Celexa. As far as I could tell, the author, a pharmacist and not a doctor, got all of his anecdotal evidence from one actual physician--the one who wrote the brief introduction. There is nothing in this book that one couldn't easily find surfing the Internet (particularly at these drugs' own Web sites) in about half an hour."},{"rating":"1","title":"Help WHO choose?","review":"These medications should not be \\"chosen\\" by the patient. Considering the side effects and withdrawal symptoms associated with all of these medications, they should not be \\"chosen\\" at all. This book is very misleading and could be very dangerous to the general public. These medications do have their place in society, but only at the discretion of a fully-informed psychiatrist along with his full testing and evaluation of the patient."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alarmingly deficient","review":"This book is deficient in providing information regarding the well documented and real risks in SSRI antidepressants. It seems little more than a restating of drug company propaganda. It does not adequately discusss the risks of akasthesia, tardive dyskinesia, risk of suicidality, sexual dysfunction, neurotoxicity, and other numerous side effects. The public is ill served by further reassurance that these toxic agents are safe and effective. The book is also deficient in discussing safe, effective alternatives to SSRIS such as St John's Wort, SAM-e, Omega 3 oils, dietary and lifestyle changes, psychotherapy, and spiritual work.Ronald Feintech, Ph.D."},{"rating":"2","title":"Man is wolf to man","review":"One of director Otar Iosseliani's stronger films. The movie takes place during several periods of time in his native country of Georgia: in the Middle Ages, in the early 1900s, during the Stalinist period (the bulk of the movie) and in the chaos of the early 1990s. The same actors often play different characters at the different periods of time (for example, the guy playing the medieval king also plays a Stalinist henchman and a contemporary smuggler). The movie works through vignettes full of deadpan humor, and a common thread of all the stories seems to be the absurdity of life, the arrogance of power and man's inhumanity to man. Iosseliani even plays a couple of roles here, as a Stalinist torturer, and as a present day bumbling projectionist, in one of the film's most elaborate gags. Overall, a great movie, with Iosseliani's caustic humor telling us, as the old Latin saying, that man is a wolf to man."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very funny","review":"Although not as good as his \\"Twisted Tales from Shakespeare\\" and \\"The Classics Reclassified,\\" this volume is still a funny overview of American History."},{"rating":"2","title":"funniest book I have ever read","review":"I first read this book in 1963 and laughed and cackled aloud, on the bus, at home, at work...Best view of American History you will ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"It all started with Columbus","review":"Book - the service was outstanding.

He had been struggling with his orientation for many years and now finally knew who he was. I was shocked and struggled myself with this news. We have teenage boys and what to tell them. Well we didn't for 8 months until school was out. I also needed time to find out where to turn. I found Carol's website and then ordered her first book on Amazon. Finally, someone knew what I was going through. The stages that women face are pretty much the same. I read the book twice and then ordered the second book to start the recovery process. It has been over a year now and things are still rough but I still refer to her books and I am grateful for the section on telling your children.

I read Pscal at fourteen and I found nothing funny in it. All I found was a hardly decent, terribly slow story, told in the usual boring language so dear to Italian novelists (I read it in Italian, by the way... Maybe the translator did Pirandello a great service, who knows?). It is a book that lacks life entirely. Although the story is plausible, there is no oxigen in it. Besides, it repeats pirandello's themes over and over again. OK, we know, according to him it is impossible for a man to know himself and not to have less than ten personalities at a time. We have heard this song over and over again! I mean, Pirandello dissected the same bloody theme for at least a thousands times. Why the hell couldn't he explore other themes and dilemmas as well? That is the chief problem with Italian literature: it bores readers to death."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Biography","review":"I just finished listening to the unabridged cd version of this book. I do have to say I was very disappointed. From the beginning and through out the book it seemed the author had it out for James Madison. He definitely laid on the negative more then the positive of this founding father's life. I understand to get a balanced view the bad comes with the good, but this wasn't even close to balanced. IMHO this was written with a bias. I recommend passing on this book. And in my opinion this questions this author's credibility for his other work. I know I won't purchase any of his other books. Such a shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame..","review":"Why in a book about Madison does the author feel the need to bring up the Vietnam War?Why in a book about Madison does the author feel the need to bring up how wonderful FDR was?Why in a book about Madison does the author feel the need to bash Republicans on every page while the Federalist come off as Saints descended from heaven.Can you possibly guess what political affiliations this author belongs too???I was jarring on every page to have this idiot pontificating on things that have NOTHING TO DO WITH MADISON!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"informative, but seemingly partisan","review":"After reading this book I came away with more information about Madison than I expected, which is a good thing. With that being said, however, I felt as I was reading that the author was not only pointing out some of the failures that Madison had (which were numerous), but also took the opportunity to bash Jefferson as well. It is interesting to see the author praise Madison for his early work (when he was more of a federalist) and then criticize him for nearly everything after he started thinking more like a republican. I don't think the author had to be so critical of Madison to get the point across that Madison was a much better legislature than an executor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hardly impartial...","review":"I'll admit I couldn't stomach finishing this book. I greatly admire Jefferson, and Wills' narrative gives such cursory treatment of Jefferson and Madison's motivations in the context of the events of the day, that it hardly comes across as impartial. Denouncing Jefferson and Madison's principled and active stand against the Alien and Sedition Act, and jumping to a 21st century perspective to offer a defense of the Act - really! And to say that Jefferson and Madison were obsessed with attacking Hamilton, while Hamilton was indifferent or friendly to them? Even a little reading of history would throw that claim into doubt."},{"rating":"2","title":"review by james","review":"I bought this book previously on my Kindle.

The first one involves the team's hunt for the elusive Miniature Killer, which ends in a truly gripping and haunting climax.

The Keppler story line has a great film noir feel that will delight fans of crime fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"CSI = Awesome","review":"Must have for any fan. Special features on the last DVD in the set gets better and better with every season, and this is no exception.

I buy every season when it comes out. I agree that this show is still going strong into its 7th season.

This also applies to the others to some degree. (I love Miami and NY as well.) I'm tired of all the darkness. Any real police officer/CSI would turn on the lights before scrutinizing an indoor crime scene. That's why I deducted a star. I'd like a little more light on the subject.My other issue is that I think this DVD set is starting to push the limit on price. So glad that Amazon discounts so heavily. Best Buy wants $99!

Those folks in Binghampton on 5/2/70 were so lucky - and I think they knew it at the time. The beginning acoustic set is heartfelt, and wonderful. The band obviously took it seriously (for them), and the crowd appreciated the generosity. The two electric discs that follow are 'typical' 1970 electric Dead. In other words - they will crush your skull, and you'll love every second of it! The only bummer is that the electric discs are Monophonic, not stereo.

Several watch repair and jewelry stores all say they can not repair or replace band because it is held on by two small screws or brads, not like normal or most watch bands.

XML is starting to look like something I can actually begin to incorporate into my projects, thanks to Sas's easy-to-read style and clear explanations and samples. It may not be the first choice for XML and Actionscript gurus, but it should be a good investment for folks who want a good intro into the subject matter.

At right around 200 pages, the books in the series give a good introduction to the fascinating men that have held this office.I especially enjoyed reading the author's discussion of the disputed election of 1876, and how it was very similar to what happened in the election of 2000. Even down to the state of Florida being one of the contested states. But in the end, Hayes was the president even without carrying a majority of the popular vote.The books in this series give a great overview of the president and his administration. For some, this will be enough. But for others, there could be enough interest generated for them to read more indepth biographies.Highly recommended"},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaves a lot to to be desired","review":"This book does a good job of outlining President Hayes life but it falls short in other areas. It does not give a sense of the country and how Hayes affected it. It suffers from being far too brief and does not even hit all of the highlights in his life. For those who want to get a sense of the president that is about all this can be used for. If you are looking for something that gives you information on the corrupt bargain or the start of the Gilded Age this book falls short."},{"rating":"2","title":"We're not in Hollywood anymore!","review":"What a quirky movie yet there was something compelling about it that made me keep watching. The perpetually overcast scenery and the not frigid but still chilly weather threw a blanket of menace over everything. As much as I hate watching movies with subtitles I couldn't get myself to stop watching. Even though I'd read the blurb about the movie on IFC I still kept waiting for a logical explanation for the main character's suffering OTHER than possession. I KNOW! What a Hollywood theme right? But the Germans made a very non-Hollywood film. It's quiet and understated. There aren't any bizarre special effects with blood spurting everywhere. Conversations are quiet, subdued even when the devil is speaking. LOL I have no idea if the actors are well known in Germany but none of them were even vaguely familiar looking to me which also added to the feeling of realness about this movie. The ending caught me off guard although it probably shouldn't have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I anticipated...","review":"Although the actors' portrayals in this film were well done, the film itself failed to strike a chord in me entirely. I believe that the actual topic of the film was tip-toed around as it took too long to get to the actual story. There was too much socializing and partying going on which abaded the true topic. The ending was extremely poor as it simply states the official outcome of the film's premise rather than take you through the meat of the process which is what would've been the real point to the film. If you really want to see this film I would not recommend purchasing it but rather renting it, if possible. Good day! :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie was not good.","review":"This movie made the story look as if the girl just had mental illness and there was no real spiritual cause of what happened to her.

The REAL professionals, like Emmy Lou Harris, don't have to show off -- they know how to showcase the lead singer. And then in the next song Iris Dement sings backup for mom herself in a similarly professional manner.

It's cute and carefree, I saw Iris sing it on the dazzling 'Transatlantic Sessions' BBC programme and she blasted my doors off! The album version is better still! 'Our Town' is an emotional tour-de-force! The rest of the album has songs which need a little more repeated listening to get the best out of them, but are well worth the effort.

There are obvious tape speed fluctuations all over the place, most dramatically on \\"Last Night,\\" \\"Old Mister Time,\\" \\"From Rochdale To Ocho Rios,\\" and \\"Everything You Wanted To Know About!!!\\" Strangely the newly appended bonus track \\"Nothing Can Move Me\\" is without flaws - perhaps the source tape used for the main album was bad, or the machine it was run on was improperly calibrated.

This is a song that, when listened to in a vehicle, will induce speeding, simply because of its insistent beat and chorus. Too Much Heaven is a great bit of charity work for UNICEF and the brothers harmonize so well. Spirits (Having Flown) is just a song that will catch your ear for some strange reason and hold you in its grasp. As for the rest of the album, skip it. Uninspiring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Games are fun, transitions are not","review":"The actual mini games in Hot Pixel are pretty good. However, in between games there are often lame video clips and useless animations that take away from the gameplay. I think Atari actually tried too hard on the presentation and hurt themselves in the process. You can unlock games to be played at your own pace, \\"Xtras\\", which track high scores and justify a $10 price tag by themselves.

It works great, for the month plus that we have had it, it has not needed new batteries. We love all the features on it, including humidity inside and outside, the atomic clock, and the capacity for more remote sensors. We plan to purchase another remote sensor for the upstairs of our house. The only thing that has not been helpful for us on it is the forecast picture. In the directions it says to put the remote sensor in an area that is not in direct sun, but in direct view of the sky (in my own words of course). Well, I have found this to be difficult to accomplish. We have settled with out of direct sun. As a result the forecast goes from rainy, cloudy, and sunny, all within a day, with no possible chance here in California of having rain in the summer, so that part of the device is not useful at all. But the unit itself looks very nice, so we would recommend this product to anyone who does not care about the forecast part of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are Better Forecaster's Out There","review":"It tells time and the temperature without a problem.

A book is supposed to give more of an insight into characters and the storyline than the movie can convey, but if a book is based on a movie (not the other way around) I would expect to see some consistency. I have to note one major mistake in the storyline from the book: Both in the book and in the movie, the Terminator tells John and Kate that Kate sent him back, not John, as the future John was dead. However, the book clearly shows the future John Connor sending the Terminator back through time (right in the beginning chapters). Unless there's something I'm missing here, that's a pretty bad blunder. On a positive note, it's still fun to read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"As fun for adults as it is for kids!","review":"Easy to set up and appears sturdy.

Looks to be durable and was easy to assemble. Ranges from 3 ft to 6 ft. A warning to those who don't like to read the directions: if you choose the 3 ft setting it is permanent. Therefor it doesn't make sense to set the height at 3 ft. You can use all the other heights by raising and lowering goal. This is very easy to do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unstoppable","review":"That is my son with this basketball hoop. He is almost two years old and wants to shoot baskets from first thing in the morning until bed time. I can't wait to get it outside this summer and let him play until he wears out.

Other than that, we love it. My 3 year old loves playing w/ it and learning how to get the ball in the hoop.

Our grandson understood the concept right away and we're glad it can grow with him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product!","review":"Our son is two and a half, just over two when we purchased this. He uses it all the time, it seems very durable, works great, and has good balance even without filling with sand. We keep this inside right now and he shoots hoops every night. If he reaches up and grabs the net, he can pull it down on himself, as we have no sand in it right now, but it's light enough, that it shouldn't hurt him much even if he does. With a little coaching, he doesn't even pull down on it any more, and we've never had a problem. If you're worried about this at all, just fill it with some sand and this won't be an issue. We are very pleased with the looks, practicality, and durability of this product. From all of the basketball hoops we looked at, I truly believe this was the best for our needs, and we still have a lot of growing we can do with the adjustable backboard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Years of fun for a 2 year old","review":"I love this hoop.

However, I have now gone through 2 units and both have a major design flaw. By itself, the base is flat and sits fine. Once you insert one or both posts into it, it is very wobbly. This is due to both posts extend past the bottom of the base surface. The overall build quality is excellent, but this design flaw is forcing us to return this product and search for another brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Water & mold damage to my carpet - watch for leaks!","review":"Be aware that this stays up and stable because you fill its base with water. I would recommend that you keep it on a hard surface - not carpet! Ours had a small leak which went unnoticed and caused water and mold damage to the carpet and padding underneath the toy.

I hope it lasts a long time in the sun (especially the stickers)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tyke basketball hoop","review":"My grandsons really enjoy the basketball hoop. The only problem with it is the base. When assembling the stand column to the base, the column projects beyond the level of the base making the base wobbly and unstable.

Once that was done it works well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fisher-price I can play Basketball","review":"I ordered this for my 2 year old granddaughter . She loves being outdoors and loves balls .

Well, more like \\"Baah Baawww\\". But you get the picture. He loves dropping balls into this basket. This product was extremely easy to put together, and very sturdy. It's plastic, of course, so you can't hang from it for too long. But it's holding up very well to our super active toddler. He's 3 feet tall and we have it set to the lowest position. He is able to push a ball over the rim and into the hoop without standing on anything or without throwing the ball. He CAN throw it if he wants to, just trying to give you an idea of how tall a kid would have to be to reach the hoop. :) We currently have it set up in our living room, and we had plans to put water or sand (or kitty litter) into the base to secure it, but it turns out that we really don't need to. It's sturdy enough without a heavy base."},{"rating":"2","title":"quite nice except for the net","review":"We have had this basketball goal outdoors for 1.5 yrs now. My son plays with it a bit. It turns out that he is not a basketball lover. Regardless, it looks good. It is under a cover, but it does get sun half the day. It has not faded at all nor has the sticker on the front peeled. It really looks great except for one thing -- the net. The net has deteriorated to 1/4 of its original size. If you touch the net, it collapses into a white powder. Literally, 3.4 of the net is gone.

Even visitors can't resist playing. I feel that by buying this, my son can not only stay indoors from the heat, but he practices his coordination and gets physical exercise. After work, my husband and I play with it to relax. This is an overall good toy. Since it only comes with one ball, I've purchased those cheap plastic balls for continuous play.

It did make ice for a few months, noisey and kept me busy unloading it to the freezer, but after a few months, it started making a loud buzzing noise, and getting hot where the motor area was. Then I only would use it if I was nearby, didn't trust it, didn't want a fire. I could turn it off and back on and sometimes the buzzing would stop, but never completely. We finally put it on a dolly and took it outside, where it is getting snowed on, and rained on until it gets taken to the dump.

The ice shovel does not lift the ice high enough to dump into ice bucket and drops back into the water tray and combines with a new ice batch. This finally brings everything to a close. Sunpentown sent me another motor to solve this problem but it had no effect. My wife or myself must empty the ice into the ice bucket every 15 to 30 minutes or it shuts down. Sunpentown Techs no longer will talk to me about it.

The manual says it could be either out of water (duh?) or have a plugged filter, but it doesn't say how to change the filter; heck, I couldn't even find the filter. I assume you don't have to take this piece of junk apart to get at it. You'd think that if the filter plugs every 10 hours, it would be easy to get at.I should have listened to all the poor reviews.

But beyond that, most of the songs are straightforward late 70's pop. There are novelty songs here, like \\"Modern Man Blues\\", but nothing so bent and memorable as \\"Rubber Bullets\\" (from the self-titled first album). So, if this is your first 10cc CD, you'll probably find their earlier ones more eccentric, while if you start with the early stuff, the middle of this disc may drag.IMHO, the really neccessary 10cc CD's are this one, \\"10cc\\", and \\"The Original Soundtrack\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Post split up, there's still life in 10cc.","review":"Oh no - 10cc have split up - what are we to do!

This is the band at their very best - refined and polished until the album shines from start to finish. Prior to attempting this review, I took an objective view at the track listing...not a lemon amongst them! 'The things we do for love' alone justifies buying this album.

The final song, \\"The Flood at Lyons\\" is easily one of Renaissance's best efforts even keeping in mind the excellence of their earlier albums. Several other tracks are also superb. This album is definately worth owning if you are a Renaissance fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Renaissance's Mainstream Effort","review":"By the time Azure D'or was released in 1979, Rennaisance was transitioning from progressive compositions to a more pop or hit oriented sounding band. Gone were the lengthy songs, replaced by shorter compositions that still retained the mix of acoustic and orchestra instruments but with more synthesized sounds added to the final mix, masterfully put together by producer David Hentschel. Basically a continuance of songs similar to those in the previous album \\"A Song for All Seasons\\", Azure D'or's songs are relatively short but catchy tunes with Annie Haslam's wonderful voice giving life to somewhat obscure lyrics. The best cuts are \\"Jekyll and Hyde\\", \\"Golden Key\\", \\"Kalynda\\", \\"Friends\\", and the stoic \\"The Flood at Lyons\\" where her voice soars through intricate time and key changes. If you're a fan of progressive bands of the 1970's and Rennaisance at its peak of success, this album is a must."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works fine","review":"Kinda expected something bigger, heavier, and more sturdy but it works as designed.

I used to have this exact model about 4 years ago, but they stopped making it, instead making the model that's most commonly available today. I was thrilled when I saw this model and snatched it up; well, something changed because it's flimsier than I remember. After only two uses, the plastic hole that holds the metal piece which props the whole thing open snapped, rendering the product useless for anything but flat-surface use. Sent it back. Guess I'm going to have to be content with the newer version which is clunkier and has pads that don't really grip the laptop. Damn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid, useful product","review":"I've been using the Lapworks Laptop Desk Ultralite for a few weeks now. I have a Macbook Pro that gets ridiculously hot after a while but this product has really helped keep the heat off my lap. The laptop fan doesn't turn on nearly as soon as it did without using it. It's definitely more effective when used in the 'folded' position where there is a space between the computer and your lap. I was surprised to see how rugged this thing is for how light it is. It's even strong enough to use as a tray when I move the laptop. This is especially effective since it has very 'grippy' rubber pads that keep the laptop from sliding off too easily. I've used it to travel, putting it inside my laptop case with my laptop and it took up almost no additional space and added negligible weight. I'm totally satisfied with this purchase and I recommend it highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great product!","review":"I gave this rating a 5 because I am rating the PRODUCT... not the shipping. Shipping was 25% of the overall total. Other than that, the Ultralite works great! My laptop does not get hot, I have a lift so my hands are in the right place, it's so durable I can lift it with my laptop on it, move to another part of the room, and have no issues of the plastic cracking or my laptop slipping off the lift. I ordered this in Nov 2008 and use it each time I pull out my laptop. Everyone that has seen my Ultralite wants one. Let me tell you, I don't get easily impressed. I am impressed with this product.

Unlike other ice therapy bags that need to use a freezer to recharge the cold. The only thing I would have liked would have been ties instead of the velcro. I have a broken foot and used this to reduce the swelling. The bag doesn't wrap around my foot the way I wanted it to. Also, after taking the velco straps on and off kind of shredded the material on the outside of the bag . It probably would work better on a body part that is straight, like an arm, leg, etc. Otherwise, I was very happy with the fact that it did not leak or sweat all over the place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Happy","review":"not happy with my order.

The production is just first rate. The music and video were done with such ease, professionalism, quality, and technical expertise, that we forget all these virtues as we are magically immersed with the great audio. All fans of music, whether or not they are Eagles fans, should be quite impressed with the quality of these effort. This is definitely a must buy for your next music DVD. My only peeve is the lack of any other bonuses other than the quite lame audio-only \\"Seven Bridges Road\\". Regardless, there's a lot of good music, good performances, and just a \\"peaceful easy feeling\\" while watching this masterpiece. Buy it and enjoy. If you don't have a DTS-capable sound system, this is a good reason to have one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even close","review":"Did anyone reviewing here (other than me) actually SEE the REAL concert?

Glen Frey had to step to the mic and ask the crowd to please stop singing along because they were filming for the video and we were drowning out the band, lmao. (Too bad THAT video isn't for sale.) They rocked! Even a hard rain didn't stop them.

My high expectations were dashed when upon opening the package I quickly realized I've been had. Not only was there only one song that was on DTS but the particular track was on audio only.

I just wanted to share a part in the concert where my favorite song, LAST RESORT starts. If you watch Don on the stool in the beginning, he starts to get worried and his head turns back and forth, and suddenly there is a look of disgust on his face. If your system can pick it up, he is upset over a BUZZING noise, and it goes away. I thought it was priceless. I can feel for him. I know he's a perfectionist. With their music I would be too. One last thing, why couldn't somebody SHUT that guy UP!! in the audiance who was yelling ROCK and ROLL constantly. He should've gone to a Metallica head banger!! The Eagles 'ROCK' real well, without making ear bleeding noise. Their passion for their craft, and music is second to none. The adding of Joe Walsh in '76 gave them all the rock they needed.

Also, you can hear the clapping and whistling of the fans from the rare speakers. AWESOME, if there's a rating more than 5 stars i would give it 110%, I listen to it every 2 days.

I enjoy a concert DVD that lets me feel like I'm at the show sonically and visually, and not as if I'm watching a slide show with fading effects. My apologies to the director, but when Joe Walsh is playing a solo I like to watch Joe Walsh play the solo. The sound is okay, but visually the 2 second cut from one band member to the next without regard to the instrumental focus or the activity on the stage was extremely frustrating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre - New views of show based on Felder's Book","review":"I enjoyed reading Don Felder's book, Heaven and Hell. In this book he described some of the behind the scenes issues of this performance. When he was asked to be a part of this event and of re-joining the Eagles, he did it. When Glenn and Henley came back, there became this huge control thing happening. At once, the equal pay amounts were thrown out the Window. They were all told where exactly to stand. Felder was moved to the extreme right. If you watch this video, you seldom even see Felder. When he is seen, he is the one who is smiling and enjoying it the most as well as Joe Walsh. When Frey Sings he never sings to the audience but moves to the side which makes me gather that he is and was trully uncomfortable with this part of performing. Henley is way too monolithic. Just way to serious. The performances were ok but not relaxed enough. Also, the show starts way to slow...."},{"rating":"1","title":"This DVD Ruined The Eagles for Me","review":"Ok. I loveD the Eagles. There was a better than 50/50 chance that I had one of their albums in my car. When people hated on them (there are A LOT of Eagles haters out there) I defended them wholeheartedly. NO MORE. The only Eagle I did not despise by the end of the DVD was Joe Walsh, who may be the sweetest old man ever.

While it really is a good quality disc, only one track was recorded in DTS. I don't think it justifies the monicker or the extra expense. Both my player and receiver would display DTS/DD playback. I thought it might be my equipment, so checked the fine print and only the last track, \\"Seven Bridges Road,\\" is recorded in DTS. The rest wasn't even DD.

This STINKS!!!!","review":"Who is the genius that decided this should only be released in DTS?????? I may not be completely state of the art, but my Dolby Digital system is very nice, and I am not spending hundreds of dollars to upgrade any time soon! This is the only DVD I have come across that I could not listen to in 6 or 2 channel Dolby, my only option here is 2 channel non dolby. Because of this, this disc is worthless to me. I'm glad I only borrowed it, because I will NOT be buying it any time soon. Even the new Don Henley DVD has both DTS ***AND*** Dolby Digital Sound. What would it have hurt to do the same here? This is unbelievably thoughtless!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, Monotonous","review":"Maybe if you REALLY love the Eagles you can stomach the bordom of old guys sitting playing electric guitars with the same monotonous heavy drum beat, but compared to other concerts on DVD, it was bad.

Skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"What?","review":"Maybe I'm missing something, but I don't see what all of the fuss is about. The Eagles were a second rate band who had to do a 'reunion' tour to earn some money. If they were so good, why did they ever go away? I just don't get it.

This sucked."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a band!","review":"This is one incredible DVD. Yes, I am a huge Eagles fan. However, this is an Eagles lover's dream. Maybe they did it for the money...but who cares. The only bad part was going to black between songs.Glenn Frey and Don Henley are the Lennon/McCartney of the seventies. Great singers, too. Don Felder and Joe Walsh were once compared to Eric Clapton and Duane Allman...I think they are way better collectively. Timothy B.

I brought this DVD as a reference DVD for my music setup comprising of Klipsch speakers, HK 635 amp linked using Monster THX cables/inter-connects mostly brought from Amazon. The quality of music listening to the DTS is amazing and really make you proud about your investment on hardware. As is being reviewed by hifi buffs, I almost started listening to each and every instruments separately and this is where the danger starts. Music is supposed to be listened to as one, when you have more and more expensive music systems, you will end up listening to some un-heard sound, missing the song. There should be a limit to the \\"separateness\\" needed for people who loves Music and I think I have almost crossed that limit with my set up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Enough Stars to Do this Justice!","review":"Easily the best concert DVD ever produced IMHO.

However, it was only 5 CDs long, and that is a rather quick read. Something about the narrator or maybe the lack of a gripping plot, made it feel much much longer. In the end it became oddly confusing and I kept trying to remember who all these characters are and what their relations were to one another. Only because it was so long and so full of holes and twists, it became almost boring and hard to pay attention to. However, I can see that Kellerman may be a good writer of other books, so I will give him a chance and pick up another audio boook. It was a good enough book that I kept listening to it. However, I kept listening hoping that something would happen and that all of this time would have a pay off. I was wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Original and full of holes...","review":"I am a fan of Jonathan Kellerman's other books (3-5 stars, the lot), but this book would get 0 if it was an option. The underlying plot makes no sense - a club of do-gooders who somehow identifies a serial killer (it is never explained how), but instead of doing the obvious they guide our hero to solve it - whilst the killer is carrying on killing other victims! Almost needless to say, when our hero eventually does identify the killer, he decides to take matters into his own hands (a poorly motivated distrust of the police is to blame) and gets saved in a typical Kellerman last minute shoot-out (my only serious issue with the Alex Delaware series...) Turns out his mistrust of the cops was misplaced - they end up saving his life.Altogether a poor read - slow paced and a plot that is utterly devoid of logic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Ever","review":"I was a big fan of Jonathan Kellerman, that was until this book! A see-through plot and \\"the Club\\" was just bizarre to say the least.Hopefully the next book I read by Kellerman (if I read one again)will be better as this was a waste of my time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to par","review":"I didn't enjoy this book much - we spend too much time \\"in the narrator's head\\", with long drawn-out, repetitive thought processes. The plot was disappointingly predictable, and the tension between the main characters, the detective and Jeremy, was sadly lacking. Kellerman can do much better.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not his best","review":"I usually enjoy the Kellerman books but this is not his best work. Major medical mistakes- Percocet is not an injectable drug, for example! should have been screened. The characters are uninvolving, and the ending a big letdown after all the work to develop characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"When I saw Kellerman had a new book coming out, I signed up for it at the library without knowing what it was about, just assuming it was another Alex Deleware book. When I picked it up, I was disappointed that it wasn't, but still optimistic, since I love Kellerman's books. This book is a disappointment. I was well over 100 pages in, and still was not \\"into\\" the story. The main character, Jeremy, did not draw me in like Alex did in the other books. I didn't feel a connection with Jeremy, and didn't find myself rooting for him, like I do for Alex and Milo. The story is very slow moving, no driving suspense like the Deleware books. I finished the book because I was \\"curious\\" about how it would end, not because I had a driving need like I do with really good mysteries. I hope Kellerman sticks with the Deleware series, it's a much better read in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"So who cares?","review":"The main characters were all people, if I met them in actual life, I would do my best to avoid if I had a choice--either boring or worse. When Jeremy first observed the elegant dining club located in the strangely abandoned warehouse district, I thought I was in some King/horror clone. The story just never got moving, either in plot or character development.Maybe Jonathan needs some advise from his wife Faye."},{"rating":"1","title":"I just can't believe he actually wrote this","review":"I am a huge Jonathan Kellerman fan - have read everything but this new book is just incredibly boring. The language is very self indulgent and where plot shoud be, there are just endless descriptions of people or events that don't really relate to the story. The only thing worse is the reader of the audio - flat, dull, the story may be putting him to sleep and his \\"female\\" character voice is just terrible. I was also offended by the need to use stereo type descriptions of Asian characters in the book. Very unusual and I'm so disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"How Lame Is This Plot?","review":"How lame is the plot of THE CONSPIRACY CLUB? So lame that even Kellerman realizes it. Because he takes this \\"plot\\", with the same red herrings, twists, and \\"the old switcheroo on who the real killer is\\", and recycled it into half of his next Petra Connor series entry, TWISTED."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Beginning!","review":"Although it took a couple of chapters to get beyond Dr. Delaware and the rest of my \\"friends\\", the book had the same sub-plots and twists that will be familiar to all Kellerman readers and then ends with what could/should be the start of a fantastic new series of novels. I'm sure I'll miss Alex and Milo, but the CCC sets the stage for more complicated and interesting stories!Kellerman is one of the best insightful mystery author's around today!"},{"rating":"1","title":"New shrink just like the Old shrink","review":"I'm a big fan of Jonathan Kellerman and have read all of his books. The plot of this one is a bit too familiar. Psychologist help police solve brutal killings. And there's even a Robin-esque woman by this side, but not too involved in the murderish goings on.I hope he brings back Milo and Alex -- why try to remake the original characters, when they are already done so well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Expected.","review":"I suppose not liking this book is my fault. I was expecting another Alex Delaware and didn't realize this was a \\"stand alone\\" type of novel. Maybe I didn't give this one a chance, but I don't think Conspiracy Club comes even close in character development to the Delaware series. I wouldn't recommend your purchasing this one but borrowing from your public library. The story line isn't even that imaginative nor able to captivate and hold your attention for the length of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boooring!!!","review":"Is this reall written by Kellerman?? Why do authors DO this; abandon a character that the public likes....see Patricia Cornwell's HORRIBLE Isle of Dogs when she dropped Kay Scarpetta...where are Alex Delaware and Milo Sturgis?? One reviewer referrred to them as \\"stale\\" ??? Not to me; I want more. I'm glad I checked this out at the library instead of wasting my money. I hope he or his staff reads these reviews, This character is weak and the whole story is simply NOT what I was expecting. Mr. Kellerman please bring back Dr. Delaware!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well-written and interesting","review":"I also did not know I'd be missing Dr. Delaware in this book. I was quite happy to embrace a new protagonist. Jeremy is so very human in all his feelings and responses. I enjoyed seeing him become interested in Dr. Chess despite his earlier standoffishness. I think that it is a mistake to expect an author to continue churning out books all using the same protagonist. I like the fact that Mr. Kellerman has chosen someone new, whether we see him again or not!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to Kellerman's standards... do you think he had a ghost writer?","review":"I was disappointed in this book. It was not up to the usual standards of Kellerman's work.... no flow for me.

Hope this isn't a trend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a great investment of time or money.","review":"I am a huge Kellerman fan; own all of his books and love them all including Billy Straight and The Butcher's theater; both non-Delaware books. This one is just plain a miss. The characters never strike a note, the book is made up of 50 some chapters often 1 or 2 pages long, seemingly inflating a short story to a 280 page novel; a trend I think started by Mr. Patterson, and one I despise. 25 bucks for a 280 page book that is actually about 220? And the ending; I for one hate books that introduce the murderer 4/5'ths of the way thru. Pass this one; if you don't have all of the other Kellerman books, treat yourself and pick up one or two that are already published."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing like the others","review":"I, too, have been very into the Alex Delaware novels and was so excited about this one coming out. I was also disappointed when I found out it had a new main character (after I checked the book out), but was willing to give it a fair chance. I had to fight to stay awake almost 100 pages into this book, as it went nowhere! Arthur Chess is such a pointless character and the conversations they have are as boring as a forced lecture in college. Bottom line, if you have not read the previous books with Alex in them, go back a few in the series and read those. Save yourself the time on this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"didn't care for this one","review":"I am a big fan of Kellerman and have listened to most of the Alex Delaware novels, but I stopped listening after completing the second CD (out of 8) in this set. I found the medical jargon depressing, overdone, and totally irrelevent to the puzzle (which I assume was discovering the identity of the serial killer). Also, I didn't think the characters were particularly likeable. I won't stop listening to the Alex Delaware stories read by the terrific John Rubenstein, but I wish I'd passed on this book. The story was weak and the reader (Rob Kahn) was even weaker. Maybe listening to the edition read by David Birney would have been better."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"Kellerman has lost it! Years ago, when I first discovered his books, I could not put them down. Now I read them through our local book club as punishment. He has become blasé, predictable, self-involved and should be put out to pasture. I sometimes wonder if he has a secretary who fills in the gaps once he has decided on the storyline. Never again, not even for our book club."},{"rating":"1","title":"Conspiracy Club by Jonathan Kellerman","review":"I am an avid reader and huge Johathan Kellerman fan. I have read many of his books and was excited to read his latest novel. This is the first time in years I actually stopped reading a book in the middle out of interminable boredom. This book is extremely slow moving. Too much description and not enough action. It was as if someone else wrote the novel under Jonathan Kellerman's name. The language seemed forced, bombastic, and esoteric. What a huge dissapointment. The only recommendation I would give for this book is to ask for your money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jonathon! Why the pretentious writing?","review":"I have read every one of Kellerman's books and also have multiple degrees in English. So why am I running to the dictionary every 3 pages? Scrofulous? Remora?

Give me Alex Delaware and easy reading anytime."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing.","review":"I hoped that with a new protagonist, Jonathan Kellerman would once again come through with a goodd read, but I found this as bad as most of his recent Alex Delaware novels have been.

On the plus side, Kellerman's writing is as always a cut above the usual and he has good control over detail and pacing. Unfortunately, the women in this book make even stick figures like Robin seem complex. The scenes in the conspiracy club are cartoonish and about as menacing as an afternoon in a nursing home rec room. Bring back Alex and his rich boy, can't commit melodramas! As much as he gets on my nerves, at least he got a bit more to him than a \\"tragic secret.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Clinical and Borning","review":"When I first read the Amazon review of this novel, I was intrigued. Never a fan of Kellerman's Alex Delaware novels, I thought I might give this a try since it \\"re-invigorates a number of tried-and-true mystery conventions,\\" was \\"gripping\\" and \\"intricately plotted.\\" I found this novel to be neither gripping nor intricately plotted; in fact, I found it tedious and quite boring.

Yeah, yeah, I know he's just been tough a terrible ordeal, but please!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"Lame plot, stale characters, and it takes over half the book for anything at all to happen. So much of this book is useless filler, I can't believe it even got published."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"The author is reusing a similar plot device than in \\"Twisted\\": a somewhat obscure reference material that shows up late in the book and clarifies everything. That is a poor strategy for a mystery novel, because the reader expects to be given clues so as to be involved in the logical process of solving the crimes.The narrative in general is not Kellerman at his best, either. The characterizations are so shallow that one wonders all the time why the characters act like they do.A small part of the book talks about Brazil, and Kellerman simply invents a couple of Portuguese words making them sound Spanish: (\\"favilla\\", \\"favillitos\\"). One wonders how much of the author's research is similarly fictional.In sum, a book carelessly executed."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE CONSPIRACY CLUB","review":"If this was my first Kellerman novel I would have been captivated. Kellerman has a unique writting style which I believe captivates and keeps his fans coming back for more. But Conspiracy Club was not his best. I was disappointed by the lack of development of the \\"Club\\" members characters. I also found Jeremy Carrier rather boring. Though it ended with Kellerman flare, I fear it was a case of \\"too little too late...\\"not his usual page turner.But Kellerman cannot please everybody all the time, and he is allowed the odd bad book, as long as he follows it up with a smasher like Therapy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Story took way too long to develop","review":"Very dissapointing. As a huge fan of the Alex Delaware novels and Jonathan Kellerman's style of writing, I was really looking forward to reading this book. Unfortunately, I found the main character, Jeremy Carrier, to be sad, whiny and an all around boring guy! The story took forever to develop and by the time it did I had stopped caring what happened. He spent too much time introducting characters that ending up having little or nothing to do with the plot. I was surprised at some of the twists near the end, but they weren't enough for me to recommend this book. I finished reading it only to find out \\"who done it\\". I recently read his new novel \\"Therapy\\" which I would recommmend along with most of the other Delware novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"not so much boring as annoying","review":"I too have been a great Kellerman fan, and have read all his books. But this one is bad, and not just because it isn't Alex Delaware or because it has little if any real plot. It's the style, something I don't remember from the earlier books. One reader noticed the annoying short chapters, a trend from some other \\"thriller\\" writers.What I noticed was the page after page of one sentence paragraphs.Or one phrase paragraphs.Supposed to make us feel breathless, I guess.But really more like [Dick and Jane]."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened???","review":"In the past I have found Jonathan Kellerman to be my favorite author, having read every book he has ever written.

This one wasn't worth the time. I was glad when it ended."},{"rating":"1","title":"WAKE ME WHEN IT'S OVER!!!","review":"Jonathon Kellerman is one of my favorite authers, and his last two books have been his best in years. But with Conspiracy Club he has totally missed the mark. This book is slow paced, the main character (Jeremy Carrier) is totally uninteresting. I've read about 100 pages and nothing has happened! I can only read a few pages at a time before I start getting sleepy. I had to put the book down, I couldn't finish it. I may go back to it but not right away. What a bummer. If you're looking for something to put you to sleep pick this book up. Everyone else should just leave it alone. Hopefully Kellerman's next book will be up to his earlier standards."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not you too, Jonathan!","review":"I have not or cannot finish reading this book. It is soooo slooow and seems to be going nowhere and I don't really care about Jeremy at all. Why is that? My first experience with Jon Kellerman was so wonderful that I had to read everything right away. But this book can't be his. I did catch his wonderful descriptive talents in describing scenery but that is not plot. As with Patricia Cornwell's disaster with Blow Fly, it seems as if two previous reviewers are right. Mr. Kellerman was phoning it in or he had this book from a college project and needed to get something published.

This audio book has the one of the worst readers ever and writing so poor that even George Guidall would be hard pressed to keep me listening.I agree with an earlier reviewer's thought that this book seems to be from before Kellerman's Delaware success. The use of latin names of diseases without a translation and clumsy use of language (When was the last time you found the term \\"jimcrack\\" in a novel with a modern setting?). And, this book suffers the worst of Kellerman's other novels: endless and pointless mental dialogue by the lead.All in all this audio recording is a must avoid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shouldn't Reading Be Fun?","review":"This is so wordy and difficult to read, that it wasn't even worth finishing.

Her voice is a bit more edgy than it was in her first album, but I think that adds to the impact of what she is singing about. It has the same western feel to it that Way Out West, her first album, had--conveying the Southwest and California, the open spaces, the deserts and mountains--but in this one all of those images are inside/interior--it is a very confessional album (whereas Way Out West was comprised of story telling, like traditional folk songs generally are).

However, the quality of Mary McCaslin's song writing and her sincere and endearing voice also captured me over time.She writes quite honestly and effectively about losing those you love the most. And the pain and loneliness that follow. She does it with compassion and feeling--not with great anger or self-indulgent pity.She's a fine singer and songwriter that deserves far greater recognition.

It has a good deal of dry humor - sometimes so dry you almost miss it. I managed to slog thru the whole book, hoping it would get better, but it really didn't. The pacing of the story was very slow, and there was no real sense of suspense or building towards a climax. The high point was barely a bump in the road. There were just too many subplots and points that distracted my attention, most of which didn't have enough of a payoff in the end when the threads tried to come together (and many of them didn't link at all) I suppose some of the plotlines were intended to be red herrings, but it is overkill when you're completely distracted and bored by long tangents that have no satisfactory resolution."},{"rating":"1","title":"An acquired taste, maybe?","review":"Satire is perhaps the most difficult form of humor to do well, and this one is definitely not to my taste.

The heroine turns down her husband's amorous advances to stay up late with the latest romance tome, har, har.

Well, Hall of Fame pitching great Dizzy Dean would differ with you. As he said, \\"It ain't bragging if you done it.\\" Author Peggy Klaus agrees wholeheartedly. In this book extolling bragging, Klaus explains that strategic self-promotion often is the best way to avoid being overlooked (and possibly downsized) in the dog-eat-dog business world. Of course, when you brag, you should not seem to be doing so. Klaus explains how to accomplish this dodge gracefully. getAbstract believes that anyone in business could benefit from Klaus's savvy advice.

The book has no point except that humans keep fighting no matter what. The old man is catching a fish for about 80 of the 127 pages. It's a very bad book that shouldn't have ever been published.

And then one day while he is out fishing the amazing happens, he catches that one dream fish. The Old man and the Sea does not deserve the praise and adoration it gets. This book deserves to be cast adrift from the landmass of literary works.The Plot of this story is slow and dull with little action. In this book action is like a slug slowly climbing up a steep hill, it takes for ever and ever to get to the top. For Instance, when action comes it drags on and on. Action in this book is like running backwards; it takes forever to get anywhere..."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Fish Swim Away in Fear of Reading this Shark Tale","review":"This book, Old Man and the Sea, is so immensely unbelievable it isn't even funny. Exhibit A: it says in the book that the marlin was longer than the skiff. Come on, sometimes it takes 2 people to handle a good size shark. On another note, how is it possible for a single old man to hold onto fish that size for that duration of time?Then there are many paragraphs were he goes on and on about how he is sorry for hooking the fish. If you are that sorry for hooking that fish let the thing go. I mean, if you are that torn up about it, then better you live and let it go than get killed adn catch the biggest fish ever.I mean thats just my opinion. Well thanks for reading my review.

Thank you."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book has no storyline.","review":"Philip Pullman, my favorite author, once said that a lot of novels get so wrapped up in showing off beautiful writing that there's no story, and the story really should be the most important thing. I agree with him. This book seems like just an excuse for the author to explain his view of the world, and life, &c, &c., and the author forgets to put an interesting story in it. Luckily it doesn't get too boring because it's short. I also hate fishing, and I hated the author's writing style, which sounds like it's trying so hard to be simple and profound. The author also sounds snobbish and superior at times, and at other times like he's trying to show you, look at this character I've created, isn't he wonderful. For a novel with deep things to say and beautiful writing AND a great story, try Philip Pullman's The Golden Compass."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didnt like it","review":"This was an extremely boring book to me. I had to read it for school in 8th grade,and I almost fell asleep reading it. I think a big part of it was that as an 8th grader i didnt understand a lot of the hidden meanings of the book.

Also, none of my friends liked it either"},{"rating":"1","title":"I cheered for the sharks","review":"This is one of the most boring books I've ever read. I had to read this back in high school.

After absorbing the story, I cannot agree with her. While it may appear to be nothing but a fight between an old man and a big fish, it is more. It is struggle. It is pain and perseverance. It is the acknowledgment that sometimes defeats look like victories, and victories defeats.That being said, I can now also say that I am not a fan of Hemingway's choppy writing, his overly overt masculinity, or his cavalier attitudes towards death and pain. But it is worth reading, especially if you like the things do not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Come on, folks. Seriously. I'm reeling it in.","review":"Wait, no i'm not. Yes I am. Wait, no I'm not.

There you go. Sound good to you? No. I kept wondering what would possess a man to write and publish a book with a story line like this. I understand all of the religious imagery, and all of the symbols with the mast, and everything, but this book really sucked! But, I dont really think that it deserves 1 star.

The old man Santiago is down on his luck, having endured 85 days, without a catch. He believed that his luck will turn and continued going to sea. Indeed, his luck turned put for the better and he caught a huge Marlin, which he battles with care and respect. Finally after 3 days of struggle, he lands the Marlin with a sense of profound victory.However, on the journey back to the port, the dead Marlin was attacked and devoured by several schools of sharks, leaving a skeleton of the magnificent fish. The old man went to bed tired but without much despair.So what was the moral of the story? Your luck will turn out better if you are patient, but regardless of your attempt, you cannot avoid fate.Did I read that Hemmingway won a Nobel Literature prize on the strength of this novel? In my opinion, it was undeserving. But it was a good attempt."},{"rating":"1","title":"You call this a masterpiece?","review":"For barely 100 pages long, this thing that enjoyed worldwide claim is hardly a page-turner. It is so dry and uninteresting, full of repetation, boring description. The author does lack of the ability of using dialogue to tell a story. The dialogue or monologue is, at best, pretty weak. The book is certainly over-rated. The reason that it won the Nobel Literature Prize is what it claimed politically."},{"rating":"2","title":"An incredible warrior's story","review":"After reading \\"The Sun Also Rises\\" and \\"Farewell to Arms\\" I decided to give this short story a try.

His last and his best."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the story that everyone should know.","review":"I read this book in two days, it blew me away. The barren language, the lack of detail. Descriptions only go as far as colors and rarely a metaphor. What Hemmingway achieves by this technique, is by using such limited language, there is more room for the core of the story to be exposed, which is, this old mans love for the sea and fish. The old man constanly refers to great baseball player Joe DiMaggio as, The Great DiMaggio. When in actuality, what this man achieves with courage and love is bigger and greater than any baseball player's heroics.

It is extremely slow, and it is kind of uneventful, but thats like saying \\"amazon is a site\\" Yes, at first, that is what it appears to be, but once you go deeper into it, you will find that it is way more than one might think. The Old Man and the Sea shows the dramatic story of an old man, and in it, you really get to know him, and he is such an interesting person.

The details of this novel are very specific and to the point. It does not seem like Hemingway used any special techniques to try to attract the reader even more towards the novel. However, the novel was still enticing, and clear; unlike other authors, Hemingway did not keep me bewildered throughout the whole novel, and then surprised me with a bad conclusion-it was the opposite of that. I liked that Hemingway used various themes like courage, loneliness, defeat, and others. I also liked that Hemingway used very detailed descriptions of everything he talked about, and he used very simple language, comprehendible to everybody. I found the novel interesting from beginning to end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the time","review":"I read this book in one sitting. It's a shorty, but pretty good considering its length.

The reason is it is an adventure and I LOVE adventures. The adventure part is cool. It is about an old man and his fishing trip. He was out on the ocean for at least 84 days. On the 84th day he caught a marlin. This book is also very descriptive which is sometimes hard to understand. This author likes to make people understand that the person that suffered was very strong."},{"rating":"2","title":"Six stars if I could","review":"I read it as a kid in school, and re-read it many years later, and now recently a third time.

It would be a lot easier and it makes exactly as good a story or even better because it is extra fish caracters.Me I think writers should stick with writing about stuff that is on dry land given the track record so far.TWO STARS for your book Ernest!

Many reknown Literary Critics have suggested that this was a metaphor for Hemingway's own battle with Depression and Alcoholism. Most biographers of Hemingway have also suggested that his drinking excesses exacerbated his Depression which is why his books are often of differing quality. Sadly Hemingway shot almost every living animal on this planet until the only thing left to shoot was himself. No doubt had he lived he would have enrolled in a Twelve Step Programme (that's the correct Australian spelling of that word by the way) for alcoholics and 28 days in Rehab just like his Grandaughter the beautiful but highly unstable Margaux Hemingway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The book is a classic, I'd highly recommend it, but this edition is full of spelling and punctuation mistakes.

Its easy to see how Saddam saw his own predicament in this sentimental story of an old fisherman landing and losing a legendary fish. Hemingway was not, unfortunately, a good novelist. Hemingway's best short stories are some of the finest in the English language but he doesn't seem to have been able to sustain character and plot development sufficiently to produce really good novels. Even this short novel displays Hemingway's weaknesses as a novelist. Even worse, it is sentimental beyond belief, without any of the clear-eyed irony or insight into human nature exhibited in the best short stories. This is a weeper for middle-aged men. See any of the great Nick Adams stories for comparison. While this book appears to have revived Hemingway's career, at least in terms of popular readership, it really shows the decline of Hemingway's powers."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"The Power of Hemmingway\\"","review":"The title and cover of the fabulous book, \\"Old Man and the Sea\\", give you reason to believe that the book is all about and old man fishing (at least thats what i thought!). Suprisingly, after reading the short, easy to read, book, and discussing it in great depth with my wonderful teacher (hi- Mrs. M :)!), my perseption of the book changed completely. Throughout the novel, the reader is introduced to the old man and his daily fishing activites. Hemmingway writes the book so well, that the reader feels as if she's experiencing all that the old man goes through. I hope you enjoy the novel as well as i did!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrible","review":"Terribly GOOD.

Not only for fishermen, but for anyone who enjoys good literature.The storyline is of much simplicity, but through those terse sentences in which this story is written, there is so much.
