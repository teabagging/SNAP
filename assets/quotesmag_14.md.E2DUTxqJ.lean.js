A bit too much Hogan, Hall & Nash. There were other members to see. Wish they had used a different War Games than the one they did (fake Sting one or Henning turning on the Horsemen).

This book provides an impressive number of films but come on! There are westerns, horror films, adventure films and simple dramas. WAY too inclusive for any kind of true film fan. (and still oddly missing a few marginal noirs) Also, the author has a strange obsession with what TV shows the actors from films have also been in. In nearly every review he mentions some TV show that so-and-so also appeared in. That information is included while he leaves out such important elements to the noir style as who the cinematographer or composers are! A huge oversight. Plus the reviews are often plot spoilers. For how expensive this book is I was highly disappointed. I'd stay with Spencer Selby's 'Dark City' While you could argue that it needs an update to include some more films, it is a far better thumbnail guide to the noir catalog."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Perfect Noir Guide For Fan, Movie Lover, Researcher or Student","review":"I will not repeat the many great things said by other reviewers about Michael Keaney's Fantastic Film Noir Guide.However, I will say it the easiest to use, the most comprehensive, the most accurate, the most cross-referenced, the most well-written and the easiest to read.

You have no idea which park your at so if you would like to travel there to see the scenes first hand you can't.

If you want to see just how aweful this book is then check it out in a bookstore first. Most of the examples don't work. There are code bugs, typos, and you'll need just about every free download that Microsoft has but doesn't ship with the MSDN subscription just to make some thing work. After you work through all of their bugs you should be fairly proficient at trouble shooting an IIS and IE4/5 application.

If anyone who will ever use your web site will use a browser other than IE4, then the majority of the information in this book is useless. Even the chapters that contain useful information aren't especially well organized.

For the price, one would expect more thorough analysis. The CD is problematic, I had to reload 4 times and load files manually just to get all the sample files. This book turns to other MS apps everywhere: MS agent, RDS, Front Page. There is not one sample app that stands alone, and it doesn't cover the MS products thouroughly enough to stand out there either. It also assumes you are programming on a machine with direct access to the web server. This is never true in my environment. All my apps are programmed on a remote machine then migrated upt o a production server.

That's why I'm donating my copy to the public library."},{"rating":"2","title":"The right book with the wrong title","review":"This book is well written, concise and clear. It provides information on Active Server Pages and all Microsoft's related technologies. The one problem that it has is a misleading title, which caused so many bad reviews here. It is a great primer on Microsoft's new Internet technologies for dynamic web sites. It is self-contained and goal-oriented. Forget the title and get the book for what it actually offers, if that is what you are looking for. You will not be disappointed.

The on-line documentation and tutorial that comes with the ASP install is more informative and follows fewer tangents."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is PATHETIC!","review":"You would expect a book from Microsoft Press titled \\"Programming Active Server Pages\\" to have some useful information. NOT! Instead you get very brief overviews of subjects like dynamic html, client-side Scripting, ActiveX, cascading style sheets, installing IIS, and microsoft transaction server. The actual discussion of ASP covers only 25 pages and is very simplistic (there are three simple examples too).

The ending was the most drawn out, unsatisfying piece of garbage I've ever seen. When I read that 3 people wrote this film, I figured it was when they were out in the desert spewing dialogue - 2 actors walking, the director holding the camera and the guy writing down what everone said while they were walking around.

It was so annoying and frustrating - I can't even describe the anger I felt at paying to watch it.Do anything with your life than watching Gerry.What a shame Amazon dont allow for zero stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE MOVIE!","review":"This was, by far, the worste movie I ever saw in my entire life!! I can't believe that Matt Damon actually agreed to do this movie. No plot, no script...what a bore! Two guys walking through the dessert. That is the whole movie. You watch two guys walking for two hours and at the end, one lays down and dies. That's it. Biggest waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Burn it","review":"This movie is so bad I can't believe I am even bothering expressing my opinion on it. Burn it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pluck out your own eyeballs first.","review":"This movie is absolutely wrong. I can't figure out if these talented guys did this as a joke or not. You know the type.. artsy fartsy people staring and some blob of crap on canvas and trying to be oh so much smarter than the world and finding the meaning of life in the blob. If they did it as a spoof of these boring people then bravo, awesome job. Next time though, let us in on the joke ahead of time. I would have rather spent the time with my family. This movie is easily the worst movie I have ever seen and I have seen some serious trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"GERRYatrics.","review":"This flick is boring beyond belief. Filmed entertainment is suppose to entertain, right? Here's the lowdown; two morons go hiking without hiking equiptment or a clue where it is they are going in the middle of a desert nowhere. They get lost. They continue to tread off in the obviously wrong direction (for cinemasenic puposes I can only guess). After what seems like two weeks (I think it's three days) one dies and the other is saved. That's it. The rest of the film consists of excruciatingly long shots of DAMON and AFFLECK walking silently or actual true-time sunsets. There is no character development and the plot is about as thick as the ten page script (has to be). The opening is ten minutes of the two quietly driving and whilst viewing I couldn't help but smell artsy vanity project, and by the end I knew it was cause this movie stinks. BO-RING."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievable waste of time!!!!!","review":"This is the worst movie I have ever seen...period!!!!! I feel sorry for anyone wasting their time watching it! You would do better watching the blank screen and not putting the movie in!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like bad movies you will love gerry!","review":"This is without a doubt the worst movie I have ever had the disprivlidge to see. This movie was so dull and boring I literally fell asleep. The dialogue was incoherent and obscure. The only part that even made me laugh was when Casey Afleck jumped off a rock, although I doubt that was meant as comical. Its funny to think how many people it takes to make a movie (writers,actors,directors,producers,sound etc..)The blame for this horrific film cannot be solely placed on Afleck, or Gus Van Sand. Everyone must take the fall for this crap in cinema form. Everyone from the key grip to the academy award winning actor Matt Dameon. Anyone who had anything to do with the making of Gerry keep youre heads down with shame. You are responsible for the worst movie ever made."},{"rating":"1","title":"Postcards!","review":"Stunning scenery, cinematography and creative use of ambient light gives the movie a dreamscape like quality. However, the two actors punctuating the serene scenery spoil the dream to a rude awakening.The desert predicament of the Gerry's seems so childish and stupid that the viewer cannot help feeling a little irritated. Some of the dialogs are downright laughable (not for their ingenuity, but for their stupidity).Nonetheless, the scenery is astonishingly beautiful and that lends a redeeming factor to the movie that'll make you sit through the end. Surprisingly, the 100 odd minutes don't seem to long. The movie can be seen a failed attempt for creating a minimalist, but oddly compelling movie genre that Hollywood seems to be missing."},{"rating":"1","title":"how much awful can you get?","review":"Listen up movie goers this movie has to be the absolute worst movie i've ever seen.And i truly mean that.When i say boring i mean it.For the few reviews that say there is some type of creative side to this movie,what are they smokin? This movie is nothin but two guys walkin around some harsh terrain lost,rarely saying anything, thats it!Theres nothing else.Some people say you need alot of patience to watch this movie I've watched Godsford Park at least 5 times i know patience'this movie had to be made just to see what matt damom and the afflecks can get away with,example is myself i paid full price plus tax on this awful movie to see, well \\"nothing\\" i guess is the most appropriate word i can use on this website. Please lay off this one!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Total waste of time and film!!!!","review":"Ever wonder why your dvd has a fast forward button? Its to get through 5-10 minute long shots of these 2 driving down a road with no dialogue, 5-10 minute long shots of showing the back of their heads and 5-10 minute long shots of them walking. I just finished this very painful movie and felt it my duty to try to save others from wasting 110 minutes of their life on this worthless boring excuse for a film. It had all the suspense of watching grass grow or waiting for a dollop of heinz 57 to drop. Honestly theres about enough dialogue to fill MAYBE 3-4 sheets of notebook paper and thats being generous. Dont waste your time!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Good 'Background Music' Movie","review":"I bought this DVD because I thought it would be a survival story, showing the emotional turmoil of being lost in the desert. I think it really fails on that account; The two men never seemed to get very angry at each other, or even at their situation, nor did the movie show any elation at finally finding civilization. It was unclear to me if one man died, but if he did the other Gerry sure didn't show much emotion about it.Another thing I found curious was that their beards didn't seem to grow much for being lost for days in the desert. They did not seem show any desperation for water, either.The best I can say about this movie is that it does show spectacular desert scenery. One other thing I did appreciate about the movie is that I could do other things while the movie was playing and I wasn't afraid of missing anything. In short, maybe this DVD is best played when one is alone. but doesn't want to feel alone, while they read a magazine or an Amazon.com book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Use the DVD for target practice, burn it, toss it, forget it","review":"What more do I need to say? This is the worst film I have ever seen. Actually, it was also the fastest film I've ever seen. It was so boring I was able to fast forward through the thing in about 5 minutes and get the main idea. If I could give it a minus 10 stars, I would. Did I miss something with this film? If I did, I guess I am not too worried about it. I have better things to do."},{"rating":"1","title":"A no brainer.....","review":"What idiots would stop a car in the middle of nowhere and start running without any thought as to where they were going, or had gone? What idiots would wander away from an area of obvious vegetation and obvious water potential, for miles, to seek an elevated area that was eons away from where they stopped in the first place? What idiots wouldn't at least have left a trail from where they started so they could return? What idiots would separate to seek higher ground amongst mountainous territory that all looked the same? Not this one! What idiot would buy this video? Yes sadly, me!!! This movie, which is far too high priced for the boring dissertation that it is, was a total disappointment and certainly didn't take any talent to write or act in, on the part of Messrs. Affleck and Damon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Movies are not novels","review":"A film is different art form than a book. Most movies don't know that. They are just a visual story, that a book could tell by words. In other words, all you need to know about most movies is their script.Gerry, just like Elephant, is a great example of how you can pass this visceral cinematic feeling that you can only get by a meaningfull image. What's the story in Gerry? Where are the plot ponts? So few... But even so, both movies have the feelings of living those situations more than any dumb film we go watch every month. Life is not like a movie, crazy things don't happen every 10 minutes, and Gus Van Saint knows that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful","review":"My husband and I are willing to watch and give any movie a chance - this was dreadfully boring. The barren desert scenery wasn't asthetically pleasing enough to overcome the total lack of dialogue between the actors. Who wants to watch 2 guys walk aroung a desert not speaking to each other for 90 minutes? Even Matt Damon didn't do it for me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time... PLEASE!","review":"I was very disappointed after watching this movie, I have never seen anything horrible like it. You will spend a good portion of the movie watching feet cross the desert, really. Too boring. I am usually open-minded when it comes to movies. I can't see why there is even 1 person that says they enjoyed it. huh?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Student's Review of Fodor's Montreal","review":"Fodor's guide to Montreal and Quebec City was a fairly good tour guide book. The maps were easy to use and understand. Rather than having one large map, they're were 4 mini-maps of the places in Montreal to visit, making it effecient to travel. The map of the Metro system was also appreciated. All tour sites listed included was Metro line to take and where to get off. The guide was thorough and covered ALL tourist sites in Montreal. The only thing lacking in the guide was the amount of inexpensive restaurants listed, as well some admission prices were not correct. Overall a very good book for the first time traveller. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"Loved his Middle Earth CD. This two cd set of 25 tracks only had one that I enjoyed.

The toys at the pet shop are a bit pricey, and he really likes the blue racquetball we have. The problem is that he keeps losing the ball in the house and when he wants to play, he can't remember where he lost it. I figured I would buy a pack of these and while he would have more opportunities to lose balls, he would also have more opportunities to find them. They are the perfect size for him and he just can't get enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Failed badly","review":"I am a beginner play, but I am not impressed with the Pro Penn balls I bought.

The stories and pictures presented can't be found anywhere else. This collection of memories and legends are printed in English on the left side, and in Eskimo on the right side of the book. Reading these stories gives one the ideas of how they lived, the great oral tradition, and how the language of the King Islanders look on paper. In the back are the original King Island family names, with the original pronunciations. This is a really good book!! (for kids and parents).

Jon Malay has given us all that in his first novel and I'm eager for a second. This book is a fast-paced read, a perfect airplane companion and would make a great movie. I'd love to see the visuals and special effects. I found the three women in this novel intriguing and well portrayed by the male author. There's the rather cold, all-business professional; a brilliant and warm NASA colleague, and the Madonna-like Maria. Watching the dynamincs between them and our hero, NASA astronaut, Michael St. Pierre, was secondary to the adventure of outer space and Mike's exploration of spiritual mysteries, but certainly held this woman's attention.

I have ever heard in my entire life. I wouldn't be surprised if the amateurs at Hallmark music & entertainment picked a cassette of 'Here's Little Richard' at a garage sale, set the equalizer to high across the board, and used a computer microphone to record it onto C.D. Do yourself a favor, stay far away from this horrendous version and buy the double album on Gold C.D.

I would recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Informative, but boring","review":"Bought this book for my anthropology class, and even the professor decided after this one semester she wouldn't be having her class read this, because it is a very slow, boring read.

This is simply not true. The book does not include 1 line of computer code, and of 928 pages only around 2 pages are concerned with numerical methods (a few results from the 1970s are quoted). Generally the book is confusing, e.g. by the order in which the different subjects are presented. Nielsen goes to great length in explaining simple things, and covers more difficult material only superficially. Moreover, the typesetting and the figures (many of them hand drawn) leave much to be desired..."},{"rating":"2","title":"G.Baudino is the Pagan author of the millenia","review":"Gael Baudino is an amazing author. Any Pagan is sure to love it. Even non-pagans will like it. Her writing has a crystal beauty to it. She makes you feel the characters, to know them. Adrenaline races through your veins, tears flow from your eyes. When the book is over, it's like a part of your life is over...until you read the next one"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT rock & roll fantasy","review":"This is a beautiful, brilliant rock & roll fantasy about a harper from the land of Faerie who forms a heavy-metal rock & roll band 2 try & blast a hole thru reality & retrieve her lost love from The Other Side -- & it works. The adventures on The Other Side I found kinda boring, truthfully, but the main story is heartfelt, involving, vivid, & Baudino has the rock & roll Dtails down solid. The feeling of Bing in a rock band is perfectly evoked, & the way the heroine's faith, confidence & optimism rescues not only her lover but her bandmates makes 4 a glorious happy Nding. Not sure why this book failed 2 sell a million copies, but it's 1 of the great overlooked fantasies of R time.

If you have the slightest familiarity with the subject, such as having read a science periodical article about it, this book is probably a waste of your time. Much of it is not very useful graphics and text blocks, and the actual narrative is sparse and overly simplistic.

It has wonderful construction ideas for children, step-by-step pictures, key vocabulary, great descriptions of all kinds of buildings in both the natural world and those constructed by people, and even includes stories and other language arts connections. Of course the connections to science, social studies, and math are natural outcomes of the projects. Wow! One could teach from this book with no other curriculum and fill a year with child-centered activities and learning. Creative students will love the ideas supplied in this book and every child will be challenged to look at the many forms of construction we see around us with new eyes. I'd recommend this book to parents of kids ages 4-14 and to teachers who enjoy providing creative educational instruction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Steven Caney's Ultimate Building Book","review":"This is an excellent book whether you're an adult or child. Not only are there interesting projects to do, the author explains about the different types of architecture (buildings, bridges,etc.) found throughout the world. He also includes nature made structures such as beehives, spider webs, beaver dams, nests, termite mounds, etc. A very detailed, but easy-to-read and understand book to share with your child."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for kids who want to build stuff","review":"Took this book out of the library for my son, 13, because he likes to build stuff. Decided it was a book we should own. It is full of information for kids on how to build things, how to correctly use tools, and why things work. I especially like it because it explains how to use tools and which tools to pick. It includes quite a bit of history and explanation, which you can skim or skip, but it is aimed at older children. My son likes to invent and make stuff. This book is great for things like, \\"If I want to build a bridge over something, what shapes should I make the beams?\\" And, \\"Why are certain configurations of beams stronger than others?\\" The book also shows a lot of ways to use materials around the house and in nature - so it doesn't require buying a lot of stuff. I'm hoping this will help my son make his inventions and creations stronger and more successful."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best \\"how to make things at home\\" books I have seen","review":"Man, this book has it all for the 'kid at home' project center. It has not only the project but the history of what the project is based on and real life examples of how the principles are used and it just keeps going. It may be a bit daunting for a 10 year old to try to tackle this book by themselves but once they get going it just keeps giving.I highly recomend this one for anyone who has kids at home."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent writing, but doesn't live up to the hype.","review":"As somewhat of a skeptic, but still keeping an open mind, I enjoy topics such a \`bigfoot' when they're written intelligently and with a base of reason. As for \\"Where Bigfoot Walks\\", I should've looked at other reviews of this book a bit more, but when Midwest book review stated things like \\"...fascinating study of Bigfoot legends and realities...\\" I gambled- and lost. For outdoor enthusiasts, this is a rich story of a man's travels through the wilderness. And I must hand it to Mr. Pyle, he really does write well. It almost seems as if he anticipated readers interested in bigfoot to get bored with it quickly, like when he goes on about hitching rides from Indians because he runs out of water- or something like that, but his timing is right and just as you're about to toss the book aside he throws in something interesting enough to get you to keep reading. In the end though, it's all rather anticlimactic, and not what I was looking for."},{"rating":"1","title":"ZZZzzzzzzzz continued","review":"I forgot to mention that if you're looking for good books on Bigfoot or Sasquatch, you start with Dr. John Bindernagel's 1998 summary, \\"North America's Great Ape: the Sasquatch\\" (available from Beachcomber Books in Courtney, B.C., 1-800-487-1494 or 250-338-8767).

Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"ZZZzzzzzzzzzzzz...","review":"As a well-travelled and experienced Canadian naturalist who has seen most forms of rare wildlife on the continent, including the ghostly Kermode bear, I give this book a fat zero for content. The new insights and personal stories from others that Pyle adds to the record are simply not worth looking for in this verbose piece of crap. And he got a Guggenheim for this?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not My Cup of Tea","review":"I admit that I bought this bigfoot book because it was cheap, yet purported to be written by a serious scholar. That sounded like a good deal.Throughout the book the author claims he's not searching for bigfoot. I feel he's saying that to elevate himself above those who have made a committment to trying to find the creature. What he does instead is attempt unsuccessfully to take extremely long foot journeys (which he usually quits half way through) into the wilderness.The book is thus filled with descriptions of the fauna, and mostly, flora, of the forest. He tells a little bit about other researchers. He tells about hunters and people who have shown a taste for destruction. He tells about his three or four wives. I would skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware the title","review":"I'll make this brief, for the people interested in bigfoot/sasquatch, forget all about this book. Now the good point... for the people that enjoy a well written book on a long nature walk, you'll eat this up. Pile is very detailed in his descriptions of nature and you should really enjoy this book. Bigfoot followers... not so much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where Bigfoot walks: crossing the dark divide","review":"As many others have said, this book is a true waste of time if you are looking for answers about Sasquatch. If you want to walk naked with a tree hugger, city dude who shouldn't be in the woods. This is a book for you. His knowledge is great if your are a bird watcher, nudist, and flatlander. His shear disregard for the basic knowledge on the wilderness, is uncanny. To read a book of birds and their calls is great. But, to bring inefficient and poor nutritional food into a wilderness, alone to boot. I am surprised he survived. If you are a \\"TRUE OUTDOORSMAN or WOMAN\\" don't waste your time with this book. There are many titles on the \\"Sasquatch or Bigfoot\\" Subject that are far more worth the time to research... I believe this author simply used the term \\"bigfoot\\" to market and sell books. This book is not for the real enthusiast."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bait And Switch","review":"I found this book interminable. I often found myself thinking, \\"Get ON with it, already!\\"It's presented as a book about Bigfoot, but the author was plainly more interested in impressing the reader with his bona fides as a naturalist than he was in investigating, or even thinking much about, the Bigfoot phenomenon. If I'd wanted to read a book about trees and plants or a history of logging and forestry in the Pacific Northwest, I'd have looked for an appropriate field guide or historical tome.Recommended if you're interested in nature in a broad sense. If you're hoping to learn more about Bigfoot, not so much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"I thought this book was about bigfoot. It is not. What little that is written about bigfoot is just a rehashing of much told events.Occasionally there was some interesting areas such as the author relating his meetings throughout his travels with a diverse group of people. The dialouge between himself and them was often interesting. But there is little of that. Most of it is his own feelings and musings about nature. Often these musings will go on for pages about such mundane subjects as moths. And at times the author does get a bit kooky, like when he talks about walking naked through the forests.At times his writing is good though. (Hence the 2 stars) The nature of the subject matter was just too boring and hippyish to hold my interest throughout."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst non-fiction book that i've ever read on Bigfoot","review":"The only time that bigfoot is ever talked about is every few pages almost as an after thought. I've never written a review like this but I feel robbed. The book should have a title like a walk in the northwestern U.S. and some fauna and some animals that I saw. Since 1964 this is the absolute worst. Not even well written. Don't even bother. The title is missleading to say the least. The author mentions a grant. He must have had an attorney to let him know what was the very least that the subject of bigfoot had to appear to be legal."},{"rating":"2","title":"odd, but really good","review":"There are a few songs that in my opinion are too odd and not that enjoyable to listen to, in particular \\"Superfan.\\" But others are really great, and especially \\"Merry Xmas Emily\\" is probably my favorite Cracker song, a great, hard-driving rock song about lost love, with the great line, \\"I still think about you, do you still think about me?\\" I've been singing that one a lot. i don't know how that song didn't become a hit, and why you can't even buy this album new on Amazon. A tragedy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bonus CD will make you thump","review":"The new Cracker album picks up where the mischievous boys left off. The new songs evoke the quirkier side of Camper Van Beethoven with the hard rocking side of previous Cracker albums. The real surprise is the Bonus CD that finds the band in top form.

A lot of the songs are about being in a band; self-mocking our complaints, and celebrating the weird stuff that needs to be celebrated. I didn't even realize it until we were mixing the album, when someone said, 'oh, it's a concept album about being in a band.\\" The creative core of Cracker has remained unchanged throughout the four albums: Lowery sings lead on most songs and plays rhythm guitar; Johnny Hickman plays lead guitar and sings lead and background. Both men write the songs, sometimes together, sometimes individually. Lowery and Hickman are joined by longtime Cracker bassist Bob Rupe, drummer Frank Funaro, and Kenny Margolis on keyboards and accordion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cracker's worst album","review":"Someone has to bring the average down.

It contains many, many interviews with the 'movers and shakers' in solar system exploration and interpretation. There is also an enormous amount of wonderful original footage illustrating the text, and extremely well produced computer graphic imaginary to show things for things for which no footage exists or to set the 'atmosphere' of excitement that is part and parcel of working on what is often the cutting edge of human knowledge of the universe we live in.This DVD well deserves every one of its five stars.

The weaknesses were immediately apparent--awkward dialogue, lack of visual style--but I hoped the movie would overcome its faults. It didn't. Unlike, for example, Wedding for Bella, which had some similar shortcomings and obvious outcomes, this movie never made me care about the lead characters--they were two-dimensional sketches rather than fleshed-out characters. I liked Amy Jo Johnson, although being a 30-year-old playing \\"the teenager\\" suggests a reason for her undistinguished career, and I liked Liz Vassey who was also relaxed in her character rather than awkwardly acting a part.

We gave up and went back to the Swaddlers Halo Sleep Sack, which he promptly pulled an arm from and started sucking on his hand.

Then you use the large wrap to swaddle them up. To me, the mini arm wraps were hard to use because I couldn't hold the kid's arms down, use the wraps, and then wrap up the whole thing without him wriggling free. It was too many things to do all at once.In the end, we just used the large swaddling blankets we took home from the hospital. I don't know how others use a regular blanket for swaddling, but the way I do it only requires me to immobilize one arm at a time. Yes you have to learn how to do the multiple folds and that is too complicated for some people.

I soon began to panic and wake up all night checking to make sure the material was not choking my son. Also, their arms can get stuck in weird positions within the swaddle.Also, do not leave your baby swaddled in a swing or bouncy chair unless you leave the feet pocket off.Because my son has GER he needs to be swaddled to get any sleep.

I bought a cheaper one with velcro when our other two Miracle Blankets were dirty and did not like it as much. He also grew out of it in a week or two. Can't beat Miracle blankets!"},{"rating":"2","title":"baby sleeps like a baby","review":"This is a great product. Baby can't wiggle free. He's wrapped snuggly and I have no fear of the blanket getting bunched up around his face. Must by for any new mommy."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was a miracle for us!","review":"Our baby had the whole newborn flinging arms thing going on and would wake herself up after only 20 mins no matter what we did. That went on for the first few months. At first we just dealt with it and spent hours rocking her back to sleep in the wee hours..UNTIL WE FOUND THIS..and VOILA!!! She started sleeping hours straight! It worked great until around 5 months when she just wiggled so much it became a wrestling match to get her in at night. But by then her newborn startle thing was gone and we just started using big swaddle blankets, loosely swaddled.If you are having a hard time getting your baby to sleep for any great length and you suspect somehow they are waking themselves up...try this! I was so thankful that I now give it for baby shower gifts. Now I give the REAL gifts...those that help a new parent GET SOME SLEEP!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Right up there with the parting of the Red Sea!","review":"At first I thought the name was sort of ridiculous but it turns out.. no! This blanket has made all of the difference for our little guy... he is a great sleeper as a result of using it. He is now 3 1/2 months old and we're starting to consider discontinuing it soon but we're certainly not in any rush... it's incredible - an essential baby item!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This blanket is a true miracle","review":"We bought this blanket on the advice of a friend. When we first got it, I felt like I was putting my baby into a straight jacket, but IT WORKED. Our baby slept longer and was easier to nurse. I believe that when babies are tiny, their arms flail around and wake them up. Think about it, a baby spends 9 months floating around in water and then they pop out and their limbs just wave about and they have no control. Wrapping our daughter up tight calmed her down and helped her sleep. In fact, as soon as we started to wrap her she'd smile and relax--she knew it was time to go to sleep.We used this blanket religiously every night until well past our daughter's first birthday. She loved it. We used it so much that we wore a hole in it (because really she was too big for it.) I have told friends to use it, and they have the same results. Miracle, really!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not safe for bigger/active babies","review":"My 3mth old is big & long and is about to outgrow his swaddler blankets (I use HALO and love them!). I am not ready to give up the swaddle, so I was looking for something else to use. This had such great reviews, that I thought I would give it a try. He woke up in the middle of the night with the blanket completely off and the long strap wraped around his neck and around his face :( In the blankets defense, he was at the larger end of the weight limit (he's 16lbs), so maybe it would work on smaller babies? I would rather have the velcro stracth or wake him up then use something unsafe. I also didn't love that you had to strap their arms straight down to their sides. Not a huge deal, but just a personal preferance. I returned it.BTW...I found the Woombie has some swaddlers that go up to 19 and even 26lbs. I haven't tried them though, so I have no idea if they're any good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Small","review":"Considering the great reviews, I was disappointed in this product. We bought this swaddle blanket when our baby was about 1 and 1/2 months, and it was already too small. She was able to get her legs out by pushing the bottom part down and creating a space in between the wrap and the bottom. When wrapped tighter she would push the entire thing down with her legs, thereby freeing her arms. Also, it's not really easy to put back on after middle of the night feedings, it's quite a long process."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to swaddle","review":"I was told by friends that I had to have this blanket for my new baby. I thought $30 was a little much, but my friends were very convincing. When I received it and tried it out, it was impossible to get on my baby. I have used other swaddle blankets with greater ease. All in all I would not waste my money on this blanket again when there are easier to use ones for less."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a fan!","review":"This product is great in theory, but very impractical. the \\"straps\\" that wrap around the baby's arms are way to thick and bulky and so it bunches up underneath the baby and isnt comfortable. This swaddle also leaves the baby's legs way too much room to kick around and wake themselves up. It is aso tedious to have to unwrap this in the middle of the night to change a diaper. I was very dissappointed with this product so I returned it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work.","review":"After reading \\"The Happiest Baby\\" book I planned to swaddle my baby. I bought various swaddling contraptions, this being one of them. First of all, the nurses at the hospital are expert swaddlers and can teach you how to use a simple receiving blanket to give a way better swaddle than this thing could ever create. Second, I happened to have a super baby who despised swaddling and bust out of even the tightest swaddles. This thing was a joke to her.. she'd be out before I could finish wrapping her. This is just another thing I wasted my money on while pregnant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Developmentally inappropriate","review":"[...] Read this.....swaddling an infant with his/her arms down is inappropriate.

We have tried swaddling with Aden and Anais and other blankets but our little one can struggle and get out of the swaddle no matter how tight we swaddle her.With the miracle blanket, the extra pieces of fabric make it a lot harder for the baby to get out of a swaddle. This product is truly a miracle product. I bought three more and this is our first choice when we need to swaddle our baby! We also have a woombie and swaddleme and our baby hates both."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Lifesaver!","review":"My husband and I purchased a miracle blanket after reading about it online. We were morons when it came to using a plain receiving blanket - our son would always wind up an unraveled mess. The MB is awesome - it wraps him tight and secures his arms so he can't get them free. It really seemed to calm him down when he was fussy. We couldn't do without it. Pricey, but worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Writing my first-ever review because I liked this so much","review":"As I said, I'm great about READING reviews but not about writing them . . .but this product really deserves a public kudos. My kids were not sleeping through the night (three-month old twins) and in desperation I searched Amazon looking for a swaddle that wasn't as heavy as our Halo microfleece sleep sacks. I saw the reviews for this, thought \\"Why not?\\" and bought it. No joke, my son slept four hours the first night I used it and six nights the following night when I used the swaddle plus a co-sleeper.

Also you couldn't use this for anything but swaddling...waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expensive, and easy for baby to break out of","review":"Every baby is different but ours did not do well with the miracle blanket. People had told me how great it was, so I was willing to spend the money, since it is pretty expensive, but in the end it was a waste. We ordered it because he had started breaking out of the velcro swaddles at night, and waking himself up. But, not only was the miracle blanket very tricky to put on, but he broke out of it even more frequently than the velcro swaddle."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE ONLY Swaddle blanket that works for us!","review":"We have tried the Swaddle Me, the Swaddle Blanket, and the Miracle Blanket. The ONLY one our daughter (now two - she used it for about 3 months) and now our 2 month old son does not break out of is the Miracle Blanket.ADVANTAGES* Works differently than others - holds arms at side with two \\"flaps\\" that tuck under the body (uses body weight), and then a longer piece wraps around the baby. The end result is a very tight but comfortable looking coocoon that works!* NO VELCRO - The velcro on the Swaddle Me kept waking our daughter up!* Keeps them warm with nothing else required.DISADVANTAGES* The part that swaddles the bottom half of the body sometimes come loose - you have to make sure that you wrap the blanket around the lower half o the body REALLY well!* Nothing else we can think of"},{"rating":"2","title":"Does exactly what it says...","review":"When I first bought this product it seemed a little overly complicated. Plus, my daughter seemed a bit small for it. As a result I ended up using the Kiddopotamus swaddle which is simpler but in my opinion much more cheaply constructed and easily outgrown.I started going back to using this product now that my daughter has a few more weeks on her, and I absolutely love it. Now that I've gotten the hang of putting it on her, she goes to sleep so much faster and sleeps for longer periods at a time. It also helps in keeping her warm at night as her room can get really drafty. I would easily recommend this to anyone with a child who responds well to being swaddled. It's the best way to swaddle that I've seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many steps & dangerous","review":"I read all the good reviews and bought this miracle blanket for my 8 weeks baby. It was too many steps to swaddle the baby, and almost impossible to swaddle a cranky baby. My daughter did like it once she was swaddled, but in the morning when she was crying & kicking, the longer side of the wrap was wrapped around her neck, and her legs were already out. Dangerous!! I don't know why others like it so much, but it did not work for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"The only swaddle that holds my baby","review":"This was the only blanket that kept my newborn tightly swaddled. Although I love the large Aden & Anais muslin swaddlers, no matter how well I wrapped them around her, she would inevitably sneak out an arm.If you want to swaddle your baby and happen to have a little Houdini, this is the best product on the market that will keep them wrapped up nice and snug."},{"rating":"2","title":"i love this thing","review":"we got this present as a gift - and what a god send. my baby just sleeps so much better and for longer periods while wrapped up in it. at first i was a little startled because it reminded me so much of a straight jacket, but after seeing how well my baby slept in it, i am completely past it. when he sleeps on his back, his arms flail in his sleep and he startles easily, waking himself up. i don't want to put him on his belly because of increased sids risks. this blanket keeps him from startling and still on his back, so it solves everything."},{"rating":"2","title":"Miracle Blanket - Baby Swaddling Blanket","review":"It works well, but needs to have a few things to make it perfect. My daughter is only 4 months old and can bust out of it like the Hulk in a styrofoam building. I think the arm parts need something a little extra to keep the arms more down, maybe a button or a velcro connection. At any rate, it does do it's job, but it's frustrating that she keeps getting out, lol!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Swaddler Blanket!","review":"I ordered this swaddler because it states that it can be used from newborn on. I have yet to use it on a newborn, I'm still preggo. However, I did babysit a 2 month old for a friend and used this blanket and he loved it. She had told me he didn't like to be swaddled but in this blanket he slept soundly and did not fuss. I purchased other swaddler blankets for my daughter that used velcro to secure and I was not fond of the sizing or the velcro. With this blanket, gravity, and baby weight is secure mechanism. I would recommend this blanket to any parents. Can't wait to get daily use out of it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bob's Red Mill Baking Book Review","review":"Lots of information on various grains. Good recipes but not necessarily low in calorie or sugar (wanted more healthy recipes). Many recipes use items not commonly found in the pantry, most likely having to buy more than needed at a health food store. Uses the ingredient \\"hard white whole wheat flour\\" in many recipes but fails to give a description of that ingredient except in an excerpt from another recipe I happened to peruse which states it is AKA bread flour. Why not simply state \\"bread flour\\"? Will adapt many recipes to use Splenda and less white flour. Overall a good book but wish there were pictures of the finished product and the nutritional information."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle version review - There's a BIG oops factor","review":"I'll re do my rate on this item if you fix the index in the Kindle version. One of the nice features of non-fiction books with indices is that the Kindle versions have active links in not just the table of contents, but also in the index.I love the recipes I have tried, but, I was hearing about xanthan gum and wanted to know more. So, I look it up in the index and there isn't a link to find out more information. I don't see it in the table of contents. This book doesn't have interactive links in the index and no page numbers to figure out where to find xanthan gum. There are NO NUMBER LINKS FOR ANYTHING IN THE INDEX!!!

I too have lots of experience with bread baking & was hoping for whole grain delicious breads to off set the high price in the grocery store. After making 2 of the whole grain recipes, I could see that the ingredients were off in their ratios & neither breads very good. It is too costly all around to use recipes that don't work & taste bad. I emailed Bob & asked if they actually made the recipes &/or did they scale down large batch recipes. I won't risk my money, time, fuel costs on another recipe in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this one","review":"I am an avid baker and am always looking for ways to incorporate whole grains into my diet. This book has recipes for a great variety of grains - more than just whole wheat. However, I've been trying recipes from the Bob's Red Mill Baking Book for over a year, and am consistently disappointed - they just aren't reliable. If gluten is a problem for you, this book might be worth looking into. If not, go for the King Arthur Flour Whole Grain Baking Book instead - recipes are wheat-based but always delicious."},{"rating":"1","title":"Recipes Don't Work","review":"I tried two recipes - the whole wheat pretzels and the cardamom rolls. The whole wheat pretzels were bread sticks (not the crunchy texture of pretzels as the recipe claimed they would be). The cardamom rolls never did rise. I tried the recipe twice! It was more the consistency of cookie dough than bread dough. A big waste of ingredients and time. I am a fan of Bob Red's Mill products and really wanted to like this book hoping the other reviewers just had bad luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some Specific Corrections","review":"The Pumpkin Cranberry Bread on p. 101 is delicious if you double all the spices, however it makes one loaf, not two. The Banana Flax Bread on p. 104 has an unpleasantly gritty texture, but (fortunately) it makes one loaf, not two. The Pumpkin Bundt Cake recipe on p. 449 calls for just 1 cup of flour--I doubt that's enough. (The Bob's Red Mill customer service rep said the author is unavailable for questions, so I should just eyeball the batter and add more flour if necessary.) On a positive note, the Maple Pecan Muffins on p. 130 were very nice, if small. If you like to experiment with new grains, or need gluten-free recipes (I haven't tested any of them), and you can spot problems just by reading a recipe and will know how to correct bad ones, you'll manage. But why do John Ettinger's work for him?

The watchout: the Rio Music manager software can't encode mp3 songs unless you download an upgrade from the net which you can do only three times, so, if you change your computer or just want to install it more than three times you might as well forget about using mp3's.Oh, calling customer service? right... I've been waiting for an answer 10 days and counting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy if you're an audiophile","review":"I purchased the Rio Chiba with hopes to not have to carry around a portable CD player anymore. Unfortunately I had to go back to the CD's. The Chiba's interface and size seemed nice enough to make me buy it, but I only had to listen to it once before putting it down. I tired a few different songs from different genres (all recorded at 192 kbps or higher) and couldn't get one to sound good. There was no bass, the mids were thin and the trebel was tinny. I suppose if you're not huge on sound quality, you may find this unit appealing for it's other features, but if you're picky on sound, look elsewhere (the iPod and iPod clones all seem much nicer)."},{"rating":"2","title":"So easy to use!","review":"This is so easy to use. Just install the software, plug in the chiba, open Windows Media, and BOOM! transfer your music. doesn't get any easier. This little gadget is just as easy to listen to. The controls are super simple to figure out, the tuner works well (There are only 2 good stations in my area), but the reception isn't terrific inside. I like that the memory card is hidden away inside the battery compartment. The belt clip cover thingy isn't too attractive, but the Chiba is still easy to use when it's in it. I had to cut the hole in the case a bit larger to fit my headphones, but aside from that, no other modifications need be made. This little thing even has a stop watch! I had another player for a very short time, but the software refused to work with my computer. Not the chiba! If you look around, you can find this for a cheaper price than Amazon offers it for. It's well worth the $130 I paid for it.

Plus, you can use an MMC card to add additional space for songs. Also, the battery efficiency is outstanding. The Rio Chiba only needs ONE, count em, ONE AAA battery, and still lasts AT LEAST as long as my old iPAQ, which uses TWO. I am VERY pleased with this product. There is one slight detail that I do not like. I am having trouble using Windows Media Player as a transfering host. So basically, you're stuck with the Rio Management, which is still very good.

But I have to agree with most of the reviewers of this toy - it's a bit boring. After the novelty of this toy wore off, I started questioning my purchase. It's extremely limited in that there's no real reward or consequence in the way you care for this toy (à la Tamagotchi); and, as many people have already mentioned, all the chirping does get annoying after a while.

Maybe these songs are remastered, but I expected remastered recordings with Ray Benson. I guess it's my fault for not listening to the samples available (pulling a** kicking machine lever now).

I would mop up the puddles, but about an hour later, enough water dripped down to form a big puddle.2.) the threads on one seam were loose, and the seam came apart as soon as the fabric was stretched. This was a tent right out of the box!I would not recommend this tent to anyone. I returned it promptly.UPDATE: As a camping newbie, I did not seam seal the tent. However, if you look at this tent design, the fly is right over the windows, which means the rain water will drip into the window. I'm not sure this is a good design. Even though the window was zipped shut, water will drip thru the seams, which is where I had the leaks.

I would suggest this book for anyone interested in the History of the Bible. It does NOT appear to be biased--just pure and simple history, not necessarily theology.

No problems or conflicts with software or hard drive. I mean, take out an extended warrenty if you are worried.

In the 2 years I have owned it, it has not performed reliably for more than 2 weeks at a time. It continues to display the UPGRADER message, a problem which is unresolved by upgrading the firmware, as Tech Support will direct you to do. It just spontaneously starts working again on its own, and will work fine until it feels like stopping to work again. Also, when I try to put mp3's on the player it states that the song is either in use or nonexistent, neither of which is the case. Additionally, the longer the Rio stays working, more and more songs become corrupted, which causes the Rio to shut itself off mid-song more and more frequently.

The Nitrus currently cannot even get passed its boot-up, the system just hangs and the hard drive just spins away. Since the system never really boots up, my computer cannot recognize it and I cannot attempt another firmware upgrade.The warranty on the product is only three months and you cannot change the battery. It looks like the manufacturer did not expect the product to last very long.In my opinion, this is a poor product that has been designed for short term use.

We both loved them for the few months they worked. My son's went first, losing battery capacity then losing all function. I thought maybe he had dropped it or something, although he said not. Then mine went! All of a sudden, in the middle of a song, all I get is clicking and whirring noises. Of course this all happened just after the warranty expired. It had been treated with kid gloves so I knew it was not anything I had done. Rio doesn't seem concerned about the \\"little problem\\" I'm having; I was told they will fix it for $125.00--only $39.00 less than I paid for it. I'll be putting that money toward an IPod."},{"rating":"2","title":"To answer some stuff and a review","review":"I had the Rio Nitrus in a couple of days and have researched. It is very good, great memory, great options, inexpensive.First off those who get the upgrader screen Oh my gosh just use a paperclip or something tiny to push the rest button near the AC outlet. It works perfectly. Upgrader doesn't mean \\"Rio Nitrus is dead\\" If the player runs out of battery (permenentaly) use the AC adapter to run on AC instead of battery. Not portable but oh well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Be Deceived","review":"I purchased a Nitrus in August and I LOVED it. It was easy to add or remove music and it played really well, but only days after my 90 day warranty was up, my Nitrus went into \\"upgrade mode\\" and froze there. I could not reset the player, nor would a firmware update install. I called tech support and spoke to several incompetent people, none of which knew how to help me, and they all told me I was out of luck because my 90 day warranty was up, even though it was only up by 3-5 days. I never mishandeled or mistreated the player in any way, and I was listening to it as normal when it malfunctioned. I have friends that have had problems with Rio products and have read other reviews that state situations similar to mine, and I have concluded that Rio does not make a quality product. Please save the money and buy a better quality player."},{"rating":"1","title":"The good, the bad, and the ugly...","review":"I love my Rio Nitrus.. or so I did. I got it for X-mas. It was definatly my favroite gift, it was awesome. Holds hundreads of songs, the volume is loud, and it's pretty simple. But 3 months into having it and it's like the MP3 player from hell. I can't get it to work. It's constantly freezing, and I have to keep calling for help. Right now I'm probably going to return it, I wouldn't EVER buy it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a reliable product - avoid","review":"4 hours after purchase, my Rio Nitrus locked-up with the kiss of death message \\"upgrader\\". The unit refused to do anything (there was no fix to the problem) except display this message and actually generate heat! (not a good sign). Before it died, I did manage to load 5 albums and play one song. Needless to say, it was returned and I won't buy another one.In spite of other comments.... when it says \\"upgrader\\" it IS DEAD... no amount of paper clip resetting will fix this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good sound....Very flawed design","review":"I have purchased quite a few mp3 players. They all have a few qualities that separate them from the rest. The Rio Nitrus seemed to be a good mix between the larger hard drive players, and the smaller chip players. It has a nice 1.5 gig capacity in a very compact design. The sound quality is very good with some of the best earbuds I have seen in an mp3 player. The biggest problem (and it is a biggie) is the menu system. It gives you plenty of options such as Artist,Album,Tracks,Playlist, however it does not list the songs under the particular artist or album. It only gives you the choice to play all. This makes it very cumbersome to locate certain songs you wish to play. With the capacity to hold 375 songs, they should have a better way to locate them. Most mp3 players on the market give you the ability to find songs through Artist or Album. What should have been a top rated player is below average for something so simple."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works great at first...","review":"I have gone through 2 Rio Nitrus players in the past 10 months. Both players completely froze up and could not be repaired. Fortunately for me, the first player was covered under their small 90-day window warranty. I received a new Nitrus (free) and it stopped working after 5 months. They've offered me a new player, but it will cost at least $100 to \\"replace\\". The other problem is that before both players were completely dead, they constantly had problems with turning on and off when changing songs. I was impressed with the Rio Nitrus when I first got it and convinced two other friends to buy them. They have also experienced the same problems and have since bought new mp3 players that do not bare the Rio name. I would not recommend this product unless you want an mp3 player that has a 5 month life-span. Please notice that most of the positive reviews of this player are old and were written when the person first received it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Work's Great...but life expectancy is kinda short...","review":"While I haven't had the software problems that others here have posted, I have experienced something just as bad. My Rio Nitrus worked fine for the first 5 months (I did get some \\"Upgrader\\" message, but somehow I was able to get out of it). It's great, does its job for the most part, and is small enough to fit somewhat comfortably in the palm of your hand if you want to hold it.However, recently my power plug hasn't been recharging the MP3 player at all, unless I really fudge with it, and even then, it sometimes takes a while. I haven't done anything extreme with it, but the fact that it's become a ritual to recharge this thing when I used to simply be able to plug it in is really annoying me.I paid $170 for this. I should've just forked over an extra $130 or so and got like a 10GB Ipod instead. I would not recommend this product at all, unless you have money to burn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Nitrus dies","review":"Add me to the disturbingly large list of people who have the Rio Nitrus just up and die after a few months. About 20 days after the warrenty expired (now we know why it is only a 90 day warrenty), I got the UPGRADER thing and the clicking hard drive. I went to the manual and the solution is to re-set the device using a paperclip (did that but problem persisted) then re-load the firmware update but the problem is you can't do that while the hard drive is clicking (it will time out). If I leave the Rio on for 10 to 15 minutes, the clicking stops. I can then load the firmware but then the device just gets stuck on RESTARTING for ever. From what I've read it sounds like my RIO is dead and I'm SOL.It's too bad because I absolutely loved it while it was working. But no way I'd buy another Rio product and I certainly can't recommend this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money","review":"I had this player for less than a month before it broke. It was a great player for about 3 weeks and then it failed to power on. I went on the Rio support pages and managed to get the player to turn on, only to be greeted with the dreaded \\"Upgrader\\" message. I installed the new firmware many, many times, but the player would never advance beyond the \\"Restarting\\" message. According to Rio's discussion boards, this happens to many other people, and it means that your hard drive is dead. Fortunately I was able to get a full refund, as it had been less than 30 days. Rio's warranty is only 90 days - I would be interested to see how many people actually had a functioning RioNitrus beyond 90 days."},{"rating":"1","title":"BUYER BEWARE!","review":"I had gotten this player as a Christmas gift and about 6 months later (after the warranty ended) it started acting up.

It started having problems after about 95 days (after the warranty was over). I upgraded the firmware and the unit completely died. Support quoted me $175 to fix the unit.

After about 40 hours of first me troubleshooting, then going through both web technical services, and a telephone technical support person, I was told that since it was after the warantee, well, there was nothing they could do.

I found that it wouldn't play for longer than 4 hours straight. Which if you had an outlet, and the charger wasn't much of a problem. There was alos a bit of a glare, and there was no pouch or anything to hold it in which made it difficult to keep track of. Then I dropped it about 2 feet, and it got really hot, made strange noises, and was stuck on one screen, finally transitioned to the off \\"Saving settings\\" screen, and stayed on that for ages.

The FAQ about the Nitrus suggest hitting the unit to get it to work. Ask yourself if you want to pay about $200 for a MP3 player that you have to smack around to get it to work.

She started with synonyms and is having so much fun, she suggested I write a positive review on Amazon for this product! She's done several of the \\"cards\\" and has asked me some questions, so she's learning. For example, she had to match \\"avoid\\" with \\"evade\\" and \\"tense\\" with \\"nervous\\". She knows the words in other contexts, but not necessarily thinking them as synonyms of each other. Each set comes with 10 sturdy plastic cards with words on them. You take the string and wrap them to the matching word on the other side. When you are done, you flip the card over and there are lines on the back that are the answers. If you don't see the lines (because you covered them with the string), you got them all correct. Everyting seems sturdy.

I dipped my lug socket in \\"PlastiDip\\". It is the rubbery plastic coating you can dip your tool handles in to improve the comfort of the tool in your hand. However, it did not stand up to the impact tool all that well. If you use a standard impact or hand lug wrench, you will chip the blue coating on these lug nuts. It would be nice to see the lug nuts to be made of the blue color all the way through the material. Don't get me wrong about the appearance and style of these lug nuts.

I used it almost exclusively to study for the NCETMB (along with my notes and materials from school), and passed with flying colors on the first try. True, some of the questions are lengthy but they help synthesize different concepts together to give you a deeper understanding of the subject matter. I found the labeling exercises toward the end of the book to be particularly helpful in refreshing my knowledge of anatomy. While many of the questions may be more difficult than what you'll find on the actual exam, I contend that it's far better to be overprepared than underprepared.

I think it would be really annoying to have to keep flipping through the pages to find the answers. The book is 95% just question and answers. The CD-rom works well, but the problem is the questions. They are on the whole so difficult and lengthy that it makes it quite a chore to get through them without getting frustrated after 15 minutes. I am sure many of the questions contain obscure material that will simply not be on the test. The answers/explanations are also often vague and not useful at all.

It isn't reliable, and it only serves as an MP3 player, and at that it falls well short of anything noteworthy. The Karma makes it quite hard to transfer MP3 files, and when you do, they are corrupted. The device has poor navigation, with some sort of red dot that you are supposed to use. It does not offer any additions to it, such as a radio tuner or even a remote. This thing is going back tomorrow, and I am getting an iPod like I should have to begin with. I am not normally an Apple consumer, but after this experience, I am beginning to understand their ease of use in their products."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS PLAYER!!!!","review":"I am very dissapointed with this player. I am now on my third player. I sent two back to Rio and I have no intention on sending a third.I was told not to go running with this player because the pounding can damage the hard drive. So I got this player specifically to use while travelling. Songs started to skip after three weeks of use and finally it got to the point where the hour glass stayed in a perpetual spin mode. I could not even shut the player down...had to wait till the battery ran out! For what I paid for this player....what a waste!!!

Ripping CDs and synchronization worked very well. Only problem I ever had was with purchased downloaded music in the highest bit rate WMA format, with the workaround of burning a CD from it and then ripping that. Device worked fine in car and on the rack of treadmill in the gym. Unfortunately, machine no longer operates properly 1 month after warranty expired. It barely boots up, requires constant hard reset, and now is totally dead as it can't load firmware anymore.

The reviews of this product touted a 15 hour battery-life, but I found that the battery drained even when the player was turned off.

I just received the replacement (the same player, just with more scratches and a new battery, I guess) and now it does something new: it simply stops playing in the middle of a song, the screen freezes and you have to wait until it decides to be responsive again (30 minutes this time).

It has the original hard drive and other than a firmware update ages ago I have not had to wipe it or repair it. I expected to have to do something to it, repair or HDD replacement (which is easily doable at home) or similar, ages ago, but nope.This thing is ergonomic, plays FLAC and ogg, plays tracks seamlessly (way before similar players did), has an ethernet port, the battery is still great (8hrs+, used to be 12hrsish, but I use fairly high bitrate stuff on it). The sound quality is great, when using my low impedance inner ear phones, but like other mp3 players it needs a headphone amp for higher impedance phones or speakers. A great gadget, and I wish Rio had not folded, because it's engineers sure knew what they were doing."},{"rating":"1","title":"On my second one now","review":"The first one the hard drive crashed and the second one looks like it is about to do the same.

I refuse to pay $175.00 for refurbished job. The customer service support is awful. I know the price is inviting especially for 20 GB Mp3 player. Look at all the past reviews and you will see a common thread. If I pay $220.00 for a MP3 player I can reasonably assume it should last for a decent amount of time.

It plays more formats - Vorbis & FLAC are both insanely great. The battery life is considerably better. It has ethernet on the dock, so it works with linux, mac, windows, whatever. The sound quality is better (to my ears). The support from the developers is amazing - lots of cool features being added all the time. This is the ONLY portable player to support gapless playback - this is a MUST for any dance music fans - how annoying is it when your ipod puts 1 second breaks between the tracks in your mix cds?

I was told that I could have it shipped to somewhere in the USA. Which, currently I am not in the USA. I was highly disappointed with this product. First, to freeze that quickly isnt a good sign. I am now looking for MP3 players with removable memory and removable batteries. This was an expensive lesson for me to learn.

Then I called the company and was told that it doesnt break it must be my fault. I can not believe that a proudct with a complicated miniturized hard drive would come with only a 90 day warranty.

In fact, it's one of the worst sounding discs I've purchased in a long time. On many of the cuts the higher frequencies are missing; this is probably because over long periods of time, recordings on tape (i.e. the master tapes used to produce this CD) deteriorate. As a result, the music sounds dull and muffled. Also, I was surprised how dated many of these songs are, both in musical style and the lyrics.

Quite the opposite of a quick read as it took me 1 year with a couple of good action-packed books in between. Boring, actually. Mixed with unrelated side tracked stories, the plot was weak.

Eating meat isn't something they do to be mean, it's something they do because they have no choice.So, you know, if you're looking for realism, this is not the book for you.If you're looking for a cute little story about how friendship tames wild beasts and makes everybody happy... well!

And even then you may wonder why it came up on the Academy Award radar screen at all. Except that Bullock is a big money-maker and it serves the industry to praise her. She hits one note in this film and keeps hitting that note. Again and again she hits that one single note, and when you've had enough she hits it some more. Pretty soon she's SO boring. Ultimately she just wears you down. Help! A goose with a good, strong honk could have played that role. I suppose it's sort of fun to watch rich, privileged white people successfully bulldoze their way to the head of the line while poor non-whites have to wait their turn.

The main story was about Sandra Bullock. She had to many parts in it and took away from the meaning of the story. At 1 1/2hr into it I thought I would go crazy knowing I still had 30min left. Once again I like the story of the family taking Mike in and helping him but that wasn't the main focus of the movie.

Our cynical, superficial world (an aspect not ignored in the film) sometimes needs its attention drawn to how really walking the walk instead of just talking the talk can bring unforeseen benefits to the quality of our co-existence as human beings.I REALLY don't care for movies with some self appointed someone's idea of what's good or bad with our society...this movie is very different in that it is a true story, at least as true as Hollywood ever makes a film (a rare occurrence).

It hit me that when I see one of her movies, it's not Sandra's character in the film- it's Sandra. The same thing happened with many actors, John Wayne, Jack Lemmon, etc. Here, it's just Sandra with blonde hair and an accent pretending to be a rich socialite.The movie itself is predictable and way too long.

This ranks with \\"Miracle\\", \\"Rocky\\", and \\"The Rookie\\" in the annals of sports films that tug at your heart strings. The film is anchored by the terrific dynamic of Sandra Bullock and Quinton Aaron as the surrogate mother and her large but fragile adopted son. One thing I would like to note. I was gratified to see Bullock win the Oscar but if you isolated this specific performance I would probably have given the prize to either Gabourey Sidibe for \\"Precious\\" or Carey Mulligan in \\"An Education\\". \\"The Blind Side\\" is the type of film that is best to be enjoyed and brush aside any minor quibbles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie!","review":"The Blide Side is hands-down one of the best movies I've ever seen.

It's about a woman being kind and helping a man on the streets. That's man became a very good and famous football star. Also that woman's family was all athletes at the ages 12-22.I honestly thought that movie Blind Side was an excellent movie to watch. The movie was really sad and humorous, but it's also really good.I can understand sobbing during parts of the movie, but if you think it's just a stupid movie, it's honestly not, and you're a complete weirdo to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"simply awesome","review":"I can't say anything that hasn't already been said.

The movie was predictable, simple, not particularly believable (I know it's based on a true story), and Michael Oher is likely a little embarassed by how the writers/director decided to portray him in this movie.I can't take away from the true story which I am deeply encouraged by.

This had too much syrup and too little reality. And what did Sandra Bullock do to earn an Oscar? Not sure.

As for Leigh Ann Tuohy (played by Sandra Bullock), she is a very strong, confident women who is true to her convictions and isn't afraid to stand up to anyone to defend them -- I wish I were more like her.Quinton Aaron did a beautiful job in the role of Michael Oher, you are cheering for him from the very first scene.

Is this guy actually going to whine and complain and sneer the entire way around the Mediterranean, and is anybody interested in reading that? He starts with a loathsome description of Gibraltar and his fellow tourists and the poor monkeys. Continuing along the coast of Spain, every place he goes, every person he meets, is despicable. I was particularly nauseated by the repeated gory descriptions of bull-fighting. OK, OK, once was enough, in fact, once was more than enough. There is a popular expression, \\"words cannot describe\\" how awful something is. Well, this guy doesn't suffer from an inability to find the words. He finds every word he needs to describe his miserable journey."},{"rating":"1","title":"The bigoted traveler","review":"I read this book cover to cover, so that I could just allow myself to write this review. Traveling is meant to widen one's understanding of the world. Travel-writing is meant to share and contextualize these experiences for the reader. The author fails on both accounts. Despite (or perhaps because of) the luxurious mode of his traveling, he does not seem to enjoy himself. He lacks empathy for the people he meets and the countries in which he travels. Moreover, he has not done his homework when it comes to the histories of these peoples. Characterizing him as insular, scornful and arrogant would be too kind for Mr. Theroux. He is an unabashed bigot."},{"rating":"2","title":"a very good book.","review":"I think that kids 2-adults should be able to read the book even if that means some one reading it to them at least they will get to read it or even hear about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pilllars of Hercules","review":"In August my husband, and I are re-visiting the area mentioned in this book.

Paul Theroux does it in a way that is authentic, or more precisely as authentic as one can be when one if free enough to tour around and around.Theroux wins high marks for this particular book because he gives concise, vivid analyses throughout. This is in my mind not the same writing genre as those that inform the tourist crowd about the better restaurants.Theroux's travel literature, as opposed to his novels, put him in the same class as Bill Bryson; William Least Heat-Moon; Jan Morris and Eric Newby. To me, Theroux seems like a man that could become cantankerous if not sufficiently challenged by being in challenging travel situations. He's at his best when things don't seem to be working for him, when he can't immediately get what he wants. And when he's at his best, he gives brilliant commentary on what he observes."},{"rating":"2","title":"A gorgeous bit of writing.","review":"I have read five of Paul Theroux's travel books: The Great Railway Bazaar, The Kingdom by the Sea, The Old Patagonian Express, Travel Fiend and now The Pillars of Hercules. I can say without a doubt, that this is my favorite travelogue of his. The book is concise and knowledgable and shows erudition lacking in most travelogues.It is a total learning experience. I have looked up more words in this book than in most books I read. And I really appreciate that. He doesn't write books for people who are looking to read about the surface of a culture, or who just want the interesting bits revealed to them. He writes books for people that are truly interested and will take the time to learn all that he supplies the reader.And I think this is his crowning achievement!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not really interesting","review":"as much as I wanted to enjoy this, I could not- Theroux comes across as arrogant and prolix- purports to travel as a \\"traveller\\" but winds up being nothing but an educated tourist who never ventures further than the superficial layer of things... well-written but it gets lost in tedious and unnecessary sardonic commentary and details that add little to the narrative: I was expecting better..."},{"rating":"1","title":"It put me off","review":"Started the book and realised that Mr Theroux has a keen eye for uglyness. His trip around Spain is really sad. I am sorry he couldn't find any of the wonderful towns and people on this coast. For his satisfaction, I can reassure him, he would be able to find his translated work not only in Barcelona, but in other coastal and inland cities and towns in Spain.

I listen primarily to jazz and I was able to download much of my favorite stuff with plenty of space left over. The size and feel of the unit is perfect for working out or running and it feels durable although I haven't had any mishaps with it yet.

The display is nice and clear.The accessories that come in the package are really good. I bought a set of philips earpieces along with this player but I haven't used them because the ones it comes with are surprisingly good. It comes with a nice elastic armband that doesn't slip. It also comes with a solid plastic clip-in holder for the armband which holds the player tightly in place when running.The software package is easy to use and I haven't had any problems with it on my windowsME system.Basically a solid MP3 player that's great for work-outs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forget about customer service","review":"Not a bad player (although file transfer needs help) but forget about customer service.

I had one and my wife had one. Each of them no longer have their power buttons and need to be turned on with a pen. The volume button on one is stuck on turning it down so you have to hold the volume up button the entire time. It's like a geriatric patient.

Bad news."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor sound, even worse earbuds","review":"Strapped for cash, I've been forced to stick with this player for a couple years. The player has indeed taken lots of knocking around, but I have two complaints:1) There is background hum behind all my music. You can really hear it between songs and during quieter passages. Because of this, I couldn't use it to listen to electronic books because the hum was so darn loud and annoying. An email to Rio tech support asking about this was ignored, which really cheesed me off. Their support is awful.2) The wires to the earbuds broke during the second use. I've had duct tape on them for the last two years, but they permanently gave out the other day (something broke in the connector where even tape could not help)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good player, horrible software","review":"I love my Rio--especially because of the FM radio functionality--but I hate the software you have to use to transfer tunes.

It is a complete disaster, inconvenient and frustrating as hell if you have more than a few mp3s on your computer. The best players have a simple drag and drop from Windows type format. Then there are alot of players that have proprietary programs that work pretty well. But this is the worst! And they haven't changed it from when I bought my first Rio 500 years ago! If you have a lot of mp3s on your computer Rio Manager will list them 2 or three times and then make it awkward to find them and download.I mean, what the hell is wrong with this company!

It is much harder to figure out which way is play or pause or stop than individual buttons.I have the Rio500 (when the company was RioDiamond)from 5 or so years ago and it still works--and I've dropped it everywhere--even in water--and sweated all over it. Unfortunately the software is outdated so I can no longer upload songs onto it. I still love it (even though it only holds about 18 songs w/out an extra memory card!).SO, where do I go from here? which Rio product will hold up? I have lost faith now that the company has changed. The SPORT product did not hold up. Obvious problem with quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great player for jogging or working out.","review":"I was in the market for an MP3 player I could use while working out. I was originally looking for a player with a large capacity, but I've heard that they aren't so good for jogging, etc. since they have moving parts for the hard drive. So, I decided to try a sports specific model.I decided on the Rio Cali after reading several reviews about it. The software is simple and I haven't had any issues with the player at all. The sound is great and I love the ability to adjust the equalizer. I rate this player 4.5 stars. It would be a perfect 5 if it had a larger memory, but at least it is expandable."},{"rating":"1","title":"MP3 review :::: Beware of this one","review":"Rio Cali Sport 128MB MP3 player: I bought this MP3 player for my husband for Christmas.

It continuously slips out of the armband while he is running. That is very frustrating. In addition, when downloading music, he has to transfer it to a CD and then to the MP3 player.

You have a number of menu options but the one I value most, random play, is absent. You can shuffle songs after they're loaded however. The computer interface is simple and worked perfectly out of the box. The earbud type headphones are fair at best. I replaced them with Sony MDR-G72LP Street Style headphones and that's a much better combo. The clip holder that you use for jogging or whatever is very good and holds it well, no worrying about the player coming off during a workout. Overall a very solid MP3 player."},{"rating":"1","title":"Problems with Rio - Buggy!","review":"Save your money, save your time. Search the web for \\"Rio\\" and \\"upgrader\\" and you'll quickly realize that this device (like all Rio MP3 players) is buggy and prone to failure after only a few months. We've had ours since Christmas 2003, so it's dead after 9 months.Unfortunately, Rio offers one of the shortest warranties, and their customer service is terrible. The \\"fix\\" they offered was to replace my Cali with a refurbished model - at a cost of a hundred dollars! Well you can see here at Amazon that a new model doesn't cost much more, so that's hardly a good solution.Avoid the Cali, avoid Rio, save up your money and get a reliable player like an iPod instead.P.S. You may find some methods posted in web forums for fixing the upgrader bug in Rio Chibas, but I could not get my Cali to work using the same methods. I also reformatted the device and reinstalled the firmware but nothing has helped."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product for runners","review":"Unlike some of the folks below, I've had great luck with my Cali 256, including many long distance runs and one marathon. The armband is fine by me - it can be tightend/loosened to get it just right. A couple of times I've had the unit appear to go dead, but simply taking out the batteries, wiping the contact, and reinserting it has solved the problem every time. I've not yet sprung for an additional memory card, mainly because I'm finding that 256mb is plenty even for long runs when you intermix mp3s and live radio. The software has also been fine for me. Nice little product."},{"rating":"1","title":"On-off switch stuck","review":"Excellent player. Its light and the controls work well. Usability and software is excellent.

That way I wouldn't have to listen to BORING 24Hr fitness music. Initially it worked fine. Downloading was easy and the software was user friendly. The sound was rather &amp;quot;flat&amp;quot; though. I like a lot of hip hop and the sound was mediocre. The radio easily lost reception while moving around in the gym. After a few weeks it started shutting of in mid song so I replaced the batteries. NO JOY. It still was shutting off.

I spent an hour on the phone with someone who had me jump through a number of hoops (reinstalling the software, plugging it into a different USB port, trying a different computer, etc.) before she finally recommended that I exchange the player at the store for a new one.

After 3 months the unit just quit working. Stopped completely. I exchanged it and the same thing happened after a few months. The second time I thought it was just the battery but when I opened the battery compartment the entire casing broke so I couldn't exchange it. Since I bought the memory card, I foolishly bought another one (stupid) figuring I would have better luck.

The only drawback is that sometimes while running the joystick is sensitive. Wait, one other thing ... the battery needs replacing a little too often, but that's true of most MP3 players.

The sounds is pretty good especially with a headphone upgrade. Very easy to upload songs, books ect. The radio dosen't get great reception but does ok as long as there is a good signal. The controls are simples, I could scroll through songs, adust volume, ect while the player was in a pocket or bag. With one AAA battery there is probably about 20 hrs of listening time. Without expansion memory it holds about 2 or 3 hours of music.

It would quit playing in the middle of a song, or skip to the last song on the player. I thought it was a corrupted MP3, so I would format the player and reload it. That seemed to work until recently. Now no matter how much I format the player, it thinks it is out of space, yet will display no tracks. Digital Networks (Rio) is of no help. The FM tuner still works fine, so I guess I have a very expensive radio now.There are two flavors of the Cali, the mass storage unit, and the non-mass storage.

However, this \\"static\\" progressively got worse and now it's accompanied by a high pitch noise. Again, it can be resolved by reformatting, but once every few days is now a nuisance. The tech support quickly responds to my e-mails but they are not helpful and have not been able to solve the problem.

After having it for not quite two years it stopped making coffee (don't know if electronics were haywire) even when buttons were pushed manually.

It was under warrenty, but I had to pay $... plus shipping to send it back in to Capresso and they fixed it and sent it back within 10 days. Unfortunatley 2 months after the 1 year warrenty was up the grinder stopped working. Just stopped working one day without any particular reason.

Even on the strongest settings the coffee comes out weak and tea-like. The grinder settings are based on the number of cups you intend to make. To make a stronger coffee (for example) you need to set the grinder for a higher number of cups than the amount of water you put in. I like to make 9 or 10 cups of coffee every morning, but the grinder only goes up to 10 making it impossible to have it put more coffee in the filter. I think a \\"12\\" or even \\"14\\" setting would solve my problems.This unit also drops ground coffee on the counter under the grinder after the filter swings back over the caraffe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth every penny","review":"After reading great reviews on Amazon, I bought one of these for my girlfriend for Christmas a year and some months ago. It worked perfectly for about six or seven months. Then the automatic release that swings the filter basket back over the carafe broke. We called Capresso, and they sent us a new one immediately, asking that when we got the new one to send the old one back in the box. They prepaid the postage. We were VERY impressed with their customer service. Later, we noticed was that the new one seemed to leak water from the top. We let it go for a while, since we didn't want to abuse our relationship with Capresso. Finally we had enough of puddles on the counter, called them up, and they sent out a new lid, free of charge, which fixed the problem. Making the replacement was easy. We LOVE having freshly-ground coffee every morning, and this little gem is the pride of our kitchen, and we get a lot of use out of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Filter Holder does not return to under Water Container!","review":"This was the only feature my wife didn't like when I first suggested buying this unit. She questioned the reliability of this function: after coffee is ground into the filter holder it is then automatically transported back under the water container for brewing. Sure enough, the first morning we used it the filter holder stuck under the grinder and had to be moved manually under the water container. We tried it again and again but it never moved after the grinding was completed.

Bill \\"Superfoot\\" Wallace simply fades away at the end of his fight with Bobby Kim because he refused to allow himself to be killed in this movie.

A couple of months later, it started coming on very slowly. It would take about 5 minutes or more to kick on. Finally, it just started making a horrendous noise & I shut it down.

I'll agree somewhat with another reviewer's commentary on assembly: it's not a quick, snap together job. However, with a bit of patience and ingenuity (and de-coding the instructions, to some extent), it really is NOT an onerous job. Just a quick tip: the worst part is the last, where you \\"snap\\" the metal clip over the grill to fasten its two halves together. It doesn't exactly slip into place, and I found that using the flat edge of a screwdriver to \\"persuade\\" that clip to go where it belongs does the trick beautifully.

I lost all confidence I had in Netgear.I'm shopping around for a better product from a more serious company."},{"rating":"2","title":"Installed like a breeze","review":"This will be my first online product review. I have no special technical training with computers, home networking, etc., but I am a well experienced user who has built a couple computers of my own. I purchased the Netgear WPN824 (and a couple WPN311 wireless PCI adpapters to use with it) yesterday to replace a Linksys wireless \\"B\\" home network. I was starting to experience weak wireless signals, and I had wanted to upgrade my security options. Of course, my operational experience with this equipment is less than 24 hours, but I can tell you these items were almost \\"plug and play\\". The instructions were clear and simple, the installation wizards did their little magic and I am up and running in less than an hour with very strong signal strength at both remote computers (one in the next room and one in an upstairs bedroom). And setting up WPA incryption was very easy. Hey, I'm a happy consumer! I will update this review later if I have any issues with ongoing operation."},{"rating":"1","title":"RangeWimp would be a better name","review":"I \\"upgraded\\" from my old $29 netgear wireless router to improve range. Bottom line; absolutely no improvement in range. Maybe with the Rangemax wireless card it would be better, but not with standard wi-fi. I'm regret having spent the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"It stopped working...just like for everyone else.","review":"I loved this router for about a year. Easy to set up and use, and range and strength seemed good. Now, after a year or so, it just drops the connection at random intervals...I have to unplug it and let it sit for a minute...then it comes back up fine for a while...then stops working again. Judging by all the other similar reviews this is a genuine problem with this product. I so don't feel like spending the money on another router either...sigh...nothing else to do...now my wife and I both have wireless-enabled laptops and I don't know how to get by without it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Technical Support Stinks!","review":"I just bought this product. I could NOT get it to install on my computer...I finally broke down and called customer support. Ugh.I had a very hard time understanding the person on the other end of the phone. The accent is very thick. It was a test of my patience! The call took longer than it should have because of me constantly having to ask, \\"pardon me? Excuse me? Could you repeat that?\\"The product itself? Not sure yet. I finally (!!) got it installed."},{"rating":"1","title":"The wifi gets disconnected very frequently","review":"I have to reset my router 10 to 15 times a day to enable wifi.No idea whether amazon sold defective piece or this model itself is defective.very frustrating"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice until the random disconnects start","review":"This was a nice router before starting to get random disconnects.I have 7 wireless devices that connect to it and I noticed that when all of them are connected, there is a very high likelihood that the connection will drop soon. However, other times even with only 2 connected devices, I will get random disconnects.Types of traffic necessary for random disconnect:1. Low traffic. Random disconnect will happen with a frequency of one a day.2. Steam Client traffic (i.e., I have steam on one of the computers): Several times a day.3. Bit torrent (i.e., downloading Ubuntu 10.10): Very frequent. Solution: download via HTTP.In conclusion, this has to be one of the worst routers I've ever had."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get's the job done","review":"So in typical networking fashion the router isn't any easier to setup than any other router out there. However, once its up and running, the range and speed for the price cannot be beat. Its the mid-size sedan category of wireless routers. Rarely reboots and looks pretty cool on your desk...check out all the postings on Youtube. If you don't like the lights, you can turn them off.Port pass-thru options are available if you're a more advanced user and I don't believe there are any major incompatibilities with any interet based software. Using a passphrase for encryption is much nicer than using a hexidecimal code for WEP...and you can move up to WPA if desired. Overall, a faithful, reliable router."},{"rating":"1","title":"great range but odd problems","review":"My download rates are phenomenal with this router. No complaints for the first few months. Then the wireless signal would just drop for no reason. First it seems like the cable modem would die and I had the cable modem replaced. The problems continued. I had installed a \\"windows home server\\" which uses UPnP plug and play feature on the router to manage routes from the web to the home server. I switched off UPnP on the router and it appears my trouble with dropped signals went away. I manually set up a few static routes for the home servers remote access.I am thinking the home server and the router are not too compatible and the UPnP was probably getting reset far too often resulting in the router hanging."},{"rating":"1","title":"nothing but trouble","review":"I just bought a brand new Dell laptop and decided the way to go was wireless..bought the computer and Netgear at Best Buy. the box said easy to install and from the reviews it seems that way too....so how come I put in the CD and followed the instructions...thought it was working and then lost my roadrunner email and internet connection. And when i went back to \\"connect\\" I had Netgear and Netgear 2...I would connect and it would tell me I was connected but there was no connection...so don't tell me how easy this is to use. I've ended up hiring someone to come over to install it correctly...I'm back to just using my cable connection. It's going to cost me a sweet 100 bucks to have it set up and secure. and then I sure hope it works."},{"rating":"1","title":"I switched back to my wireless G router...","review":"I purchased this router about a year and a half ago with a new laptop equipped with Wireless-N thinking I would also want to upgrade my wireless network. I selected this one because of the price and I regret doing so.I eventually unplugged this and plugged my old wireless-g router back in. Both wireless and wired connections were much slower with this router. The wireless also had a habit of dropping the connection entirely. Next time I get a router, I guess I'm going to have to spend a little more and get better quality.Also of note: It has no built-in firewall.I definitely DO NOT recommend this router."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just out of warranty - FAILS","review":"It's just worthless to buy a modem that stops working pretty much the day it goes out of warranty -- which this one did and will to you. Get a different model. This one will cost you double since you'll have to replace it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good","review":"The only problem I have had with our wireless set up using this router was having to switch to WEP so my son could use it with his Nintendo DS Lite. I had to re-configure my laptop's wireless card (be sure that you have the latest drivers and SW -- I didn't). I had to reduce the maximum speed down to 11 Mbps, so I am not planning on doing any printing through the network until I get a different router for my son to use. It uses a browser based interface so its pretty easy to deal with. I have yet to get the Wii to adjust to the new settings. Through-put is fine as our cable modem is only like 6 Mbps anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was never able to even configure it!","review":"I am a big fan of Netgear equipment. In fact this router was supposed to replace my trusty Netgear WGR614 that served me flawlessly for over 5 years of continuous power-on service before dying this week. After hooking up this new RangeMax router and the install routine confirming that I was connected to the router, I could never log into the router nor get connected to the internet. I finally gave up and returned it. Today I bought a new Netgear WGR614 v9 ... you know the model that served me so well for over five years ... Netgear still makes them! ... and the install was plug and play. Could log right into the router and configure the wireless and had instant internet access. Get the WGR614 if you want a reliable wireless router!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to use and set up","review":"This router is very simple to setup. Bought it for my parents and they love it. Once in while you'll need to unplug and plug again to reset. Security is standard and so far so good. Overall a solid and easy product to use."},{"rating":"1","title":"range MAX?","review":"Quite simply, this router is not at all what its cracked up to be. The range is lousy, hardly MAX at all. Great signal within 5 feet, but almost none only 50 feet away and with only one simple wall in the way. Our house is not so large that we shouldn't get a signal most anywhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"great product!","review":"I did quite extensive research before decided to purchase this item. Most of my friends/reviews suggested buying from Netgear. I followed the product guide to do the installation. It went very smooth and took less than 10 minutes. It has been up running for almost two months now, very sound product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product!","review":"I installed this product yesterday after returning a D-Link Draft N router to Office Max which was an absolute piece of junk! The RangeMax product is outstanding. I live in a 2,000+ SF 2 story house plus a basement and had trouble getting decent connectivity throughout the living space. The RangeMax solved that problem as I get 4 out of 5 bars even outside on the deck and it's lightening fast. I had a little difficulty setting it up but the Netgear support staff patiently walked me through the process. The only negative comment that I have is that the flashing blue lights are obnoxious. Fortunately, there is a switch on the side to turn them off. Well done Netgear!"},{"rating":"1","title":"bad range, worse reliability","review":"This had great reviews many places, but sadly it falls short of everything. The range is worse than the Linksys it replaces, the router goes down 4-5 times a day and it HATES my Netgear Skype phone (SPH101).Netgear SPH101 Skype Wi-Fi PhoneNetgear was good in the mid 90's, then went to junk again early in 2000, then back to good in 03, but since 05 they are back in the junk bin.

In all frankness, I have never had a worse router than this. I run into problems with this router at least four times a week. The signal just dies off and it only reconnects after resetting/ rebooting the router. I am a software engineer and quite savvy with all things electronic. I have tweaked every possible setting that is available but nothing gives. I finally put it in the trash today and went out and purchased a new router."},{"rating":"2","title":"works great after it gets set uup","review":"This router works great, I have now purchased 4 (three as gifts) all work as stated, but all of us had to call tech support to get the router to work. Very good tech support, but from India and very difficult to understand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great router if you are looking for 1 year's worth!!","review":"I bought this router that was recommended to me buy a Best Buy rep. The set up was ok, but had to call customer support which was prompt and very helpful. The router worked great everywhere in my 1500sq foot home with minor incidents. Than, this month. exactly 1 year after I bought it, I started having major issues of losing connectivity and blinking orange lights...I first thought it was my modem, or issues with the ISP...Nope, the router was the culprit. I called the 800 in the manual for support and got a big SORRY CAN'T HELP after 1 year and a week.... I was left with the online e-mail support, which was not helpful at all and after a couple of e-mails back and forth they said it was hardware issues and because I was over the 1 year period I was......screwed out of $90.00Good luck, if you want to try it. I am going for a company that will back their products longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad","review":"This router is not really that bad. But the company treats it customers soooo poorly that buying it is not a very good idea.The router seemed to work for a while but then quit. Customer support would only be provided at a price.

I am looking for something better.I would avoid ALL Netgear products until they support their customers and provide better tested equipment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short life & Must Reboot Almost Daily","review":"I just had this router die after 2 yrs. The range- poor (20 feet un-obstructed or less on the same floor). Had all the same problems others discuss- having to unplug & reboot almost everyday because the connection is lost- what a pain!!

Cheap-you get what you pay for."},{"rating":"1","title":"I think mines Defective","review":"I got this when it first came out with high expectations and at first it was great.

I think I need a new one and its only four years old."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outing FTP service does NOT work - don't buy","review":"I had a perfectly good Linksys wired router but my family wanted wireless, particularly my son, the Xbox Live player. Well the Xbox wireless adapter will not work with the wireless N routers and only certain G routers, this Netgear RangeMax being one. Bought and installed and Xbox Live was working great BUT as a webmaster, I could no longer upload files to working web servers - Winsock error #10061. I checked the router setup and no services were blocked, fellow webmaster with different routers could ftp to those same web servers. OUT-GOING FTP DOES NOT WORK! Tech support is unresponsive. Google this router and FTP problems and you will find many unhappy, former owners. It gets returned today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product for the price","review":"I've had this unit for about a month with no issues to report. Easy setup using the CD on my Vista PC. I purchased this router because I was switching back to cable from DSL (I had a 2-in-1 with my DSL service) and needed a wireless router. The router is located in one room and my PS3 and Xbox 360 in another. We also use a laptop upstairs in which we saw our signal go from \\"good\\" to \\"excellent\\". My gaming consoles have also seen a noticable difference in speed in the form of ALMOST lag free online play. All in all, a great product that has been around for a couple of years = tested and established."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing--Old Netgear \\"11b\\" router had better range","review":"The RangeMax is a misnomer. I purchased this router to replace our old router (model 614), since it gave only a weak signal on the second floor at the other end of the house. The so called \\"RangeMax\\" is even worse. Even on the same floor, where the old one was a champ, the signal is moderate. On the second floor, sometimes there is no signal. I would not recommend purchasing this router if your main requirement is range and strong signal. I feel that I have wasted my money. I hope I can return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's Not Working","review":"Purchased product to use with laptop and video gaming system. Have gone through installation process twice and it's not working. At this point, I am unsatisfied but have not taken time to seek technical assistance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy something else.","review":"I have owned this item for a little over 4 months now, and have had nothing but trouble with it. I run 2 wired desktops, 1 wireless desktop, a Voip phone, a laptop, and an Ipaq all under one roof. This thing is a nightmare. It wouldn't let the wireless desktop on except under special occasions like a full moon , and when it did allow access, it would dump EVERYTHING after 10 minutes. I have followed all the install procedures to the \\"t\\", rebooted, reinstalled, and still have problems. If you want a disco light coaster, this is your unit. If you want a good router, get something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wireless router for people in glass houses.","review":"Don't believe the \\"RangeMax\\" claim of extended range on this router. I have 2 desktop computers and a laptop and was upgrading my old router to the G format for greater range and speed. This router has less range than my old B type wireless router. I had more \\"dead spots\\" than a morgue! I found the wireless plug-in access port accessory useless even when I put the small notebook wireless adapter right next to the plugged access point. Signals would drop like flies. I bought Linksys Rangeboost router and had NO problems with the same computers in the same locations. Buyer Beware of NetGear claims!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not much of an improvement","review":"In my situation I was told a MIMO would help(I live in a granny unit attached to the main house where the dsl is). It has made little improvement over the 2 wire wireless unit that we bought with the sbc service."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great wireless range - but it needs frequent reboots","review":"Compared to the Linksys router I replaced, this WPN824 has an awesome range. But, I have owned the router for three days and have had to reboot it 5 times. It will appear that it is running, but none of the computers on my network can access it or the internet. Once I reboot it by unplugging and pugging it back in, then all of my computers can get to the internet. I am going to give their customer support one attempt to resolve this before I take it bake to the store. I am running hte v1 router and not the v2 - I do not know if that makes a difference."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only slightly better than the rest.","review":"1. Don't be fooled.The Smart 7 built-in antennas is a gimmick to help sell something that doesn't work as well as they say. I purchased one and it can't move through or around walls any better than any other router. The reason is because all 7 antennas are only 4dbi in strength. Regardless of how many antennas you have attached, the strength will ultimately determine the performance.2. No option to upgrade.If you have a 2 or 3 floor house and your connection is at one end of your home (like mine), purchase a router with an external antenna and boost the signal. The internal antennas in the RangMax can't be boosted. And if you think you'll never need to, think about if you're the type of person who uses a laptop outdoors on a patio or balcony."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thumbs up - twice","review":"I have had great success covering houses that have the router on one side and the notebook/pc on the others side about 60ft+ and on different floors. Here are a couple of hints though:1 - do not use the installation disk, just hook up a pc to the router and follow the instructions in the quick-install sheet.2 - do the firmware upgrade, most of them ship with 1.0.3 and now there is 1.0.103 - enable the xr feature under \\"advanced wireless\\"4 - use the corresponding notebook/desktop card: while strongewr than most routers, MIMO needs an intelligent counterpart. So if you cant get a signal where you need it, drop the money on the card the resukts are great - in one case I was able to connect through 60ft of house and into a yard an additional 150 more feet away and downhill!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Router","review":"Just purchased this router a week ago. It was recommended by a tech person. We have DSL service and needed a router that could handle three XBOX360s, a laptop, and a PC at the same time.Installation was a breeze. We were replacing an existing router and the wizrd walked us through the process in 20 minutes. No manual adjustments were required. Don't disconnect the existing router until instructed to.Range and performance improved dramatically. No longer have any 'lag' issues with XBOX Live. The blue light on top can be turned off. I have no problem with VPN access for work. Have not experienced any interruptions in service so far."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst router in my life, hands down.","review":"I thought my 17+ years of computer experience was lost when I bought this thing, but after reading these reviews, I have to concur, do NOT BUY THIS.1st? I run this machine with two Macs (G5, MacBook Pro) and a Lenovo X61 at home. Both the wireless computers work great. When they actually connect! It seems, every other day, I can either reset the router, or if I'm bored, simply change the wireless encryption password back to what it was, and I can reconnect. I've changed the channels, made it just a b/g router, nothing. Still happens. I don't have a cordless, etc..completely unacceptable.2nd..my Mac G5. It's a WIRED connection and I swear it's on dialup. I get worst download rates than my wireless laptops, it's intermittent on web pages, and it even has the hardest time navigating the router's internal site!Sorry...no more Netgear for me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I would not buy this","review":"I generally don't write reviews and generally believe the problems people have with items are more related to improper set up than product failures BUT in this case I'm having such poor performance that I feel compelled to write.The router worked great for the first 3 months -- no problems -- but then it started to fail every five minutes. It constantly drops connections. Sometimes it just freezes up and I need to unplug and re-plug it in for it to work.Initially I thought it was my laptop but I've since had three different people over who have all experienced the same problem.It's also not my ISP as I use VOIP and my phone is always active.Hope this helps."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst","review":"Although this router was easy to configure I have had a terrible experience with it. At one point I was having to reset it every thirty minutes. Netgear technical support is the worst (India). I finally got them to agree to an RMA and had to pay extra for advanced replacement. The replacement router worked correctly for a couple of weeks and now it is doing the same thing that the original one did. I cannot recommend this model of Netgear router and would not buy anything else from them based on extremely poor tech support."},{"rating":"1","title":"No extra coverage","review":"I was hoping to solve a difficult coverage issue(router located upstairs corner room) to get coverage throughout the house.

I thought I could save a few bucks; ~$20 compared to a Linksys WRT54G2. Sadly, I have gotten ZERO uptime since the unit arrived. It gets stuck during the configuration process and keeps power cycling by itself. I've reset it and tried again many times over a sleepless night. It's obviously not normal behavior so I'm returning the unit. I got an RMA# from Tiger Direct, but they don't pay for return shipping. I'm guessing they also won't refund the original S&H; so now I'm down $15 with a lot of frustration to go with it.Lessons for today: Don't get a refurb router, there's just too much flakiness in these devices that a bad unit can easily get sent back out to some loser (like me). If you insist, check first if the vendor pays for return shipping. And obviously, these refurb Netgear routers must have originally gone out at full price to someone else's grief. I'd just stay away altogether."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well...very impressive range","review":"It's small, light, has incredible range and at the time of purchase (18 months ago) was the best value and most highly rated of it's kind out there. I'll be honest, I like Netgear - I usually buy Netgear. I've never, ever had any problems with their equipment. This is my third router. Plug it in, configure it, and stick it in the closet - you're all set. I really find the range to be impressive - you can pick it up like a block away and it's lightning fast.Cons: the blue lights are ridiculous. An obvious \\"what were you thinking\\" moment once you see these. But, it shouldn't be a deal breaker. It comes with a little black cap you can cover the blue lights with, and then you never have to give them a second thought."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am still hoping to get a refund on it","review":"I have never had so many problems with a router. And I am also experiencing those horrible random disconnects, and it seems the only way is to re-boot the router (I have gone through the agony of speaking to phone support 3-4 times and nothing they've told me works). Also, the router has its on firewall which forces the user to turn off his own firewall in order to use the router, which is a RIDICULOUS condition to have.I regret ever buying this Netgear product, I will actively recommend my friends NOT to buy it, and I am still hoping to get a refund on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Limited or No Connectivity\\"","review":"This wireless router drops the signal frequently requiring a reboot to restore connectivity. This has been under discussion in Netgear's own user forum for several months now - multiple users having the same problem.

I have bought three of these. The first one, the radio quit completely, the second one dropped connection constantly, so I purchased the newest version...same problem. Repeated dropped connections to any wireless device. On top of that, I could only pull 500 kbps wirelessly whereas I was pulling 6 MB with a wire. Not the problem of the wireless adapters, because they work fine on other routers.

Well it works ok for the most part, except for the fact that it drops the internet connection fairly often, and when attempting to game online the ping will fluctuate very often making it impossible to play and actually have fun.It's not a bad router for someone who is just surfing the web or chatting, but for some reason it fails to route our internet speed correctly.I am also rather dissatisfied with the \\"netgear support\\" that is so highly spoke of. Unlike most of their customers, I am not a simpleton. And while simply reseting the router would APPEAR to be the magic solution for all of the problems under God's green earth, it's not. I am returning or selling this one to downgrade to our previous WGT624 108, at least it's reliable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this thing, it's junk.","review":"I bought this router from Fry's and paid them to come out and set it up. It worked fine for a day, they came back and got it working again. It quit 31 days later, one day after the cutoff for me to return it. It is impossible to get any help from Netgear unless I pay them $39.99 for help. Their website is useless, their help line just keeps telling me it's my computor. I've tried this thing on 3 computors with the same result.In my opinion Netgear equipment is nothing but junk, their service stinks and Fry's is a rip off store.Don't waste your money on this thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this product","review":"I should have known not to leave Linksys with their superior support. Do not buy Netgear. Their support is horrible. They will not answer what day it is without trying to force you to buy \\"support\\" for $100. I was just trying to find out something about updating their firmware which should have been on both their internet site and their instruction manual but was not. Stay way from Netgear products. Companies with this view of customer support should go out of business."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work","review":"Received product, no installation CD received, had to go to the website, spent two days trying to get it to work. Ended up going and spending $50 on a new Belkin at Walmart and it works great!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Keep your old Netgear router","review":"I bought this new router because of the \\"claims\\" that it had great coverage in a home. No, worse than my old Netgear router. I have speeds that vary from 54 to 48 to even 24 when I am 5 feet away from the router. I just printed my labels to return it to Amazon. Luckily amazon has a great return policy."},{"rating":"2","title":"YES, you CAN turn off those annoying blue disco lights!","review":"I recently bought this router to replace a lost Linksys wireless router and so far it's working fine with some improved range. I, like about everyone else was TOTALLY annoyed with the blinking blue disco lights.FYI, after a brief search on the internet, I discovered this:\\"Note: The button on the back of the router is NOT a power switch. It is used only to turn the blue LED lights on the router on and off.\\"I just assumed the switch in the back of the router was a power switch, but it's not.Thankfully, I can now enjoy the device without have to wear sunglasses at night."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY PROBLEMATIC","review":"I've had nothing but bad experience with Netgear products and this item is no exception. I've been using it for over a year. It delivers pretty good range as advertised but unfortunately causes a lot of irritating network anomolies such as random network slowdowns, IP address conflicts, unavailability of wireless access, incompatibility issues with other network equipment (particularly the Verizon FIOS modem/router). A hard reboot of the router will resolve most of these issues until they inevitably and unpredictably surface again. Needless to say, rebooting the router is a real pain in the neck. I finally got fed up with this router and replaced it with a comparable D-Link model that has performed flawlessly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seems to Work Well","review":"Simple to install (3 minutes), good signal throughout my 4100+SF home. So as long as it continues to work I am happy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good if You want it for 5-9 months...","review":"This product is just trash. Do not waste your time or money on it like I did, unfortunately. I liked it at first because it was easy to set up, looked pretty good to me, and worked seamlessly. Until after about 6 months of ownership it starts not connecting to the internet very good because of Netgears dns traffic passing stuff. It has only gotten worse until it would just connect for maybe a few seconds. I had to get rid of and will never buy a netgear product again. Just look on other reviews to learn more about it dying when it even nears a year and the horrible customer support."},{"rating":"1","title":"[4 Star now] Original copy was down more than up.. New one is working perfectly","review":"I like this wireless router.. when it works. Which unfortunately is only for short stretches at a time. As other reviewers have said, the problem appears related to the wireless functionality. I've spoken to support who claimed to have never heard of this issue before and ultimately agreed that \\"it sounds like it is not operating correctly\\". Of course I'm out of warranty, so out of luck. This is obviously a design or quality issue, but apparently Netgear doesn't want repeat customers. If it worked as expected I would give this 4 or 5 stars.UPDATE: [4 start now] Work was nice enough to provide wireless setup for my home office and this was my one choice for wireless router. I was a bit apprehensive given the issues w/ the first one, but after 4+ months the 2nd copy I have is working flawlessly. I originally rated this 2 stars, but would up it to 4 based on the replacement router."},{"rating":"1","title":"I like Netgear, but I could not get it to work with Verizon DSL","review":"I've never had problems with Netgear products, but I found this unit to be an exercise in frustration. Perhaps it's simply not compatible with Verizon DSL, but despite many emails with customer service, I never got it to work. It's definitely NOT plug and play as my previous Netgear wireless router was, so I give it a major thumbs-down."},{"rating":"1","title":"WPN824 ? Save your money","review":"If you are looking for an easy to use router that is intuitive to set up, or have any foolish expectations about customer service, do not buy this unit. In fact after my experience, I will not buy netgear again.I cannot recommend D-Link highly enough. THeir units work, and they do answer e-mail etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Experience","review":"Terrible buying experience in every way. After 3 days of trying to set it up and numerous hours wasted on the line with Netgear tech support, I never got this working correctly. I'm not computer illiterate, and I have had great success with several Linksys routers, but this product was simply terrible. Between the bad product and the bad tech support this was just an awful purchase. I'm returning it and getting a better quality product.Just because its more expensive than Netgear's other junky wireless products, doesn't mean its better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't purchase this - a complete waste of time & money","review":"Whatever you do, don't wast your money on this. It is extremely difficult to install. I still don't have it working correctly. It totally trashed the network settings on my laptop so now the laptop hangs for over 3 minutes when I start it up. Not only can I not get it to work wirelessly, I lost my wireless settings entirely. The tech support on the Netgear website is absolutely horrible. It is almost impossible to figure out how to contact them - you go around in circles trying to find the right link to their tech support form. I'm an experienced user, although I've never tried to set up a wireless network before. I've used my laptop wirelessly with no problems until now. I followed the directions exactly, but I might as well have thrown my money into the street. I just hope I can get my laptop back the way it was (it won't go back to the restore point I created). I won't ever buy any Netgear products again after this experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch out","review":"When this router arrived, it didnt come with the standard packaging. I realized this was a refurb, which made sense as to the low price. It was NOT clearly marked as a refurb and I am currently researching to see if it was advertised as brand new merchandise.To make matters worse, port forwarding doesnt work with a standard install unless you take down the SPI feature of the router, making it less secure. The fancy lighting is useless and has no functionality other than to fire off blue light. Fortunately this can be turned off.If laptop is put in sleep mode, it has a VERY difficult time reconnecting, sometimes having to reboot in order to get a clean connection. Signal strength also seems to be less than advertised but this may be the reason it was a refurb. I think there are better routers for the money. I wont go with netgear again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Netgear meets STARWARS... but the force was not with them....","review":"This is the 1st wireless router which I purchased and I wasnt pleased. I saw a drop in internet speed after installation....and the flickering blue lights were enough to have me banging my head against a wall by the third night. I returned the unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"No installation instructions","review":"The product arrived quickly, but be advised that if you do not know how to install this router, the product will be of no use to you. Not only are there no instructions provided with the router, the netgear website is also of no use. So, the bottom line is, this product is of no use to me and I will have to return it. The other bad thing, it is not even heavy enough to use as a boat anchor!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not impressed","review":"i thought this was supposed to be better than it is. no major problems. but, stupid blinking light is annoying as he** and the strength is not great for me (apartment building - 55 units). It is slower than my land connection was when 2 people are using. it's ok - just not what i expected."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nope...not again.","review":"I bought this so that my kids PS3 could connect wirelessly and they could play online. First...did not work...only had like 10% signal strenght. Heck, I had a stronger signal (30%) from my NEIGHBOR'S wireless network. Ended up hooking the PS3 up via ethernet and then it would frag out whenever someone was on the internet while someone else was playing the PS3. Did speed testing, and all my speeds were a fraction of what my speed was when I connected straight to the cable modem.So, I went out and bought a D-Link Xtreme Gaming Router, and man, could you tell the difference. Paid a lot more, but worth every penny...none of the issues above reappeared with the new router. I reviewed the D-link as well on its product page.Summary: skip over this...go D-Link if you have a gamer."},{"rating":"1","title":"'easy'?","review":"Okay...well...first let me say I'm not real handy setting up computer things..so when the reviews said it was 'easy' to set up I thought \\"hey! I can do 'easy'.\\" It took two hours on the phone with tech support ( in some foreign country...thick, difficult to understand accent) before 'we' were able to get it up and running with our computers. Once it was set up, it worked for a few months, then just quit one day. I didn't have it in me to do another two hours on the phone trouble shooting, so I bought AT&T's wireless router and hooked it up, ( in about 20 minutes) and it's been working fine ever since. Also...the blue flashing light is annoying if it's in or near where you sleep at night."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seems to overheat...or something","review":"Easy setup, and good range.However, the unit seems to overheat or, for whatever reason, will stop working without warning once a month or so. I haven't figured out what causes it, but I have to unplug it for a few minutes and then restart it.Also, the flashing blue lights are INCREDIBLY annoying. I haven't figured out how to shut them off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse than the other wireless router","review":"There is a reason that this router is getting such a poor review; I think they have some serious firmware/design flaw in the WPN824. My router will drop the connection, on the average, once a day, and will reconnect if power-cycled. The netgear tech support guy is a joke. The range is great, but the product is just not ready."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"I just received this for my kids for Christmas and it is great! We had \\"dead spots\\" in the house and my daughter couldn't get service in her room at all, and we have a ranch style home. We were using the lesser expensive netgear wireless router. It did take quite a while to get it hooked up and running but taking my time worked out. They love it and they are getting the internet all over the house now."},{"rating":"2","title":"wireless internet","review":"since i cannot get my portable phones to work from the main house to my studio...with 6 walls inbetween, i must admit i was skeptical, but lo and behold...a perfect internet connection.the only problem i see, is that it slows downloading abit. who cares...i am finally connected wireless-ly and with ease.installing was a cinch also. you may, as i did, have to adjust the positioning of the unit.don't know why the unit has a flashing blue light. could do without the dramatics but on the other hand, you can find your computer room in the dark.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Petstore Perfect!","review":"I work at a small local petstore and we needed new tanks for our reptiles. One of the main reasons i got these is because a lot of people like to take their new pet home with its tank at the store, but thats means we loose money since the glass tanks are so expensive. Now people can take their reptiles home in their Reptile Houses and i can get new ones as soon as i need them! Our reptiles love these even more than we do, I deffinetly recomend getting these for smaller snakes (corn snakes), treefrogs, hermit crabs, geckos, ect. The only reason i gave 4 stars instead of 5 was because once the bedding was down,there wasnt much viewing space so we had to move them to an eye-level shelf. But overall these are very good products!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Struck By Lightning","review":"To paraphrase Edward Norton in Fight Club (who no doubt would have been a fan of the band)... after Lightning Bolt, everything else in your life has got the volume turned down. The duo achieve this by combining an uncompromising musical vision, technical virtuosity, and, you guessed it, sheer VOLUME.Noise. Experimental. Free Jazz. Grindcore. No one word can fully encapsulate Lightning Bolt's sound, so I won't attempt to try. All I can say is that if you're in search of some new music that is even remotely similar to what you hear on the radio, look elsewhere. However, brave souls with open minds will catch a glimse of the future of music with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thunder tap","review":"LB presented an interesting palate of stripped down, neo-punk assaults, but become too ensnared in the aesthetics of pounding minimalism to have most of the songs rise above noisy novelty."},{"rating":"2","title":"God what a workout","review":"Rhode Island band?

There are no classic movies which will endure for future generations. We are left only with some excellent written accounts of the conflict.Although I read and enjoyed When Thunder Rolled and a number of other books on the air war in Vietnam I would rate this at the top of the class. Bell not only tells the story but also the emotions from the highs to the lows.Highly recommended"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating stories all wrapped up into one","review":"This book has three main elements - the 1994 theft and eventual recovery of The Scream, the undercover Scotland Yard detective Charley Hill, and various digressions on other crimes and criminals. All three parts are equally good. Charley Hill is a character straight out of thriller fiction, but no one in the book even comes close to being boring. I have read several books on art crime, and this is one of the best. I do not understand how anyone could give this book fewer than five stars. It is highly recommended to anyone who is interested in art, interested in true crime, interested in a good detective story, or just interested in a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good, really fast read","review":"The Rescue artist is a swift and exciting book that revolves around Charlie Hill, an unforgettable (and quite real) detective on the hunt for missing masterpieces, in this case Edvard Munch's classic \\"Scream\\" stolen from a museum in Oslo, Norway. Dolnick writes crisp, well-turned sentences that pull the reader along. I felt like I was reading a good, long magazine article, like in the New Yorker. At times the story jumps and shifts around too much, and I had to backtrack a couple times to pick up what was going on, but this is really good stuff, entertaining as can be. Highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"art history/true crime buffs","review":"This is a fun and engaging read for anyone who likes true crime. Those of us who also have a love of art will find a real treat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seedy adventures in high art!","review":"I just finished Edward Dolnick's new book, _The Rescue Artist_. It is a fun read filled with madcap, Damon Runyonesque characters who would be hard to make up. This book, with the theft of Edvard Munch's \\"The scream\\" as its main story, covers the underside of the art world. As a person who enjoys art and goes to museums, I certainly never imagined that works of art would be held as ransom by political groups. Dolnick delves into the hows and why of art heists, and how detectives track down the paintings most importantly, and often the thieves. I recommend this book to anyone who likes a good adventure \\"story\\". You don't even have to be interested in art!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Right Up My Alley","review":"To use an old cliche' this book was right up my alley. It fascinating because it's about \\"true crime,\\" which is far more intriguing to me than the antics in the Da Vinci Code. The meanderings didn't bother me. I wanted to know about the history of art thievery. Charlie Hill is a great character--flawed, quirky and still believable--a complete mess! I also found the writing well drawn--good vocalbulary--good descriptions.

Frankly, none of these are a panacea.The multiple choice section in particular has the basics, but a student preparing for the test would need a lot more walking through the types of questions to be encountered and more practice than this book gives.Otherwise, it is as good as others on the market. You might give an edge to the Cliff's version if you had to choose just one, though having both would be a good plan, if you find these prep books useful.Being widely read in a variety of AP level lit. and writing, writing, writing, with someone to give you good feedback is the best prep."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thermo Loud","review":"These brake pads squealed worse than my Autozone pads right out of the box.

Even after detection, they allowed him to continue as a doctor.Even more upsetting was the failure of the faculty of the college of medicine at Southern Illinois University to detect and fail incompetent students. These students, including Michael Swango, were allowed to continue; even after episodes of total incompetence.

For those familiar with his books, this is just as good as the others and well worth a read.

This practice is becoming more prevalent in this age as impossible as it seems, and this book describes how easy it can be. Swango may be out in Jan.2000 unless they can charge him with murder & like all serial killers he will continue, his purported 60 victims are just a start.

How does the medical profession handle physicians who should not be practicing medicine? How are medical professionals treated who engage in criminal activity? What is the hierarchy within the medical profession? Have you ever been curious about medical education? Have you ever wondered how a doctor you've visited seemed to be \\"operating\\" in the wrong profession? Have you ever wondered why the medical profession tends to work on a similar \\"paradigm\\" and any physician who proposes a different theory is attacked and ostracized? Ever wonder why Medical Quality Assurance boards are so loathe to do anything? This book begins to answer all of those questions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this a script for Phil Donahue or Jerry Springer?","review":"This is another example of the media's biased doctor bashing. Swango is a bad apple. He is a rarity. To give the most extreme example of a problem to demonstrate how a whole system is broken is absurd. Doctors don't cover for doctors. They are often each other's worst critics. Meaningful regulation is often limited or blocked by litigation, whether threatened or real. At my hospital we have a bad surgeon we would like to remove from the staff (multiple malpractice cases among other problems), but their lawyer keeps appealing so we are forced to allow them to practice while we wait. Stewart misses the point that lawyers make it very difficult for doctors to police themselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"A harsh slam at medical professionals","review":"While this book is an interesting take on the history of the Swango case, the author (and many of my fellow reviewers) jump to too many conclusions about the poor state of checks and balances in America's hospitals and medical schools.

Many many lives are saved each and every day by tireless medical professionals -- let's give them some respect and thanks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Michael Swango, aka Killer","review":"Good Book. Very Interesting. Michael Swango - guilty of all charges including murder. I am appalled by what he got away with in the medical field.

The sample seemed good so I gave it a shot. I should have listened to the other reviewers.

He just barely passes off looking like Bogart. But everybody else in the movie CAN act; more specifically, act like character archtypes from Raymond Chandler movies.There's Victor Buono as a Sydney Greenstreetoid, Herbert Lom as a Peter Lorreite, and Franco Nero as a rival art collector that colors his world lavender. Olivia Hussey plays the innocent daughter of the guy with the McGuffin (In this case a pair of twin sapphires) and Yvonne DeCarlo...doesn't speak. At all. Odd, really. Don't blink, or you'll miss George Raft in a cameo, only slightly longer than his \\"this gun shoots backwards\\" role in Casino Royale.It's not quite a parody, and not good enough to be a tribute...more like Bogartmania. Not Bogart, but an incredible simulation.Okay...not that incredible."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's Got Sybil Danning.

Most of this short (54 min.) work consists of two small groups of extraordinarily confident horsemen who canter about, chasing and shooting at each other, in essentially non-stop fashion; since most video releases of the work have no titles or credits, one's attention becomes drawn to spotting the interchangeability of the good and bad guys......nothing else here warrants a viewer's concentration."},{"rating":"2","title":"covers the basics, a good start","review":"I think this is a good book for starting Visual J++ programming.

The reason why I ordered it is the workout from violet zaki, which is excellent of course. Unfornately I had to purchase the whole tape just to get to her. The rest of the trainers were terrible.

Now if you are a beginner, then this workout is for you; but if you are intermediate to advanced, then skip this tape."},{"rating":"1","title":"They had no right to put advertising into their workout","review":"I got this new CD and was looking forward to doing it, but it did not happened.

You really have to watch it otherwise you will miss the beginning.I have a lot of CDs at home, and it never happened before this particular CD. Needless to say that this series is out of questions for me to buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"I thought this DVD would be such a bargain with 5 different workouts. I was disappointed with all of these workouts. The first workout started fine then he got really complex. Why do they feel it's necessary to make thins so hard and frustrating, it's a total turnoff. The rest of workouts were not challenging at all. I was very disappointed in this. I might give it another try only because I don't want it to be a waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great variety!","review":"I really like this dvd for 1 big reason: Variety! I don't have to do the same workout or see the same trainer day in and day out - that really beats my biggest problem - boredom.All of the trainers are fun and most of the workouts have one person (there are 4 in the background) doing a lower impact version of the moves. Some of the choreography can be tricky and take a few times through to pick up - but that is part of the challenge.This is my new favorite cardio dvd and I use it 2 times a week."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great workout video","review":"With the 5 different Star Trainer workouts, you have so many options to choose from.

In one of the workouts, they actually take a break of several minutes while the instructor talks about how great this water is.I also felt that the workouts were more on the low impact side, and I didn't get that great of a workout from them. With most of them, I barely break a sweat. Also, some of the workouts spend too much time teaching the routines and then breaking in between - which amounts to too much down time for me.I might use this for a light workout or for days when I don't really feel like exercising, but it certainly won't be a regular for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Variety=Good","review":"I like having the five different workouts by five different trainers so I can mix them up depending on what I feel like doing.

The othersare also very good and I especially like the kickboxing-ish segmentwith Amy Dixon in the group. Thanks love this DVD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great variety, great cardio, great instruction","review":"Sometimes there's nothing like a good, pure cardio workout, which you'll get with this DVD, along with other benefits. Violet Zaki's kickboxing/martial arts will sneak in some toning, and the cardio bursts in Kimberly and Kendall's workouts will get you some added burn. Rob Glick's workout is a bit more challenging as far as choreography, but not overly demanding physically, and Gay Gasper's is good, old fashioned aerobics. You can't go wrong here. I'll admit the propel plugs are annoying, but it was probably necessary to fund production. Each workout is roughly 30 minutes, so you can mix and match depending on what your goals are. There's something here for everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy it for Violet Zaki","review":"Violet Zaki is probably my favorite fitness instructor of all time. I have done every workout she has ever put on dvd and I love them all. I bought this item because I knew she was in it and that she wouldn't disappoint and I was right. This is a great video, yes there is quite a bit of advertising which gets annoying. But this video will make you sweat and Zaki's workout will get your muscles screaming for mercy."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a poor indication of the group's quality,","review":"though not their fault. The production of the DVD is almost amatuerish. The visuals are impeccable, but when you buy a music DVD, you hope for quality of sound as well. This sound seems to have been recorded using a microphone hung in the middle of the auditorium. Frequently, the vocals are uninteligible, drowned out by the back-up group. If you have ever seen them in concert, you know what a treat the experience is. In this case, however, the effort of the group is evident but the results of the recording are disappointing at best."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE ANYTHING BERYL TAYLOR","review":"I have taken a workshop with Beryl in Colorado, purchased her book and HAD to have her DVD.

In my opinion, Beryl rules!"},{"rating":"2","title":"You Can't Go Wrong With This Guide","review":"I used this guide after briefly referring to a third-party manual and scored 952/1000 on the exam--three days before, I'd never even used PowerPoint. Some people think study guides should be as comprehensive as a manual but the truth about the MOUS exams is that, most of the time, the more advanced knowledge you have, the more likely it is that you'll get tripped up interpreting the tasks. Klippert provides an excellent, easy to read and refer to guide that tells you exactly what you need to know. The accompanying CD is brilliant with practice documents for everything, including finished solutions so that you can check your work. What this guide has that most others lack is focus--which is all you need to pass the exam."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Resurrection of Bayou Savage","review":"Russell combines imagination and insight of the life of a musician to provide the setting for an incredible journey through the dimensions occupied by Bayou Savage.

It's a great story line and the characters are unique. Easy to read for teenagers and adults."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for ANY Musician","review":"I can safely say this is one of the coolest books I've ever read. Russell takes guitar playing to a new level in this thriller about a \\"Guitar Ghost Hunter\\" who battles ghosts with an Old Fender Guitar, and the legend and circumstances surrounding his life and death. If you like science-fiction that won't take you 6 years to finish reading, you'll love this book. Perfect for readers of all ages, and musicians in particular."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely strong. Cheaper at an Indian grocer.","review":"This soap has a very strong sandalwood smell - that's the reason why I use it. Sandalwood also has many properties that are beneficial to skin, at least according to Ayurvedic tradition. It's thought to be effective against infectious sores, acne, rashes and excessive sweating. I just like the fact that I smell good after I shower with it - I've even been complemented on my smell by women when I've used this soap.I do need to mention one odd thing though: On a few occasions, I think this soap has altered my sense of taste. For instance, even hours after using it, I've had red wine taste like sandalwood to me (but not to my drinking buddy). Powerful stuff!If you have an Indian grocer nearby, they usually sell the 150g size for two bucks, or the 75g size for a buck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure unadulterated barnyard brown","review":"To start with, the SEAL Mr. Valentine interviewed in this book never existed. There has never been an Elton Manzione who graduated from the Navy's Special Warfare Training, UDT/R or BUD/S. This combined with the fact that the Navy only sent their senior people who had time in country to work with the Phoenix Program. Either Valentine made this up or relied on sources that were pretty shaky. Do your homework better next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mostly fantasy substantiated by proven frauds with an agenda","review":"Once you know that Manzione is a verified fraud everthing that follows is discredited.

It is very telling that one of the most positive reviews posted here is from one of the purveyors of the fairy tale about Americans using nerve gas on other Americans. Avoid this book; there are lots of better and more balanced ones. And, yes, I was there, as a matter of fact."},{"rating":"2","title":"No spoilers here","review":"This is a very good movie. If you are fascinated by addiction or addicts you will get something out of it. Maggie looks great as a blonde (who would have thought?) and she easily slides into the role of addict. I never once thought that she was trying too hard or wasn't right for the part. Addicts are a lot of work and a drain on the family...they pop in an out of rehabs, jails and halfway houses and expect everyone to be overjoyed when they are released. This movie shows the love, the anger, the regret, the abuse, the neglect and the hopelessness of addicts and their families."},{"rating":"1","title":"What about the Earth Religions??","review":"I wish books like this would stop claiming to represent the complete religious views of humanity. By ignoring the highly sophisticated belief and religious systems of countless earth-connected Indigenous Cultures, not to mention the fastest-growing religion on the planet today - Paganism, it complies with the devious principles of dominance and control. This book is not a comprehensive attempt to address the \\"truth that unites all humankind\\" that's for sure. There are countless other paths to the Sacred that are not acknowledged in this book. What about the millions that don't subscribe to the eight major monotheistic organized religions - where are Their Voices???"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique and unifying","review":"As stated in the product description, the book contains (translated) excerpts from the sacred texts of Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Judaism, Confucianism, Taoism, Zoroastrianism, and Buddhism, and addresses such universal topics as Love, Faith, Courage, Justice, Duty, and Forgiveness.It is unique, and well worth getting."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Read","review":"The book is told in first person, storied format, which made it really enjoyable to read. I could care less about whether or not it's non-fiction (which the author claims), it's a good, suspenseful espionage type story, that teaches you a little something.I didn't read it looking for political knowledge for debate, I read it to have something to read, and it was good, plain and simple."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible insiders account","review":"The author shares with us a remarkable first hand account of a young Muslim who ends up working for European Intelligence Services. His journey from the streets of Morocco, to Belgium, and ultimately to Afghan Mujhadeen training camps is captivating. He shows us the difference between how \\"westerners\\" like myself and young Muslims see the world. It is important to understand his story, the people he met, and how the call for jihad resonates with the youth throughout the Muslim world. I personally found the incompetence of the Intelligence services he dealt with remarkable. This is a great look at the \\"insiders account\\" of what motivates people to embark upon training and joining the Mujhadeen. In addition it shows how we really don't understand the threat we face, the resiliency of our enemy, and their robust training."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fake","review":"Under the auspices of \\"inside information\\" on the workings of the Jihad, this book is a piece of subjective propaganda - not all that cleverly camouflaged - an should be tagged as such."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad Strippa","review":"This song flopped in the UK something terrible and so did the follow up.

However, I was very disappointed when I got to the section on Homer, as it contains a large number of basic errors about the plots of the two epics, especially the Odyssey. These are mistakes that I would be annoyed to find in my students' essays, and would remark to them that it they seemed not to have actually read the epics, or at least not recently. I haven't finished the book yet, but my confidence in the statements made by these authors in other areas has been greatly shaken."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tacked-on HP","review":"I've only read the last couple of chapters of this book, but my advice is, don't buy it for the Harry Potter part. There are a few pages on HP, and they say things everyone has said before by John Granger and others. John Granger's books are hard to follow at times, but he really engages with the HP books in a way this book doesn't.I also read the His Dark Materials chapter which seemed biased against Pullman, but I need to read the rest of the book to rate it fairly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading, false and biased book - christian propoganda","review":"I was very excited about this book as an intellectual investigation into myth and fantasy used through out world literature.How dissapointed I was. This book is initially very interesting but the more you read the more clear it becomes that these are Christian fundies writing this book and the only purpose they see for art is one that converts more people to Christianity. Ironically the Book rails against the author Bill Pullman for having an anti Christian \\"axe to grind\\" when they clearly have their own \\"Christian Axe to grind\\". This book pretends to be critical discourse. All it really is is christian propoganda that states anything that isn't \\"christian\\" is bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terribly Disappointed","review":"This book, which was probably very good in the 1970's is woefully lacking in currently applicable information. Too much of the text is taken up by documenting projects that failed. A far better book on hydroponics, and worth every penny of the additional $8 cost, is \\"How-to Hydroponics, Fourth Edition\\" by Keith Roberto. While this book is supposedly updated as of 1999, it barely scrapes the surface of current hydroponic technology."},{"rating":"2","title":"a reference for every project","review":"I was introduced to this book early in my undergraduate studies of design but rediscovered it during my recently completed senior year.

In that sense, for those who are familiar with this subject, this book does not add anything new. This book also has many serious faults. For example, I find the translation of Purusha as Man (even with capital M) as disrespectful and improper. The RigVeda does NOT say that Man is his own creator. Of course, why would that bother Dr. Doniger?If anyone wants to read a proper anthology of the RigVeda, I recommend the english rendition of a Sanskrit anthological (121 hymns) work of T.V. Kapali Sastry by Prof. R.L. Kashyap. This book is available in the US."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gets lost in the foliage","review":"If the Rigveda is a tree with a grand plan, Wendy Doniger doesn't know it.

The author has wasted her efforts to put through incorrect views of her own, much better if she had researched some other texts perhaps the bible? However, knowing her knack for misinterpreting ancient texts I shudder to even think about it.In ending I think anyone who commented the following on the most sacred Indian text as follows should not have tried interpreting a religious text of the relgion that she is biased against:The Bhagavad Gita is not as nice a book as some Americans think,\\" the good professor informed her audience. \\"Throughout the Mahabharata ... Krishna goads human beings into all sorts of murderous and self-destructive behaviours such as war.... The Gita is a dishonest book ; it justifies war.\\" Prof. Doniger added for good measure : \\"I'm a pacifist. I don't believe in \`good' wars.\\" (Philadelphia Inquirer of 19 November.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to grasp","review":"I know nothing about the Rig Veda outside this book so cannot comment on whether the hymns selected or the translation were appropriate. However, the lack of introductory material means that each hymn is followed by a lengthy notes section. Flipping backward and forward detracts from the fluidity and understanding of the text. The hymns are pregnant with symbolism but if it's introduced in the notes on an as-you-go basis it isn't absorbed.Some of the shorter hymns I found read quite well so the translation isn't all bad. Furthermore, it chooses to present some of the more \\"mundane\\" aspects of life during the time of the Rig Veda, which I found interesting.Overall, there are probably far better translations but this one isn't all bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Indian Elephant","review":"Ms. Doniger seems to be biased against the Vedic religion (aka Hinduism) which can be easily gleaned by a careful reader of this work. The author also has hidden agenda in her portrayal of the Hindu religion by negative stereo-typing.Any Westerner wanting to know about the Rig veda is well advised to ignore this shananigan.

It was nice to read a book about the battle of Midway from the Japanese point of view. It was even nicer to read a book about how arrogance can blind you from doing things the right way. In reading this book you really start to realize how lucky the United States got at the battle of Midway. By all rights the force that the Japanese had amassed should have crushed the US Fleet that was gathered to meet them. The US was lucky that it broke the Japanese Navy code and had a pretty good idea of where the Japanese were while the Japanese were poking in the dark and had no idea of what was waiting for them. It is a good thing that Fuchida had an appendectomy right before the battle because if he hadn't we probably wouldn't have been able to read this little gem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long Discredited Apologia","review":"The excellent work by Parshall & TullyShattered Sword: The Untold Story of the Battle of Midwaycompletely demolishes the myth that this book of personal excuse mongering can add anything non-fictional to the history of the Battle Of Midway. Fuchida tells some flat out whopper lies in this book. When Parshall & Tully went to Japan to research from original Japanese sources, they found that no naval scholar treated Fuchida's book as any serious source on the battle. Fuchida's book has long been totally discredited in Japan. This can be read in full in Parshall & Tully, Chapter 24, The Myths And Mythmakers Of Midway, pages 431-443 in the hardcover edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Midway - The Japanese Account","review":"Midway as told by Fuchida and Okumiya is an interesting account on the turn of the battle in the pacific. Fuchida was one of the senior officers during the attack on Pearl Harbor. Being an important part of the prolog to the battle of Midway he tells the story of this epic attack from the view of the attacker.Unlike Germany and other axis powers very little firsthand information is available from the Japanese own records. This book is one of the most important sources of information narrated and told by the Japanese themselves. The book also gives an overview of the nature of the Japanese and why Japan never could have won the war. I found it interesting to read about the discussions inside the Japanese Navy General Staff that ultimately led to the outbreak of the war. There are some important lessons to be learned here, also transferable to daily life and interaction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mitsuo Fuchida was a liar...","review":"As a Navy brat who grew up in the postwar era, Midway was a big deal. Of course, I read and enjoyed Fuchida's book. However, I recently finished reading \\"Shattered Sword: The Untold Story of the Battle of Midway\\" by Jonathan Parshall. In this book, it's clearly demonstrated that Fuchida did more than shade the truth. He lied in such a way to push blame upon others for Japan's defeat at Midway. For example, Fuchida makes the claim that the Japanese were getting ready to launch their strike just at the time the American SBDs dive bombed their carriers. Parshall shows how that was impossible given both Japanese carrier practice and the logs of flight activity. Sadly, Fuchida's book has enjoyed an unwarranted popularily due to our ignorance of Japanese documents and our lack of desire to question something that fits right into our own prejudices.The Japanese historians consider Fuchida to be a liar. It's time that we do the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"A different perspective on the pivotal battle.","review":"This is a first person account of the battle that turned the war in the Pacific.

It is not and if you put it in a hot oven it warps like crazy. Once I realized that this was not the All-Clad that I was used to I contacted All-Clad. I have an entire kitchen full of All-Clad and they told me to stuff it. So that will be the last \\"All-Clad\\" I will ever purchase.

It is now the night before Thanksgiving and I have hauled out my old inexpensive roaster, the one which looks like the Granite Ware roaster listed on Amazon(like my mom's old roaster but not has heavy). Using the All-Clad seemed to produce less juice for the all critical gravy making, and the gravy making was far more difficult in the All Clad. Been roasting turkeys for over 25 yrs and here I am pulling out the inexpensive one & feeling as tho I had wasted almost $300.This All Clad roaster's quality is not like my other All-Clad's pots & pans-not nearly as heavy or even \\"cooking\\"(when I fought with it during gravy making on top of the burners). The only thing positive I can say about is, the handle placement ( french roaster design) is excellent. Save your money and get a better pan- until All Clad can come up with a better roaster(heavy bottom).Happy TG!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bait and Switch?","review":"I read the reviews on this All Clad oven pan and saw that a few reviewers said it was a 'Roti' version, made in China, and not three-ply construction. Since these reviews were several years old, I read the description that Amazon provides. I assume they get the description from All Clad. I ordered it and, of course, received the Roti Pan, made in China. Is not 3-ply. It is all stainless. I am concerned over buckeling when subjected to high heat either in the oven or on the cooktop. I have written All Clad to see what they say. There is no mention on their site of Roti pans and they proudly state their products are made in America. I love my other All Clad pans but am disappointed in this product......When I previewed my review, even though I was logged in under my name, the preview showed the author of the review as someone else. What's up with that, Amazon?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Update on Cook's Ilustrated","review":"The above reviewer is correct that Cook's Illustrated has updated its recommendation of this pan.

I am, to say the least, very disappointed. I'm a senior level software engineer with a good hardware background, but I found this book to be so unclear as to be nearly unreadable. There is little logical progression in building the reader's conceptualizations. Facts are introduced seemingly at random. Irrelevant ideas are gratuitously tossed in, only to be rescinded shortly after. I looked in vain for a chapter that lived up to its title, and felt disappointed with each and every one. There isn't even an appendix listing the processor's instruction set! There's no way I could program a PIC after reading this book, and I'm almost as ignorant about them as before. All in all, a very frustrating experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most Poorly written Book I have read in last 5 years","review":"The author may know the subject, however by reading the book one does not get that feeling.

It was written at a level that assumed the user was familiar with microprocessors and jumped right into a rehash of the convoluted PIC literature. Needless to say it was simply another book that got relegated to the library shelf. I don't recommend anyone buy this book if you are trying to learn anything about the PIC. The problem is mainly that professors should not be writing books for ordinary engineers to read. I was looking for a book that outlined in simple language how to use the PIC. This book was an absolute disappointment. This would be a book I would ask to have my money refunded."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor organization and writing","review":"After reading the mixed reviews, I bought this book anyway. Even the more negative reviews had not prepared me for the vague writing style and, much worse, the very real lack of structure. There is progression of ideas is weak and haphazard with insufficient explanation of basic concepts. It is possible to learn from this book, but only by reading the datasheets first, and then perhaps by reading the book cover to cover twice -- I had expected the book to serve as a self-contained introduction, allowing me to use the datasheet only as a reference, but I could not use it as such. Instead of this book, I recommend Peatman's book over this one (also sold by Amazon).

Doesn't McGraw-Hill have editors to point out that it is customary to create a logical, linear progression of concepts? Were there no proofreaders to tell the author that to immediately retract a statement is a waste of the reader's time and attention? The poor organization, grammar, and phrasing were not what I expect in a book of this price from a major publisher. The technical content is acceptable, given the implicit target audience of hobbyists. The processor architecture diagrams, though, are of a type meant for those who study or design processors.

The aforementioned big titles are there for a reason, and while this game has it's fun points, if you're looking for a good FPS game, just do yourself a favor and get Call Of Duty, you'll be glad you did."},{"rating":"1","title":"extremely disappointing...","review":"I liked the first Ghost Recon. It was challenging, had some length to it, and was a pretty good game.Ghost Recon 2 is supposed to be all-new and improved with new features. It's not. It's not even worthy of having 2 in the title, because it's not much more than a sad overpriced expansion pack.They don't even try with the story. The game is RIDICULOUSLY short. I completed this in a few short hours. Definitely not worth 60 bucks!!!!Since Rainbox Six: Vegas came out, the whole FPS scene has changed. Save yourself the couple of hours it takes to complete this forgettable game, and save the $60 you'd spend on it. Instead buy RS Vegas and see what the greatest FPS ever made looks like (and it's at least a very challenging, fun, and lengthy game)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Game freeze problem and bad customer support!","review":"Good: This title has great and improved graphics. Little tweaks that give this game almost prefect gameplay.Bad: Short single player campagin. Buggy online voice communication and people drops offline are very common. A little pricer than the last title.Ugly: Freezing bug (undetermined reasons from software or hardware) makes this game totally unplayable on some old XBox360. Some have even reported that the game bricking their consoles (the 3 red light of doom). Hundreds of complains on the Ubi and MSLive forums but yet any reponse from the companies in the first week. This kind of customer support really breaks many gamers' heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great combat simulation!","review":"I've just gotten started playing this game, and I have to admit I was a little intimidated by it at first. I played some of the first GRAW and had some difficulty understanding the cross comm. I enjoyed the game play and graphics but didn't get too far in it. I decided to trade it in and get GRAW 2 since it was new and highly touted. I have been more than satisfied with my purchase. The graphics are about as good as Gears of War (some of the cut scenes don't look as good as Gears) and the cross comm seems a little easier for me to grasp this time around. I don't know if it's because Ubisoft simplified it or because I'm simply familiar with it after playing GRAW. Anyway, once I got started and completed the training section I was hooked. If you like shooters you have to check this one out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Single Player fun but too short.","review":"This game improves upon the 1st however it is much too short and I would say much too easy. Even on the hardest difficulty I had no problem completing this in a couple days. I still don't understand why the multiplayer can't be the same as the single player or why we can't play the single player missions co-op. This game is more like 1.5. Not part 2. I certainly wouldn't pay $60 for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Military Engagements","review":"I love working my small crew against a formidable enemy. I use advanced military hardware and my own tactical analysis to defeat Mexican rebels rallying against the United States. This game is an excellent military simulator.

Though the title indicates that the reader will learn what was not known before on Israel's nuclear weapons, the fundamental questions on Israel's nuclear armament are not treated at all.

This tale reminds us that slavery is a state of mind as well as an institution. A slavery mentality is what develop when the institution changes and shapes you, even if it touches your body, soul, or mind just once.Dana is fierce in her passion for life as she is in her desire to make sense of the world she zips into. This tale is truly frightening. I will never view time travel in quite the same way. I also like the under current of \\"love\\" stories through this novel. Love is not just a healthy, two way street but somehow a bargain where there is no clear winner. There are no win-win situations in this book. Octavia Butler should inspire us all to try our hands at creating the very real with the unspeakable and absurd. Just as in her novel Parable of the Sower, you can hear what the characters hear, speak, and see. This novel is as scary as Parable of the Sower."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book was fantastic!!

Everyone should read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous novel -- heartily recommended to all","review":"The wonderful thing about Kindred is that it places a modern Black woman and white man into a situation where where the reality of slavery becomes a completely felt experience for the modern reader, an experience as intense and thrilling as any good mystery or science fiction novel, and at the same time a deep exploration of a serious historical issue. Truely a fabulous book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does the poor writing here bother anyone else?","review":"I wanted to love this book--I love time travel stories and I am writing a novel that deals with post-slavery life--I had every reason to LOVE Butler's story. I cannot even begin to express my personal disappointment at how poorly this amazing story concept was executed. I am a very demanding reader--it is SO distressing to find a great idea squandered with lack-luster prose littered with detail minutiae that added nothing to the story. A very telling detail: I read with a pencil and highlighter in hand--for margin annotation, and to highlight particular lines that blow me away. I didn't use either one while reading this book. Butler's writing never reached my heart, her characters were arranged in scenes like so many one-dimensional paper-dolls.I know these are fighting words for fans of this book--but I have to say that wanting to love this story made my disappointment in it all the more bitter."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book","review":"I really liked this book it was very interesting how she kept going back in time.

But am I missing something? This book intrigued me when I read its premise - it is wonderful! Time travel combined with slavery! I dove into the book, just knowing the author was going to amaze me...and instead, I found a story riddled with poorly drawn characters, totally unrealistic dialogue, and even less believable plot points. What should have been horrific events are relayed without emotion, so that the real impact of slavery and its attendant cruelty is lost. I may be in the minority, but I honestly feel Ms. Butler dropped the ball on this one. I can't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Decent Book, But It Could Have Been Better","review":"When I first started the book, I really disliked it. I thought that Octavia Butler's writing was rather childlike and poor, but as the novel progressed, this improved. That was not my main concern. The ending was rather rushed and pointless, and the loss of her arm at the end [which they tell you about from the beginning, so I'm not spoiling anything] really wasn't necessary. I simply believe that the ending could have come in a more appropriate way. As for the novel in general, it was a pretty entertaining story but I wouldn't really classify this book as science fiction; it was more like historical fiction. All in all, a decent read, but it could have been much better if certain elements were avoided."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of my favorite books!!!","review":"This is simply one of my favorite books!!

This publisher, however, has very sloppily created metadata which lists the author (for Kindle sorting purposes) under her first name rather than her last name. And, since the book is an AZW1 file (the \\"dreaded Topaz\\" format), it is impossible to correct this sloppy publisher metadata using mobi2mobi.For that reason, I have given the eBook the lowest possible \\"star\\" rating.

Without giving the story away, I must say that the inner-struggle that Dana had to go through to act as a guardian angel of sorts to Rufus was amazing and well-written. I felt every emotion that Dana felt and probably then some...I could not put this book down and grew angry with the clock when it told me it was time to stop reading.

I didn't hate this book but I would not recommend it to anyone as anything more than a fluff book, which anything discussing the awful practice of slavery should never be, in my humble opinion.

Dana, a young African American woman in an interracial relationship is ripped back in time to the days of slavery to save her white relative, a slave owner named Rufus.Butler could have executed this whole work wrong, but she didn't. She explores all myths (the difference between consensual love and forced rape), how slaves are \\"made\\" (due to violence, etc;), and how slaves, free blacks and whites lived through this period.

Anyone who likes fiction, will enjoy Kindred. Forget about the gendre. It's as much Science Fiction as yesterdays news.As an African American woman, recently returning to the states after living in Canada with a white husband, I still read, and re-read Kindred and consider it the most profound explanation/interogation of our country and it's history of slavery and adverse race relations. To say it's science fiction, is to pigeon hole Octavia Butler because she deals with ideas, we as a people are still struggling with. This racial divide, is ours to understand, and perhaps embrace.

I am the kind of person that likes everything to be wrapped in a nice and pretty bow at the end. I would have liked to know why all of this happened to the main character, Dana. Was there a reason?

It started off with Jake Gyllenhaal's opening monologue, then skipped over the rest of his show and flitted over other shows with 1-2 clips max from each. There were no other monologues. It's very much like the \\"Best of\\" shows you would see on the E channel - brief and leaving you feeling short-changed. I deeply regret this purchase.If you're looking for a particular show, go to amazon video download feature (which lets you purchase a show, though it looks like even that's edited down) or go to the SNL website which will give you A LOT more clips to see than this DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as Advertised","review":"This book has nothing to do with \\"Christ in Art\\".

You need to put a lot of pressure on the top in order to get shaved ice to come out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating!","review":"If I could give it a \\"0\\" stars I would. This piece of junk is destined for our garbage can. The machine is very slow, works sporatically and if you have children anxiously waiting for their snow-cone it is excruciating. First of all, you have press down on the top to engage the motor to shave the ice. A safety switch is supposed to turn the motor on only when the machine is in the right position. Unfortunately, this means you turn and press and move the ice and try and try to find the sweet spot where the motor will start going. At first we thought the problem was too much ice or that we overfilled the ice container but we have tried everything and the machine is just very touchy. DO NOT be fooled by the positive reviews like we were -- you will only regret it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Suck","review":"I bought this machine and the other machine (Hamilton Beach 68050 Icy Treats Ice Shaver) at the same time. This machine sucked badly. This machine was messy and slow. I made snow cone for 12 people with 68050 machine in 5 minutes. This machine took 5 minutes for 1 person. It really sucks when compared with the other machine. 68050 shaver is $10 more expensive, but it worked much better and faster. It is very easy to clean."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little ice shaver!","review":"It's very quick and easy to use! Just plug it in, put the ice in the holder (which has one sharp blade), set the top on it, and press down. It takes less than a minute to make a bowl full of fine-textured ice. The texture is closer to snow than the little ice balls you get with a lot of snow shavers. The molds have lids, so you can stack them in the freezer. It's easy to clean the ice holder and molds, but to clean the top part (which holds the motor) you must remove a bolt and wash the bolt and a metal disc by hand. It's quieter than your average blender crushing ice. I love cold treats, and this is perfect for that-- a bowl of shaved ice with a little fruit juice poured over it is VERY refreshing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It works good","review":"I like this machine it's good for hot days.

This product can easily be used by a child over the age of 6 with the supervision of an adult."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy extra cups!","review":"I love this ice shaver. I own an automatic shaver by Hamilton Beach (Icy Treats)also. The good part about this one is that the ice is much more soft and fluffy than with my other machine.

So, that is why I advise ordering several of the cups when you order the machine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Satisfied!","review":"I am very happy with this ice shaver.My only minor complaint would be it doesn't shave regular ice cubes as well as the provided ice mold.

No lumps of ice chuncks at all. I bought the Hawaiianshavedice company's syrup and it's just like home for sure. The other stuff in the stores just doesn't compare. You can use the molds included to make ice blocks, or use regular household cubes from the freezer. You can freeze coffe, juice, etc, then shave them for a special treat. I use this with my daycare kids, on family trips, or just because I miss \\"home\\". The only downfall is one ice block makes one large snowcone, so we froze a bunch of them and kept them in the freezer for when we get a crowd. Overall, I love this machine. A good buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good shaved ice!","review":"I have had my Snowman Ice Shaver for a month and really like it! Yummy shaved ice!! I use it 3-4 times a week.

The shaved ice is very thin and so fine that it melts so fast and becomes water before you can enjoy it with anything. I wanted to use the shaved ice to eat with fruit or make a dessert but by the time I mixed the ice with my fruit it was already melted and just left me with fruit soaked in water. I'm not sure how you would be able to mix the ice with syrup to even make a snow cone? This item does have a great blade to shave your ice but it is way too fine and should be more slushy (the ice does not come out to look like the image on the box at all). I was very disappointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lemon Shaver","review":"Worked first time I used it.

You can also freeze yogurt and shave that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I was looking for","review":"I was looking for a shave ice machine that was inexpensive and didn't take up too much room. The Hamilton Beach Snowman was exactly what I was looking for. I plan on using it for a preschool age birthday party, although we are also enjoying \\"practicing\\" on it. It is very simple to use. Fill up the two molds that were included and freeze them overnight. The ice \\"puck\\" pops right out and is inserted into the machine. Plug the machine in and push down on the button. The shaved ice falls down and is collected below in a container of your choosing. One \\"puck\\" makes about three shave ices. You can also use ice cubes, but the quality and ease of use are much better with the pucks. My only complaint is that I could have used a few more molds - four probably would have been perfect. You can pop the frozen pucks out and store them. I'm using ziplock bags to build up a supply of frozen pucks. Overall a good purchase and I would highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dirty little secret about this book","review":"This book would be of value to those who study disinformation. The authors assert that about 4,000 American soldiers deserted in Vietnam during the war. They presume that all these deserters were drug dealers and junkies who did not want to face the music and melted into the civilian population. This part of the book is not supported by checkable statistical sources. Anybody who ever lived in that country knows that 4,000 Americans drug users could not melt into the civilian population nor would they even want to. I saw the body parts and identifying information of one of these alleged deserters burned with gasoline in a trash barrel. He was set up to be a drug dealer. The battalion was right there mingling in the party and said nothing about the distribution of hashish and heroin that was arranged by ARVN officers. The whole battalion reeked of it. They did not desert. The author's conclusions are based on questionable sources."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read","review":"Contains many fascinating facts about our involvement.

The author is very inexperienced with eating disorders and only has her word to back up her statements. She puts down eating disorder facts that have proven to be true. The one good thing about the book is how she encourages treating victims of eating disorders with love and compassion. I think her kindness is what drew her clients. She states that her way is the only way to help anorexics which ignores the fact that people are individuals. And she ignores the fact that other therapists besides her have had a high success rate.

Killing of a pigeon as a rite of passage. Yes, the boy defies tradition but for a ten year to get a detail description of how to kill a bird is totally inappropriate for 10 year olds. I teach 5th grade and I do not want my students to read this book. I can guarantee that we will have a rash of killing in the neighborhood as a result. The story about how Phillip decides to not become a wringer is OK but did you have to put in a step by step description of what you need to do to kill a bird. I love Spinelli books but this one is a disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"wringer","review":"Palmer is a 9 year old boy who dreads his 10th birthday. In this small town, pigeon shooting day is the big event. All the men get to shoot down the pigeons. Then any pigeons that are still alive are then killed by the 10 year old boys. For most boys this is a privilege, however, to Palmer it is the worst birthday ever. Spinelli writes about peer pressure and moral problems through Palmer's different experiences. Spinelli does an excellent job showing how a young boy learns that it's alright to be different from his peers. Sometimes parents are the hardest people to address, and Spinelli does a great job showing that although parents do not seem to understand or know what is going on, they do actually. Wringer is a wonderful coming of age story. Spinelli shows Palmer finding his own voice and expressing it to the people he is afraid of most."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"tradition\\"","review":"Wringer is a good book that taught a valuable lesson; to stick with what you believe in. For example, in the end where Palmer was 10 years old and was supposed to be a wringer. He was supposed to kill the Pigeons like the other kids, but he didn't he stuck with what he believed in. That takes a lot of guts, to go against tradition"},{"rating":"2","title":"A simple but touching story:)","review":"When I first looked at the cover of Wringer, I thought it would be some kinda Stephen King-like story. But, as you can see, I was wrong. As soon as Iread the first few pages, I was hooked. Kids trying to fit in with everyone else, having to endure cruelty and taunts, and going to their parents for help as a last resort. Those are things that most kids are familiar with, thus, they can easily relate to the strong, realistic characters in this book. Another thing is that this book is fairly easy to read. No big words and no complex metaphors. Not to mention a pretty cool and eye-catching cover."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book.

It revolved around a conflict that didn't seem all that important. The main character lives in a town where they shoot pigeons to raise money for the park, and he has a pet pigeon that he keeps secret. It's not really clear why he cares so much about this bird, it's just a dumb animal. He isn't a vegetarian or anything, or at least it doesn't say so in the book. The only thing I liked in this book were some of the characters, even if they were the antagonists - Henry, Beans, and Farquar. I wouldn't like to be friends with the last two, but they were interesting enough to make me finish the book.

But he can't let his friends find out or they will twist the pigeon's neck and Palmer's. The only reason I didn't give this book one star was because one of Palmer's best friends, Beans, made the book a little funny and Beans was the only reason I didn't throw the book away.

The ethical and moral questions the book constantly keeps demanding its young readers grapple with, keep the kids with it until the end. Whenever I try and explain this book, which has become a staple in my read-aloud classroom collection, I get that look. They just can't seem to get beyond the concept of the pigeon shoot. But the kids can and they do. And they've got a lot of questions about friendship and how far one should go for acceptance. It lends itself to all kinds of critical thinking exercises. And, the blood and feathers along the way, are well worth the outcome.Chris BowenAuthor of \\"Our Kids: Building Relationships in the Classroom\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Wring it!

I was in tears by the end, and I was rooting for Palmer and his... forbidden friendships(s) the entire way of this amazing book. The characters are so deep and complex, it's hard to single out one or the other character as \\"good guy\\" or \\"bad guy\\" they all have moments where they make poor decisions and some where they do the right thing (that could be arguable for a select few). The emotions of each character really drove the story on, making it better and better. This got me going with Jerry Spinelli, and I just finished reading his book Eggs.

Yeah! 5 out of 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fantastic Book","review":"We loved the book Wringer, it was filled with suspense. The way they described things in the book was really good.

It deals with guns, children being violently cruel to each other and violently cruel to animals. It purports I know to be exposing these elements in American society as wholly undesirable but by dwelling on them and describing them in great detail it mistakenly normalizes them. I particularly disliked descriptions of children killing animals with fanatical adults urging them on, of children being violently abused by other kids and of the adult (father) not only condoning the abuse , but taking a warped machismo pride in it. The number of reviews above praising this book is extremely worrying in the context of the current wave of violence in our schools. This book can only add to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Am I the only teacher who thinks this book sucks?","review":"Read about half of this tonight as the class I'm co-teaching is going to read it next week. As the mother of a nine-year-old and a lifelong reader, I can't for the life of me comprehend how this book could be considered a classic. The premise is incredibly contrived (let's shoot pigeons that will land in the chicken salad?), the boys false, from their nicknames to \\"the Treatment\\"--it's like something from the Dead End Kids. Not a note rang true. I understand allegory, but I just found this very--unbelievable. I have to have some kind of empathy for the characters to care what happens. This was like a One Step Beyond episode--cheesy Twilight Zone imitation. I'll take Hatchet any day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wierd Book","review":"This book was okay. Very weird, though, and not one of the best books I have read. I was not that impressed by the actions of the gang, a group Palmer decided to hang out with.

Wringer is a great book. Some themes are friendship and honesty. This story is about a boy who lives in a town where people hate and kill pigeons at a yearly festival. One day, the main character, Palmer, threw cereal out the window when a bird appeared. The bird kept coming back and forth. So Palmer kept it as a pet and named it Nipper.

I recall my reading speed had improved at least 10x from the beginning of this book to the end of this book. Of course, I was till reading very slowly by the end of this book, however, to be able to read a full novel in Spanish boosted my confidence in learning this new language tremendously.

A trigger would allow the unit to stop automatically if you lost control and dropped it. However, Rotozip's pull switch makes you pull on it to start, then push it to stop. There's no safety mechanism to shut it off if you lose control. That means if you drop it while using it, you'd better get out of the way quick or expect to get a severe injury.In addition, I've had my Rotozip for about a year and use it only occasionally because of its hazards. While using it recently, much to my horror I discovered that the pull switch failed altogether! The only way I could stop it was to very carefully kick the extension cord out of the outlet!

Previous emergency lights used an incandescent bulb. This light uses a LED. This means that it will provide light for about ten hours instead of twenty minutes.2. Previous emergency lights used NiCad batteries that were soldered in place and were sometimes of odd sizes. This light uses three standard AAA rechargeable batteries of a type that can be bought at Radio Shack and easily replaced in the battery holder. All NiCad rechargeable batteries go bad eventually. Although I have sometimes soldered new batteries in the old-style emergency lights, usually bad batteries meant that the light had to be thrown away.

If you are doing a salad, chopping for a large recipe....forget it. It's only good for maybe a cup of chopped whatever-you-need at a time.

I can put in carrots, slice them into a mixing bowl, then chop onions into the same bowl, then throw in some celery and position the shooter over a second mixing bowl. It had trouble chopping things to a uniform size when I put too much material in the bowl. I just have to remember it's only made for about 2 cups of material at a time and it does a fine job.

Some of the guests appearing on this CD include Little Jimmy Dickens, Marty Stuart, Ricky Skaggs, J.D. Crowe, Paul Williams and Josh Graves.I wish there would be a DVD produced of these performances. If you like bluegrass, you will really love this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't care for it.","review":"I bought this book with another of the best resturant recipes. The resturant recipes was a winner, this one should stay with Grandma. Many of the recipes are so simple that I don't use a recipe to make them. Simple in the way that peanut butter and jelly does not need a recipe. If you can't make great mashed potatoes without a recipe, then this book is for you. One recipe says , cut up the potatoes, cut up and onion, add to pan, add garlic and sprinkle with olive oil, salt and pepper. Bake covered ,then remove foil to brown. Who would not be able to think of that without the help of a book? Secret Resturant Recipes, on the other hand, will help you master some of your favoite resturant dishes."},{"rating":"2","title":"OFTEN OVERLOOKED AND TRULY UNDERRATED!","review":"Rory Gallagher is an amazingly talented blues rocker who plays both acoustic and electric guitar, harmonica, and mandolin. This set features three of his best high-energy live recordings and one previously unreleased bootleg. Fans of Rory's will not like having to shell out their hard earned cash to purchase three CD's already in their collection just to get ahold of the bootleg, but that's the way Budda records chose to do it. Those not familiar with Rory's work will receive some excellent material.

Good stuff!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Whets your appetite for the bootlegs","review":"Most Rory fans rave about his live performances, but for a long time I preferred his studio LPs.

It is hard to fill the cups on the counter top and then carry them to the poacher without spilling.At first the cooker would shut off prematurely (after just a minute) with raw eggs inside. I had to call the 800 number to find out that you need to fill it up with water and let it boil dry with the lid off to fix this problem. It needs to have a calcium film on the bottom.

So all in all, I'd recommend this produce. For poaching, you should use regular or large eggs.

It was simple and reliable. It finally died and I couldn't find an Oster to replace it, so I bought the West Bend. It is poorly designed - too many parts and a stupid water measuring system. Its manufacturing quality is worse than the design. The buzzer that is supposed to tell you that your eggs are cooked is totally unreliable. Sometimes it doesn't buzz and other times it buzzes well before the eggs are done. Yesterday the buzzer went off five separate times before the eggs were cooked. Thus, the buzzer is useless. Very annoying that such a simple product is so bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"not happy","review":"I purchased this egg cooker about 1 1/2 years ago to replace a very old yet still working Sunbeam. I was happy with the way the product cooked eggs, both boiled and poached. However, after about a year of use, the handles on the egg tray broke off. I've tried super glue, but that doesn't hold up under the steam. To replace, it will cost another $16 and I have to buy a kit with tray, poacher, and measuring cup. I am very disappointed that the tray did not hold up as the space left by the missing handles doesn't keep a tight seal to contain the steam. Compared to other egg cookers on the market, this was not a cheap model, yet it didn't hold up to moderate usage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked Only 10 Times","review":"At first we were delighted with this cooker, but after just a few uses, one of the handles on the black tray developed a crack that leaked water on the counter.

We buy Costco eggs (which are large Grade A, and the poacher tray is simply too small for them. Then the OTHER handled developed the very same type of crack as the first one! Into the trash with it! Terrible engineering by West Bend (by the way, I added my own knob on top of the dome, which should have had one designed in!).

Thought I would write this review to save all of you from this. ...Jack"},{"rating":"1","title":"Design problems","review":"I was disappointed with this egg cooker because the design of it has a lot of problems. First, the poaching tray does not hold an egg that is considered x-large or jumbo. It barely fits a large sized egg and those spill easily too. Unless you coat it with a cooking spray, the cooked egg sticks to the tray and even then needs to be scraped out. Second, don't pay attention to the cooking instructions; it overcooks everything! Finally, my biggest complaint is the dome. Once the cooking process is completed; the dome is VERY hot and there is no way of gripping/removing it without burning yourself. Using an oven mitt does not help because the surface is slick and grabbing it from the sides allows the hot steam to burn your hands. This is an awful product. I gave it two stars because hard boiling the eggs is easier than using the stovetop, but I still have the issue of burning my hands when removing the lid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Faulty cooker","review":"After only a couple of months the buzzer indicating the eggs were done stopped working.

So if the eggs do not come out the way you like, you need to add less water to make them softer, more to make them harder; probably when the water is all gone, this causes the temperature of the heating element to rise and triggers the switch that activates the very loud alarm. You need normal or better vision and an eyedropper to fill the little plastic measuring cup to the correct level, or just keep spilling/filling/checking or getting your eye level with a dripping faucet. A few drops either way impact how the eggs come out.But really, this appliance failed after fewer than 10 uses? This is beyond 'cheaply made', just say 'China'.

Then, after only about a month of use, the timer started malfunctioning, going off when the eggs were still raw, and turning itself off even when there was still water in the unit. After having several breakfasts ruined by this unreliable appliance, I decided to order a new Oster.

The side small finger grip handles are worthless. At least my old Oster, it had a big handle/knob on top that one could use easily, even with an oven mit on.

For example, if you want to cook one egg, you fill it to the 7 mark and if you want to cook 7 eggs you fill it to the 1 mark. Anything in between is a crap shoot. The individual poached egg cups are too small and an egg will overflow and make a huge mess. And in addition to all this, the unit simply DID NOT work. Within a couple seconds of starting the cooker the buzzer started going off. Nothing I did would stop the buzzer if it was plugged in.

I used it once for pureeing & the plastic covering around the blade literally warped within minutes as if someone pushed it down, so now the plastic is at the same level as the blade, offering no protection & it allows the foods to splash everywhere. I was simply trying to blend my potatoes, carrots, etc because I make my baby's food at home. Will only buy blender with a stainless steel shaft from now on. Also, the seal above the blade doesn't fully close off & allows food to get into the shaft, which I have tried letting it soak in water & soap but was unable to get it out.

I've blended silken tofu with lemon juice and honey for a low-cal treat. Attachments have an easy-on, easy-off twist mount.

The warranty is useless since you have to pay to ship back the old product (or at least some of it) and also send a check to cover (and then some) the shipping of a replacement.

Almost every second of this movie makes me sick. Marines DO NOT conduct themselves in this manner AT ALL. Do not think for a second that the United States Marine Corps would put up with a single Marine acting in this manner much less an entire unit.If you are an Anti-American, Anti-Military, propagandist than this movie is for you.

And there is no film I'm aware of that penetrates the reality of the other side, be it civilians or insurgents, any better than this one. The incident itself was a tragedy, but certainly not one that besmirches the Marine Corps nor one that should just be ignored as another incident of war. But it is a reality of Iraq, like it or not.Not being a former Marine (I was in the Navy), I won't take up the discussion about how real they are in the film. However, this isa wonderfully constructed and technically excellent film.

The opening of the slot is large enough for a 5/16 bolt, but the slot for the head is about 1/32 too small to take a 5/16 bolt. The stuff from Peachtree is very tight, the 1/4 bolts slide in nicely but there is no slop or fear that you will pull the bolt out if you tighten it up. It's all about the same price so if you don't care about the fancy anodized gold color you will be much happier with the silver stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very sturdy and versatile.","review":"Most 3/4\\" wide T-Track is 3/8\\" deep, so it usually works well in 3/4\\" thick wood. This Incra T-Track is 1/2\\" deep and I'd want to do some testing with the specific application before I would use it in 3/4\\" stock, but it definitely works great in thicker wood. What you gain with the extra depth is the ability to use heavier mounting screws, which makes for sturdy installation. It comes with \\"#8 wood screws\\" (they look like round head #8 sheet metal screws to me) while the 3/8\\" deep T-Track requires #6 or smaller flat head screws. The ability to take 1/4\\" hex bolts and nuts makes it quite versatile. I'll certainly be buying more Incra T-Track for other projects."},{"rating":"2","title":"10 times better(...)","review":"I really don't like the idea of remaking pop songs for kids, but if I had to pick a CD, Superstar Kidz would be it. The singing on this album is much better than that of Kidz Bop. The adults are just as good as the people singing the originals. Sure the kids aren't great, but they're just kids! And anyway, they're much better than the Kidz Bop kids. These kids really know what they're singing. What I mean is that these kids don't sound like they're just singing along because they like the rythm or tune. They actually know what's a happy song and what's a sad song, and everything in between. The Kidz Bop kids sound like they're just singing for the fun of it. Sure, we want these kids to have fun singing, but it should also sound like something meaningful.(...)"},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit overpriced and too small","review":"This hat is solid but cheaply made.

You expect them to be the opposite of the way they are in the real tale, but instead they fall somewhere in between. Characters are added that have nothing to do with fairy tales.

The very nave Smitty, the main character played by Wendell Burton, goes to prison where he is totally unprepared for his harrowing experiences. I saw this movie in the theater when it was first released. I was in high school and it was a very disturbing and frightening film to sit through. Director Harvey Hart's film is brutal, harsh and very realistic. Its effect is very claustrophobic as Smitty grimly comes to the realization that there is no one to turn to and no way out of his horrific situation. This film is several years ahead of its time, engrossing but at times hard to watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"TRULY PATHETIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This has to be one of the worst movies ever made!

It covers in a clear, mathematical way in which certain pitfalls and problems may be overcome. It does not, however, teach more of the advanced methods that must be used in more complex boundary value problems.I think that a mathematician will find this book easy reading.

You mean to tell me that artists shouldn't use music as a medium to spread a message? Was N.W.A wrong for telling the world about the aubsive LAPD in the late 80's/early 90's? Any way, I doubt you actually read the book, and if you did, your mind obviously is incapable of accepting black people outside of some bubble you have put them in. Grow up, wise up and get a clue.You're an idiot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great All-Clad","review":"This product is excellent, just like the entire line. Perfect for warnming or cooking small amounts and easy clean-up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dazzling Memoir","review":"This is the most engaging book I've read in several years. Written with all the power that could be expected of an Iowa Writers Program Professor, it tells it's own story while exposing the desperate truths of all who've violently wrenched themselves out of home ground to find a life that fit. Blunt, funny, ironic and wry, its bravely openhearted look at a younger self made me look clearly at my own 20-year-old self, that I've disowned for over 35 years, and invite her back in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Farm Girl Agrees: This Book is AMAZING!","review":"As someone who grew up in the middle of nowhere I can attest to the fact that Debra Marquart's writing is spot on. She describes a very specific subculture of the U.S. (i.e., the upper Midwest) with humor, grace and uncanny truth. She gives voice to a kind of life that is rarely spoken of by those who have endured it. Her insights made me alternately crumple on the floor in tears and laugh out loud shouting \\"Yes!\\" Simply put, she gets it right. To top that, she's done her research, too; she mixes lots of interesting background information with excellent storytelling. I am giving this to all my exiled Midwestern friends for Christmas!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent memoir about growing up in the midwest in the 70s","review":"She is a gifted writer and her observations about growing up in a rural setting, love, parents, siblings, the need to flee our hometowns and the way we eventually reconcile who we are and where we came from are all spot on perfect. The book is poignant and funny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great writing","review":"DM certainly can write, no doubt about it, and it was the quality of her writing that propelled me forward. I wondered throughout if autobiographical authors realize how much of themselves they actually reveal when they take on an adventure like this. Her angst is written into every word. For me this book was a sad tragedy, the tale of a girl/woman who wanted to escape a place I consider to be one of the most beautiful places in the United States. I'm not quite sure what I make of her story, her relationship to place and her people, but (again) she sure can write."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved this book.","review":"I grew up in southwestern Minnesota, still on the plains, but not as harsh plains as the one in North Dakota that Marquart grew up on. I relish her account of growing up in a small community, knowing your place in that community, and her ruminations on it all. The book sticks with you. I found the running over the deer incident both poignant and hilarious."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing..........","review":"I too, am from the Plains--and though there were shadows of the cultures that exist there--this book was an exercise in academics-- very boring academics at that. I couldn't help but think that a therapist had asked Ms. Marquart to explore her roots and she journaled her way through that process. Then she did some 'research' and turned it into this book. Very disappointing, difficult and unmemorable.PS--How the heck do you live on a farm in the Dakota's (or in Iowa for that matter!) and not know the danger's of deer by the road? That was \\"driving 101\\" for living there......"},{"rating":"2","title":"Struck a nerve...","review":"The author was a guest on On Point on our local NPR station in Connecticut. She must have struck a nerve, because the host stated the switchboard was lit up with callers wanting to make comments on rural life. Marquart had lots of great quotes from her book and those of others that influenced her.I have not read this book beyond a few sample pages, but realize that this work opens new questions on the meaning of home, America, and life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Toaster Oven","review":"First, I have never owned a toaster oven but thought I'd give it a try. Do they all \\"tick\\" constantly...even when you aren't using the timer? This one does and it is annoying. Second, I had a piece of bread in there to toast. After 10 minutes I gave up. The bread was hot, but certainly not toasted. Third, under no circumstances are you to get even remotely close to this oven while it is on (or for that matter, 30 minutes after) as it is about as hot on the outside as it is inside. I thought it would get warm but this was hot enough to burn someone. I would be a nervous reck letting my kids (teenagers) use this (putting something on top, or even accidently touching the side). Even the front where you turn the dials is blistering hot. If you grab the dials wrong you get burned. I had it for about 30 minutes then put it back in the box to return."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"I ordered this product from amazon last year. So far I am happy with this product and no problem. Its on my daily usage for baking stuff. I like the feature to switch to broil/oven without flip the baking item.

I consider it a good product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this item","review":"I've had this toaster for a year now. If it weren't a gift, sent from out of town, I would have returned it along time ago. It barely toasts at all and now most of the functions do not work at all. The heating element above is dead so it won't broil and it only toasts one side of the bread. I am hunting around for a new toaster oven before this makes it to the trash heap. I hope there is one out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"great toaster oven","review":"This toaster oven does a great job with all tasks, toasting, baking, broiling. The controls are easy to use. I like that the door lifts up rather than swinging down. And it is a perfect fit for my small counter. The only thing that's a problem is the crumb tray. It has to be removed from the back of the oven. And if anything large falls through the toasting rack, it won't come out through the crumb tray. And the toasting rack is not removable so you have to wrestle a fallen item up through the rack."},{"rating":"1","title":"broken after 1 year","review":"This Hamilton Beach 6-slice toaster oven has never worked very well -- only toasted one side, so I had to always flip the bread to toast both sides. Broil doesn't work as only the bottom elements get hot.Now, after 1 year, the timer/start knob has stopped working -- it goes from timing the toasting right on to the keep warm setting, without turning off. I now have to keep the toaster unplugged when not in use, and time the toasting with my kitchen timer. Since the timer is also the on/off switch, there is no option to just toast without the timer.Piece of junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"After 3 months will go in trash","review":"After 3 months of use the door hinge stuck and the glass came apart from the frame. If I could I'd give it a zero star rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"Bought this unit and found it could not heat. Exchanged it for a second unit and it has the same problems. Baking is not possible because an oven temp guage shows it going all over the place. All the other heating settings for broil and toast are unreliable. The heat it gives off on its top can burn the underside of a cabinet. This product should be recalled."},{"rating":"1","title":"Toaster that doesn't toast","review":"It's impossible to toast with this unit. The \\"light\\" and \\"dark\\" icons on the timer are not accurate so you need to guess where to set it. Even worse is you either burn the bottom or the top is untoasted. There are several rack tracks but there is no combination of rack tracks or rack \\"up\\" or \\"down\\" setting that will place the toast midway between the top and bottom elements. I am in Quality Assurance and whoever designed and tested this unit should be fired."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy It","review":"I can deal with having to set each of the three knobs each time I want to bake, broil or toast something, but the way this product works overall is not acceptable. Despite the three knobs, your choices of \\"done-ness\\" are either \\"not done\\" or burnt. As far as toasting goes, your choices are partially toasted (only on one side) or cremated. You'd have better results holding your toast over one of the burners on your stove. Same concept. I've tried moving the rack. I've tried different settings. Same thing. It does a so-so job baking. As a toaster, it's awful."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is a great children\`s book for all ages!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I wish I could read it forever its such a great book!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent reading","review":"I have been looking for this book for days and couln't remember the name thanks for the info I plan to buy this book so I can share it with my four children.It brings back memories and it was my favorive book as a child and plan to read it again and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a wonderful book for little girls with imaginations","review":"I read this book when I was in 4th grade and I loved it.

It failed in about 1 year. When I called about the warranty, they wanted me to return it via post at my expense for repairs. After some dispute, they finally agreed to cover the cost of shipping. They replaced the kettle with a new one. It lasted 6 months. We were told it would not be covered under warranty so my husband took it apart. The wireing in the base was the problem. It had melted the plastic base before quitting all together. We felt lucky it hadn't started a fire in our house."},{"rating":"1","title":"like the design but function unreliable","review":"After using a different stainless steel electric kettle for several years, I pulled my TWO old CJK 17BC's out of the attic to unclutter my house. Both had problems when I put them in the attic, but both are on their best behavior during the test run.After reading the other reviews I realize that they need to go into the rubbish bin, afterall. I hate that because I love the design. It is very attractive for an electric kettle. I searched and compared many to find a design that I liked. Both CJK's had problems with the lid release - but I like the design. I think the problem is the quality of the plastic parts to the lid. One had problems with being reliable as far as maintaining contact with the base, turning it around would restart it, momentarily. It is kind of spooky that they both just worked fine, a few minutes ago, but I don't trust them.The one I'm using now is not as nice to use, and kind of ugly, but so far, has been reliable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Product","review":"The first kettle I bought would not automatically shut off. It eventually melted the base. The replacement kettle has now developed a leak around the fill indicator. I would recommend NOT purchasing this kettle. I am off to buy another brand this morning.

It died completely in 3 months. Cuisinart charged $10 shipping and handling, saying they would replaced. However, for the next 3 months, they kept telling me it was on \\"back order.\\" It turns out that this model has been discontinued. I just called Cuisinart asking why they told me this has been discontinuied when Amazon is selling them - the answer was that Amazon must have bought a lot before they were discontinued, but they have in fact been discontinued. So don't waste your time buying this. Electric kettles are great, but this one is a very flawed product that Cuisinart won't stand behind. I feel sorry for the person whose review says they bought it in reliance on the 3-year warranty. I WILL NEVER BUY ANYTHING FROM CUISINART AGIN."},{"rating":"1","title":"$30 per month - so not worth it","review":"Our old electric kettle, after about six years of daily service, stopped functioning. My wife and I did some research and settled on this one, partly because of its size, appearance, and the Cuisinart reputation. On November 12 of 2009 we ordered one through Amazon. Today, 30 January 2010, it ceased functioning. When I turn it on the little indicator light turns on for about ten or twenty seconds, then it turns off. It seems that the thermostat has malfunctioned.It's interesting how this disappointment has affected us.

We didn't have any lid issues or leak issues the way some reviewers had. We used it every morning, we used it every evening. And then, slowly, it started to die.The issue, as described in other reviews, is how the kettle makes electrical contact with the base. In our case it seemed that the kettle was merrily heating up the water, and then it would stop (the indicator light would be off) and then turn on again. It did this for a while, and then stopped working entirely. We had had the kettle for just over a year.But I looked at other kettles at LnT and they all seemed to have more or less the same kind of base/kettle connector, so I thought I would try again with Cuisinart. Oh well, poor me! It completely failed without warning less than three months after purchase.For a product in this price range by a reknowned housewares company, I expect MUCH better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT, QUICK, EASY TO FILL!

Now imagine it rotating so that you can pour it - your hand is now direcly above the stream of steaming water. Sure, any kettle will have that problem to some extent (excepting the dispensing sort), but this one is particularly scary.2) The base is made of a fairly weak plastic.

You build a complete application from the ground up, which lends to putting the concepts you learn to use in the workplace. This is a very practical book and the author is a gifted teacher."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book for Intermediate users","review":"Rather than presenting Visual Basic as a logical grouping of topics centered on the Visual Basic language, this book takes you through the development of an ENTIRE application from start to finish! No other VB book has done that! It is like having a professional developer sitting right next to you showing the development process all the way. I gave this book 4 stars only because it say's it is for beginners only. This is NOT a book for novices; it is a book for intermediate users. Once you read a book or two on VB pick this one up. It will teach you from a well-rounded angle and approach..."},{"rating":"1","title":"visual is not the word","review":"apparently the writer has no idea how to explain programming for the beginner, the book arrived fine as for the instruction on how to program is less than instructional for the absolute beginner. go and find a bookstore that caters to computer programmers and geeks and ask around before you buy a self teaching programming book for the beginner as yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"missing parts","review":"This is generally a very good look at how to build an application. It lacks details in the book which are on the disc though, so can be a little obscure if you get the book with no disc. You would have to fill in many parts in that case."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a beginners book","review":"I have just started learning Visual Basic. It has been many many years since I did some programming in Fortran and Basic so I consider myself a beginner. I got my introduction with \\"Learn to Program with Visual Basic 6\\" by John Similey. So I guess I'm spoiled. Visual Basic 6 from Scratch very quickly uses words and phrases that have not been defined. I know that these phrases are known by every programmer but a beginner needs help. Thus I rate this book low for use by beginners. I suspect it will be good after I have had a little more experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book","review":"I gave it a 4 due to trouble with some code found in the book. There are times when the code is missing parts or it's entirely non-existent. It's a good thing for the cd code, since one has to go back through it to find why parts aren't working. But I liked the project the book takes you through. It's a great way to learn by building an entire working application from start to finish, rather than just a bunch of small code snippets and useless program widgets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Visual Basic 6 from Scratch","review":"If you are new to Programming don't waste your money on this book.

For me,the most valuable suggestion from this book has been to \\"branch out\\" and try unusual designs. Dyan Peterson's style (earthtones, natural designs and embellishments) is what originally attracted me. I'm not one for santas and cute pumpkins--these projects are somewhat more art than craft-oriented. I highly recommend this to seasoned gourd crafters who want to try something new, or to artists like myself who are interested in painting, sculpture and pottery and are looking for a new medium (an addicting one at that!) to experiment with. As Dyan Peterson would say, Happy Gourd Days!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A GREAT book on the art of \\"Gourdology\\"","review":"This was the very first book that I bought on Gourds and it gave me the inspiration and confidence to begin in the medium.

The last job I did was repairing a broken DVD drive in a Dell laptop. The disassembly process was involved and time consuming. In the process, an aluminum keyboard tray separated from the plastic base it was glued to (the original adhesive just gave up). I purchased this glue and applied liberally, then left it with some weight on top overnight. The aluminum is now firmly adhered to the plastic base again, and the owner claims it feels more solid than when he bought it. No way to tell if the glue will last five years like the factory adhesive, but it was certainly cheaper than replacing the laptop, and the owner is very happy. Well worth the money spent.The product did expand some during drying, so be careful how much you apply. I easily pared off the excess that came out from under the metal surface with a sharp knife."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great stuff.","review":"Not much to be said, aside from this being awesome glue.Read the instructions and warning before use and you'll be fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"not good!","review":"Dries very slow! although the sticker says dries 2x faster. oh, c'mon, takes forever, and then often leaves that white foam...not happy with the product.And yes, this is not the first glue I am using in my life and I know how glue should work."},{"rating":"1","title":"gorilla glue","review":"This glue is ok but dries up in 2 oz. bottle after one use.

I needed glue to reinforce a heel on my shoe. I went to my local Walgreens and could not decide between Gorilla Glue or Super Glue. I unfortunately choose Gorilla Glue which proclaims to be for \\"the toughest jobs on planet Earth\\". I followed the directions, used a clamp and let the glue set overnight(instead of two hours like instructed).The glue's bond came apart after 4 hours.

Before then, it was the favorite sled of the day."},{"rating":"1","title":"popped on the first time using it","review":"I also had my sled pop on the first day out. I was sledding over packed snow with no branches or bushes in the way and it just popped (it was about a 1 foot tear so the patches could not save it). The sled also had a taco shape to it when fully inflated so the quality is very low. I think that the plastic is to thin on this sled."},{"rating":"1","title":"Popped 2nd time down hill, \\"repair kit\\" useless","review":"My 10 year old twins went down a snowy hill twice. They loved the tube, but it popped second time down. We went home, got out the \\"repair kit\\" which is no more than a piece of tape. Bit of poetic license with the term \\"repair kit\\", I guess. So we taped the hole. Pumped it up. Tape fell off. Kids went back to using their regular sleds, and we all agreed that we hadn't seen anything so cheesy in quite awhile. It was a birthday gift from my girlfriend to my kids, and J, if you're reading this - it didn't last long, but it still was a really sweet gift to give my boys. FYI - in addition to the wonderful repair tape, I have tried a bicycle patch which won't stick to the shiny plastic, no matter how much I first scuff it up. My next thought is packing tape. Wish us luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"This item coming out of the box was very nice. However just one trip down an icy hill and the sled had a hole in it.

Seems it was made after Molly was sort of growing up a bit - she probably wanted to do something for teens, only a little more serious.The young couple were really very sweet, and I could relate to it - the way that tough times do test love, once the innocent feelings of romance are harshly knocked out of the way by the urgent realities of life.But of course, when it came to the crunch, love conquered all. Cynics may find that unrealistic, but you gotta remember, every now and then, even on earth, young love can last! Awwwww..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Teen Struggle & Love","review":"For Keeps where shall I start. For Keeps is one of those 80's movies that would fit perfect on The Lifetime Network. Molly Ringwald stars as Darci Elliot and Randall Batinkoff stars as Stan Bobrutz (intentional hard to spell and pronoucne name, it is the butt of several jokes in the film). The two high school sweethearts are sent fast forward into adult hood when Darci becomes pregnant. They struggle to stay together. I think this film is great because it shows young people just how hard things can be when you introduce a baby into the picture. It is not one of those happily ever after stories, Stan and Darci go through some real hard times. The movie itself takes a real awkward turn towards the end with Darci pushing Stan to pursue his dreams without his knowledge, but the movie will entertain those in 6th grade and up. Its a bit pricey but it is good for educational use and for the 80's fan building their collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great little trip back in time","review":"For when you need a little Molly Ringwald fix that 16 candles just won't satisfy.

Both were designed to enhance the morale of French nationals, either civilians at home or Free French at war. Both movies are short,in French, and subtitled. Quite frankly, neither is particularly good if compared with Hitchcock's artistic/commercial films, including those, like Shadow of a Doubt, made during WWII. But as propaganda they are quite watchable and effective. Voyage is about WWII in Madagascar, which is something about which I--and I would imagine most others, even those interested in WWII--was totally unfamiliar, and accordingly increases my interest. I consider these films well worth seeing."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!","review":"I second the first review written about this product. Great concept, but horrible product. Not enough in the can to do two full legs and under arm areas. Does not spray well when aiming for the back of legs or upside down. Clogs up and doesn't function properly to spray continuously and evenly. 3 minutes is not long enough to remove hair, but yet your skin is on fire. I was covered with red spots that grew into welts over both legs. Any where the cream had been on my skin was a large red welt that did not itch, but burned. The welts and burning sensation lasted for 5 days after till I could get in to see my dermatologist. I could not shave after using this product and I could barely touch my legs to put on any body lotion. Forget about the under arm area. I was in such discomfort it was hard to put deoderant on. I could not even wear pants to work because the fabric rubbing my legs sent me through the roof. Horrible, horrible experience. I would not recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"This product is poop.","review":"Well, once you spray it, you can barely breathe it smells so bad. I sprayed it on my legs, and it was burning but I decided to take it like a man. My legs got rashy redness on them. Then, I sprayed it on my armpits, cause nobody likes the gray look you have on your pits after you shave. I decided to do it because it is supposed to dissolve the hair. I lifted my arms up, so it wouldn't rub off, and there was a terrible burning sensation on my right armpit. Then, the pain got so bad, that I washed the stuff off and looked at my armpit and there was a bleeding crack in it. I washed it off my legs too after that and the hair was halfway gone, and halfway there still. Please do not get this product. The crack looks like a fault line and I call it my earthquake. Makes good memories but I have to avoid putting deodorant on it and I smell a little stinky. Yeah, it caused me problems, so there you go."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst ever","review":"It was the worst product I have ever used. It took a lot of spraying to cover my legs... a lot of fumes that it made it hard to breathe... it was very hard to keep the tube straight and spray... and 3 minutes are not enough. First I was excited about the idea of a spray but now I think it was a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL product","review":"This is the first online review I have ever written. I purchased this and was excited about being about to spray it on with no mess.It was awful!!! I sprayed it on in the shower. The product was not drip free. It dripped horribly and didn't stay put on my skin/hair. Also, it didn't spray evenly and was hard to reach the back side of my legs. I rinsed it off after a minute and went back to Veet.BE CAREFUL! Like the other reviewer said, it will leave your shower incredibly slippery.

No hair came off.Drip-free spray for legs, body, arms and more is what it says on the can. After spraying it on it clump up in one area on my body waited 3 mins. showered off still had hair were the clumps were. I had no redness or bumps i'm thankful for that. After I showered it off I got my Gillette Venus Vibrance and some shaving gel and went to work.This was done only in 3 or 4 minutes.

When my electric razor broke, I decided to try it. I have weird allergies and usually react to stuff marked hypoallergenic, so I was nervous about using this brand because I can't use Sally Hansen makeup. However, I was pleased to find out that this might be the ONLY hair remover that I'm not allergic to. I'm so glad I found it because of that.However, here's the problem. The can was only enough to do my calves and my pits. Yes, I accidentally sprayed some on my bathroom wall, but still, that's not very much. What's worse is I used it on Thursday night and by Monday morning I had noticeable hair growth again. At first I thought this might just be because I left it sitting too long, but after reading all the other reviews, I now know that's not the answer.So, basically, this is a nice product because I'm not allergic to it, but there's not enough and it doesn't even last all that long. Quite a bummer."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst product ever","review":"This was really the worst product ever and I could't agree more with rest of the negative reviews...I wish there was an option to give 0 stars...It stinks, tub gets slippery, it doesn't do its job.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Impressed","review":"I have to say that this is not a product worth spending money on. The can says \\"Last days longer than shaving\\" which is a lie, because the hair grew back at the same pace as regular shaving would. Stung like crazy, smelt terrible, don't try it in your basement, because the smell will stink up the whole floor even if you did it in your bathroom with a closed door. Don't waste your money on this product!! I would recommend TRIA, a laser-type hair remover. To look further into it, go to triabeauty.com."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ineffective, smelly, and potentially hazardous","review":"This product simply didn't work. I used it per package directions, leaving it on the maximum 10 minutes. It damaged my leg hair, but didn't remove any of it. The odor was unpleasant and lingered despite running an exhaust fan and disposing of or cleaning everything it touched. I also find it potentially hazardous because it can pose a fall risk. It instructs the user to apply it in the shower or tub. It makes the tub/shower surface so slippery that it will present a fall risk even to a healthy, mobile individual. I have arthritis, so I'm very careful in the tub and shower. After applying the product to the first leg, the tub was so slippery that I had to get out. I ended up switching bathrooms so that I could shower safely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"I thought since I was in Iraq that I should invest in a shaving cream that would be easy to remove hair.

I am normal sized 5'6\\" and 135 lbs. and to spray both legs well that was all that was in the can. Secondly, it never fully removed the hair and I left it on for 5 minutes plus. Thirdly it truly stinks and the smell takes forever to go away! Lastly, whatever it got off, grew back within 2 days so it was almost no better than shaving.Don't waste your money or time unless you like standing in the shower for 10 minutes barely being able to breathe for the smell, hoping it will work!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT I REPEAT DO NOT GET THIS","review":"I got this thinking it would be better than some of the other USB missile launchers. I was horribly wrong. It looks cool, and has laser sighting and stuff, but the firing power is atrocious. It can't even hit a target 5 feet in front of it because the missile drops off before that point. In addition, the ON/OFF switch was missing and the battery compartment had no metal to connect the batteries to, which leads me to believe that the firing power would be better if there was some way to put in batteries.

However, the actual book read like journalist's notes- just a dry recounting of facts and timelines.

To me, Mr. Brink manipulated Pud into having a mortal injury as a way of getting Gramps to \\"cross over\\". Before this happened, Mr. Brink told Pud that his grandfather would be a burden to him if he continued living. These scenes were cruel and could manipulate the audience into believing that Gramps had a duty to die.

The hole for the aftermarket head unit was almost an inch too small on each side. Then to my added frustration there was no way that the din/pocket compartment in the lower was able to be attached. It was as if they expected you to somehow get the unit in after trimming and then just sort of stick the pocket in there. I was not happy and didn't want to deal with it any more or take the chance of trimming incorrectly and mess up. I also hated how the pocket wouldn't attach to anything.

I like that there is still a bit of a rim on the dish to hold the food in. The fact that they are not plastic is a plus, since plastic pet food dishes can become scratched and hold in bacteria and smells.

Necessarily Brody has had to pick examples to prove his thesis and some scholars might question whether these were carefully chosen to support a pre-formed theory.

For anyone who likes the English village mystery with a bit of a modern twist, this series fits the bill. Ms. Granger has a wonderful sense of humour and her characters are believable and likeable. The plot moves along nicely, and the mystery is always just a little hard to figure out. The relationship that is developing between Meredith and Alan is developed nicely with each story, and as they work together to try to solved tricky mysteries it is fun to see their relationship grow. These characters are very realistic! This book is about the death of a local woman in the wine cellar of a newly renovated hotel in Markby's area. Markby has to go a long way back in history to figure this one out, but Meredith is also there to help him get to the right answer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Loop Tuning Guidelines","review":"This book is worth it's price for Connell's explanation of loop tuning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible smelling product","review":"It took me 2 days and this product smell is not out of my hair.

I was very disappointed to see that it really only covers larger houses which already have space available. All the pictures show rooms with high to very high ceilings, entrance ways, and alot of open space. Unfortunately, I think, that the average house is much smaller, with less room to work with & lower ceilings, not every place has utility rooms, verandas or entrance ways to utilize. Even the bathrooms were larger than most I've seen. Also, many houses do not even have very much extra wall space due to small room dimensions, windows, doorways & possibly a fireplace. Try to work around that - that's what I was expecting to see, I guess, more variety in the types of homes.

It is true that Susannah was excellently sung and in ensembles, her voice was the only one that was reliable and the one to be listened for. On the other hand, the other 3 singers in the main quartet (Figaro, Count, Rosina) were not accurate either in pitch or rhythm. I agree with the other review that this Susannah is terrific, but if you want a decent production that is excellent musically then choose either of the other versions with Alison Hagley as Susannah. While she may not be a better singer than this one, the other 3 principle singers are excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looks nice.","review":"A nice looking mousepad, good and thick.

Other brands with cross-hatched elements clog up and short out in a few days -- worthless. Other Flowtron units burn out in heavy thunderstorms, and Flowtron does not respond well to warranty claims (they want an exorbitant fee for a new bulb, even though the original bulb is perfectly good). I stumbled onto this model at a going-out-of-business sale. The (normal) fan noise, with occasional zaps, is much less intrusive than constant zapping of others. More importantly, it survives the weather and springtime swarms of midges, zillions of them, that used to pile up an inch thick even on other Flowtron units. Perhaps because the fan helps keep the elements clear, this has lasted through three years of continuous night-time use (it's connected to a photocell switch) until finally the fan started howling. Unfortunately, the warranty is only two years.

If you like John Wayne then you will like this one. The plot was much the same as in most of his early movies, where he was trying to break out of his western image and offering a more leading man plot. That said it's still the same script as other early John Wayne movies only changing the setting and leading lady. He still is the hansome hero who saves the day against all odds. He has not began to offer his later moral or political views but it is still good over evil and he gets the heroin in the end then leaves.

I believe this book is out of print for the simple reason that it would mean the destruction of America as we know it. I was also surprised to find that it was published in 1970.

I rented this movie so me and my friends could make fun of it but there was little to make fun of it was just bad. This movie really couldn't get any worse. Apparently the people making the film were very inconsistent because several scenes that were spliced together had the actresses switching places or wearing different or less clothing/jewelry. I was amazed that this movie has even been compared to HSM because all Bratz tries to do is copy HSM, which it did a horrible job of.

You have to be an idiot to not know how it ends. The movie was highly unrealistic, I mean what school is ruled by cliques, and what girl has an elephant at a party? The movie is very stupid, predictable, and the cast is basically composed of unknown stars who probably are doing nothing now. What genius thought that it would be cool to make a movie off the stupid doll company which portrays a anorexic, skanky version of what a girl should look like.

My son really likes it and has played with it a ton. I only have 2 issues with it. First, the rug doesn't stay in place. I've tried several surfaces and it still travels all over the place! Second, it seems as if the print of the rug is on a roll- so when they make it, they just roll out the necessary length and make the rug. So this means the print of the rug isn't necessarily what you get. I was excited to have a couple roundabouts and a couple soccer fields. Well, our roundabout is in the middle, and so we only have 1. It's just a bit different than I thought it would be. But my son has no clue about any of this- he just plays with it and loves it! So the positives definitely outweight the negatives.

However, you need to keep in mind that LoJack is only going to request your local detective do something about it. You have to ask yourself, \\"If the police know the phone# that is calling in are they going to act on it?\\" Their thinking is, \\"Even if we do we cannot make a case on who exactly is using it so why put any effort forth.\\" As a result, I had to really push to keep LoJack communicating with the detective and push the detective to look into it.

If it doesn't ever call in, they don't have to pay. But, since they've blocked you from seeing the call-in logs after its reported stolen, you have to take their word for it.I have no direct knowledge that they have withheld information to avoid paying claims, but the way it is set up provides every incentive for them to do exactly that and no way for you to verify what they're telling you.Based on my experience, I'd say save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!","review":"I bought the three year contract for my son's Mac laptop, It was stolen at a New Year's party and so far there hasn't been much support from Absolute or the police.

The creature keeps talking to the host and you hear the conversations as she goes between thoughts of sucide and mothers love for the alien inside her body.The creature in the womb needs blood to survive so many bloody murders follow as the mother and creature head to the sea where the creature says he must live.There is nudity,much blood and a crazy story.everything modern horror fans will love.I highly recommend theis movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"aWSOME","review":"This brings a very human side to a person who asually plays a mute character.

Within these answers are some hilarious stories about everyone from Kevin Smith regulars (Jason Mewes, Ben Affleck, etc.) to other celebrities (Prince, Jon Peters, Tim Burton, etc.). There's also obviously a good amount of background on all of Smith's movies up until \\"Jay & Silent Bob Strike Back.\\" It's a good look inside Smith as not only a film-maker, but also a person. There aren't any extras on the DVD, except for a few trailers. If you're a hardcore fan, worth the $25. If you're a casual fan, good to rent from Netflix or plop down $10-15 on a used copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"a MUST OWN for the View Askew Fan","review":"This is absolutely priceless. Kevin Smith candidly telling some HYSTERICAL stories from his movies, personal life, friends, and family. Considering the company involved, this is gold.

He tells stories about his life that are hilarious. I didn't even mind the fact that he had one of the dirdiest mouths I've ever heard, he was just so funny!The best stories he tells are:1) The story behind the ill-fated \\"Superman Reborn\\" (for which Smith was commissioned as writer);2) Filming a religious documentary for Prince, and;3) When he and his wife joined a protest of his own film (\\"Dogma\\").While this is definitely not for younger children, any fan of Smith's work will definitely enjoy this.Grade: A+"},{"rating":"2","title":"Been there..heard it..it was great","review":"I personally saw Mr. Smith at IU in Indiana when they filmed this last year..if his other performances where half as good as it was at IU YOU MUST BUY THIS DVD!

The first two books managed to be cute AND have a plot. This one seems to have been phoned in. I would have given it another star, but it really did not deserve to be in hardback. There is already another one slated to come out in hardback and I will wait for the paperback... and I probably won't be in a rush for that one either. For wacky, stick with Katie MacAlister, for off-beat, Charlaine Harris (worth the hardback price), for funny and sensual, Sherrilyn Kenyon, for dark and over the top sex, Laurell K. Hamilton, for a bit of everything, Kelley Armstrong. MaryJanice Davidson needs a little work... and a plot."},{"rating":"2","title":"still going","review":"So my interest in the series is still going. This book was alittle abrupt, I think it was to make room for a book 4 to come out without too much time lapsing. That is just my opinion though. I enjoyed it enough to read on to book 4."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just eh. Passable","review":"Kinda disappointing, especially since Betsy is becoming more whiny, airheaded, and more unrealible person (save for the fiends), as opposed to the flighty spunky, common-sense yet sarcastic wit of a character we saw in the first two books. More and more becoming a real dumb-dumb blonde than blonde with a brain and shoe fetish. Seems like everything is becoming a fetish and flight of fancy for main character. Too bad characters are becoming more and more superficial in this book, rather than being fleshed out. Main character is a former secretary-model, and secretaries, by nature, are smart people who have much common sense and street smarts, but the you'd think she was only a model in her former life. If there rating were available in .25 increments, I'd have given it a 1.75-- so I rounded up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring book - no plot","review":"UGH!

A must have for fans of Queen Betsy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"When I picked up this book I was delighted, especially if it were like the other 2 books - Undead and Unwed and Undead and Unemployed. Oh, how I loved and adored Queen Betsy and found her ditzyness to be hilarious- in the other 2 books.This book brought much disappointment to me - I felt that it did not have a real plot to the story and it was going no where fast. The story of Betsy and her stepmother is getting old to me. They fight - we get that! They hate each other - we get that! Lets get something else please - something totally unrelated to the stepmother.While I would recommend Undead and Unwed - that one is hysterical!! I would not waste my time again by reading this book. It went no where fast and continued going no where.Please go back to developing the characters and DIFFERENT situations that Betsy the vampire queen can get herself into trouble - I am really bored with the family drama - an \\"undead\\" girl should just be able to get over and move on with her undead life."},{"rating":"1","title":"loved the first one","review":"even though there were times betsy was a tad too crude. but the crassness was offset by genuine laugh-out-loud humor, great characterizations, and a wonderfully satiric attitude toward the vampire genre.i didn't think the second was quite as good, but still worth reading.this one...well, aside from it being rushed (at about the speed of light), it's really hard to believe someone forgives having their throat torn open, not to mention some of the other episodes. and while some of the other plot devices showed promise, they were pretty superficial. this may be what happens when an author publishes two novels in less than a year.also, by this time, betsy should be growing a bit.i've cancelled the pre-order on the next book--perhaps when it comes out in paperback, i'll try it used."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another hilarious book","review":"MaryJanice Davidson has done it again with her tremendously funny blend of the supernatural and humour."},{"rating":"1","title":"Downhill from here","review":"The first two books were silly fluff, with a largely unlikeable heroine but enough of a quirky setup that I was interested to read on. Train stops here, though.Betsy becomes even more shallow, pigheaded and crass, if that's possible. Everyone else operates as spokes on her self-centered little wheel. Plot points are brought up only to be left as loose ends. Betsy's half-sister seems to be a plot thread, except that there's no real event or resolution involving her. Sinclair's an idiot who is apparently brain-dead, to be attracted to this infant Betsy. This entire book was just filler, with nothing happening of any consequence and no character developing in any way. I hit the end and couldn't believe the author published something so half-baked.Put a stiletto through her heart, she's done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Started out as a promising series & quickly turned into mindless fluff","review":"The first book was wonderful, quirky & funny. It quickly became obvious that the author took advantage of its popularity and divided what should have been the next single book in the series into 2 books. The author filled these 2 books with so much mindless fluff and avoided the plot line so completely that I quickly decided there was no point in purchasing any more books in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The first two books in this series were funny, well written and although read very quickly, well worth waiting for. This, the third in the series, unfortunately seemed rushed and 'thin' on plot and characters. They are not large literary works, they are fun, happy books with a twist however, the author seems to be slipping, possibly complacent or bored? Shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"MaryJanice, what happened????","review":"The first two Betsy Taylor books were short but packed with humor and action. I've re-read them both several times, and still love them. This one? It seems like she whipped it off in less than a month, and didn't put the care and craftsmanship into it that she did the others. The plot is thin, the characters far less developed, and the book is overall a disappointment, especially in light of how excellent her first two Vampire Queen books were. Sadly, the fourth book in the series, Undead and Unreturnable, is even worse. I advise anyone wanting to read either Unappreciated or Unreturnable to get them from the library--they are not worth buying. Try Kim Harrison's Dead Witch Walking instead, or Katie McAlister's You Slay Me if you want something lighter, and hope that MJD gets her act together and starts writing well again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait for the paperback","review":"Like most of the people writing these reviews, I loved the first two books in this series. When I found out the 3rd was coming out in hardcover I was a little surprised.Well, I bought it and all I can think of was \\"I paid how much for this?\\" I couldn't believe how air -headed and very spoiled Betsy has become. She basically doesn't think throughout the entire story. While there were still funny parts, I almost had to force myself to finish this book. Ms. Davidson usually does much better than this.So, if you must have a copy, like I said in my title, wait for the paperback version."},{"rating":"1","title":"JUST ANOTHER TOO STUPID TO LIVE HEROINE","review":"I'm through with reading Davidson. I kept hoping some potential would start appearing in her stuff, but have given up hope. The female lead is stupid, the male lead all knowing, the secondary characters annoying. And let me just say here, Sex in the City was a wildly amusing show but it did women NO FAVORS when it comes to portraying them as incredibly shallow, fashion-and-shoe-obsessing idiots. Now, due to the show's popularity, everyone and her sister is writing about shoes! Give me a break! That was funny a few times on the show (and even that got old!). That's OVER NOW! I've decided it must be asking too much of JD to give us a clever plot line and female lead. She must be incapable of it, so I won't be trying anymore!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wicked Pleasure","review":"Although the vampire section of my personal library is usually serious and seemingly realistic, i.e. The Vampire Huntress series by L.A. Banks, I decided to investigate vampire chick lit. I was not disappointed with Undead and Unappreciated.I didn't read the previous novels in the Betsy Taylor series but I was still able to keep up with the life or should I say \\"unlife\\" of the ditzy progtagonist, Betsy the Vampire Queen.Oh, the perils of Betsy: she's running a night club and her vampire workers are on strike, she discovers she has a half sister (who's literally the devil's spawn) and sets out to find her, and she's hot for the King of the Vampires.Nice formula. Witty and entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"lighthearted","review":"I love the series. I got it as gift to bring up friend's spirit. Of course she loved them.Worked like a charm."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not everyone can write awesome books every time out","review":"I was entertained for a couple hours, but felt like the book was just lacking. Maybe because this book was a hardback, I had greater expectations. I feel a bit ripped off, because even as a small hardback, the pages had large margins and large print. This would even make a tiny paperback.As much as I look forward to the books in the \\"Undead\\" series, I would be happier to wait a little bit longer if it meant I got a story that was more fleshed out. I have grown to embrace all the characters in the series, and felt that this book did a disservice to them.Despite that, I am still looking forward to the next one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Undead and Unappreciated","review":"This book was just as good as the previous ones in this series. Any fan of Mary Janice's Davidson's will love this book. You can't help feel sorry for Betsy's \\"consort\\" Eric Sinclair, as you can tell he really cares about her and Betsy doesn't really pay attention to him (unless she gets an \\"itch\\"). I really enjoyed this lastest book and can't wait until the next one comes out in October."},{"rating":"1","title":"Undead and unfullfilling","review":"It was nice to read as a continuation of the plot, but it probably could have been skipped. The only thing this book added was Betsy's sister, daughter of the devil, and that only superficially.There was the normal \\"Kill Betsy\\" attempt, but no great advancement in the story line. It was a real disappointment. Hopefully the next one has more to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"enjoyable bit of fluff","review":"I did enjoy Undead and Unappreciated. Betsy is possibly starting to grow up a bit, some of the things that I found very grating indeed in the first book have stopped (all that name-calling...), and of course, reading about the shoes is always fun. :) The high point of this book is dropping in on some familiar and beloved characters, just to see what they're up to.On the other hand, this short little book should have been published in paperback. It's just not long enough or complex enough to justify hardback, a move which screams that the publisher is trying, rather crassly, to cash in on the success of this series. That's a shame. The content of the book isn't even dense enough for a short story, hence the two stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dead-ly boring","review":"I am so disappointed. The first 2 in the series were absolutely hilarious. They moved quickly, were witty and highly entertaining. Even my brothers were in stitches, laughing at the shoe humor and all. This one is a shadow of the style from the first ones. It's as though someone was imitating Ms. Davidson's style, and falling woefully short. I pre-ordered this and the next in the series but I think I might cancel the order for the next. If you haven't gotten any of these yet, definately get the first 2 and bypass this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little short","review":"I would normally give MJD a five star, but this book was very short and did not have much plot to it. It was still worth buying and reading, but the one coming out later this year should be more informative."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed ..","review":"I loved the first two books in this series. They were fun and different. This installment seemed rushed and not well thought out. It is an all right read but it is nothing compared to the first two books. I missed the Betsy flavor, the tongue in check goods times. It was darker, less interesting, and the author seemed bored.Perhaps, I expected too much I have been waiting on the next installement for a very long time.Still readable but not great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the story????","review":"I have to admit I may feel this way because I've started in the middle of the series but this book just felt like filler... like the author needed to get a book out and this is what we got.

The songs are all very smooth and just seem to flow right out at you, yet still have that great beat that is the trademark of the Braxton Brothers. Some of the smoother songs include \\"Don't Stop\\", \\"Blue Sands\\", \\"Tonight\\" and \\"Anything for You\\". While those songs having a good beat include \\"I Want You for Myself\\", \\"When You Touch Me\\", and \\"Rollin\\". There are two songs which feature vocals \\"It's You\\" and \\"Love is Crazy\\". \\"It's You\\" has it all. It's soft with a good beat and romantic lyrics. \\"Love is Crazy\\" isn't all that bad, but it really didn't do much for me. This cd is definitely worth checking out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Interesting","review":"This is an interesting and informative book.

I heartily recommend both tools.The axe is as lightweight as advertised, and the handle is likewise as durable as claimed (I overshot once and hit the handle with no ill-effects).

It is a nice peppy song. Unfortunately this song is not typical for the album. \\"One good woman\\" is a decent song partly because the instrumental chorus sounds like it's been stolen from \\"Grease.\\" Most of the songs have the Grass Roots horns, but they begin to sound more and more like Three Dog Night with a little bit country.Overall I feel like this group strains to fit a melody to their instruments, only slightly more than it struggles to find it's own sound.

Fields, an Australian resident who grew up in Japan seems qualified to attempt such a work. However, the book falls flat.The dustjacket summary and title are misleading as the book is written solely from the viewpoint of business and sales, which isn't even alluded to on the cover. This could be overlooked if that were a fulfilling aspect, but even that is not very substantial. I came away from this book with a few anecdotes about how not to market Western goods in Japan, and that's about all. I wouldn't reccomend buying this book for general insight, OR business acumen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally misleading!","review":"Serious warning for all prospective readers of this book: this is the most misleading title ever created. This book has almost nothing about about the July 20,1944 bomb plot by Count von Staufenberg against Hitler. Of course you'd think this would be about that topic since the title mentions this event. Forget it! Instead, it's a lengthy, boring and ultimately unreadable account of the German Home Front in 1944-45. That's a fairly interesting subject, but not when you expect to read something about July 20, 1944. I didn't even finish this twaddle, Hitler appears on a scant 14 pages, Staufenberg is a non-entity here. A crushing disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Wasted Opportunity.","review":"I can only reinforce the misgivings of the earlier reviewers.The author postulates that the failure of the German Army to field a large number of new divisions in early 1944 was a deliberate attempt to hold back manpower from the front for an internal coup to accompany the Bomb Plot in July 1944.However, he then fails completely to offer any evidence of a causal connection. As a result, on its central theme this book is closer to conspiracy theory than history.This is a pity, as the German Replacement Army was a major military institution that badly needs a good study.

It is a TOY! I completely agree with what others said.. it is a wonderful toy, but its purpose (to be a potty) is ignored by the child b/c they are having too much fun playing! I also agree it is way to sensitive. My daughter will just lift up the seat and it says \\"you did it! You went potty!\\"I do not recommend this potty for potty training. Go with a simple, non-toy version of the potty!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Better if you turn off the sound!","review":"We bought two different Fisher Price potties- one for upstairs and one for downstairs- just in case :) This model is way too sensitive. If my son so much as twicthed, the potty told him he had successfully peed. In the beginning, he thought he was pretty hot stuff! Finally, I turned the thing off and he just sat on it and told me on his own when he was done. The other bad thing is that the splash guard comes off way too easily. Every time I'd turn around, my son would have the thing in his hand which is not a good thing when training a boy! My son has rather generous thighs and when I'd get him off the potty, the splash guard would come too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT!","review":"This is a SUPERB introduction to potty training. I bought it because my 12 mo old was interested in the adult toilet. Mostly lifting the seat! I bought this as an early introduction only and to keep her focused on a safe area in the bathroom. I change her diaper and bring her to the potty to use the fun flush and toilet paper. After a few weeks, she sat on it and was happy with the music. Now she takes a diaper from the shelf and puts it in the potty and closes the lid. This is an EXCELLENT introduction to the world of potty training. When her time arrives over the next year or so to start, she will have been gently introduced to the process and it hopefully will be fun for her with little pressure. It's not too loud, the sensors work effectively and I like the small size for small people. It's just right for their world."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's A Potty TOY","review":"This is a very fun TOY. It is not a good potty! My son likes to find things to put into it to hear it sing.

She was very dissapointed that it didn't make a real flushing sound. Because she is a girl we do not use the splash guard and that leaves a hole in the blue lid where there is room for the guard to pertrude. She stuck her hand in the hole and was not able to get it out. We had to pull her hand out leaving a scratch and a bruise on her hand.

However, my son is tall and he was uncomfortable with having to sit at an awkward angle. Now for the sound effects: each time that my son lifted the lid to \\"go\\" it said that he had already gone or made some other ghastly comment and the guard would fall off.

When my son urinates, if he doesn't get it all directly in the green pan, it leaks from in between the seat on to the floor and in between the base of the potty. This thing is disgusting. I have to take it apart and clean it every single time he pees!!!!Also, the sensor is too sensitive. It sings and says he went when nothing happened.I wish I would have spent the money on a simple potty without bells and whistles. Now all my 1 year old wants to do is play with this nasty potty. I finally threw it away and just let my son use the regular toilet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good one","review":"I can't even use this chair with my son.

I agree with those who wrote about the oversensitive sensor on the potty chair. Every time my daughter sits on the potty it tells her \\"way to go- you did it\\" when in fact she hasn't gone at all. I think the toilet paper and flush have definately helped make her fearless about using the regular potty, but when it comes time for serious training, I'm going to have to turn the sound off because it is so misleading. She's had more success the few times she has sat on the regular toilet- this is indeed an expensive toy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun Toy, but Not the Best Potty Training Device...","review":"We have had this potty for close to a year and all my nearly 3 year old son will do is play with it. He figured out how to fool the sensors in the potty and sticks his hand between his legs to get it to talk back to him.

Unless this was a defective one, I would not recommend this at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this and go with a basic potty cover","review":"This plays nice songs and is a fun TOY, but I wouldn't recommend it if you are serous about potty training. While the seat and back can be removed from the base to attach to a toilet, we found that it either doesn't attach well and slides around (depending on your toilet size and shape) or it attaches so well (to a standard size toilet) that it's a pain to undo it so an adult can use the toilet. You need to reach in and squeeze four clips one at a time to release it from the toilet. Also, it takes up a bit of floor space, so if you have a small bathoom, you'll be tripping over this (plus a stool)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!!!!","review":"When I started to teach my 28 months I bought the old fashion potty. She didnt care for it. Then I bought the fun to learn. She got very excited and started to be interested on it. However the first time she pipi was in the simple one.

My 2 1/2 yr old twin boys took to playing/sitting on it immediately, and as other reviews stated, it sang \\"you went potty\\" when they clearly didn't. My biggest grip, however, is the urine splatter guard for usage w/boys. The guard doesn't \\"clamp\\" on tight at all, so when my kids simply sit down, the guard falls off, or it simply falls off when they try to lift the seat. When I called to complain to FP, they didn't seem concerned -- don't they even test their products??!!

In fact it hinders. The sensors are far too sensitive and can't be adjusted, resulting in the potty blaring out \\"well done!\\" when the child hasn't actually done anything. This causes confusion and even discouragement. The so-called \\"flushing\\" noise is nothing of the kind - which really confused our child.

See other reviews if your actually interested in achieving potty training."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of Fun","review":"This potty chair was bit more expensive than I wanted to pay, but my daughter refused to sit on one of the small simple potty seats and was afraid of our toilet seat. We are almost completely potty trained and this potty chair is the reason why! It does talk and it can be loud, but if you child is past the step of \\"being shy to the potty\\", it's perfect. It has a sensor in it and if she sits on when the pee hits the potty, it says encouraging words like you've been on the potty. It tells her when the seat is up or down and tells her to find the toilet paper and flush it all away. She was really excited about it.The only downside is that it can be considered play time if your child isn't quite ready for it.I was on here today looking for a potty seat to put on our toilet with handles...

I love that you can set the temperature you want as well as release the handle to spin as you release the curl.

The ceremonies he writes about have meaning to him and he wishes to share their essence with the readers. There is nothing about exploitation in this. What this book does is send a message of hope that people will do SOMETHING in themselves to correct their insane ways and reconnect with the living Spirit that flows through Nature. Small minds need opening. Small hearts need opening. Envy is a disease of the soul. 1000 blessings to Ed McGaa, whoever he is, for his beautiful efforts. Small stones dropped in the water make ever-expanding rings. It is for readers to reflect on the meaning of what is written. Noone has to go out and perform rituals that are not theirs. There is something universal in all people's rituals, however. The wise see it and can work with it. The lazy idiots sit back and sling mud. When has it ever been otherwise?

And the excitement of games 2 - 4, when Cleveland proved they were true contenders!And while the 2004 set lacked the 3 ALDS games against the Angels, at least it was produced in HD. This World Series set was rushed to market, so much so that it is not in HD or widescreen, which are practically automatic on all DVDs today.So while I appreciate MLB's effort to get a product out in time for the holidays, I truly wish they had postponed the offer until such time the entire postseason series of games could be made available in 1 set - with all the viewing perks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh ...

What's not to like about being able to fast-forward through Joe Buck and Tim (bad hair-dye job) McCarver every game?

It's cute, humorous and hopeful -- a rare combination compared to some of the more doleful books out there about ASDs. While it is slightly basic, it was a good conversation starter with some members of my family who think all my kids need is a good psychiatrist. (I have two sons with varying degrees of autism and ADD.) This book helps make clear that autism is a developmental disorder, not a mental problem, and that kids with autism are not behaving in certain ways on purpose to make other people upset but because they are trying to get their needs met. I recommend this book to any loved one of an \\"Aspie\\" child who wants to educate others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very cute book!","review":"I bought this book last night and I think it is great!

The cats are really cute too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hurt my Asperger son's feelings....","review":"I was excited ordering this book for my son since he is such an animal lover. He does have a very soft heart, which is probably why this book was NOT a good choice for him. My son is exactly for the most part like all the descriptions in the book, however I do not suggest you give it to the aspie child. I think it's more for other children to see to help explain your child. My son ended up balling his eyes out and it took him awhile to calm down after reading this book. Asking him why he's so upset it is to help him he yells because it's true!!! :( I suppose it was not good to remind him he does not have friends, or is different.The book is cute, and I think again it could be positive explaining Aspergers to your child's peers. But I regret buying it for my son."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inaccurate","review":"I was ready to purchase this book for my son, however after viewing the preview I opted not to purchase the book because one page says that AS kids like to be near those they love but not touched by them. However, MANY, including my son, AS kids have Sensory Integration Disorder issues which make them crave EXTRA sensory input including but not limited to actions like hugging. This behavior may change as the children mature but such a blanket statement is disturbing, particularly since AS kids are very literal and if I gave this book to my son he would then infer that he does NOT have AS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Expected","review":"I'm glad we checked this one out from the library before purchasing. It was extremely disappointing and I can't believe all the positive reviews. My son is on the spectrum and I thought this book would help draw parallels between our cat's quirks and his own and then show how it's ok to be quirky like a cat. This book was overly blunt at times and did little to help my son and his brothers understand Asperger's Syndrome. Maybe it's a cultural difference between Europe and the United States but I do not feel that this book is appropriate to read with a child dealing with an Autism Spectrum Disorder. It made him feel like an outcast."},{"rating":"1","title":"A funny book unless you have an Aspie child","review":"This book was funny and cute and true but I am glad I read it in the bookstore before giving it to my son.

This may be helpful for kids (or siblings) who love animals, it may help them make sense of a condition that can be confusing. It encourages the reader to be more sympathetic and compassionate of Asperger's persons, since the kitties are so appealing. However, not all the pictures will correspond to every person with Asperger's, since each case is unique. Also, I have a small problem with the title, since I myself don't really think cats are all that much like Asperger's kids. Asperger's kids really want to socialize and please, and most cats are just fine on their own, quite independent.

My son was so excited he took it to school with him, his teacher loved it and started sharing it with other teachers, so it turned out to be a great way to get them thinking about it as well.The book includes a few negatives but is otherwise overall very positive and that perspective is appreciated when so many other books on the subject can be depressing and even condescending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I'd expect","review":"This book is not what I expected at all. I thought it would liken cats' behaviors to symptoms of Asperger Syndrome. However, it is just a book that simply describes the behaviors of people with Asperger Syndrome alongside pictures of cats vaguely performing similar behaviors.

However a simple picture book cannot address the variety within AS so it failed to describe my little Aspie who is extremely cuddly but has many sensory, social and \\"theory of mind\\" challenges.

She was the daughter of Thadeus Lowe, a wealthy pioneer of Pasadena who made a small fortune during the Civil War, supplying Abraham Lincoln's army with tethered hydrogen balloons. Her anti-social and rebellious ways eventually led her to the world of Aviation and she eventually held many world records (beating out Amelia Earheart sometimes) and worked in the Hollywood Aviation community where she became President of The Motion Picture Pilot's Association. During the 40's she founded her notorious \\"Pancho's Happy Bottom Ridding Club\\" based at what is now known as Edwards Airforce Base.

It's unfortunate that this was his last album, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"A sad conclusion to an otherwise brilliant career.","review":"Albert Ayler's 1969 recording Music is the Healing Force of the Universe was to be his last. Recorded just before his mysterious death, Music ... is also unfortunately one of his most misguided albums. Ayler had fallen on bad times and was under the influence of his eccentric wife \\"Mary Maria\\". Her \\"cosmic vibration\\" vocals dominate the album, while Ayler and his rhythm section attempt to back up her pleading declarations. The two longest cuts on the album are the only non-vocal performances, but alas they are both untypical of his better output. \\"Masonic Inborn\\" is twelve minutes of overdubbed dual bagpipes drug along by a calamitous rhythm section. Oddly, the album closes with an electric blues, featuring a member of Canned Heat. Here, Ayler's blues shouts and growls are nowhere near as intense and revolutionary as his previous recorded legacy made implicit.

Thirdly, it just wasn't very good.If you're a diehard Chris Crutcher fan, read this for posterity. And heck, it does get interesting eventually.

The carrying case, unfortunately, isn't that much of an improvement. It's basically like the cover that comes with it with a back and a flap that slips onto the back. It's not as convenient as one might hope. In all, I'd say it's not worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"An under-rated case...","review":"Everyone tends to ignore the manufacturer cases, focusing on the expensive products by Vaja or Coach, but the CA-60 is actually well-thought out.It adds barely any bulk to the case, making it ideal for protecting your T-series Clie in your pocket or purse. The interior is a soft, sueded midnight blue that cushions the rear and screen of your Clie. The tab slide closure holds it securely shut (it is a little tight at first, but wears in nicely). The Sony logo is elegantly embossed in the front of the case.What it doesn't have: bulk; slots for memory sticks or credit cards; a magnetic closure that will erase your credit cards and memory sticks. If you want a wallet case to hold your Clie and more, don't bother with the CA-60.If you want a sleek leather case that emphasizes the slim lines of your T-series Clie, this is the case for you. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because the [price] is a little high. If you can find it cheaper, like I did, go for it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great case","review":"I purchased the Sony Clie PEG-T615 around two months ago and with it, the Sony Carrying Case... It's great! Really, the leather is well made (must be, it's from Sony), you don't have to remove case when doing the hot-synch, and it looks very classy.

The house phone is the line that gets used least. So what I really don't understand is how I'm buying new batteries for the phones twice a year, because every time we do have a call that's more than 5-10 minutes, the darn battery goes to low battery and drops the call. Mind you, you've got to move fast to pick up a different phone, because once you get the alert that the battery is low you've got maybe 15 seconds before it conks out entirely.

The internal phonebook works well, as does the answering machine functions and voice clarity is excellent. I haven't had any problems with interference from my wireless router. About the only complaint I have is the speakerphone could use a little increase in volume, it is hard to hear at times during my conference calls. Great phone I'd buy again anytime."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major design flaw","review":"I've had this phone for about 4 years.This is a great phone when it works, but it's got a major design flaw: the battery charge management. As batteries get older they don't last as long, I understand that; however, with proper charging, NiMH batteries should have a life much greater than what this phone allows. But that isn't the worst part. That honor goes to the low charge alert. You will not get an alert about a low battery until you place or answer a phone call, and then if you're lucky you've got fifteen seconds to swap handsets (you'd be up a creek if you don't have a second handset) before it shuts down.Then when you place the discharged handset back on the charging cradle it will beep every few minutes to let you know it's charging. What genius thought of that???

It's starts out with some of the best songs of the past like \\"We Are The Doctor\\" and \\"No Style.\\" They display their love of British music from fifteen years ago. The Pleased are a Californian band, so there is more space and psychedelic longings. On some of the new songs like \\"One Horse\\" and \\"Another Disaster\\" they expand their sound and surprise and thrill the listener. There is a tragic romantic theme throughout most of the record.

Annelie is also one of the lesbian beautiful people, having reinvented herself after winning a huge lottery. Carolyn wants what Annelie won't let her have, so there are sparks between these two divas when they first meet. The story keeps you turning pages and it's fluff - after a hard day at the office, that's okay! I recently discovered the existance of lesbian romances so I have a lot of catching up to do.

The relationship is contrived and the connection between the main characters is superficial at best.While I didn't expect a great piece of literature, I was hoping for a compelling story.

Moreover, Japan boasts a maritime resource management system that differs from and in several respects seems more successful than those of Western Europe and North America. It is impossible to understand the present situation in Japan's fishing industry without having a knowledge of its past. What is more, Japan's fishing villages played a significant role in Japan's economic development. In partitcular, during the Tokugawa period (1699-1868), they acted as key commercial links between the castle towns and dispersed farming communities.The aims of this book, therefore, are twofold: first, to place martitime resource management within the larger context of social and material reproduction and, second, to analyse the fishing villages in the context of Japan's economic history."},{"rating":"2","title":"awsome","review":"This machine is so fun.

Now the whole machine, along with all the cartridges I got her, are useless.

But it belonged to the company I worked for. So I decided to order my own. and this is that exact product that I've used in the past.Unfortunately I am extremely disappointed with it. The product leaks. the dispenser straw inside the container keeps falling off. and sometime you have to push the dispenser lid down about 15 times before you get any alcohol out of it, completely defeating the purpose for the convenience of which it is intended. ( I can open an alcohol packet faster than that) Also, I never had any of these problems with this product when I worked with it in the past. That is the reason I decided to order one for myself. But I am extremely disappointed with this one. I give this product two thumbs down. or on a scale of 1 to 10 about a 3 & 1/2"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Eclectica","review":"I agree with another reviewer that with this album Minus 8 tries to venture too far out of what they are really good at. Other bands have done a good job fusing different genres. The problem with this album is that Minus 8 didn't seem to have a good idea to be eclectic. Some of the tracks venture to Jamaican/Reggae style with horrible result. Only a few tracks are well done with sublime style Minus 8 is good at. I really like other albums by Minus 8. This one is the worse. If i could sample the tracks, i wouldn't have bought it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth it for anyone who's recently had a promotion (good gift to celebrate this too!)","review":"This book was suggested to me as it would outline some of the management challenges I was facing. It was a very insightful read. This book helped me understand what I need to stop doing, and although I already had an idea it was helpful to see it clearly in black and white.The book outlines six promotional steps (the book calls them leadership passages) between managing self (i.e. being a worker) to Enterprise manager (e.g.CEO). It gives signs to look for showing what's working and what's not in subordinates and your own new role as well as pointers on how to address them.I recommend it to anyone who has recently been promoted as it highlights some of the things you have to learn to do and some of the things that you need to stop doing as your role changes. These include the way you work, what you value and how you manage your subordinates."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highlights Push for Leadership","review":"I never tire of reading or discussions on leadership and this book gave me a way to think more strategically about the process.

I keep wondering how can that be done. Jaques and Gillian Stamp has written for so many years about human capability and seven levels of work complexity that are clearly repeated in this book withouth no comment to them. Even the general themes are there, for example managing other, leader of leader, managing a business unit, managing a group of business unit. If you don't beleive me, just read Requisite Organization (Jaques) and previous ones, for example, and you will learn that Jaques' ideas are being developed for more than 30 years. So, better learn with the real creative people that has really done researches around the theme."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Read!","review":"Organizations need leaders, but natural leaders are at least as rare as natural athletes. And, even natural athletes need careful training and development - given that almost everyone is capable of developing some degree of athletic potential. Similarly, the right training and development program can help almost anyone cultivate some degree of leadership potential. In fact, it can help a few people develop extraordinary leadership abilities. Ignoring leadership development is foolish, but at many companies, short-term priorities eclipse the long-term thinking needed to develop a good leadership pipeline. This book's plain, sensible approach is simple without being simplistic. It is generally lucid and clear, and - somewhat to our surprise - it does not suffer from having three authors. If you are a leader or need to develop leaders for large corporations, this is a very useful volume."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware ordering for Kindle edition!

This is a 2nd Kodak I bought (1st -- c340). The multi-point button was better on c340, as now it's sharp edges irritate your finger when used to browse pics too long. It's the only usability drawback I found.Another good point -- Kodak has great support. I had problem with my c340 and it was serviced (warranty) and mailed back to me in 1 week. Much better than Sony(90 day warranty) or Pentax(2 months in service) experiences I had.Camera's response is fast-- power-up time is under 2sec., easy to navigate and set-up. Use of AA- type of batteries is a plus and Ni-MH rechargables are cheap. Battery life is very good. I recommend usin 2700mAh Ni-MH. It seems to me that white-ballance is not performed when image is shown on the LCD, but when taken, image is balanced. Large LCD is surprisingly resilient to the sunlight situation. I guess die to Kodak's OLED technology.Wish they had 7 MegaPix, but Schneider lense offsets that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good enough for my purpose..","review":"This is a great little camera. I took it on a week long vacation, snapped over 200 pictures and several movie clips and never once charged the batteries. I like the movie mode, it has a great sound - I find myself using it more and more. I've even recorded at an indoor concert and the sound is incredible. The only con of the movie mode is that you cannot zoom while it's recording. A little annoying, but - I've learned to zoom in before I hit the record button.The display is big, however, one other con of this camera is that my pictures look a little fuzzy on the display. Once I download them in to the computer, they look very clear. I'm just now ordering my first batch of prints so I am anxious to see how they print out.Overall - Kodak makes a great camera and I am very happy with this model."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Theoretical, Too Wordy","review":"I had high hopes for this book to improve my understanding of the subject for my work as the quality engineer for a testing laboratory.

I thought I saw the ending written on the wall about half way through the book - and she keeps piling it on all the time - Rendell kept me riveted all the way to the very last page.

Some of the songs did even sound like him - he was so wild that he lost control. The recording needs a cleaner recording and mix, as it's lacks clarity. In my opinon it should be done over - something like greatest hits live; in control; shorter; improved sound (DTS) and video! If possible, I would return it.

The only things that I don't like is that the sun visors don't adjust down further. We have to drape a blanket over the visor so the sun doesn't get in my daughter's eyes. Also, I don't like not having a cup holder for my old son. I have to hold his drink for him. There is also no cup carrier for adults. Also, the compartments on the bottom are not big enough to hold a large diaper bag. We have to carry that on our shoulder which isn't comfortable for long days.

But as soon as you play it you're told that it is PG. And, boy, does it ever deserve it's PG rating. I've seen more skin in documentaries on the Amish. If you're one of those rare birds who'd watch a Tweed movie for the plot, forget it--it's not good enough to keep an insomniac awake nor is it bad enough for camp.

All these songs have been categorized and put in a position on the cd for a taste anyone can enjoy: rap,hip-hop,dance,rock, etc. Some of these songs are a bit old, but what do you expect NOW to do, forget about these hits people still like and go to new ones?Say bad stuff about these songs all you want-- that wouldn't change the fact all 20 of them have entered the Billboard Hot 100 at one time, so someone had to like all of them.By the way don't complain on how Missy Elliot, TLC, Christina Aguleria or Kid Rock aren't on the Now's-- chances are they'll be on Totally hits 2003 since they've been on Totally Hits before."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great songs","review":"My favorite songs are Keith Urban's Somebody Like You, Jenny from the Block, and Pretty Baby.

I'm surprised how far from accurate it is. However, it is the same blaster that's been made and sold as a Stormtrooper blaster for quite some time now, so it's the best you can buy. It's a fun sound effect blaster, and it's pretty easy to remove the bright orange cap so it looks a tad bit closer to the movie. Younger kids will love it. Older kids, might if they're willing to look the other way about it not looking the same as the movie.Best of all...if you're REALLY interested in having a perfectly accurate stormtrooper blaster, you can find the conversion pieces online (for around $75-90) and make it the perfect stormtrooper blaster.

However I also believe in other civilizations out there in other planets, the universe is HUGE with Billions and Billions of stars and planes a like. I believe God just didn't create life on earth. I believe other civilizations are out there and they are not nephilims, I don't believe that all the ufo sightings and alien contact is related to the nephilims. I believe the goverment has capture flying saucers, I believe they have that technology and i believe a great deal in life in another planets unrelated to nephilims.

Listening to the instructor throughout the video does not annoy me, and that is a huge plus :-) There is a nice mini cool-down session just around 25 minutes, so if I am short on time I can call it quits there.

For example, although the book is around 200 pages, 10 pages are devoted to a questionnaire of fictional character traits (\\"I go to religious services,\\" always/sometimes/never). Yet the book isn't really geared to fiction writers, either. Often there's information that's either completely oversimplified or just ridiculous, like defining in the glossary what a \\"CD\\" is. (A \\"compact disc,\\" she sagely informs us.) Finally, considering this is a 4th-edition book about publishing, there's a distracting number of typos.For better introductions to publishing, try Albert Greco's \\"The Book Publishing Industry,\\" Thomas Woll's \\"Publishing for Profit,\\" or the simple but wise \\"Spark Your Career in Book Publishing\\" form the SparkNotes series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mixed bag of information","review":"Disappointing.

The story tries to depict a situation where Christian pro-lifers are the only ones to object to involuntary abortion. Speaking as a pro-choice Agnostic, I would also object- so would several athieists I know. The book, like many other Christian fantasy novels, tries to show that the only way to be a good person is to be Christian. This is simply not the case- many people in the past who have fought against tyranny haven't been Christians. Many who fought for the rights we take for granted today (the 40 hour work week, anti-child labor laws, and workplace safety to name a few) were socialists, anarchists, communists and other people most Christians would choose not to associate with.

Mr. Robinson's telling of this history insightfully looks not just at the facts and dates, but at the personas, influences, and lasting historical effects of the crusades.

The book reveals personal details of her life but downplays certain players in her life. For example, the lesbian relationship between her mother and \\"friend\\" Auntee was passed off as being no more than a casual friendship. I understand DD reasons for not revealing things about her mother considering she was still alive at the time the book was published. She only mention a few details about her fame with the movie CARMEN.The book is written well but only takes a cursory view of her life and success. It seems to accentuates the most tragic details of her life and downplays her contribution to others. It's a good book, but please read Donald Bogle's book if you want a more thorough revelation of her life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for non-programmers","review":"The book Javascript is by all means not a quick fix book if you are looking to learn Javascript in a short period of time.

This is the best account of what happened from August 15th to August 16th 1977. If you have always been curious concerning the death of Elvis and what happened and not so much how it happened this is for you. This account is not morbid in anyway. Family and friends come together and describe the last 24 hours in chronological order. Joe Esposito leads the way as he was the first to attend to Elvis other than his girlfriend Ginger who is not in the DVD and that is probably a plus in my opinion.You cannot go wrong and you will not be dissapointed. The last 24 hours of Elvis is well done with many intwerviews and clips coming together in good taste. If you are a Elvis fan and you want to spend a couple of hours learning about the end of the greatest entertainer of all time.Buy this and you can't go wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a really nice, dependable product!

Classic and not so classic tracks are given a good reworking by Dr. Alex Patterson, giving the Orb listener a great product. Even fans of the artists being remixed will enjoy the abstract interpretations produced by this phenomenal electronic maestro. A great addition to any CD collection, many of the tracks are set in a mellow sort of mood. Yet, certain tracks definately have a more rugged feel. Also, there is a good amount of danceable tracks for the club/party scene. Yessir, the Orb never ceases to amaze, and Auntie Aubry's excursions are nothing short of amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best album in history","review":"I cannot say enough about this album. Every once in a generation there is a perfect album; such as TEN by Pearl Jam, on and on, this album was that and more. Disk 1 particularly is beyond explanation. You have to listen to it with your eyes closed. And do it again and again. The first time I heard this album I got that funny feeling that something is symmetric and perfect. On subsequent listenings, my ears enlightened my brain. This is something not to own, but something to treasure and love. Trust not me, but your own ears and soul. Listen to the lyrics before fast forward the future and higher than the sun and tell me you didnt meet god. That you didnt understand a mathematical beauty orders of magnitude than yourself. This is the essence of the Orb. This is the essence of music beyond boundaries.

I have been a fan of Concrete Blonde for 15+ years, and while I was disappointed by Group Therapy, I was completely turned off by Live in Brasil. I will admit that the recording was well done, and I was enjoying the album up until the attack on our President, but because of her silly rant, I will no longer support Concrete Blonde. There are plenty of listeners who will overlook or be ammused by the insult to Bush, but entertainers should learn to keep their mouths shut about politics, and U.S. citizens should be more outraged by those who disrepect the office of the president on foreign soil.

A real roller coaster ride","review":"Those of us who gained immensely from Kubler-Ross' first book \\"On death and dying\\" will be interested to read her final book. And what a dichotomy from the first! Instead of a carefully reasoned, almost scientific treatise on the subject of life and death, Kubler-Ross throws us onto the roller coaster that has been her life. Unsatisfactory relationships, a definite superiority complex (Kubler-Ross is always right) and a profound belief that her life has eveolved the way it has in order for her to learn the lessons she needs to - and yet mysterious and thought-provoking. The way in which she refers to her \\"spooks\\" (her term), the spirit guides which live with her each day, and her encounters with out of body experiences leave us more grounded souls with a high degree of scepticism. And yet ... Read this book and make up your mind for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Memoirs","review":"I was a little disapointed with this book.

The beginning was fine and interesting, following her journey from childhood to medical school. Something went wrong in her life when she was in her 40's, and that's when the story got wacky. It was probably the California life-style of the 1970's and all the garbage about channeling the other side, etc. I wanted so badly to plead with her to go back to her family and raise her children instead of running around the country searching for who knows what. It really was quite flaky as she told of spirits having long conversations with her. This poor woman was seeing and hearing things that were not there. She seemed so lost spiritually, and it sounded as though she was estranged from her family. I do not discount her work with the stages of dying, this was an important contribution. But if love was the most important thing of all, that goal seemed elusive to her. Very sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inspiration from a crabby, selfish, person is impossible","review":"The story highlights the author's egomania.

I love Birdemic, The Room, Hobgoblins, Shark Attack 3: Megaladon, and all those wonderful movies as much as the next nerd, but this- this is a different animal. What we have here seems to be a movie that was taken seriously on set, but upon viewing the footage for the audio dub, the film makers came upon the realization that what they had was not salvageable.

Charles Kim has a very specific sound and feel he is going for, and you can hear here exactly which parts of the Pinetop Seven sound are attributable to Kim. It's an interesting record, very beautiful, but as a Pinetop Seven fan, I can't help feeling like I'm hearing a demos of Pinetop Seven songs that don't yet have words. But this is no bad thing, and when taken on its own merits, as it should be, this is an exceptional record. The last song falls somewhere between Boxhead Ensemble and the Dirty Three, and many of the players here, including Kim, are also associated with Boxhead Ensemble. Anniversary is not quite a match for the Ensemble's masterpiece \\"Two Brothers,\\" but it is a very striking listen and one of finest instrumental albums of the year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sets Pattern For Ghostworld and Hellworld","review":"This is a sequel to Blue Moon Rising, but like Ghostworld and Hellworld, the character base has been trimmed from the epic to the contained.The time is ten years after the Demon War (see Blue Moon Rising). A border fort was constructed to secure a border with Hillsdown. But now the fort has gone silent. A team of Rangers is sent to investigate.Upon arrival at the fort it is obvious that there is something very wrong. Soon the Rangers must join with some bandits in order to survive a horror that threatens the whole world.Dream sequences give a great personality profile for each character in a similar fashion to the flashbacks in Blue Moon Rising. While a direct sequel to the events of Blue Moon Rising, this is a tough and gritty tale that does not have the Rupert/Dragon/Julia/Unicorn brand of humor. But it is no less a good yarn.If you like the Forest Kingdom books (or the Twilight of the Empire books), you should take quite well to this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough information to understand letters","review":"Frances Mossiker's book is really the best source for the Madame's letters, as it offers information about people and the era and much of the original letters.

I figure for that price, what the heck, I might as well try it, I have only $4 to loose. Two weeks later, it is still sitting in the box. I guess it's because I rather throw some spray in wash on the stain and pray rather than getting out this big machiene.

The second unit also stopped working after only 4 or 5 uses - same problem, no fluid flow - and the buzzer also stopped working. I gave up. What a piece of junk.

How convenient is that?? Now I am on the third unit and after aboutwith the results. Then it quit working; the sonic part quit. I then had to spend another $5 on shipping for a new unit.

During that time it met our expectations. Like others have mentioned, after calling for service we were told to cut off the cord and return the unit. Our replacement arrived and worked for a week before it quit buzzing.Bottom line: It would be a decent product if the quality was adequate, but judging from my experience and other reviews it has serious design or production flaws that result in a very high failure rate.

Each time prior to this, the customer service representatives assured me that they had never heard of this problem with the product. I have a large quantity of cleaning pads and fluid laying around taking up shelf space, so today I decided to see if other people had had the same experience as I did, and found these reviews. I wish I had looked earlier.Like others, I'm not confident that the units (when they actually functioned) did any better than other stain removal products.The representatives had to be lying to me when they said they had had no other reports of this problem.

After all, my fancy iron cost about that much, and I shelled out $80 for my garment steamer. HOWEVER, after lightening my wallet to the tune of $50 at a local linen & bath store, I soon felt pretty stupid at the thought of paying $5 for a TINY bottle of cleaning fluid and another $5 for some little absorbent pads for as long as I own this product, and took it back a week later for a refund.If someone discovers cheap substitutes for these consumables (who knows...maybe liquid detergent and paper towels would work?) then I might consider buying one of these.

This band is not popularly successful because they represent everything rock fans have forgotten: Straight ahead rock and roll with intelligent lyrics and actual talented musicians.

This book tries to present typical colloquial features that cross the various national dialects as well as pointing out certain regional peculiarities (which can really only be fully learned by living among native speakers). Moreover, having presented the spoken language it then goes on to present modern, literary Arabic (alFusha) in a very practical and relevant way.

The first few chapters of Savage were quite good, but once as soon as the characters set sail for America, I became very disappointed with the plot and the writing. Laymon's attempt at capturing a British accent is painful--He seems to rely heavily on words like \\"bully\\" and \\"passel\\" to convey Englishness. Similar painful methods are deployed in his use of words like \\"pardner\\" in his cowboy characters. There are pages of dialogue that were so bad that I read them out loud to a friend--our sides are still aching from the laugh workout.Having spent good money on the book, I finished it, but I was thrilled when I had read the last lines.

Also, the writer did not attend the trial, which is painfully obvious. He did no independent research.

While the author was thorough on the court proceedings, this book just lacked the \\"meat\\" of a good story. Too much info on the lawyers and their personalities, not nearly enough in depth on Sandy Murphy and Rick Tabish, the two who in all likelihood really did get away with murder. Ted, his family and friends were similarly shortchanged. These are the people I wanted to know more about, not a bunch of lawyers.

Yeah, its stupid and cheesy, but that's why its so good! Its unintentionally hilarious, the zombies look cool and there are a lot of great gore scenes (especially the one at the end!)! What more do you need? Ok, a lot of people need more, but personally, I don't. Then again, maybe I'm too much of a zombie movie fan, I like a lot of zombie movies just because they're gory, they have pathetic stories and acting, but I don't care!Anyway, you'll probably enjoy this movie if you're an hardcore zombie movie fan, but if you want a good horror movie with a good story and great acting, watch another movie.4/5."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Terrible, but it's Pretty Down There","review":"Once again, National Geographic and some producers have gotten together to make a movie. There is so much B-roll of birds, coyotes, bats and whatever else in this flick that if you took it all out the movie itself would be about 50 minutes. Also, since part of this movie takes place in the jungle, there's plenty of unga bunga in junga tribes dancing and running around. You can tell the B-roll really did come from some sort of National Geographic-esque type production house because whenever they use it, there's a lot more grain than the rest of the movie. Now, the movie itself has a horrible dialog and the voice over work doesn't help either. The way the movie flows from scene to scene is absolutley ridiculous too. Whoever planned out the scenes must have been a schizo. Some of the zombies look really good, but the majority of them look like someone just put grey paint on their face. Decent gore, but that's about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD MOVIE, with some good gore","review":"this movie was bad. the characters are taken right from dawn of the dead, just like some of goblins music. this movie wants to be dawn of the dead SOOO Bad, but it's a movie easily forgotten, only to be revisited and talked about by people who agree that it was crap. the only good thing about the movie was i'll admit some of the gore was good, and some zombie hordes weren't a let down, like the end"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as bad as you think-even worse","review":"If you're looking for a good, cheesy eurotrash zombie movie, look elsewhere.

Mostly though, it isn't even very funny. I would say that it is even \\"offensive\\" but it isn't worth that sort of label.watch the documentary and notice how delusional the director is too. the people who will buy this will still buy it because they enjoy that sort of thing anyway but for those of you who are unknowing, you have been warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"calling this the worst horror movie is kind","review":"this is movie is A NICE BIG PILE OF WARM DOO DOO.THERE NOTHING ENTERTAINING ABOUT THIS FILM HORRIBLE ACTING AND SERIOUS OVER ACTING ARE JUST THE BEGINNING TO THIS MESS.NO STORY TO BE FOUND SUPER BAD SPECIAL FX .I MEAN U CAN SEE RAW MEAT TOSS ABOUT AND THE NEW GUINEA ZOMBIES LOOK LIKE BROTHERS AND SISTERS U FIND IN COMPTON CALIFORNIA.AND ADDING STOCK FOOTAGE IS PLAN LAZY.I DON'T KNOW IF THE PERSON WHO DIRECTED THIS STILL ALIVE IF HE IS HE SHOULD BE MADE TO WORK AT MCDONALD'S MAKING FRIES FOR LIFE"},{"rating":"2","title":"This night was painful but great in a sick way","review":"This is a hoot!

The acting is not the greatest, but I've seen much worse. The pace and action of the film is relatively non-stop. There's plenty of gore to go around, but a powerful story-line surrounding it. The plot adds a whole new dimension to the idea of \\"Population Control\\".

However, for the 2007 (new body style) Silverado it has been junk. While my earlier one stayed nice and tight going down the road, the vinyl on this one flops all over and drives you crazy because you can see it in your rear-view mirror. I took the first one back to where I bought it (not Amazon, but a local dealer), and they tried sealing up the bed so no air got underneath it. That didn't help, so they ordered me a new one under warranty. However, the second one is even worse. I felt bad about repeatedly taking it back to the dealer, so I emailed the company to inquire what the problem is 3 times now over the past 6 weeks, and they won't even respond. There is some kind of mfg issue with this cover, as the vinyl is just way too loose. I'm continuing to try to get this resolved with the company, but for now this product is unacceptable, as is their customer service."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Challenging Read","review":"This book may seem to be a bit slow at first, but as you get into it further, Walcott's words really start to affect you. His sense of awareness of American perceptions of the Caribbean are dead on, and he exposes them for what they are. Most importantly, he address poetry in general, relating the poetry he writes to the poetry he sees around him. It is in many ways a fierce defense of the beauty and timelessness of both poetry, and the Caribbean. In just these short pages I found more food for thought and more things that have gotten me thinking than in many novels or other works I have read recently.

The author has backed up all of his thoughts with prophetic scripture and the inspired writings of Ellen G. White (a latter day prophet). He is not dogmatic in his interpretation of what might happen but has put forward his view as another way in which prophecy could be fulfilled thereby broadening the reader's mind. Either way, whether you accept his interpretation or not of what this coming great calamity will be, only a fool would believe that life on earth will continue as it is now. This was the downfall of the Antedeluvians and those that lived on the plains of Sodom and Gomorrah.
