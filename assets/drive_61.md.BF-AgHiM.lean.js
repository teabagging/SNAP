It brings to life so many biblical stories that I had basically forgotten, and gave new meaning to those passages. Diamant does a great job of showing what could have happened to influence the stories of the Bible. The only drawbacks were the constant barrage of tricky and complicated names, which I kept forgetting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Change of course?","review":"When you write a novel everybody knows it's a novel. When you write a true story is the same. The problem begins when someone wants to write a novel from a true story and here everybody knows the Jacob's story as is written in the Bible so here are the flaws:You don't have to explain every little detail as it is written in the Bible and then explain the same as you wish it were. You can give a general description and then write something of your own but without changing the main story.You can't change what happened so why trying to do it by writing a different thing?You can write an unbias or funny or sad explanation of a true story depending in your point of view, but to change the core of what really happened?Of course nobody knows for sure what exactly happened 5,000 years ago but no one have found the Bible as untrue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trashes Jewish history for New Agery and a Joseph rip-off","review":"Diamant actually had me until she started cribbing way too much from Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat for this re-imagining of the Biblical rape of Dinah in the Book of Genesis. She ravages Jewish history in order to play on the cuddly notion that menstruation (I'm sorry, \\"our moon time\\") is a spiritual event that binds all women together - making Diamant a perennial book club favorite among women to whom I do not wish to be bound (shared biological functions notwithstanding). It doesn't help that Diamant keeps forgetting Dinah is telling her story in the first person, which she continues to do even when Dinah is not, technically, in the scene. The fourth wall breaks most painfully when Dinah describes her own death."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book I've ever read!","review":"This is a book every woman should read. I recommend it to everyone and it is often a gift I give to the woman in my life."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Red Tent","review":"This book quickly became tiresome as one realized that the main action in the book revolved around the bodily functions of the tribal women - bleeding, breeding and birthing. In the first half of the book all of the men, with the exception of one lone husband who didn't last long, were cruel beasts who had no use for their women (other than sex and food) and no interest in their female children. Is one to draw the conclusion from this book that the men of the old testament were self-centered brutes who treated women as chattel? I think so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely story!","review":"I often take books from my mother's book shelf. She's an avid reader and has superb taste in books. I over looked this book on her shelf for years. It just didn't seem to be my kind of book. I was finally talked into giving it a try and boy am I glad! This book is beautiful! You have to pay some attention to all the names. It's not the easiest read I've ever had, but it's not the hardest either, and well worth it! There is a family tree of all the names you need to know in the front of the book so don't let that keep you from reading this wonderful book. I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great!","review":"I really did not think I was going to like this book but, I was very pleasantly surprised. I finished it in three sittings in two days and I would have finished in one if I had that much time at once. I don't think this is a book many men would enjoy but, I wouldn't classify it strictly a romance novel. I think it it important to know that this is fiction as some of the Christian readers were offended and thought they were getting something Biblically accurate. It is a beautiful story, well written that left me with happy and sad tears."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating historical fiction","review":"Great book. I'm a fan of historical fiction and this was no disappointment. Kinda reminds me of _The Mists of Avalon_ in its feminist retelling of an old tale."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very empowering read","review":"I truly enjoyed reading this book; I found it so interesting and such a wonderful point of view to the times they were in. I find that after reading this book and then reading Genesis where it talks about Jacob, Leah, Rachel and the others mentioned in The Red Tent; I cannot help but see this story in the background. Where it so briefly discusses Dinah in the bible and how she was \\"violated\\" I think about the love that she had actually found and how the murder committed by her brothers so deeply affected her. I also love reading about the bond formed by women in this time; how they would all sit together in the tent and share secrets and stories. I have read this book three times now and each time I just enjoy it more and more. I would recommend this for any woman to read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Red Tent","review":"Absolutely was caught up in the story immediately! I cannot imagine these women not saying the words expressed by Anita Diamant on their behalf. The lives they led, the hardships they endured, their strength and the faith they had makes me proud to be a woman but grateful that I didn't live then! However, I believe in reincarnation - was I living at that time? How did I respond to those same instances of life then? Would I have survived?Thank you Anita Diamant for such a moving novel expressing how life could have been lived in those times."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"The Red Tent\\" -- exceptional writing, some scenes a bit gruesome.","review":"I am reading this as part of a study group of Jewish and Christian women. We are having a wonderful time examining various viewpoints and imagining how it might have been from the women's point of view, thanks to the excellent writing of Anita Diamant. An intriguing novel and a good read. Be prepared for some graphic scenes of childbirth, murder, abuse, but also a fascinating picture of life at a blooming time in the world of Isaac, Rebecca, Jacob and Esau, told through a daughter of one of the several wives of Jacob. I meant to read this sooner and I see this is the book's 10th anniversary. Better late than never. As a Christian, I think we see Biblical history through a certain lens. For instance, it's easy to forget that there was still strong belief in multiple gods during this period. A very worthwhile and rich reading experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it-","review":"While I read this as fiction, I loved the historic references as well. The last few pages are the best, as Dinah sums up her life and death....So good! Sorry critics!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Timely","review":"At the time I was reading The Red Tent, I was also awaiting the home birth of my granddaughter. I was very moved by this book and have recommended it to all my women friends, young and old."},{"rating":"2","title":"A minor Biblical character gets to tell her story","review":"I've always loved historical fiction, and found this Biblical fiction just as compelling. I had no idea that religion was so diverse, during these times, and that the concept of the goddess was alive and kicking amongst Hebrew women. This book kept me up at night and almost made me miss my train stop twice (the true measure of a really good book). What a great idea, telling the story of a minor Biblical character. The only thing that was a bit of a let-down, is that after the pivotal event, the pace slows down greatly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"The only thing that I can say about this book, is WOW! This is one of the best books I have read in a long time. When I initially read what it was about I was a bit tentative about it, thinking that it would be a bit more 'religious' than I wanted to read. Now having read it I think it to be a brilliant story! Anita Diamant is a wonderful writer and this book kept me wanting more, as a matter of fact I was sad when it ended! I highly recommend this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just a biblical story!","review":"How many of us have heard the story of Jacob's daughter, Dinah and not really paid much attention? This book is a fascinating description of Dinah's story and live in these ancient times. A terrific women's book and also great for book club discussions. I have given this book all of my women friends and the reaction has been most enthusiastic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Luke-warm fiction","review":"I didn't think I would ever get through this book, a selection of my book discussion group. I started off really interested in the story, partly because it was initially intriguing and also because there was so much hype surrounding the book. The author attempts to weave a tapestry of Dinah's life but dwells too long on details extrinsic to her own existence. For example, there was great detail given to descriptions of birthing. I failed to see where this affected Dinah's life...especially those births that occured before her own. At any rate, the book was enjoyable to a certain extent. The first half wore on like something I was forced to read against my will in grade school. The last statement in the book, as it turns out, is the most powerful literarily speaking. Too bad you have to wade through so much muck to get the reward..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unforgettable","review":"I loved this book so much that even now, three books later, I find myself still thinking about Dinah, and missing her so.

Read it immediately."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Blue Ribbon for The Red Tent","review":"Passion! Betrayal! Greed! Envy! Sex! Murder! Yup, it's the Bible -- only this time told from the rarely heard women's perspective. Gripping and well-researched. Loved every single sentence. A book all men should read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful, Heartbreaking, and Moving Novel.","review":"\\"The Red Tent,\\" by Anita Diamant, recounts the Old Testament tale of Dinah, daughter of Jacob and Leah. Dinah narrates the story for us and recounts not only her own story, but that of her mothers (Leah, Rachel, Zilpah and Bilhah), her brothers, and her father.I cannot express what a wonderful novel this is. Diamant is an extremely talented author. She managed to take a few simple lines of text from the Old Testament/Hebrew Bible and spin those sparse lines into the most engaging and touching story of a young girl and her family. Diamant brings Dinah to life and makes the reader love Dinah. I cried at parts of this novel and I laughed in others. It's a genuine work of art and Diamant is to be applauded for her work. Simply beautiful and captivating."},{"rating":"2","title":"An unusual read","review":"This novel is based on the story of Jacob in the Bible, but it is written from a woman's point of view. The story is told by Dinah, daughter of Jacob and his four wives. The Red Tent is where the women go when having their periods or giving birth, so five days out of the month they are in the tent. Not a bad idea if you get bad PMS! Maybe we should bring it back!Anyway, if you are not familiar with the Old Testament of the Bible, you may want to read the story of Jacob first before you read this novel as it will help to make more sense to you. If you are familiar with the Old testament, you will probably enjoy the story more than your typical religious lesson would allow. It is a good way to learn more about the Bible if you find reading the Bible too dry. The author tends to personalize the characters very well which makes them easier to identify with--she makes them more human and realistic. I enjoyed this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a new telling of an old story......","review":"Evoking a marvelous sense of destiny and magic,Dinah's story is told in a fresh and new way, breathes a marvelous way of life in the time of the patriarchs, and a sympathy for all women,bound by love and traditions,definately eye opening!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Historical drama","review":"Brittle preconceptions are largely dispelled within the pages of this warm, wise tale which aims to lift the lid on the secret, precious world of mothers, sisters and daughters."},{"rating":"2","title":"A new angle for the old story","review":"I found this book to be really moving, makes you wonder what kinds of other things may have been really happening in the background of many of the Biblical stories as we know them... also a wonderful story of female relationships... its main detractor is the confusing nature of the names and relationships, which was solved in the edition I have by a family tree in the front cover, but even that was sometimes inadequate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Practically sacrilegious","review":"Having a fascination with the historical culture of the Biblical lands and people, and a great respect for the characters in the Bible, I really looked forward to reading this book. I was disappointed and even occasionally horrified to see the author's treatment of these characters. What surprised me was that I would have expected her to have treated these people--her spiritual forefathers--with the reverence they deserve. (Do we really need to hear about Jacob's wedding nights?)I threw my copy away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why all the fuss?","review":"I read \\"The Red Tent\\" several months ago and wondered \\"why all the fuss\\". I was reluctant to recommend it to my book club, but, someone else mentioned they had heard good things about the book, so, read we did. After the second time, I feel exactly the same way - why bother? - the rest of my group were even less enthusiastic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing--I expected more richness and depth","review":"Can Ms. Diamant write well? Absolutely! Is the story compelling? Yes. But given that she has written a half dozen books on Jewish life I was expecting a story about the richness of Jewish history--something that would be fitting of the patriarchs and their women. I realize that they were far from perfect, but nonetheless, they grasped their faith well enough to hand it down the generations to reach to the twenty first century. Yes, Jacob's wives worshiped the Mesopotamian gods of the time, but I think that he had to have explained his own developing faith in his God to his wives and children, and that didn't come through in this story. Furthermore, I expected that Diamant would describe what to me is the crux of Dinah's life story; the struggle children have with adopting their parent's faith versus finding their own faith. She missed out by not elaborating this timeless dilemma--thus creating an interesting, but rather superficial story."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was just too much","review":"I was drawn in by the premise of the book, about the little-known Dinah from the bible. It is fascinating how the author takes this sentence and produces a whole novel and life for Dinah----it reminded me alot of how the book Ahabs Wife was written about a woman mentioned in about two sentences in Moby Dick. Like Ahabs wife,this added a new dimension to the original story. This book is fairly fast-paced and easy to read, and spoken in the first person which I am partial to.However, I must say I was disgusted by the detail in the graphic parts......I can see once or twice, but the descriptions of bodily functions got downright redundant. I agree with the readers who compared this to a romance novel.Be prepared for this if you should choose to pick this book up.All I have last to say is to the reader \\"Moon\\" below me----maybe you need to take a dictionary and memorize the word \\"opinion\\"......and realize that people JUST MIGHT have a different one from yours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"After years of hearing about this book, I had great anticipation of literature at its finest. While the story is compelling, it is written like a romance novel. If you are expecting great spiritual insight with little physical indulgence, you will be disappointed. It has little spiritual insight, and a lot of \\"earthiness.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Sacrilegious to an LDS","review":"Too sexually disrespectful to me towards women. I do love the Bible story, however, I did not like how the author added so much sex into this book...to me, it was very sacrilegious the wonderful Bible story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Red Tent","review":"This book was a wonderful interpretation of the Bible Story of Jacob and his family. Anita Diamant reads between the lines of some of the questionable bible stories, and fills in what others may have suspected. It is a modern interpretation of bibical stories, which I suspect is exactly the way that the bible was interpreted throughout the ages. We will never know the truth about what really happened, but this view seems much more likely than the one we are led to believe in the Bible. It's hard to believe that the Bible in its present form is the divine word of God, with all the horendous crimes that were justified in it. Anita tells it the way we would assume the story of Dinah must have happened in her affair with Shalem at Shechem."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Perfect Gift For A Mother, Daughter, Sister, or Aunt","review":"Anita Diamant does a great job of retelling the story of Dinah from the book of Genesis. The story is told in Dinah's voice and from the point of view of the women around her. This is a story about mothers, daughters, husbands, and sons. I specifically liked the details about the food and farming, social organization, and medical practices of the time. I was able to easily imagine the caravans, midwives, artisans, and slaves.This would be a difficult read for those who take the bible literally -- but for me, it makes me wonder what the bible would read like if it were written by women.This is a clever idea -- I like it when a author retells a story from a different perspective. I recommend Sena Jeter Naslund's, \\"Ahab's Wife\\" and Jeanne Rhy's, \\"Wide Sargasso Sea\\" if you are interested in a different perspective from either of the classic tales: \\"Moby Dick\\" or \\"Jane Eyre.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must-Read for All Women","review":"We don't know much about the women in the Torah, since it is mostly told from the viewpoint of men. This fictional account of Dinah and her mothers may not be historical fact, but since it relies heavily on facts in the Torah up until the murder of Dinah's \\"husband\\", it can almost be taken as history.The Red Tent also had a couple of passages that actually made me cry, not an easy thing to do with words."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fit only for kindling","review":"This book does a horrible diservice to the Word of God. Among other things, it had quite a few significant Biblical inaccuracies in it. Dinah was raped, not fell in love and had premarital sex. The Bible doesn't depict Joseph as bisexual. The book portrays God as cruel, glorifies pagan goddesses, and describes bestiality by the shepherds. The author didn't even try to base the book on the Bible (but felt it was okay to \\"borrow\\" their characters). When I looked at Anita Diamant reader's notes for the book, she states \\"My research focused on the everyday life of women in this period of history, in the ancient Near East. I did not study the Bible or rabbinic sources, but concentrated instead on the food, clothing, social organisation, architecture, and medicine of the era (c. 1500 BCE).\\" The sad thing is some people will read the book and mistakenly think it is Biblically accurate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a true Christian Fiction","review":"While this book is beautifully written and presents a unique persona-point-of-view, it does not fit into the category of Christian Fiction by definition. Most Christian fiction presents a person in situations that lead him into a more intimate relationship of God and Christ. While this book portrays interesting facts about cultural practices of societies in Biblical times, it does not do as I described above. It also greatly deviates from the Biblical descriptions of Jacob and his family. Rebecca was not a pagan prophetess and Joseph was not a petty man full of himself and his power while a vizier of Egypt. I don't believe this book should be listed under the category of Christian fiction. It is misleading."},{"rating":"1","title":"HUH? No storyline to follow-","review":"It went on and on until I could not take much more and stopped at page 136, lord knows I tried to get through it. It was so boring and the writing style was boring boring boring.It was so confusing, who is who and who is having sex with who and I was at the point that I was so totally bored and confused by this book I had to return it to the library before I even dared try to continue."},{"rating":"1","title":"A look at reality","review":"The author has written a fascinating novel. However, it is extremely important to realize that it is only a novel. She has taken the stories of the Bible and using her own words and thoughts has created an extremely distorted version of the lives of our Patriarchs and Matriarchs. In many places she directly contradicts the Bible and its commentaries. It is important to note that these people were extremely holy and G-D fearing people whose lives were dedicated to serving their creator NOT random gods and goddesses as the author depicts. It is audacity to try and bring their lives down to our level and to try and portray how their lives were. G-D only wrote the stories that would teach us how to live our lives, not a word more not a word less. Furthermore, in no Biblical source do we learn about their personal inner physical relationships and it is an embarrassment to them to make it up.

WHile Ms. D. is a talented writer, she did not research this book accurately at all. The book has a huge anti-male bias. In fact, the only men who are portrayed positively are Shechem (the rapist), Esav (a murderer she describes as a \\"baby-faced cutie\\") and Dina's eventual Egyptian lover. It is interesting to note that Ms. Diamant is married to a convert. Maybe she does't like Jewish men? (In her book they are all stupid, spaced-out, smelly, sexually selfish, and self-centered). I wish she would have read Genesis before writing this. It is completely fictional, and not at all reflective of what occurred, namely the rape of a CHILD! (Dina was 8 at the time)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous!","review":"I started this book but never finished it, after being greatly bothered by the biblical discrepancies in this book. It's one thing for the author to \\"fill in the gaps\\" and provide a work of fiction based on biblical fact, but it's a whole other deal for the author to change biblical fact to fit her work of fiction. Dangerous!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Altered and sometimes perverted","review":"I chose to read this book, because I usually love fictional stories that elaborate on Bible stories. I like to imagine what it must have been like had I actually lived at that time. However, I was disappointed with this book, because the known Biblical facts were altered--several of them. The only known Biblical fact concerning Dinah, the main character of the book, is that she was raped. This is not the story line. Another reason that I did not like this book was that the father of the nation of Israel, Jacob, is not presented in a light that I would say was respectable. If you are considering this book for a \\"Christian\\" read, think again. The facts are altered, even perverted at times, and the One True God is overshadowed in this book by other gods and idols worshipped by the women of the Red Tent."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like poor writing and soap operas, this is for you.","review":"In sophomoric prose, the author attempts to recreate what life was like for women in Biblical times. For example, the phrase she uses to describe women nursing their children is \\"giving suck.\\" It describes the story of Dinah who had sexual relations with Sechem outside of marriage. Later Sechem and his father Hamar try to make reparations offering both the traditional bride price for Dinah and a marriage between Dinah and Sechem. Jacob, Dinah's father agrees. Later, Dinah's brothers renege and kill Hamor's male relatives and steal their worldly possessions. This does not portray the Israelites in a very good light by modern sensibilities. But it does open an interesting anthropological window on the times. This is a far more interesting story to google than to get out of this dreary chick-lit attempt at historical fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Biblical Tour De Force Is Offensive to Religious People","review":"To all religious Jews and conservative Christians who are considering reading \\"The Red Tent\\", I issue a warning: you will find the premise of this book deeply offensive, as I have. It takes the biblical narratives of the Patriarchs and Matriarchs of the Jewish people and twists them so that Jacob, Rebecca, Rachel, and Leah are portrayed as idolaters who worship Mesopotamian gods and have only the basest possible morality. It is a feminist \\"retelling\\" of one of the chief stories of Genesis, presenting biblical men in the worst possible light, with Jacob as a greedy, lustful, misogynistic self-seeking weakling. The historical accuracy of this book is also practically non-existant; Rachel is made a blonde, which is obsurd considering that she lived in ancient Mesopotamia, which is today modern Iraq. One of the few saving graces of this book is that the writing is superb; but it is not enough to convince you to wade through this river of lies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misogynist and anti-Jewish","review":"What do you call an author who turns a rape into a love story, idealizes pagan goddesses, and calls Jacob and his sons \\"barbarians\\"? \\"Jewish feminist\\"? Hardly!! Anita Diamant's story mocks and distorts the Torah (and therefore Judaism). Furthermore, if it's now considered \\"feminist\\" to say of Dinah (or any rape victim) that \\"she wasn't raped, she wanted it,\\" then something is very, very wrong indeed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ambilavent Feelings","review":"The Red Tent left me with ambivalent feelings.All in all, I found this an intriguing story.However, as a student of the bible, I was sad to see God left out of this story. Was it a sacrilege to use the revered characters of the bible to spin a tale the likes of \\"Clan of the Cavebear\\"? Or: was this an example for us that the characters of the bible were ordinary people struggling through life just like us? Was the \\"worldliness\\" of this story representative of what a challenge lay before the sons of Abraham in developing faith in the God of their father?Overall, a thought-provoking and entertaining story."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Real Page-Turner!","review":"I was kind of turned off on the concept of the book before I actually started reading it. I thought being a biblical fictionalized story it might be preachy and force the author's values onto the reader. Boy was I wrong. This is a class-A, top notch story told with such deep character development that it was so easy to picture what life was like in the Genesis-times and to picture each of the many characters. I laughed, I cried, I got angry...this book takes you through so many wonderful powerful emotions.I could not put this book down and I am so glad that I read it. We read it in our book club and it was unanimous that it is an excellent novel. I highly recommend it for every female out there who likes to read. You will not be disappointed in the slightest."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Refreshing Take on an Old Story","review":"I liked the point of view of this book, and the very rich description, but did not find it so compelling that I couldn't put it down. I was less concerned with what would happen than with the narrator's perspective. I liked the lesser (female) characters of these age-old tales being given center stage, and look forward to Diamant's next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great style but ......","review":"Diamant paints an elaborate word picture of the world of the patriarchs. Many of her characters are simultaneously captivating and sympathetic. Nonetheless, anyone remotely familiar with the Genesis text can't help but compare the two and find Diamant's story lacking. What makes other historical/biblical works of fiction successful is the writer's ability to transport imaginary characters into an historically accurate setting. Diamant places her imaginary characters into a psuedo biblical setting that completely conflicts with the Genesis text. Hers is a whimpy, whiny Joseph whose rise to power can only be described as serendipitous. Gone is the beauty of forgiveness, \\"What you meant for evil, God meant for good.\\" In its place we are given an old man suffering from Alzheimer's and a son who can't get away quick enough. A story about the life and world of the otherwise little known Dinah was indeed a compelling idea. Too bad, Diamant fell short in her delivery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was not impressed with the content","review":"I started reading this book thinking it would give a visual of the Bible brought to life through the eyes of women. However, I could not get into it as after several chapters I felt it was soft porn for women. This is the second time I attempted this book. I tried several years ago after it was recommended to me and put it down within a few chapters. I now remember why I did not finish the book.The author does a great job from what I read of giving the characters personality, so this is not an opinion on the authors skills, but I just personally did not enjoy the details of the sexual aspects and truly felt it could be rated as soft porn for women."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprised how poorly written it is.","review":"I have heard so many great things about this book and am impressed with the movement that it sparked. I am just so disappointed by how poorly written and confusing this book is. The timeline changes from paragraph to paragraph, though the perspective doesn't, making it difficult to put down and mid chapter."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you have a daughter, read this book!","review":"If you are a daughter, sister, or mother of a daughter, you need to read this book. This book about the life of Dinah, Jacob and Leah's daughter- the only daughter of Jacob's brood-- made me appreciate being a woman in all respects. I also understand the bonds of women even more than I ever have. I am excited about being a mother to my daughter and the incredible responsibility that I have. I hope that I can be as close to her as Dinah was to her \\"mothers\\".This book grabbed me in the prologue and for the few days that it took me to read this beautiful book, I slept, ate, and lived with Dinah. I cried when I finished because I missed the characters and I missed being a part of their lives. There has never been another book that touched me quite like this one. When my daughter is old enough, I will give it to her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not what I expected, but maybe that's good!","review":"I want to say that I loved this book. I bought it to read for a book club that I belong to. Although I am not a fan of historical fiction or religious books, I could not put this book down. I'm ashamed to admit that I went into this book thinking it would be filled with biblical references and perhaps sound \\"preachy\\" because of the characters. It was none of these things. Yes, there are biblical characters, but the author grabs your attention from the beginning and you've but no choice other than to hang on for the ride. Dinah is likable if for no other reason than the fact that she's a survivor.I highly recommend this book. It's full of action, suspense, romance and history."},{"rating":"1","title":"i just didn't get it","review":"i must have been the last woman in the world to read it. all i heard from women (whose literary opinions i usually respect and agree with) was \\"RED TENT IS THE BEST BOOK!\\" even when i was reading it-- carrying it around visibly, strangers would stop me on the city streets of chicago and say \\"RED TENT IS THE BEST BOOK!\\" and now that i've read it, i can't agree. with everyone going on and on about it, i expected a \\"Lovely Bones\\" experience -- one of those rare gift reads when all you think about is the book, and you can't wait to get back to it. not so. *sigh* i just didn't get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much graphic sex with little else","review":"I stopped reading after a few chapters. I understand women were for sex but too much and too graphic. Maybe it got better later."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really interesting book","review":"This book is a fictional book based on actual people in the bible. It was extremely interesting and entertaining. I loved the story line and it was probably one of the most unique books that I have read in a long time. I found myself wanting to open up the bible along side the book to see where the bible ended and the fictional story began. This was a great concept!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Red Tent","review":"This was a great novel! I wasn't judging the book to be accurate to the bible, but read it as a fictional story of history. I truly enjoyed the content and it gave a different view of what women may have went through at that time. I read this in a weekend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hit and Miss","review":"The arrival time was awesome! But half way through book/disc's they began to skip. So I am bummed to have to fast forward threw parts and miss chunks of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just awful.","review":"Didn't know what I was getting myself into. Not my cup of tea. Made several attempts to read and just coudn't do it. Other than the difficulty in actual context and characters (remembering names, etc) I just DID NOT CARE about any of them to keep reading or try to comprehend. And I wanted to like it. But nope, not even a little bit. Did not finish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did this author ever actually read the Torah??","review":"I was interested to read this book after I read the blurb on the back, but was appalled at the writer's ignorance after just the first chapter. I don't think she has ever actually read the Torah, and clearly she is not a practicing Jew, or she would know that we never, EVER, cook a lamb in milk. She would know, too, that none of the matriarchs or patriarchs would ever do this either, since they followed halacha (Jewish law) even before Moses received the Torah. Her storyline was so far gone from anything rooted in Torah (Dinah clearly was raped, so I doubt she could love the rapist), it makes me embarassed that she calls herself a Jew. Don't waste your time with this trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very disappointing book","review":"I had high expectations for this book, but it was flat and insipid. The author rearranged historical fact to suit her story and in the end, it just wasn't interesting at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much sex...a smear of bible character.","review":"This is NOT a book that a true Christian should read. If you love Jesus and you want to keep your mind pure and clean don't even borrow it from the library. I hope none of my children (even the grown ones) ever get ahold of anything like this! It's porn! It's trashy! What would Jesus do? Burn it! It made me sick for weeks and I didn't even read it all. This should never have carried the label of biblical fiction. The was nothing biblical about it but for some of the names."},{"rating":"1","title":"I greatly disliked it.","review":"\\"The Red Tent: A Novel\\" left me with a sour taste in my mouth. I honestly cannot pinpoint why I dislike it, but I deeply know that I do dislike it with a passion. I do not like the fictional liberties author Anita Diamant took, and felt she toyed with Biblical matters. And even though she is Jewish and holds many degrees pertaining to the religion, I felt she didn't tell the Jewish side of the story well. I'm disappointed - I do not recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me","review":"I had to read this for my book club otherwise I would not have read it. It just was too New Age religion for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at all what I expected","review":"I know that everyone raves about this book, but I just thought it was incredibly hard to stomach. For starters, it is poorly written and, at many points, seems contrived. The language is very basic, dull and uninteresting. At some points, she even attempts to throw in some old English to make it feel like Biblical times. Also, the plot line is really difficult to fathom. I am not saying that I disagree with anything she is saying, but, again, the book seems really commercial. It's almost as if an editor came up with the idea, put someone else to work and then forgot to pick someone literate enough to make a lucid point. She is clearly not someone who experienced college and the incredible torrents of college professors beating her essays and general writings to a pulp. Can anyone write a book these days? Maybe I should get started on my novel!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother -","review":"Oh stop it. A pathetic book about a time when women were viewed as less than real people, and accommodated the male world to their own personal detriment. It was awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Misconception","review":"I bought this book with the preconception that it was \\"christian fiction\\". I was disappointed to find that the storyline does not keep the integrity of the Bible and I would consider it secular fiction. If you are a true Christian fiction reader, I would not reccommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Red Tent","review":"This book was slooooooooooooooow! It is 321 pages long and it took to page 205 to even get slighltly interesting. It was very difficult to read this book as a christian. It departs so far from the Bible. If you don't know the characters in the story from the Bible well, you will be very misled! I understood that the book was fictional but why change Bible facts around? It was fine for the author to write about Dinah anything she wanted because she really isn't expounded upon in the Bible but for the author to make Rebecca into some high priestess was going abit far.Aside from changing the Bible truths all around the story was rather sad. The main character Dinah lives a miserable life and in the end she isn't even remembered by her father or brothers which she grew up with.I don't think I'll read anymore books based loosely on the Bible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skipable","review":"I found this book to be boring, annoying, two dimentional, and frequently disgusting. I realize that the old customs are important for the story's telling, but every simile (and believe me there are a lot) compares the setting, the person, or the object to blood, the moon, or something an 'auntie' did.The story drags on and the characters are no more than stereotyes. The action occurs only in what one person said to another. Every sentence is either in past tense, passive, or a descriptive metaphor.If you want a good version of this story, go for the Bible or Joseph and the Amazing Technicolored Dreamcoat. If you want a story about women and religion, read The Mists of Avalon."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you love the G-d of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob...this book will offend you.","review":"First, I apologize for giving this book one star...but that is the lowest rating allowed. I add my voice to the very valid responses in the other \\"one star reviews.\\".....I wish I had read them before I purchased this book. The book is so anti-Semitic that I was shocked to find it was written by a Jewish woman. I don't know how she can love the Torah, and write this book. After reading 76 pages, which is the source of my review, I felt my G-d and His people had been attack. This is the first book I have read were I was suspicious that some of the author's resource material came from old dirty jokes. This book has no redeeming value. For anyone who loves the G-d of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, it borders on blasphemy."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment.","review":"Having read a few reviews on this book I thought it was going to be a wonderfully edifying book, based on the Dinah of the Bible.It is not.The author seems fixated on sex, in various forms: bestiality, incest, you name it, she included it. The book is not in the least biblically accurate, and the liberties the author takes with the characters, events and timeline is sickening."},{"rating":"1","title":"Promising but Blasphemous","review":"Despite being well written and having a very interesting premise, this book was a disappointment overall. Considering how the bible, especially in Genesis, covers hundreds of years within a handful of pages - there is a lot of room for exploration, and even some creative license with such fiction. However, to take figures beloved by the Jewish and Christian communities, and to add things contrary to their known characteristics, is apt to upset some as it did me. Jacob was portrayed as an idolatrous and cowardly man. Sure, he wasn't perfect in real life, but I do wish the author had stayed a bit more true to the Jacob of the Hebrew Scriptures. There was plenty else she could've, and in some cases, did do - to be interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fiction at its best!","review":"This is a wonderful, fictitious story. The Red Tent is a very compelling read. Anita Diamant does a great job with her character development, keeping the reader interested throughout the book. If this was meant to be taken as gospel, it would not be listed as a work of FICTION. Avid book lovers know the difference between Fiction and Non-Fiction. Enjoy this book and get caught up in the story of some amazing women."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazed.","review":"beautifully written, creative, engaging, descriptive, honest....This novel made me proud to be a woman and while reading it, I was more aware of my senses and the world around me. I do not consider this to be \\"truth\\" as many reviewers who hated the book seem to think Diamant advertised it as so. What a joy to read this book. What a celebration of womanhood."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Feminist Fictional Account","review":"This book was a huge disappointment. If you're looking for a book using fiction to fill in the gaps of the scriptural account of Dinah, this book fails miserably. It, in many instances, contradicts scripture and adds some strange ideas of what may have happened (for example; insinuating that Joseph and Potiphar had a sexual relationship)as if the biblical account wasn't interesting enough without adding to it. This book IS well written in style, plot and character development, but it painted all of the men mentioned in scripture in a very negative light while remaining sympathetic to every woman. The Red Tent was not at all what I had hoped for. My advice to the reader is to get it at your local library if you must read it and save yourself a few dollars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful and Amazing","review":"Yes, this book may not be exactly in alignment with the Bible-but the author states this upfront. It is an amazing book about women of a different time, their sisterhood and their hardships. One of the best books I have ever read. It might have been better if the author hadn't connected this book to any characters in the Bible-then some of the reveiwers of this text just just RELAX! They worshipped idols because the majority of people did not know about the Christian God and this is extremely early in the Bible (Genesis when it would have taken place) It is an amazing book about women-a voice almost completely left out of the Bible and a refeshing look about \\"what was really going on\\" in those times. A MUST READ!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous","review":"Can't stop thinking and talking about this book. I have never been pulled into a story as I was with this one. I feel as if I knew these woman personally and I will carry them in my heart for a very long time. Bravo Ms. Diamant...Bravo."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a fascinating perspective!","review":"The major plot points in the book do come directly from the Old Testemant, but that's not what the book is about; it's about the relationships among four women - basically, the equivilent of sisters - who grew up together and who married the same man and who all raised their children together - the rivalries, jealousies and interpersonal relationships they have with each other. Yes, it makes Jacob and Issac look pretty bad - and of course, Jacob's sons never have come off looking like good guys, given the whole Joseph story, but the failings of the men and women in these ancient times makes them more human. Judaism does not have saints, and I have never expected any of the Patriarchs or Matriarchs to be holy in every minute of their lives - which may be why I was willing and able to suspend disbelief."},{"rating":"2","title":"Diamant makes up for what the boys left out","review":"This was a compelling read--easy, interesting, and thought provoking. Historically, it's plausible and that means that the \\"willing suspension of disbelief\\" is effortless. As I went through the Bible reading about Jacob and family and compared that with what Diamant wrote, it raised more questions. How much more could we understand if only we had a better perspective on what the distaff side of the equation experienced?Want food for thought? This is THE book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Startling myth","review":"I found this book fascinating. The cultural details were wonderful--I found the lack of any clear dividing line between our traditional understanding of early Hebrew peoples and what a religious person might call pagan roots very thought-provoking. My book club rushed to the Bible to see what was said there about these characters. The power and mystery of these women was amazing--it made me think about how much women lost by being in a nuclear family in the Western sense in the last couple of hundred years, rather than part of large extended groups of mothers, cousins, daughters, servants--something only partly regained as women have fought for eqality in the modern age."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Red Tent","review":"This novel was a great read. I always hated the thought of men having more than one wife, but now I have an understanding of why and how women could make it work years ago. The Red Tent was hard to put down and I couldn't wait to discuss it with a friend. Superior writing with an excellent story to tell."},{"rating":"1","title":"porn??","review":"As many others, I was expecting a historical fiction story and was excited to read it.I was shocked and disappointed at the graphic and needless descriptions of the sexual activities and such.I am a Bible-believing follower of Jesus Christ and was feeling quite ashamed and disgusted as I read on, hoping it would get better.Needless to say, this is obviously not a book I will be finishing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only the best!","review":"I was amazed with this book. Knowing the Bible well, it tied in with it but in a different way and made the characters very real and very human. Relgion was not emphasized but touched upon. The times came to life with sights and sounds. The author was able to evoke all of those sensations so smoothly and effortlessly. I felt like I was there and knew the characters. That's how great the book is. I highly recommend it. Read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting story","review":"Interesting story, but the writing was disappointing. I didn't get a sense of being there, of feeling for or caring about the characters. I felt like a distant observer, and never felt involved. The story had potential, Diamant missed it..."},{"rating":"2","title":"An incredibly moving historical journey...","review":"This book just blew me away. I was very skeptical about the topic at first, but Diamant's writing sucks you into the story immediately. The bond between the women in this story is completely compelling and believable, and this book puts a fascinating spin on the relationships only hinted at in the Bible. Dinah is an incredible protagonist whose desire to love and be loved is at once her undoing and her salvation. Her survival is inspiring. The end of this book had me in tears. Beyond Biblical and beyond purely historical, this book is a moving testament of one family and the things that bind them together and tear them apart. A must read, in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"loved it!","review":"I really enjoyed reading about this Old Testament character that is only mentioned briefly in it's original story. The artistic liberty taken in this story is done well."},{"rating":"2","title":"I didn't want this book to end","review":"I loved this book. Having attended an all girls orthodox yeshiva, this brought our forefathers and foremothers to light. I also have a daughter named Dina, so I found this book very real and personal."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Red Tent","review":"Delightful reading. View of the past I have never seen before, from Women's perspective, in lieu of mens. I have read the story of Jacob many times but this presents an entirely different picture. Learned a lot and I want to read more. I delighted in the fact that the men of the time saw the Red Tent as a place of woe and exclusion for the women HOWEVER the women let the men think that --keeping for themselves the fact it was a place of refuge and love and relief from the day to day drugery of tending the house, husband and children.The reading made me proud of woman's ability to bend and survive and thrive. The same feelings of pride that was aroused by my reading ofTwo Old Women, by Velma Wallis."},{"rating":"2","title":"INTERESTING","review":"I found this fictional rendition of an old Bible history interesting. I was not cought up in its accuracy as much as how the author imagined the people would feel, react, and behave at that time. To that end, the book added also to my insight. While I thought the preoccupation with sex was excessive, perhaps tribal people who were concerned about their very survival and existance were more focused on procreation. The author portrays the times as brutal, fairly lawless, and very sad - an interesting insight. The treatment of the God of Jacob (EL) was also enlightening. Sometimes the Biblical accounts abbreviate the process leading to devotion and worship of Jahweh. Noting that the god of the people was the one who promised the most and made good on that promise seemed to be a realistic development. The people were not focused on El but, at that time, working on developing an identity in the world whcih eventually lead to Judiasm."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating!","review":"This was another book I picked up for a road trip and listened to it in the car. I wasn't certain I'd like the book, but I found myself looking forward to driving as I listened to the story. Others have mentioned the story line, so I won't go into it, but I can't say enough about it. Loved it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Book.","review":"This is a beautiful book to share with other women. It captures the overwhelming beauty of sisterhood and the mystic of being a woman. It makes you think about how history would have been written if women were given the chance to have a voice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hooked from the get go!","review":"Hooked from the beginning...such an interesting story...the story is narrated clearly and cleanly...one voice....easy read...great story. Reading it for a book club, wasn't sure about the choice, but it's proved to be a great read! Such an inspirational book on the power of being a woman. Also interesting it brings up the question of how many stories in the bible are only told from the male perspective...very thought provoking!"},{"rating":"2","title":"totally blown away","review":"I was totally blown away by this book. I couldn't put it down. I didn't start reading it when I first got it but boy, it took my me sometime to realize what the women of the Bible had to do. It was emotional, funny and dramatic too. a mixture of alot of emotions in this book. After your done, this book will stay with you and I'll bet at one point in your life you will want to read it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deftly manages to avoid too many New-Agey cliches","review":"I found that this book, while hardly the miracle of fiction my friends told me it was, was a satisfying and educational read, with a gratifying ending and excellent consistency of voice. The characters are solid, and it is an interesting and rich historical snapshot. The narrator is a fascinating character who puts us very close to the story. The Red Tent is a beautiful and detailed read, and the author manages to keep just on the good side of New-Ageiness without sacrificing the spiritual qualities of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprised","review":"Didn't think I would like this book because of the religious aspect. However, I couldn't put it down once I started it. Excellent read. Highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Red Tent","review":"Excellent Read! This book demonstrates the closeness of women during a time when women were relegated to \\"The Red Tent\\", for a perfectly natural happening. However, during this time they were in control, the tent was their's alone and men were forbidden to enter. It is here they share their secrets, dreams and desires. There are also pitfalls, they must, and do work through. It is about love, hate, lust, desire and the ultimate friendships between women. I recommend this book for everyone, men and women."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many characters","review":"There were too many characters and the author insisted on telling you exactly what every one of them was doing on every given moment of the day. I really wanted this book to be good and wanted to see where it was going to go, but I couldn't keep up with all the characters. Most of them seemed pointless. I put it down about half way through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not for me","review":"It may or maynot have been a good representation of life for women at that time, but it just did not appeal to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like reading a biblical trash novel.","review":"Every person I knew praised this book. I thought to myself, why not, and give it a try. I felt that the idea behind it was good, but the literature read like reading a women's trash novel. I actually listened to this book on tape and at times I felt I had a soap opera on. If trash novels and soap operas aren't for you, skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looking to build your faith? Read the \\"original\\"!","review":"Though I did like the author's writing style I was disappointed to see my \\"heroes in the faith\\" from the bible trivialized and in most cases even distorted. The people who praised Ms. Diamante's insight into biblical events appear to me as not having read the \\"original\\". If she was trying to just write another story, she did a well enough job, but I don't think that this book will inspire women out there about God or his word - if anything, it will make them more cynical about the roots of judaism and christianity... I would not recommend the book to christian believers out there - some sexual parts are too graphic, and again, are trivializing people we admire...too bad, this story could have really made an impact!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't finish it","review":"Could not finish it. Too many men having sex with the goats/sheep. Blaaack! And totally not according to the Biblical account."},{"rating":"2","title":"well done","review":"Half way through this book, I discarded it. I was sick of reading about the menstrual cycle and birth details of the women in Jacob's tribe. However, I always finish a book, so I picked it up again some weeks later. Taking a fresh view, I became transported to the biblical world of women and was surprised at the richness of their lives. Not being a biblical scholar, I knew nothing of the story of Dinah and was horrified. I checked the bible - the authors story relates to valid passages. I am impressed at the author's skill in using her knowledge of biblical lifestyles to tell Dinah's life story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Diamant is nervvy, and I like that!","review":"I love it when author's refuse to pander to their readers, and Anita Diamant is a great example of an author who doesn't. This book is fresh & I know Diamant never wondered how a particular subject matter/topic/phrase in her book would \\"sell\\" or be perceived."},{"rating":"1","title":"clever invention of traditions.........","review":"This is a passingly interesting story about the lives of women in Biblical times. It was supposedly based on historical facts, but that proves to be inaccurate. Many of the times, places and traditions are clearly just clever inventions by the author to move her novel along. If you read this as pure fiction, as the story of a diverse family of women experiencing both the harsh realities, joy and hardship of their time it is entertaining. If read with an eye toward any historical accuracy, it will be disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely wonderful","review":"This book pulled me in and held me spellbound until I finished it. From a single mention of Dinah's name in the bible, Anita Diamant brought a whole world to life. Dinah's story is the story of all the women whose names and voices have been lost or intentionally silenced by over two thousand years of patriarchial religion. Her story, with all its physical and emotional details of womanhood, is simply beautiful. Diamant's writing is smooth and often lyrical, celebrating women and the work of home and family. A beautiful, beautiful book that I highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Good Book!","review":"I really liked this book. It did have a tendency to brush past many years to get to another point, but it really didn't hinder the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very enjoyable","review":"This book started at a very slow pace giving a lot of background and setting the stage for the second half. I almost gave up wondering if it was actually leading anywhere. Then Diamant drops the bomb and book rips into gear. She creates an idyllic world for her main character's upbringing. Raised by her \\"mothers\\", the women's lives are largely segregated from the men's. The men have different lives and different values, competitive and violent. The women, in contrast, nurture and share, and you can see the importance of feminine values and the consequences of ignoring these values. In everything there must be balance and this book reminded me how dangerous an unbalanced world can be."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I was intruiged with the idea when I heard about it. Of writing about the Dinah of the Bible. I was severely disappointed by the book. I was disgusted by what I perceived was the unbalanced focus on sex and all types and elements of it. Presented apart from the meaningfulness of the rest of life and interactions among humans. I avoid the soft porn romance novels because of this type of thing. I want relationships, not cartoon characters. The people, women and men, didn't talk or behave like anyone I know or have ever met. I enjoyed finding out more about daily life back in that time, but would've done better to find it out from a non-fiction book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Christian readers","review":"This book does not accurately represent the Biblical stories it uses. If you are going to read it, I would recommend reading the scriptures that tell these stories before hand so you can see all of the embellishments the author added for what they are."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Earthy Tale","review":"I cannot fault the writer on her unusual approach to the tale of Jacob's wives and the story of Dinah. However, the story seemed to be an unveiled advertisement for the Wicca religion instead of supporting the historical approach given in the Bible. By the time Dinah began her menses cycle and I labored through the graphic earthy account of thier pagan ritual my stomach was queasy. As a Christian I was offended that the \\"bad\\" guys were the men that opposed the pagantry. I would not recommend this book to anyone and am sorry I spent the money for my copy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The Red Tent had great potential. The Bible contains many stories that when fleshed out could make wonderful novels, and Anita Diamant seems to have done quite a bit of research into the time period. But, she ultimately failed to enthrall me. I think the problem for me seems to have been that Anita Diamant has never met a righteous man or woman, and seems unable to imagine one. True, every human has weaknesses, but Ms. Diamant seems to think that all people have the weaknesses (and to the degree) that she portrays. This book is disappointing to those who expect prophets of God and their wives to act differently---to have at least some knowledge of God's commands and to be striving to be better or come closer to God."},{"rating":"1","title":"a slow read","review":"This was an interesting book because I usually don't touch religous books at all, but it was different, hard to get through at the end however."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Red Tent","review":"I found this to be a wonderful story concerning relationships between women as well as mother/daughter relationships.

My mother said she loved it. I was excited to see that the book was about Jacob and his sons since I love the story of Joseph. But nothing much happens in this book until about page 206 of 336 pages. And even then, it's not all that exciting and not a lot comes of it. The book seems to be about women getting pregnant, not getting pregnant and having babies. What's the hype about? Skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Christians Beware!!!!","review":"I wanted to read this book when I found it on favorite books lists of those who I have a lot in common. I was shocked in the first chapter how \\"off base\\" the author is. I understand that this is a work of fiction. But I take offense when the basis for the fictional story is the Bible and the fictional story is so vulgar. I understand that the people mentioned in the Bible did not lead perfect lives. Please do not make a mockery of the sacredness of the Bible. If you wnat to read some quality Biblical fiction check out Francine Rivers' books on Tamar, Ruth, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"amaaaazing","review":"This book made me want to have a baby... right here, right now and right outside.

Thank you Anita!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Most Boring Book","review":"I was assigned to read this for an Old Testament class. This book was so boring that I literally started to cry because I didn't want to read another page. There is no plot! Just ramblings that go on and on and on.

I really wanted to like it but it lacked enough emotion for me to continue on. I felt the writing was poor and dis-jointed. Like another reviewer said, it was every other sentence of \\"so and so begat so and so\\" as well as birth and after birth with very little emotion. The Red Tent had a great deal of promise but sadly failed to pull me in enough to keep going."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete fiction, not a biblical account.","review":"Although the book was an interesting read, it was very disappointing. It was not a biblical account and missed every opportunity to reflect on the positive in the people who were the beginnings of the Jewish/Christian faith. I will agree that there is a lot of scandalous and negative behavior in the early historical accounts of the bible, but this book made every attempt to dramatize and scandelize while omittimg anything edifying. There was no respect given to the God of Abraham and that I have to say was the most disappointing part. There are way better books that are interesting to read, give an accurate historical background, AND hold true to the integrity of the Word of God."},{"rating":"1","title":"LibraryLady","review":"This book was good as a \\"story\\", however, read it with the understanding that is it a story told from the perspective that Dinah and none of the women in Jacob's life believed in God and only God.

The novel has a distinctive feminine focus that adds an interesting layer absent in the Bible story. Understand that it is a fictionalized version of the story and you should enjoy it very much!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just wonderful","review":"This may not be the most in-depth review you will ever read, but it is heartfelt.

I have to say that it is a must read for every woman. Truly amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Rare Treasure. Five stars are not enough!","review":"The story of The Red Tent has squeezed my heart, captured my breath and has kept my in or near to tears from the first page to the very last. It has been an honor for me to go through this very emotional up and down journey with Dinah and all the other characters in this story. Every person in this books has had a tale to tell. The author has done an amazing job of doing that for each one of them, and in a way that will stay with the read for a long time to come. She has given an amazing and wonderful voice where there was none. I think Dinah would be please with the story and remembrance she has been given. I can't compliment this book enough. If you only read one thing, read The Red Tent. You will not regret it. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A female view of biblical times","review":"Though, I know that this is fiction, it's interesting to see the parts played by various women in Jacob's life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable...","review":"I liked this novel because I like historical fictions. It had some very slow parts. It was not a book that I started reading and could not put down. It was a slower read than I wanted it to be. But, I enjoyed the subject matter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Revisiting my library...","review":"Was perusing the books in my library and deciding which I would pass on or reread someday.There is was...'The Red Tent', a gift from my daughter years ago. Certainly, I remembered how much I enjoyed this novel and how it gave me some understanding and knowledge of women and families in the Old Testament.Having read thru the Bible a number of times, it was a very enjoyable historical novel complement.I went to look at my review here on Amazon and alas! I didn't provide one.So here it is, better late than never, minus little minutiae that could have added to the review.A lot to be said when you decide to revisit a novel!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Inaccurate and crude.","review":"I wish I read more reviews before I bought this book.I didn't read it all because after a while it just put me off completely.I was expecting a book like Redeeming Love but this book is anything but...The author invents things like Jacob worked seven months, instead of seven years, and their actions are anything but Christian like, such as having sex with animals... And constant bad mouthing of characters.I don't think I ever disliked a book as much as I do this one..This book left a bad taste in my mouth and made me feel sick ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Ted Tent","review":"This was a great discussion book club choice for women.Alas, this exclude more than half of population.Characters were painted too simple, especially men. There was no rich Tapestry only cotton rags.It will provide discussion of many topics."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Red Tent","review":"The Red Tent is one of the best books I have ever read! It was plausible, and it taught me a lot about the women of this period. I think every woman should read it. I enjoyed it so much, I bought my step-daughter a copy so she could read it. Everyone I know who has read the book has loved it! Anita Diamant shows an incredible talent for story telling in this book. I look forward to reading more of her books."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite books ever.","review":"Loved the feminine perspective of story. This author has such a beautiful style of telling a story. Would put this in my top 5 reads of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Female Fiction","review":"This goes at the top of my reading list. I love this book, and I have recommended it to many of my friends. It was a gift to me from my best female friend, and I have given it as a great read to many of my other friends. It think it would also make a great book-group read.Highly recommend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read","review":"I found The Red Tent a highly approachable, entertaining, yet serious read. A feminist novel without bashing you over the head with it, the character of Dinah holds the readers interest while giving a unique perspective into well-known biblical stories. This book has a lot of depth to it, teaching the reader while it entertains."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read.","review":"It may take a while to get into this story but it's well worth the effort. I read this book a year and a half ago and I still think about it now and then. All the women that I've shared this book with agree that it's the best book they've read in the past few years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting interpretation of bible character.","review":"I took a long time to read this book. It was on my list to read and so glad I finally decided to read it.I loved the interpretation of Dinah and what her life was probably like in that time. I loved the historical lives of the women and the close relationship they had as women. My favorite type of book to read is historical novels and this filled the need for that type of book. Great Read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Red Tent","review":"The Red Tent will take you back in time. The story is so vivid and compelling that you feel you are right there experiencing it all. You feel every emotion of every character. The landscape so realistic and mesmorizing you will actually see a vivid picture in your mind. Excellent story. Worth every moment. I was transfixed. The Red Tent is one of those books you come back to time and time again and each time you get something more out of it. Anita Diamante is a superb story teller."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Journey Into History","review":"When I started the book, I thought it might be a lot of history with confusing character names to remember. Once I was two to three pages into the story, I couldn't put it down. One of the best books I've ever read. After I finished, I picked up the Bible and was amazed that some events were spoken about. A truly talented author to shed light on the shadows of such a well known story - completely believable."},{"rating":"2","title":"A touching look at the lives of women in Biblical times","review":"I really enjoyed this book. Diamant does a good job of weaving together accounts in the Bible, history, and her own imiagination to create a story about women and what their lives might have been like during Biblical times. To those reviewers who have complained that The Red Tent does not mirror accounts in the Bible, my answer would be that this novel is a new creation, based loosely on the Bible and what we know of historical fact from this time period.The characters' lives illustrate the challenges women faced, including their positions and duties within the society, the limits that were foisted upon them, and the roles of both faith and special talents/gifts within their stories. Don't read this book expecting rote regurgitation from the Bible. Rather, be prepared for an imaginative, rich, and detailed story set during Biblical times and depicting some Biblical characters. A good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Do NOT Recommend this book","review":"As a fairly conservative Christian and supporter of feminism, I am deeply offended by this book. The author takes broad liberties with the biblical family history of Leah and Jacob, and seems inclined to satisfy her own personal agenda. By doing so, Ms Diamant paints an unfair portrait of a society of women that are, in a sense, one dimensional; it would appear woman (or at least this one particular woman, Dinah) is prone to make life-altering decisions on the superficial characteristics of how a man looks. I am also greatly offended by the pagan spirituality that these \\"women of the red tent\\" supposedly protect, nurture and revere amongst a strictly monotheistic, Jewish society - hardly plausible but then again this is fiction.I will agree that Ms Diamant is an outstanding writer. I just wholly oppose calling this a 'christian' fiction as Ms Diamant has simply used a biblical text as her launch pad to a undermine and confuse a judeo-christian worldview."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Thought","review":"While the book was well reviewed by others I was disturbed by the lack of veracity of actual Biblical history included in the novel. The continual representation of gods and goddesses was also disturbing. When I read the summary review for the book it seemed as if it was a fictional account of a real woman mentioned in the Bible. So as a Christian I looked forward to reading the book. But it was not at all what I thought it would be. It was all fiction and misrepresented the main character."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not necessarily a \\"Christian\\" book","review":"While I thought this was an extremely good book, I wouldn't consider it a Christian book. Yes, it deals with Biblical times and SOME of it may be fact, but alot of it is fiction... It's a good read if you can remember that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bad it's an AUDIO book","review":"The material of this book appears to be interesting, and the novel would probably be quite enjoyable. But the audio tape is greatly damaged by the breathless, over dramatic style of Ms. Bilger, the reader. Often emphasizing the wrong word or the wrong syllable, Ms. Bilger distorts the meaning of the text to the point where this listener could not even make it though the first tape!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING","review":"Many people have written about the inaccuracies of the bibilical nature of the book. I simply found the stories of these women BORING and PREDICTABLE. There is no depth or realness to any of the characters. Each sister represented a type of woman and each of them responded to every situation in exact way one might expect. BORING. I did not bother finishing."},{"rating":"2","title":"I was quite prepared to dislike this book.","review":"It was chosen for my general fiction book group, and I thought, \\"Oh, great. Another navel-gazer in which women complain about men and commiserate over cramps and bloating.\\" Imagine my surprise when it turned out to be an imminently readable story about Dinah, daughter of Jacob. Granted, Jacob doesn't fare very well in this book, and there is quite a bit of general male bashing, but the well-written prose and clever use of a classic Bible story as a jumping off point for an examination of women's relationships in a polygamous tribal society make the book a worthwhile read.Caution: This is not a scripturally faithful recounting of Dinah's story, so don't use it as a Sunday School text, or the church elders will want to have a word with you. :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"What would you do if you were married to one of the first?","review":"I found Anita Diamant's answer to the question of the first generations of women married to the first few generations of Jewish men extremely interesting--they didn't drop their affiliations to the goddesses the first time their husbands suggested there was only one God. And what they did keep--and perhaps we've kept somewhere in our collective feminine conscienciousness--was shrouded in the Red Tent. I found her investigation of what might possibly have transpired between the lines of the Biblical stories a delight and an inspiration to someone who is also a writer (\\"Forever Retro Blues\\"). At any given moment it was difficult to put down. I shared Dinah's pain at the loss of her first love, the loss of her son. This was really a worthwhile read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"I particularly enjoyed the first part of this book. I could not put it down. Overall a very interesting and well written book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Empowering","review":"I loved this book. I was entertained, and, to a certain extent, educated. The fictional world created by Diamant seemed very plausible, and the book reminded me that throughout the history of the world the contributions and knowledge of women have been frequently ignored and/or forgotten. Through its fictional portrayal this book reminds me that just because it was not written down or remembered, it does not mean it did not exist. To the reviewers who complained that its \\"not like the Bible\\" - the book IS FICTION, and, frankly, if you can't handle fiction based on what only some people believe to have been fact, then you may need to consider broadening your scope of the world. To quote - \\"there are more things in heaven and earth.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Good and tragic","review":"\\"If you want to understand any woman you must first ask about her mother and then listen carefully.\\"Very interesting book about the lives and customs around 1402 BC in Hebron, where Jacob (the protagonist's father) and his progeny lived. The famous one in the Old Testament is Joseph and his coat of many colours, the gripping story is about Dinah, the only daughter.Sad, tragic, painful, but very well written and absorbing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly Wonderful Book","review":"The Red Tent is a book I've been putting off to read as the story line just didn't really appeal to me. As much as I dearly cherish the Bible, Old Testament charactors were always dry for me and I have stuck to reading mostly the New Testament. I decided to give it a try and boy, was I in for a surprise. The Red Tent brings these Old Testament figures off the dusty shelves of history and brings new life to them as I never could have imagined. Although this is a fictional account and creative liberties have been taken, I look at the Jacob and Rachel story in a whole new light. An amazing story that journeys into the hearts of women, revealing the joys, pains and heartache we all suffer through life. My eyes were filled with tears as I turned the last page and finished the incredbile saga of Dinah."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"The Red Tent\\".","review":"A fascinating tale of women and men borne of Joseph. It truly is as the Bible would have read if written by a woman. It reveals many aspects of the women's lives that were before untold. (Hard to believe this is a novel .) Very believable. It has many unexpected twists and turns. A wonderful read, I didn't want it to end. Hope Anita writes another SOON!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Engrossing","review":"This was one of the most enjoyable books that I have read in a long time. Anita Diamant took a biblical storyline and wove a fictional storyline about Dinah, the daughter of Leah and Jacob. Dinah was given minor attention in the book of Geneis, but in The Red Tent, Dinah is given a respective platform to tell her engrossing tale. Dinah's story shed a new perspective on the traditional story of Dinah and her forefathers and foremothers. The sisterhood of women is strongly developed in this story. I would recomment this book to anyone who grew up on the stories of the bible as a child, and now gets a chance to view the stories from a more adult and female angle."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the best this year","review":"As historical fiction, The Red Tent has the potential of being offensive to some who do not wish to expand on the literal word of the Bible. The writing, however, is lyrical, and the story of a woman -- a minor character -- in Biblical times is addressed with great sensitivity. Having lived in that part of the world, I was able to see many aspects of modern Middle East culture reflected in the book, and this made the book far more believable for me. I savored this book, which is not something I do often. I would recommend it to anyone, man or woman, who would be willing to explore its topics with an open mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Book I've Ever Read","review":"This was one of the most wonderful books I have ever read. It was so exciting to be able to tie it in with the Bible and know that these people were real. It was so hard to remember that it was fiction. I found this to be a very powerful and moving book. I borrowed it from a friend to read but now I'm buying it so that I can have a copy for myself and to share with other friends and family members. I would recommend this book to any women who enjoys history and would like to find out a little about the lives of women from the past."},{"rating":"2","title":"great condition. quick delivery.","review":"The book was in excellent condition. Looked brand new. Delivery was quick. I was exremely pleased."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd require this book for women's studies. It's also a great read!","review":"Anita Diamant has written a story, of our history as women. This book has been on my shelf for several years. I'm somewhat protective of \\"The Red Tent\\". I feel like it is a scared part of my history as women. I love to read, and \\"The Red Tent\\" is definitely in my list of top 10 books. I'm disappointed that \\"The DA Vinci Code\\" is quickly made into a movie, when such a wonderful book as this is ignored. We need a \\"Red Tent Society\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"I only wish the red tent was still around!","review":"I'm not religious. What I know about the bible, I know from being preached to by pius people, television & grandparents.The story of Jacob was completely new to me, and while reading this book I rented the religious film \\"Jacob\\" to compare the stories... The book was awsome, but I'm glad I compared it to the patriarchal version of events, because I realized how horribly unrealistic the \\"biblical\\" story was, compared to this work of fiction.It's a wonderful story that should be read by every woman... especially those who take their priveledges & rights for grantid."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is my favorite book","review":"My mother recomended this book, and I can read it again and again with out getting bored. In most books I have to skip through the boring parts, but in this... I've read it three, four times and I've loved it each time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Contradicts biblical story. Also base in places.","review":"Historical fiction usually fills in around known facts. If you know Genesis, you will note many contradictions to the scripture. This was very disappointing to me and detracted from the story. Paganism is glorified and the fathers of the Christian and Jewish faith are shown as people who don't even like their own faith. If you like wholesome books, parts are not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Biblical Characters are Mis-represented","review":"I recognize that this is a work of fiction, but it would seem that the author should be true to the documented descriptions of her characters in the Bible. In an effort to tell an interesting story, the author has portrayed many of the characters to be people they never were. If one is going to write a ficitonal novel about this time in history, perhaps one should use fictional characters. Because I have read and studied Genesis, I found it difficult to reconcile the information that I knew to be truth with the story written by Diamant. As I read, I often thought \\"This is a lie\\". While the story was well written, I strongly disapprove of the author's inaccurate description of many of her real life characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"too politically correct","review":"As several other reviewers mention, our congregational book club chose this book as its next subject. I found myself continually weeping at many descriptions, I also felt myself being manipulated by the author. I felt as if Diamant had an actual list of current women's issues (rape, abortion, marital abuse) which she needed to work into the plot. While she is a talented writer, the book might have seemed less contrived had I not begun to take note of and list these various contemporary women's issues to see how many of them she would eventually weave into the story. Yes, I learned a great deal about life in that time and I believe that the book was well researched. Nevertheless, be warned that you will notice every current PC topic in here and most of the men are w/o redeeming qualities. I still think it's worth reading and I'm glad I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"MIsled by seller","review":"The seller advertised this book as new.

I would like this charge taken off my credit card.Mary Ireland"},{"rating":"1","title":"Here's the deal...","review":"I am sure this novel was surprising to some people who have never experienced any variation in their chosen dogma. To those of you who have, however, and especially those of you who have researched menstration rituals, The Red Tent may be a wee bit on the boring side. The character developement was good and I enjoyed the fact that Diamant chose Dinah (only mentioned once in the Bible) to concentrate on. I regard this novel as fluff reading, however. It is mediocre at best with so many other available stories to read (try Anais Nin, Julio Cortazar,for example). Sorry, but maybe a little research ... would lead you to a better buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite disappointed!","review":"After reading the first 7 reviews on this book, I ran right out to Borders and bought it. I thought I would settle in for a great read over Thanksgiving weekend. This book is a disappiontment! It is tedious and boring. The writing style is simplistic, written at a 4th grade reading level.Sure, Jacob married Leah and Rachel. After that, the author made up this wife, that wife, and the next wife; all with strange names. They all bore children with mostly strange names. Next, they each worshipped household gods with strange names. Half of this story is an alphabet soup of names. If I was interested enough, I could keep everyone straight, but I am not.In my opinion, the author took a Bible story, plugged in some basic facts, and ran wild making up the rest.Too bad she didn't make it interesting while she was at it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Put it in the ROMANCE section PLEASE!","review":"OK I admit it! I was fooled by the jacket cover and the many positive reviews. I should have read the negative reviews here first. I have learned my lesson!I was thinking I was buying a historical (biblical based) fiction. WRONG!I probably shouldn't rate this as I am not a fan of romance novels; I am not putting down the genre, it is just not for me.

An excellent depiction of the role women played in Bible history.Created an understanding of some of the mystical practices of that time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good for the bible believing christian","review":"It was an interesting story and very well written. And it certainly was historical FICTION....i think the only thing historical about it was the fact that they used biblical names and places. Dinah was raped, not fell in love and had pre marital sex. I think that alone is an injustice to the real Dinah, to be raped and then have the idea put into the minds of those who read the book that she might have consented. how horrible!! I had to go back and re read the actual account from the bible and while reading the book had to keep reminding myself that it was total make believe, because boy! does it get your feeling stirring!! For the bible believing christian this is a dangerous book to read. For those who aren't, I believe this would be an excelent read."},{"rating":"2","title":"How did Oprah miss this one?","review":"If I died tomorrow, I'd be satisfied with the Red Tent being the last literary piece of material to have crossed my eyes, imagination and soul. Dinah (Anita Diamant) says/writes a little about death and love in the end of this novel - basically, there is no shame in death, it would only be a shame to not have read this book before that circumstance befalls you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly Disappointing...","review":"This is my second series by Rosenberg, and I fear it will be my last. The one thing all his books seem to have in common is an upward trend in Rosenberg's use of vulgar language... all of which is unnecessary, offensive, and highly distractive to this reader. And while his use of foul language has steadily increased, Rosenberg's storylines have just as steadily decreased. The plots have thinned dramatically. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"That is a long hall!","review":"Not unlike Meshuggah's I, Halls of Amenti is a 19min journey through a doomy music wonderland that makes you reassess what you think of one of your favourite metal bands.

The late 1920's was such a period for blues music that had moved from the hard country into the small towns and cities of the South. Bill Bill Broonzy is a well known exemplar of this form. As is Blind Willie McTell. The artist under review, Furry Lewis, is an unjustly lesser known exemplar of the form although he had the benefit of being \\"discovered' as part of the folk revival of the late 1950's and early 1960's. His patented guitar work and versatility shine here is these songs from his \\"classic\\" period. I highly recommend listening to \\"Mistreatin' Mama\\", \\"Jellyroll\\" and \\"Rock Island Blues\\" but the ones you really need to hear (and get the words for) are the two parts to his \\"Kassie Jones\\". This version is worth the price of the whole CD and, perhaps, one of the most interesting variations on that old song from the time of the railroads. Nice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Duane is the king !!!!!!","review":"What can I say, Duane has done it again. The band is a six-piece straight forward punk rock n roll band, with tons of great background gang vocals and three guitarists. If you're already a fan of the U.S. Bombs and Die Hunns then this cd is perfect for you. It's different musically than the Hunns, and not really at all like the Bombs. There are guitar solos, slide guitar, alot of western (cowboy type) refernces, and just plain kick-ass songs. If you like street punk, oi, basically anything except emo and wuss-punk, then order this cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing new here!","review":"The problem with this video is simple, it doesn't tell you anything that isn't already widely known.

The music is a unique blending of Tibetan, classical Chinese and new age music.

I only reserve 5 star ratings for the discs I absolutely can't live without. But that said, this is great. My kids love it (elementary school age). My wife loves is (she's Chinese from Taiwan). I love it (a regular white guy from the Western US).As other reviewers have mentioned, this isn't a CD of Tibettan music. It's a CD of music inspired by Tibet. There are traditional Chinese themes in it and the lyrics are in Mandarin. There are western-inspired new age/ambiant themes in it. And there are some more modern Chinese themes, that I hesitate to call \\"pop\\", but verge on that label.I've never been to Tibet, but have long been fascinated with that region of the world. I lived in East Asia for several years, and this music takes me back there.I can fully recommend this CD, but as others have mentioned, you definately need a nice sound system in an accoustically-appropriate room to fully enjoy this."},{"rating":"2","title":"To People who give it lower than 5 stars","review":"I don't think Dadawa has label herself to be a traditional Tibetan musicians. This is what we call the new music. One merge from the old and find a new style of their own.

I agree with one of the reviewer.. you need a \\"very\\" good system to play her music or you might just blow out your speakers or simply can't enjoy the way this music was made to be.

Although the book is not a training manual, it is a great account that should be read by first time marathoners. Experienced marathoners, on the other hand, will be able to relate to mental highs and lows described by the author during his run. Most amazing, but not covered in depth, was that the author was dedicated enough to train for the marathon, as a \\"bandit\\", during one of the worst winters recorded in New England. That perseverance carries over to pages of Mr. Connelly's book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I liked the comments from the real Boston runners","review":"I bought this book while in Boston and was eager to read it as I was unable to remember much of the course.

Part of the \\"Boston Experience\\" is qualifying. The book gives lots of information of the towns and neighborhoods along the course which is great. Skip the author's acount of his run.

The blades do seem sharp but I believe the flaw lies in the poor quality plastic handles. There's barely any spring action becasue all of it relies on the plastic \\"loop\\" idea at the back. And the blades can't pass tightly together enough to create the kind of friction to cut something as thin as thread or fabric because there's absolutely no pivot screw or anything :( I'm surprise at Fiskars as usually they make quality scissors. My advise is to save your money on this and put it towards a metal pear of thread snips. Nothing beats metal for cutting things :) Gingher makes a lovely pair and Gingher is now owned by Fiskars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Instrumentals. Insipid.","review":"When I bought this, the option to listen to the songs wasn't working. It appears to be working now, but here's my warning anyway: for reasons known only to them, the marketers of this CD chose to not include the words to these songs. This is a CD of melody only--no words. The instrumental rendition is adequate, barely, but for songs like these, who cares? Without the words, Maresy Doats wouldn't even amuse the least promising of toddlers, much less improve their language skills or cetera.I give it two stars because I couldn't bring myself to listen to it twice, and thus may have missed some good point about it or another....but I doubt it.

I was amazed how well the TV version matched my own impression of the book, which has been always my very favourite Dickens novel. The only thing that looked untruthful was that old Betty Higden had very good teeth, which was totally impossible at her age and at that time. But everything and everyone else were absolutely recognizable and amazingly truthful. Unfortunately - and totally unexplainably - that BBC version does not exist on video - as well as, by the way, \\"The Forsyte Saga\\". For anyone who is familiar with the older BBC movie their new attempt to create another \\"Our Mutual Friend\\" cannot be but a total disaster."},{"rating":"2","title":"A phenomenal rendering of complex Dickens characters.","review":"The choice of actors was so apt that the story became real to the viewer. You are taken directly into 19th century England with its collection of villians and heroes. The interplay of the various characters alone is enough to enagage the viewer to say nothing of the brilliant acting. This is an absolute MUST for fans of Charles Dickens."},{"rating":"2","title":"a well executed production that should be released on ws dvd","review":"I bought this video set to see Keeley Hawes and she gave her usual excellent performance as Lizzie Hexam. Having never read the book, or Dickens for that matter I was enthralled to see what would happen to these characters. So much so that I watched the entire series in one sitting on a Sunday afternoon.The performances were first rate. I wish though that the program had been released on widescreen dvd as it was in the U.K. because the full screen format so drastically cut the view of some scenes that at one point in a scene between Lizzie and Eugene all I could see were their noses and the space in between them! It certainly took away from poignancy of the moment. Dickens' story can be dark at times but the world all comes into balance at the end. I highly recommend this series even in this vhs format."},{"rating":"2","title":"Our Mutual Friend","review":"I completly enjoyed this movie.

The very fact that Our Mutual Friend is within this genre makes it appealing to me from the start. Until now, this outstanding (yet relatively unheard of Dickens masterpiece) has only been available on VHS, that is, IF you could even find it (and then you would have paid premium cash for it). The last of Dickens' literary works seems to coalesce all of his remarkable abilities to show the worst and best of a society which was marked by the haves and have-nots with an impassable chasm between. Do you like it when the the evil get their due and the good come out all right?

We purchased the VHS when that came out, and the DVD when it was released. Loved them all - perhaps our favorite adaptation of all time.Unfortunately, the streaming version comes in at exactly 300 minutes - 39 minutes shorter than the original. Those missing 39 minutes include an entire subplot - the Boffins' attempt at adopting a child, that child's extended family, including Sloppy, and how Sloppy and the dollmaker meet, etc. - ALL missing. Several of the plot points no longer make sense without these scenes - how did Bella and Lizzie meet so that Lizzie would want Bella at her wedding?Who is the masked man that haunts Weg?I still rate it 4 stars - but would be five with all the scenes!"},{"rating":"1","title":"another distorted bbc wonder","review":"This dvd is unwatchable due to the compression and distortion of the picture.

I eagerly watched the adaptation, but I was disappointed to find that it lacked the spirit of the book.

The cast is excellent, plot twisty and entertaining, costumes to die-for, etc. I highly recommend this- beware though, it is very hard not to watch all 6 hours of this DVD in one sitting!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stick with it....It's worth it.","review":"Typical of Charles Dickens tales, this story does not shy away from showing us the seedier side of life. But, that's what makes the good guys so compelling; the contrast to the low-lifes around them. In this case both the low-lifes and the heroes come from all ranks of society, from \\"dust men\\" and river people to the social elite. The contrasting conditions of these different classes is the real crime.Unfortunately, with the pace rather slow and the story line so dark, it may be difficult to get into this movie. I almost turned it off after about half an hour. But, I'm glad I stuck with it. As the characters developed, I was drawn into the story more and more. It ends well also which for me is the real pay off. Charles Dickens is still a little dark for my taste, but, I found this piece very much worth the time to watch it. And, if you are a real C.D. fan, you will want to add this DVD to your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enthralling","review":"I watched this production on Masterpiece Theater and the only bad thing about it was that it was divided into three parts, with the result that I was on the edge of my seat for three weeks. At that time I had not read the novel, but did read it after watching this production. This film was beautifully produced, well-written, well-acted and just purely exciting. It is the best movie I have seen in a long time, on TV or in the theater. These characters are some of the most marvelous Dickens ever created, ranging from eccentric (Silas Wegg) to just plain odd (Mr. Venus) and from very good (Lizzie) to terrifying (Bradley Headstone). This movie has it all: greed, lust, madness, evil, innate goodness, love, romance, and mystery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer BEWARE","review":"This is not the entire movie. It is an edited version. They leave out key characters that add charm to the story. For those who know the movie, you will find that the entire story of the old woman and Sloppy was left out. It was very disappointing because the story is so intertwined that they had to leave out whole scenes. This version shows Bella going to Lizzy Hexham's wedding but does not show how they were introduced. It leaves out the endearing scene of Mrs. Boffin trying to adopt a child, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lamp rebuild","review":"After a lot of searching I found this to reduild the spot light on my bed's headbord.

Less than 1/3 of this 'film' is about Bruce Lee, which features films made when he was a child actor, and a paltry amount of other photos. Then the shmucks who created this 'film' completely forget the 'real' Bruce Lee and show a wanna-be named Bruce Li whose martial arts are marginal at best. After that debacle, we get to watch a poorly made Kung Fu movie featuring another wanna-be named 'Dragon Lee', who, whilst he may physically resemble the real Bruce, is much slower, and his style of Kung Fu rather ornate and silly which the real Bruce thought was a waste. What's really a waste is any money spent on this fraud of a film. The hucksters who threw it together did so withthe obvious intent of duping the public looking for a quality documentary on the one and only late Bruce Lee. It's an insult to his legacy. The shysters who spliced this crap together should be flogged in public. Whatever you do, don't buy this film!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie is great","review":"It is like 2 hours long and it is freaking awesome.The first 90 minutes show Bruce Lee childhood movie clips and while all that is interesting, it gets really good when they start showing the Bruce Li clips. The we get like a full length Dragon Lee movie. I have to say that this has to be the best Dragon Lee movie I have ever seen. He actually does more than 1 kick in succession, cartwheels, and of course he is the closest looking Bruce Lee imitator(at least in facial expressions). His super kick has to be checked out for the special effects alone. If Dragon Lee wasn't a Bruce clone he may have actually been able to make it in the kung fu movie industry.I wouldn't really consider this a movie, but it does turn into a Dragon Lee movie that was almost watchable."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE REAL BRUCE LEE","review":"See Bruce Lee in one of the world's most famous martial arts movies.

It is small, compact, and would be great for a small apartment as it stores easily. Doing large items would be harder, but it is fine for a shirt or touching up slacks. It has a padded top, and a cover is not necessary for use. It seems sturdy on a table top, but is lightweight.

I tried to call customer service at all possible times of the day and always get forwarded to a voicemail box that is full. The board itself is not flat. Where the unsupported section is, it is warped down. Also--it didn't occur to me while purchasing it, but you can't hang pants, shirts, etc. over while ironing naturally because they will rest on whatever your surface may be (bed, table, etc.).

However, I can't say the same for the item. The two legs were severely bent - one to such a degree that it cannot be straightened without breaking it. This item was damaged before it was placed in the box AND THAT IS OBVIOUS TO ANYONE who is not blind, drunk, or completely drugged out of it. What a rip off! The only thing deluxe about this was the cardboard box it came in."},{"rating":"2","title":"good for people who don't have to iron a lot","review":"lucky for me I only have about a dozen things that need to be ironed.

It is predictable and trite. I was hoping for a writer of the talent equal to Barbara Michaels. This author is a huge disappointment. I will never purchase another of her books.

In the classic 'cloak-and-dagger' style that we associate with all of Follett's works. Highly recommended for all readers of spy-fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Romance and Intrigue","review":"This story, set at Brittain's entrance into WWII is a great Romance novel with a solid dose of Intrigue. The story follows several intertwined plot lines that are well linked. The plot takes a few twists and turns along the way, and includes a couple steamy scenes. This is the third Follett novel I have read (Lie Down with Lions, and Whiteout). I would rank it ahead of Whiteout but behind Lie Down with Lions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aviation Hit","review":"By Jeffrey W. Bennett, ISP, author ofISP Certification-The Industrial Security Professional Exam ManualandUnder the Lontar PalmNight Over Water is an aviation fiction buff's dream.

This story kept you in suspense and is so different of a plot from the other books I have read by Ken Follet. I loved this book. Now I'm reading the book The Key to Rebecca by Ken Follet and find it just as interesting and learning about how WW2 affected Cairo. Such talent Ken Follet is as an author!"},{"rating":"1","title":"thin, compared to his great ones","review":"Thin plot, thinly developed characters, not the author's best. The Pillars of the Earth, Eye of the Needle, and Dangerous Fortune stand out as by far his best. Night over water is interesting, but not nearly the suspense, drama or richly developed characters of Follett's best... not worth a read in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Childish plot and thin characters - maybe his worst book","review":"This is a great setting and a good theme - badly executed. It reminds me of a plot of a Tom Swift boys adventure book from the '20's - but without the excitement and adventure. Maybe Follett hired someone to grind out the hundreds of pages of bad dialog and the all too predictable plotlets and final wimpering big bang climax. In the end, the book lays there dead, motionless and emotionless, like the dead cardboard cutout Scotland Yard Special Branch detective."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spoiler Alert","review":"The books was completely spoiled for me because 3/4 in the story there is a very sudden and extremely inappropriate scene. I can accept adult scenes, but this was unexpected because up until this point, there was no other adult material that would have at least warned the reader. I was abruptly ambushed with something I would never choose to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suspense, romance and intrigue","review":"Night Over Water harkens back to the end of the golden age of flight, concluded with the silencing of the PanAm Clipper. On the eve of World War II, the story follows a diverse collection of passengers who fly this luxury craft's final revenue flight from England to America. On the single night they spend over the Atlantic, their lives become intertwined in ways none of them imagined. The story of passengers escaping to a new world, running from an old, or eluding the present one is tangled with deceit; mystery; suspense; and love lost, found, and rediscovered. Night Over Water is a gripping story that is worth the price of admission."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like Ken Follett, you will like this book.","review":"Ken Follett knows how to tell a good story, and this book is no exception. Take this book to the beach and lose yourself in it"},{"rating":"2","title":"You'll soar with the suspense","review":"As a lover of history and aircraft, I knew this book would appeal to me. Follett recreates the luxury of flying on the PanAm Clipper beautifully. I appreciate the time taken to build up the backstories of several of the passengers, as well as engineer Eddie Deakin, who faces a heart-wrenching decision when his beloved Carol-Ann is kidnapped. I looked forward to diving back into the suspense and love every time I had to put the book up. The ending maybe is a bit too pat, with coincidence playing a big part, but for the enjoyment of the ride, I can forgive that. Just sit back and fly back into the elegance of 1939 air travel!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My First Follet-Not My Last!","review":"This is the first time I have ever read a book by Ken Follet, after many suggestions from my husband and I really enjoyed it. Not my usual genre, I like non-fiction he reminds me a bit of Sidney Sheldon, but not so corny (sorry, Sidney). But I really enjoyed this book, a very quick, light, read.Try it, I bet you will enjoy it, you feel like you really know the characters and want to get to another chapter to find out more about them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"What a crappy book. I read this after just finishing \\"Pillars of the Earth.\\" I thought that was such a great book that I couldn't wait to sink my teeth into \\"Night Over Water.\\" I wish I was wearing dentures so I could take them out and wash them. This book was a huge disappointment. Once I start a book I will finish it, but it was a chore finishing this. The characters are one dimensional. There are no surprises. The story would have been better off remaining in Mr. Follett's mind. It says nothing and goes nowhere I was interested in going. I'm amazed that a man capable of other great works could try to foist this off on the reading public. Guess he needed a few bucks. Read \\"Pillars of the Earth\\" again, instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"My first Follett book, not bad","review":"I thought this story was interesting enough to keep you reading and I found the concept of a flying overnight boat to be interesting. I love books that take place during world war 2 so I liked the setting as well. The characters, to me, acted fine, they were much better drawn than people in some of the other books I read and they acted understandably. Diana got jealous, and sulky, Margeret had surprising dimensions as you read through the book ( at the beginning she seems like a good little crusader), I liked Harry's character, I thought he was really amusing. I didn't think Nancy was that interesting but she gave the book flavor, and I liked Mervyn more than I liked Diana's other lover. The political situations and beliefs added spice to the story, as well as the conflicts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tiny Bubbles....","review":"I read this book right after reading \\"Pillars of the Earth.\\" That might have been a mistake. I thought PotE was a great book. I thought Night Over Water was just awful. Trite, poor characterizations, uninspired. I can't believe others raved about it. I can't believe it's by the same author as Pillars, Eye of the Needle, Key to Rebecca, etc. I have read Pillars several times and feel it is a great read. I gave Night Over Water away right after I read it. Read at your own literary peril."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great reading","review":"I very much enjoyed this book. It is evocative of WW11 events clearly showing how, before Pearl Harbor, it definitely could have been lost. Most of the characters, as usual with Follett, are believeable and very human. Lovely read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A romantic, humorously intriquing novel.","review":"I've enjoyed reading other Ken Follett's novels -- recently \\"The Pillars Of The Earth\\" -- and found \\"Night Over Water\\" a change from his more serious novels. It \\"trips lightly\\" making fun at it's characters. Simply enjoyable reading.I would recommend this for someone who could appreciate a light humorous novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Follett fantasy","review":"Not one of his best.

Save your money, it's not worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely recommend","review":"I read this book quickly - it is much shorter than his other books that I've read. The store is told from different point of views and they all come together on the PanAm plane. Defintely recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Clipper","review":"It is a thriller with much new information about how Boeings' ugly duckling took from water to flight. Well all ducklings know how to swim and how to fly. They should have come up with \\"Duckling\\" rather than with \\"Boeing\\" or \\"Airbus\\". The Clipper is a sea-going vessel that becomes airborne. It can only land in tranquil water or burst to pieces. It cannot land on the ground... hey, ugly duckling! It wasn't so ugly, because it had more luxury than any of our modern passenger crafts. Would I have flown with it? Heck, no! But nobility, snobility, and greedability enter in 1939 to fly or hijack such craft? You bet on it! Even then..... Hijacking is just a modern word for bucaneering, pirating etc. Clippers have throughout history been prone to it whether on water or in the air. This is a Ken Follett masterpiece. ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good effort from a pro that earns his paycheck.","review":"Some research went into the aircraft, which is interesting so far as it goes. Standard suspense with a glittering cast of characters. All in all, a great summer or airplane read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great Follett book","review":"This book is a great read; the plot develops carefully, the characters are believable and the tension develops. I have become a Follett fan and this book, while not as enthralling as the older historical novels keep me turning the pages. I would highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow paced","review":"Maybe this is just Follett's style, but there was tremendous character development, but it was just too slow paced for my taste. I only made it 60% through the book before I just became too bored to read what happens next. The action takes place on a plane, and the characters don't even get ON the plane until around p. 120, so I give the book 2-stars. I personally wasn't engrossed in the story, but I appreciate there is an audience for richly detailed, advertised suspense stories, even if they aren't exciting reads to this reviewer."},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought it would have been better","review":"The only other Follett book I've read was PILLARS, which i consider one of my favorite books ever, this one however doesn't even make the top 500. Here's why?1)it read like a bad soap opera than a good thriller, people fall out of love then run into someone else and fall in love with them and so on.2)I couldn't care less about the characters, the only one who was interesting was the thief, then that got ruined by this lovey/dovey soap opera junk too.3) then ending was so ridiculous that I actually laughed out loud. I found myself saying \\"Ya right\\" way too often and that is never good.I did,though, finished it and at times some of the multiple stories do grab you but overall it's trash and I'll know one day I'll see a movie version of it on the lifetime channel."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Rock & Roll Album","review":"Why are there only 3 reviews for this excellent album? I would think there would be at least 40 or 50 or something. This album is one of the best rock and roll albums ever. Bryan Adams knows how to bring the roof down with this one. All the songs are great, and you'll especially love the instrumental on 'Vanishing'. The lyrics are great on all the songs as well, meaning and sound. Once I tried waking up my neighbors with this album, but I don't think it worked; they were all at work. I was at home and finished my day of classes, I believe. Great job Bryan Adams, excellent album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Because there is no 0 star option","review":"This album is downright bad. Songs and lyrics range from stupid to horrendeous. I like 80's music and but this is just too much. Its beyond cheesy, dry, overproduced and entirely laughable - think a mutant cross of van-halen, def leppard and shania twain. Nothing works here at all from the dull rock attempts to the tired ballads.This is one of the worst examples of corporate rock I've heard by a famous artist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like Adams, but not one of my favorite except for one song","review":"OK, the song of Robin Hood is the song of our marriage, so have to like it, but have liked other Adams offerings more though many find some great tunes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Guilty Pleasure","review":"I grew up listening to this cd nonstop. I bought at least five tapes because they'd keep on breaking. I recently pulled the cd out of my collection while ripping some files onto my MP3 player. I still remember all the words to the songs but the cd is a bit cheesey to me now. Its funny how everyone I know hates Bryan Adams but I love him. His early stuff was better. Still though, a great rock album."},{"rating":"2","title":"A really cool album","review":"There was a time in my life when I thought Bryan Adams music was outdated. But, I've seen the light! \\"Waking Up the Neighbours\\" is definitely one of my favorite albums and I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys hard rock. Bryan really knows how to capture a feeling with music. Take for example, \\"Thought I'd died and gone to heaven\\", or \\"do I have to say the words?\\" Anytime I'm not in a positive state of mind, I just pop this album in and whammo! I feel excellent! If you want to have this same experience, I suggest you get this album NOW!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just for kids' enjoyment","review":"This CD has several silly songs about animals and toothbrushes, and those will appeal mainly to preschoolers. But there are also at least six that are simply good tunes, which you'll find yourself humming or singing, if only in private. My favorites are Hey, Hey, Little Renia, Best Smile in the World, Celebrate with Danny, Engineer Will, My Little Train and two quieter, more poignant compositions, You're His Mother and Still This Will. Both of those are definitely aimed more at parents than kids, in the vein of Harry Chapin's Cats In the Cradle and Cat Stevens' Father and Son."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not helpful for college level biochemistry","review":"I was hoping for a supplemental to my undergrad biochem course.

So I personally would have prefered that the 'Choral' Symphony was not a part of this disc. About the only connection between the two pieces is that they are both conducted by Seiji Ozawa.That said: The performances throughout are exceptional. I first saw the performance of the Carmina Burana some years ago when it was televised on a public broadcast station. Kathleen Battle's solos are so beautiful and heartfelt that it drove me to tears of joy; and she still has that effect on me. I have owned numerous copies of the Carmina Burana; this is by far my favorite version. Although I find Beethoven's symphony to be tedious, the performance is superb.This is a must have on the strength of the Carmina Burana alone.

The discussion about Sarah and other activities in southern France of that period were informative."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't take it too seriously","review":"I've read a few books by Margaret Starbird to see what evidence has been gathered to support some of the more far-fetched theories surrounding Mary Magdalene. I was disappointed to see that each outrageous claim that she made was poorly supported and neither proved nor implied anything factual. While I am a complete advocate of new interpretations of this biblical figure, I feel that Starbird is the leading cause of misinformation on this subject. I can not deny that the author provides an entertaining and thought-provoking read, but if you are a stickler for the truth and probability, you would be best to check out Karen king's the Gospel of Mary Magdalene before looking at this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Not sure if it is just this kindle edition but I was really looking forward to this but found it to be disappointing.Makes an interesting topic rather boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book to live by","review":"I know that Joseph Campbell speaks against adopting a guru in this book.

He is one of those rare people who is so wise in his understanding of life that you can trust him and truly listen to what he has to say.

Steingraber is a gifted writer and a solid scientist (a rare but good combination) and she weaves scientific research and personal story together in a skillful way.

The story deals with the meeting of Tanis Half Eleven, Flint Fireforge and Taslehoff Burrfoot. The writing is easy on the eye and the action paces nicely older readers, my however find it a tad tedious in places. The writing by Kirschhoff entertains the reader with her clever use of words as well as her interesting plot development. She doesn't seem to bore the us with overly large sentence and paints clear decisive pictures for the reader. How ever she tends to extend a bit to the extreme. She introduces too many elements and characters with out the necessary subplot to sustain them or she fails justify their existence in the greater scheme of things. However, the book is kept interesting by likeable characters, witty and often laugh out loud writing and a genuinely interesting plot.

However, the movie changes the ending and eliminates a lot of the sexier material in the book, so even if you are familiar with the one, there is still reason to try the other."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"The product arrived on time safe and sound.

Certainly one of the most profound and revolutionary works in literature, the keynote to existentialism, and modernity. There was simply nothing like this book in literature before it came along( of course there were works similiar to it afterwards, since it was so influential, e.g., Ellison's homage to NFU \\"Invisible Man\\").Dostoevsky's prescience blooms in this work, as this work foreshadows the fractured nature of the modern world. This work is intellectual dynamite in a hundred or so pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so classic Who","review":"Overall, this movie was entertaining and, at the time of release, a welcome return of the Doctor to TV. The problem I have with it is what actually got it aired on FOX tv in the first place. It was too commercialized and Americanized for true Whovians. I was a fan watching Doctor Who re-runs on PBS as a teen and loved it. Tom Baker was my first Doctor and, though other actors were very good, Tom is MY Doctor. Paul McGann does justice to the Doctor nicely and Eric Roberts is a top-notch actor very capable of pulling off the villain, though somewhat lacking the Master's \\"I would like to be good, but can't\\" warmth meant to make you like/dislike him. It's not a problem with the actors, but of the story itself. It's like the writers either held back (or were held back by FOX) or the best bits of the story got chopped out by TV execs who only care about the money.As a movie on its own, it was good. As a real Doctor Who story, it's a fail. Your call."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good beginning","review":"i really enjoyed watching this new begining of doctor who with paul mcgann as the doctor his performance reminded me of tom bakers and peter davidsons potrayal of the doctor. i loved eric roberts as the master he was very scary and sinister. its too bad this was shown on the fox network because no one really watches that network it would have got much larger ratings success if it had been shown on sci fi network channel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Plain Awful","review":"I remember how excited I was that this movie was being made.

Maybe I'm spoiled by the quality of the rebooted Doctor Who, but this seemed terrible in every possible way. Awkward writing, abysmal acting, dated and silly effects, uneven style, and plot holes you could fly the Tardis through, made this feel like a very slap-dash attempt at something that could have been SO MUCH better. An example of the ridiculousness: The doctor's two hearts on an x-ray are explained away as \\"a double exposure\\". Multiple times. Really??? Say, does anyone here in this HOSPITAL have a stethoscope? No? Oh, ok, nevermind.Obviously your mileage may vary, but I would recommend saving your money & time (I'm lucky I got this from the library, so at least I didn't waste any money on it), and skip over this to go directly to the 2005 Doctor Who series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just the movie please!","review":"Do you know what I want?

But the story, starting with the super-violent beginning was dumb from the get-go. The car chase was eye-ball rolling and the loss of the British sense of humor was unfortunate too. Americanizing the Dr. was a huge mistake I think."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insult to a Great Series","review":"As a classic series Doctor Who fan I remember waiting with great anticipation for this movie to come out. I was SO excited to see any new Doctor Who, and I was SO disappointed when I finally saw the movie. I am glad they did this movie because without it we might not have the new series. If you are a hard-core Doctor Who fan you may want to watch this movie even though it is terrible just so you can discuss its horribleness, (if that's even a word), with other fans. This movie proves that Americans should just stay away from gems like Doctor Who. As an American I was particularly embarrased by this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"I've gotten interested in insects just because of my own curiosity but wanted to learn a bit about their Families and species so I picked up this book (recommended by a teacher of a naturalist class on insects).

It is very useful and replaces separate strippers, crimpers, small bolt cutters, fuse pullers, and wire snips.I have purchased similar tools like this in the past, but they did not have the cushoned handle, good quality construction, and they did not strip small gauge wire like the Leviton here.This tool is essential for any typical automotive electrical work... from adding fog lights, new dash illumination, boost gauges, etc. It has the leverage to crimp connectors quite well. With some practice, you can get a solid connection. For critical connections you can use bare metal connectors; crimp them for a good mechanical fit, then solder it.Since it is a \\"combo\\" tool, there are some drawbacks. The wire cutter is on the inside between the handles. This limits the usefulness in tight places. If the cutter was intergrated on the working end, this tool would be perfect.Still a great value."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just as depicted.","review":"Arrived ahead of schedule, fits well, and appears to be of good quality, no defects in workmanship, and doesn't seem to be made \\"cheap\\".

He still loves the book. Each page just has a sentence or two, providing tips or advice on being a daddy to a little girl. It is special. He wants to be the best father a girl can have, and he likes the ideas in the book and the way it makes him think about things.. It's just really nice and sweet and worth the money.

A girl will cry.* Cheer for her team. Even though they may be called the Pansies.* Teenage girls spend hours doing something in their rooms. No man has ever figured it out.* She may look cute, but her diaper can be as challenging as any boy's.There was also another about letting her mother have time alone with her, and one about protecting her from boys.In conclusion,Sure, this book is wonderful- if you live in the 50's......"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"This book is about a girl named Addy.

I was hoping to read about a few examples or case studies but the book seems geared more for devising cutesy by-lines and adages for select basic points.

I read that bamboo processed in humid countries (i.e. China) can have issues with cracking when used in dry climates. I suppose I could have kept the board in some sort of humidifying chamber or something...but really...who wants to do that with a $40 Go Board.

A couple years ago, a friend and I were talking about Christmas movies and I asked her if she had ever seen Annabelle's Wish and as I was telling her about the movie, when I got to the part when Annabelle gives up her Christmas voice to help Billy, I lost it as I am crying now and when I finally was able to stammer my way to tell her about the ending, I decided she just needed to watch it since I couldn't get the story out without bursting into tears. She now adores this precious movie as well, it is such an amazing lesson for children (and grown ups alike) If you haven't seen it, it is a MUST SEE for families!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful story for \\"kids of all ages!!!","review":"What inspired me initially to buy the video of...Annabelle's wish was the fac it was narrated by my...favorite country artist, randy Travis.

The villains are unforgettable, the love story is fantastic, and the sci-fi tech is just awesome. I will say that the intricate plot can be confusing at first.

Lurie brings a different sensibility to the task. This is no literary biography. Whether Merrill and Jackson pair more like Pope and Bolingbroke or Auden and Kallmann would be out of place. This memoir invites comparisons to Scott and Zelda, poets and their faculty wives. It's probably the best thing for future biographies that most of the worst and most prosaic things that could be said about Merrill and Jackson have now been said by a friend. Merrill fans will pick up bits of gossip.

They dabbled through the ouija board in contact with unseen spirits that supposedly provided the material for Merrill's largest poetic works. The cost to both men of this eerie devotion is trenchantly narrated by Alison Lurie, their friend of many years. The charge that Ms. Lurie is using her connection to Merrill to enhance her own reputation is absurd, as she is far more well known in general than Merrill."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like patriotic marches","review":"I like patriotic marches, they make me remember the America I grew up in and that I love.

It should be noted that while the quality does sound fine, you do know that you are listening to something that was recorded decades ago...Still, this is far from a bad listen. I quite enjoyed hearing the progressive blues/rock precursor to Hatfield & the North and National Health.The CD is a particularly nice package as it includes the band's only single as well as a few live tracks.Would I want this if I didn't already love the Hatfields and Health?

Not so with The Southern Cook's Handbook. The book is superbly organized and very well written. Recipes, with commentary, are clear, and they work. The authors succeed in their efforts to organize the book first with basics (choosing equipment and seasonal produce) then an important section on methods (making stock, gravy, etc.) before giving us the recipes, also well organized as to type.

If you like the kind of comedy where people just do stupid things for no reason at all and keep digging themselves deeper and deeper in a hole by continuing with the same behavior, then you'll love it. Seriously, the main character is a lazy man who has issues with just telling the truth, instead fabricating stories when there is no reason to and just making things worse.The kind of comedy I like and that makes me laugh?

Now, I have the same problem again. No warranty and Casio wants it returned at my expense, plus return freight at my expense, insured at my expencse, and PAY FOR REPAIRS, since they say, \\"it should not be doing that\\".

Going by the covers and summeries of these three books in this series I bought the set thinking they would be great reads. The 1st Changes of Heart was a bit confusing and left much wanting especially in the end. I got lost in the last few chapters wondering if I missed reading a chapter. I felt as though the author skipped a vital part of the book. The storyline started great but did not have much in the way of describing the characters or emotions besides the leading ladies feelings of grief. In all I found the book lacking character description and enough faith concepts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the Ending???","review":"I thought this book started out good and kept my interest.

It just seemed like the story dragged on and on and on..... I also couldn't for the life of me figure out why she went into such great detail on some things that, in my opinion, didn't help develop the story at all. Like detailing the engine in her truck or like the truck is only 4 years old, but sounds like it is about 15 years old. My personal favorite was when the snow storm came and the vet drove them out to Maggie's farm because he was a super talented driver and had a 4 wheel drive truck that would go through any snow drift. Now come on, I realize this is a fictional story, but seriously? I don't even live in an area that gets a ton of snow, but on the rare occasion that mother nature unleashes her fury with a snow storm/blizzard, there is no 4 wheel drive truck in the county that could ever go through drifts like that!

I went back and checked; the story really does end suddenly!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book made me go WHAT?!","review":"The 2 stars are for a well written story, for what was there at least.

You shouldn't read Russell just to agree or to disagree with him; you should read him to know what he has to say about a topic. The great historian Arnold Toynbee compared him to Plato's philosopher who is responsible for descending back to the cave to enlighten those that have not seen the light. One of Russell's most important characteristics is that he was a great writer, and this truly shows in his autobiography. Reading this book, one is inclined to ask himself over and over again \\"what have I done so far?\\" It's probably not fair to try to compare yourself to Russell because the only thing that would lead to is insanity. However, this book is a window to one of the greatest minds of recent times and everyone should come and take a peak."},{"rating":"2","title":"*Comment on the typeface for this Routledge edition*","review":"Caveat emptor: whilst this is a magnificent autobiography published in one quality volume by Routledge, any potential buyers should be aware of the very small type setting of this book.

Times New Roman font, single spaced, and imagine it on bright white copy, 3\\" wide paragraphs. I've repeatedly tried to read this book, but the effect is so hypnotic on the page such that I cannot. The font is reminiscent of (but worse than) those cheap paperback classics read in school, by Signet or some such version.Since I do actually want to read this book, I am now in search of a readable copy. What does it matter to have it in one or two or six volumes, as long as I can appreciate the words? I am deprived of the pleasure of regarding the words on the page. I hope this helps someone make a decision."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very honest and revealing","review":"I was surprised to see the level of openess of this autobiography.

When I first heard it, though a long time Miles fan, I wasn't sure what to think. The band is basically playing mellow psychedelic groove music throughout - kind of like a really good Grateful Dead jam or something - but then Miles comes in and plays solos that form an unbelievable contrast to that pleasant groove - sounds so full of pain and loneliness that it's unnerving, particularly coming out of the sound all around it. Like someone else said: sublime."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Must-Have Classic from Miles!","review":"This is one great album! Miles has made so many classic and essential LPs that it's truly scary! \\"Silent Way\\" is no exception. This LP was the one that preceded \\"Bitches Brew\\" (another milestone album), and is a wonderful precursor to it. The moody grooves are not as dark and dense as \\"Bitches Brew\\", but are equally compelling, if not more so. Put it on and let it play... you will not be skipping any tracks on this disc! One of my 5 favorite Miles Davis LPs, and I recommend it without reservation. As the banner on the album states: \\"Directions In Music By Miles Davis\\"... That's no understatement here, that's for sure!! God, I love this CD.

Not quite as way out there as \\"Bitches Brew\\" was to become and hence is a little more accessible but this is a very good representation of Miles' earlier electric fusion output.This version of the album is a real treat for fans too as the mini-lp replica sleeve design is very well executed and the mastering is very well done as well resulting in a very good sound quality and hence listening experience.

This is the first Miles Davis release where Wayne Shorter plays a soprano sax, and the change of tone fits this music perfectly. There's two electric keyboardists (Chick Corea and Herbie Hancock), augmented by Joe Zawinul on electric organ, giving this music a spacey, ethereal feel. Overall, this isn't one of Miles Davis' best, but interesting nonetheless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy This Album, Because....","review":"...as soon as you listen to it once, you're going to want the Complete Sessions boxset! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite jazz recordings","review":"In A Silent Way is not only one of my favorite Miles Davis albums, but it also is one of my favorite albums of all-time.

There are 2 songs on this album, both nearing 20 minutes bringing up to 40 minutes of music. Also, his trumpet is great on this album.

The SACD brings great separation and detail - but is marred by the presence of significant passages containing too much hiss. I am getting gunshy about these Late 50's - Mid 60's SACD reissues.

So much the pity after waiting for so long for the Wackers to come out on CD. Because they were a great band and Shredder, while uneven, has so much magic that the music itself can elevate and inspire. What a travesty, Collector's Choice.

The characters are played beautifully. Jerry Orbach's best work to date. My favorite scene: The fish-eye lens treatment of Orbach \\"negotiating\\" with my least favorite of many federal agents. Save up plenty of energy for a viewing...... and don't blink!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Long time coming...!","review":"This movie is one to see!

It has an epic theme that compensates for the movie's attempt to create an epic movie. I haven't seen the entire movie (40 min. but only remember 10), but I didn't care for it that much. I read the book, and it was awful. But the soundtrack is DEFINATELY worth getting. Out of all the so-called blunders made during production, the choice for a composer was RIGHT ON!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sizzle to fizzle.","review":"It's interesting that Clavell managed to write such a weak ending that didn't scuttle the rest of the book. This novel is fantastic, don't get me wrong, but the end leaves an empty feeling. It's as though he was winding up for a monster pitch then ends up rolling the ball across the plate. It's one hell of a wind up, though, and that makes the whole read worth while."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anyone interested in Asian culture should check this book ou","review":"What an amazing book!

I have an old version of Tai Pan published by Dell. The current version is published by Random House and I have no reason to believe that it contains the typos that my Dell published version has. My apologies. I have just purchased the Random House version of 'Noble House' and have every hope that it will be as professionally produced as other titles that they have produced for the Kindle.The Kindle version is riddled with typos as a result of a flawed print to digital file conversion process coupled with a lack of proofing the converted file. Lazy and nonprofessional on the part of the publisher. Clavell deserves better. An excellent read otherwise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review of Taipan","review":"One of the great historical novels ever, a superb story, tremendous character development, a fascinating look at western and Chinese cultures at the time and very well written. I may be in the minority but I think this was Clavell's best work, even better than \\"Shogun\\". The character Dirk Struan is unforgettable as is his nemises, Tyler Block. Clavell is a master story teller. I wish he was still alive so he could write more."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books I've read.","review":"Tai Pan was incredible. This was the first Clavell novel that I read, so I didn't quite understand his genius. Tai-Pan is a historical novel, meaning the events in the book are loosely based on true happenings. Character names are different, and history is skewed slightly for story. Please read this book, shortly followed by the rest of James Clavell's novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"A dazzling novel","review":"James Clavell was second to none in decribing the charcters' reasining process. The reader can think he actually knows the characters. However, it seems to me like the author wanted to end the story and did it so abruptly. Unlike Shogun, many stories were left incomplete. This is why I didn't give it 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"Such a good book, such a horrible TV mini series. Yes, the book was that good that I suffered watching the mini series. Don't do the same, ready Tai-Pan, then Gai-Jin and King Rat (probably Clavel's best.) You should have already read Shogun but if not please do so. Amazing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tremendous amount of typos when uploaded to Kindle","review":"I was very disappointed with the upload. There are way to many typos and symbols that has been transported over, so you are left figuring out what the word really is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tai Pan is no Shogun","review":"Like many on this board, I picked up Tai Pan after reading Shogun. In my opinion Shogun is one of the top 5 novels written in the English language. Perhaps because of the expectation set by Shogun, I found Tai Pan to be a huge disappointment. Shogun was a story of empire-building and forbidden romance. Half way through Tai Pan, the \\"drama\\" centers around a pending beauty pageant and which two tea-carrying ships will dock first on a different continent six months in the future. I started, but was unable to finish, both Tai Pan and Noble House. For me at least, being a fan of Clavell turned out to be really just a fan of Shogun."},{"rating":"1","title":"what's the point?","review":"Had I not paid for this book I never would have finished the first chapter. The entire first section of the book spans a period of about an hour, and yet for some inexplicable reason about ten characters silently recount their life stories to themselves while standing around waiting for a ceremony.This unnatural inward dialogue continues throughout the book, and to me it was an entirely ineffective mechanism for telling a story.There's not much of a satisfying story in these 700 pages either. Another reviewer was not exaggerating when they mentioned that the suspense half way through the book was who would win best dressed at a ball. From the book's size I was expecting a self-contained epic; in the end I got some resolutions to some lightly interesting plot lines with a fair amount of items left unresolved.I fail to see what the time and effort were worth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-rated as historical fiction","review":"This book is highly over-rated and very hard to get through. The author over-loads us with trivial details of complicated espionage. There is not much \\"historical\\" detail as I would have liked, as in the Michener books. Also, Dirk Struan is such an unlikeable character I couldn't wait for the book to be over so I wouldn't have to read about him anymore"},{"rating":"2","title":"a great story","review":"Tai-pan is possibly the best book in Clavells series and that says allot since Shogun is one of the better books of all time. Run don't walk, get this book.

This album shows why Devin is a musical GOD.It is tracks like 'The Death Of Music' that make Devin who he is today, and this album takes his regime to a new level. Tracks like \\"Almost Again, The New Black, Monument, Wrong Side\\", I'm at a loss for words, pure musical magic. I saw in a review before that Godsmack are the best band on the planet.

They had to get something out in time for a run on Ozzfest, and this album resultingly (at least to me) sounds like a good amount of focus, effort, and real creativity were compromised in favor of efficiency. That's unfortunate b/c their other 3 most recent albums are pretty incredble...namely Alien and City. But i won't hold it against the band. There are a couple songs here i enjoy, but it just isn't the same sound that i associate with SYL. Overall it is an unfortunate letdown, but i'll always have their others to listen to instead...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ideal for digital camera beginners","review":"If you are a newcomer to digital photography, this inexpensive book is for you.

I have owned this on vinyl for many years and is on my top 10 playlist. Blind Lemon Jefferson was a incredible guitar player delivering many unique blues licks. He was an inventor in both song and lyrics, and was one of the most selling artists of his day. My favourite tracks are 'Shuckin' sugar' and 'Bad Luck Blues' which have very singular and beautiful melodies.

I was flipping through it, thinking it was kind of cute, then I got to the end-----I was appalled! This book went from happy and cozy to absolutely depressing and sad like a skitzo changing personalities. And this story ended that way! What kid wants to read a book about cute cats that ends in everyone crying and upset??? Did the author do this on purpose to make kids cry for the fun of it? I couldn't give this to my niece! And the worst part is, that at the very back of the book the author suggests that this story would make a great school play... Can you imagine going to your kid's school, watching the kids pretend to be cute cats, everyone's happy, then get to the end and see all of them crying their eyes out??? Hmmm... I don't think that will ever happen. Just my opinion. Buy this at your own risk!"},{"rating":"2","title":"suave combination of tech and trad","review":"As someone who enjoys both the techno music scene and traditional Scottish and Irish music I was amazed at how well Shooglenifty combined two different genres into such a smooth blend of fun and funk.

An excellent way to enjoy new music out of Scotland!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A trad-lover's guilty pleasure!","review":"Super-modernist pop-fusion/techno/world beat Celtic material, but also pretty playful and fun, once you're willing to get on their wavelength. These Scottish fellas play breakdowns and reels with drum machines and synth-sounding sonic washes buoying the fiddle's rasp, and endow their songs titles like \\"Bjork's Chauffeur\\" and \\"The Hijab\\" (one of several tunes that have a sort of an Arabic tinge...) True traditionalists will loathe such experiments, but for anyone looking for creative approaches to defining a modern, new Celtic sound, this is certainly worth checking out.

The grip on the unit is pretty well-designed and comfortable as well.Unfortunately, that's the end of the pros. The switch is very sensitive, the slightest little touch or vibration and it turns on. I barely ever used it, but it was always dead when I needed it, and I had to replace the batteries every few weeks to keep it alive.Also, the cap on the bottom is very flexible and has very fine threads, so it's quite difficult to re-tighten the cap properly. The ring on the bottom is a very fragile piece of plastic, making the ring completely useless.I don't recomend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Catacylsms on the Columbia","review":"I found this a fascinating book.

There is a certain defensive tone to his writing that I find oddly childish, given his credentials.I discovered several factual errors in the book, and I think his visits to the companies he mentions and the employee interviews he conducted were more \\"whistle-stops\\" than fact-finding missions. (I feel sorry for the Southwest Airlines employee he dismissed after using the word \\"we\\" -- isn't it possible she was talking about her family and not her workplace?) And to cite USAA as an example of \\"separation from community\\" is laughable. Anyone in this city knows that USAA is an integral part of the community, not an ivory tower.Too bad -- with better research, this book could've provided a interesting counterpoint to all the books about excellence in the workplace."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not waste your money","review":"I needed a book for quick brush-up of statistics over a weekend. Realized I was better off with some of the more detailed books. Typically statistics books introduce new concepts by building on material across successive chapters.

If it's forumulae you need to review get one of those formulae booklets rather than spending on this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"a very good edition of the Bible","review":"This is a very good edition of the Bible. The third world perspective is a useful balance to the plethora of study bibles writen from a \\"1st world\\" academic perspective. The work is scholarly, yet also includes much devotional and pastoral reflection, including references to Augustine and other great saints and doctors of the tradition. I would give it 5 stars except that there are a few errors in the notes ( a supplement is included pointing out the errors) and the Old Testament books are not in canonical order which can confuse the reader at first. All in all, I think that this Bible can be used with the Oxford Annotated Study Bible (Revised Standard Version) and either the New American Bible or the New Jerusalem Bible."},{"rating":"2","title":"unbelievable","review":"Reverend Gary Davis. These are the earliest known recordings of THE MAN. His guitar skill truly must be heard to be believed. At points I swear there are at least two or three seperate guitars, but it's all coming out of him. Simply incredible.Most people may be familiar only with his later stuff, but for my money this is the gold. A musician just getting first exposure, like college athletes in a way, always have something to prove, and it shows well on this disc. Mostly gospel and ragtime tunes, the Reverend was not particularly fond of straight-up blues, but his style and skill will surely impress anyone with an interest in blues, guitar, or plain musicianship. Outstanding. One of my most deserved 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Being Honest","review":"One must remember, this man is a convict, sent to prison for attempted murder. If you understand the mind of the incarcerated then you know it is all a front for parole.Once Cleaver was released from prison he proceed to get involved with more criminal activity both in the United States and abroad. In France he is suspected of the murder of a man that had an affair with his wife. In Algeria he ran a auto theft ring. Does this sounds like the re-incarnation of Malcolm X. Or does it sound like the a street thug. The fact that he became a crack addicted whore towards the end of his life renouncing the Black Panther attest to the fact that Eldridge Cleaver was a phoney only hustling the system to get out of jail.I read his book and essentially was bored. I had no desire to experience life behind bars as white critics and so-call academics do."},{"rating":"1","title":"at least he's honest","review":"I'll say this about Eldridge Cleaver.

Cleaver's comments are acute and, in a certain sense, prescient and prophetic. This work is about much more than black frustration and rage (remember the violent riots of the 60's) and for Americans who are interested in the past, in order to comprehend better the present and anticipate the future, this is good reading, much better than the bestseller pulp out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Noteworthy","review":"As a college student, I chose this book due to my interest in history. It relates to that and much more. The black man's struggle with trying to find an identity in a white society which continues to ignore it. How the prison system oppresses rather than empowers. This book paved the way for the Black Panthers and a better understanding of the civil rights movement. Even though Cleaver is angry and hateful, he is an intelligent and observant writer. He educates himself through reading and writing, even while in the depressing circumstances of prison. His experiences in prison have been captured beautifully. Anyone who wants to understand race relations, incarceration, religion,and literature should read this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Justification for the Unjustifiable","review":"I have seldom read anything as offensive as Cleaver's attempt to pass off rape as a \\"revolutionary\\" act. By his own admission he is a serial rapist,and if he'd served time for all of them would never even have been out of jail in the sixties in the first place! While the other content of this book isn't totally worthless, I found that Cleaver came off as a typical criminal, filled with reasons why SOMEBODY ELSE was responsible for everything he did wrong. The first step to self respect is to accept responsibility for one's actions, Cleaver has not done that, nor does he give the slightest indication that he ever will. If you want to read an autobiography of a panther read Huey Newton's, because with Newton, instead of self pity, there was substance and intelligence behind the anger."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad, Revolutionary, and Incindiary at the same time,","review":"Mr. Cleaver wrote a semiautobiography about how society sets itself up along racial and gender lines. Raping women is reprehensible and evil and it doesn't help solve the racial/gender problem. It excabates it. Challenging the racist/sexist society by making alliances with people whom he considered to be his enemies will solve most of the problem. He should have shown love for his fellow man/woman.

While reading this memoir, I was engaged, repulsed, seeking further understanding, and more. So many emotions were brought forth. Eldridge Cleaver provided us with insight to the soul of a complex man during a time of turmoil. While I may not have agreed with some of the things he had to share, I appreciated being able to look at social issues during that time period from his perspective. It's harsh, it's gripping, and it was his reality. Cleaver conveyed his feelings and views of society with such clarity and emotion that it certainly allows you to step inside of his mind and see from his perspective how it was to be black at that time...whether you agree or not, it certainly provokes reflection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Over my head","review":"Eldridge Cleaver is spectacular.

Eldridge Cleaver is just another criminal rapist who thinks he got smart in Prison. This book is so bad! It's supposed to be iconoclastic and insightful but it's really just a showcase for the extensive lexicon that Cleaver has. Serously, though, this book reads like that In Living Color skit where those dudes pontificate while they misoginate because they're ingrates and who cares what they ate! So if you are in for hearing how the Man has repressed his human brother for 400 years with a liberal sprinkling of .50 cent words then this book is for you. And there's really only one good essay dealing with prison life (the rest is junk, bunk, no GOOD).

The information is presented in the most dull way and further everything is DATED. I have never become so frustrated with a text that discusses current race relations with data from the 1980's. If you are considering this text, just glance at some of the data and you will get my point."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Every now and then, even a fantastic author like Agatha Christie will produce a virtually unreadable book. This, in my opinion, is one of those books. Despite an intriguing premise, the story (which concerns a fairly uninteresting group of young college students) deteriorates somewhere in the middle and the reason for the random thefts takes an unusual and boring direction. The solution, which is arrived at with little of the skillful detection that Poirot is known for, is one of those types that you forget almost immediately after finishing. For first readers of Christie, please don't let this book influence your opinion of her quality. I STRONGLY recommend AND THEN THERE WERE NONE, MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS, THE MURDER OF ROGER ACKROYD, DEATH ON THE NILE, THE ABC MURDERS, and FIVE LITTLE PIGS, which rank among her very best."},{"rating":"1","title":"the side plot, was terrible...","review":"I'm only 19 years old, but yet a veteran at reading A.C novells.

Still this book features Poirot, and it is still one of the weakest of A.C:s books. I can only think of one that disliked moore, and that's \\"at bertrams hotell\\" (Mrs Marple). Anyway this book, is about a private studenthome, there things are not what they should be...Of course this leads 2 murder, after a while...

It might be different on the larger screens, but I suspect this is a work that might be most useful in paper.If I were only going to buy one M1 Garand book, this would not be it. But I found it a worthy adjunct to other books on the Garand and I have no regrets over my purchase. There is some very good information for the Garand owner.In summation, I would suggest people think about the paper version, even if I have not seen it. If this is your first M1 Garand book, consider some of the other offerings on Amazon first. But that doesn't mean this book is somehow inferior."},{"rating":"2","title":"great pre-war blues harmonica","review":"Yazoo has done a good job of remastering the 78 rpm records from which these songs were recorded. The music is excellent, especially if you're a harmonica player or a lover of country style harp. At the minimum, you gotta hear Ice Water Blues and Chickasaw Special. At 73 minutes, the amount of music is generous, however, there is one glaring problem with Yazoo's presentation--no recording dates! This is a tremendous oversight on Yazoo's part and I normally would ding a historical recording such as this as much as 2 stars for omitting recording details. According to the liner notes, they had the source records, so why didn't they just copy the label info into their liner notes? Yazoo is noted for these kind of ommissions and I question the quality of the poeple they hire. Nevertheless, the harmonica playing is so good, that I'm still going to give it a 5 star rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kind of poor quality","review":"Sounds like an old record...which it is.

We also get to hear works by Ludvig Van Beethoven and Francois-André Philidor. Mariateresa Dekkaborra has written informative and well-written music notes. All the lyrics in respective language.

Worried sick, Laura imagines the worst. Turns out it could be worse than an accident or kidnapping: her husband of 20 years, Jeff, actually willingly walked away; the IRS, who had been investigating him, then freezes all her assets and she has no money or credit history of her own. Sure, eventually the love of her life comes back to her rescue, but this book carefully analyzes the relationship between lovers, friends, parents and children. Sometimes it's highly predictable, but it certainly beats the usual damsel in distress, one note soap opera. There's even one additional couple in the story. My only regret was that the kids, who were so much present throughout the book, are barely mentioned at the very end."},{"rating":"1","title":"did not like the characters","review":"I have read several Barabara Delinsky books that were good--this one was very disappointing.

But, I perservered because I had heard this one was \\"great.\\" Great it wasn't. Mediocre, with the ends tied up in a neat bow is the most I can say for this story of a woman who can't decide who she wants, what she wants and how much she's going to \\"take\\" from the people around her. I was disappointed with Delinsky's story here...find her most recent romantic/suspense novels to be much more satisfying-both with characters and storyline."},{"rating":"1","title":"plot?","review":"I couldn't find anything good about this book.

I was so relieved to find the exact same watch, at a very reasonable price, to replace it. I wear it as often as I can. It's dressy but also sporty and very unique."},{"rating":"1","title":"Naughty Granny!","review":"Grandmothers who buy this book for their own children's children are simply demonstrating their own lack of parenting ability.I think this book body-slams Mom every chance it gets! It also encourages children in the formative years to just ignore Mom and go with that fun-loving granny, no matter how important Mom's advice is to her growing daughter. Any good granny should know, (except for the narcissistic ones who will purchase this book) that supporting Mom and backing her up is more important than being hip and wild. All grannies who think about purchasing this book should step back about forty years and put themselves in the place of Mom, and then place the book in the hands of her own mother-in-law giving it to her daughter!Mother-in-laws beware...if you don't want to enrage your daughter-in-law, choose another book! It's a shame because the idea is cute, but the delivery is point after point of parent bashing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great toy for a little one!","review":"The \\"My Granny's Purse\\" is a really cute book for a little girl.

Also, it was less expensive at Amazon than at the book store."},{"rating":"2","title":"Granny's Purse is full of fun!","review":"I bought this purse for my 4 year old daughter, because it looked like so much fun. She is still enjoying the \\"book\\" six months later, which says something. Granny's purse is full of little things for little hands to try, rings to poke a finger through, glasses, hankie, a letter, and more all made out of sturdy cardboard (except the hankie is real). Each page has little phrases such as, \\"My mommy always tells me, 'be careful.' My granny says, 'be prepared!'\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"So Cool!","review":"This is the neatest product I've seen in a long time and my two girls, ages 7 and 4, love it. There are so many fun extras inside the purse, I would have put this #1 on my wish list as a little girl. I haven't had any problems with durability or with losing pieces but my girls have always been careful with their surroundings and personal items. I would recommend this book for ages 3-8. My mom (granny!)was so excited when I told her about the book and she enjoyed buying it and giving it to my girls to share. By the way, I see no problem in giving this to little boys, there are some 'girly' items in the purse, such as lipstick (not real), but the point of it is that it is granny's purse and you get to borrow it whenever you like!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My daughter loves this book!","review":"This book can definitely become a favorite to little girls.

I expected more little dodads and gadgets for her to pull out and play with. I was thinking it would be a cardboard book full of goodies, but it is definitely just a \\"book\\" and not a box of fun playthings to take in and out. She may be a little more interested in it when she gets older, but I think she will have more fun if I make up my own little purse of goodies just for her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment","review":"My Granny's Purse was a big disapointment for me. I wish I had read the reviews of others before buying. THey are right.. it's not for a small child. I bought it for my 18mth old daughter. She didn't like it at all. The sunglasses are the only thing she played with and they broke almost instantly. It's all cardboard.. and so it's not durable. For a older child, this might work. But it doesn't have much to do really and its text doesn't have much of a point. I don't know whether this is a book or a toy but it falls short in both categories. thanks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to her previous works, but a must for fans.","review":"Judging an author's body of work by only reading one novel, and her last novel written at the very end of her long life, is infantile, the equivalent of watching Steven Spielberg's \\"1941\\" and judging him to be a mediocre talent and not worthy of further viewing.This is Mrs Thirkell's final completed novel and like the majority of her later works, not up to the standards of her finest work of the Thirties and Forties, but it's a must read for fans of the Barsetshire series. For newcomers to her books, I would recommend any of the Barsetshire novels of the Thirties, but particularly \\"Summer Half\\", \\"Wild Strawberries\\", \\"Pomfret Towers\\", \\"The Brandons\\" or \\"High Rising\\". These early novels can be read as stand alones that introduce the characters featured throughout the series and are witty, dry, well-written comedies of manners."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not her best","review":"I have read several of Thirkell's book but this one was absolutely boring. No plot to speak of. I have enjoyed her others."},{"rating":"1","title":"amazingly boring","review":"I agree that this book is one of the most boring ever written. I also read \\"Coronation Summer\\", by the same author, and that book was much better. The book did exert a strange fascination; I kept reading, wondering if the author would finally break down and make something happen. At one or two points she almost did, but somehow restrained herself. The book is also partially saved by the author's strong command of the English language. Her words have a vague poetry that makes complete and utter boredom almost enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly tedious","review":"This may be the most boring book I have ever read. I was prepared to make certain allowances, knowing that it was the last book of a long series I have not read. However, that does not excuse the lack of any interest/conflict/plot line, the long digressions on the part of the author, the overwhelming number of in-jokes among the characters, and the sheer tediousness of the entire story. At least 3 characters are famous largely for their inability to carry on a coherent conversation, which is incredibly annoying to the reader. I would recommend that the anglophile reader instead concentrate on Barbara Pym, PG Wodehouse, Nancy Mitford, or Rosamund Pilcher."},{"rating":"2","title":"clear, concise, effective lessons","review":"I really liked the clear format, the focused lessons, and the areas covered.

As you can imagine, it was quite a big deal when Robert Altman came to town. And the film and its music hold up surprisingly well thirty years later. Personally, I think Keith Carradine's \\"I'm Easy\\" is the best of the bunch. But they are all great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Most Entertaining and Musical","review":"As a musician working in Chicago during the 70's, our town shared both recording engineers and musicians with Nashville so I can testify to it's accuracy. Musically, I find NASHVILLE to be up there with Woodstock, and certiainly better than Altman's Kansas City with a sense of humor that can't be beat. Really, one of the best movies ever made."},{"rating":"2","title":"Play This CD in Your Tractor!","review":"These songs are brilliantly quirky and smoothly performed by a large ensemble cast better known for its acting prowess than its musical ability. Ronee Blakley, who stole all her scenes in the movie playing the emotionally unstable Barbara Jean, is wonderful crooning \\"My Idaho Home\\" (love her tag-on ending \\"... for Mamma and Daddy\\"!) and the fast-tempo \\"Tapedeck in His Tractor\\"; Keith Carradine deserved the Oscar he won for \\"I'm Easy\\" (the song that transfixed Lily Tomlin and several other women in the club scene); and Henry Gibson's twangy vocals are a pleasant revelation. A must for fans of Altman's cinematic masterpiece; these songs evoke the heart and spirit of his superbly watchable film."},{"rating":"2","title":"C&W with Irony","review":"Country&Western music plus subtley and irony would seem to be an oxymoron. But these aren't ordinary country tunes, just as \\"Nashville\\" is no ordinary movie. Though critical and satiric, the songs, like the movie, manage to be infectious and touching as well. I'd recommend the album not only for fans of the movie but as preparation for younger viewers who may not even have been around at the time of the movie's release. Despite its academy award, I find Carradine's \\"I'm Easy\\" to be one of the weaker songs in the collection. The stand-out is Ronee Blakeley's performance of \\"Dues,\\" in which the pathos and emotional vulnerability equal some of the best moments in the music of Judy Garland and Billy Holiday."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cornball but Good","review":"Its a rare thing for me to find a CD that has every song I like. \\"Memphis\\" is a hoot as Karen Black tries without success to hit that high note at the end \\"some MOOOOOORRRRRREEEE\\"; \\"My Idaho Home\\" is a lot like \\"Coal Miner's Daughter\\". Ronnee Blakely has a beautiful voice. \\"I'm Easy\\" is very good. I hear that one alot on a 70's station I listen to. \\"Bluebird\\" is very good and Tim Brown who sings it sound a lot like Charley Pride. The duet between Haven Hamilton and Barbara Jean is very good, very catchy and easy to sing along with. The version of \\"It Don't Worry Me\\" sung by Barbara Harris just touches my heart with her soaring vocals. Sure, its not for everyone but its for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bay of Pigs book","review":"Peter Wyden's The Bay of Pigs: The Untold Story is a thorough telling of the entire story of the planning, the invasion, and why it failed. More than that it is a sobering look at the underlying political manipulations that created the project and were the ultimate reasons for its failure. The shame and grief of those who were compelled to stand by and do nothing is heart wrenching. If you want to know more about why and how President John F. Kennedy was convinced to allow the invasion and about the men who participated in it, this book is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally!","review":"I've got 3 little kids...finally a disc we all agree on!!!

I thought that the things that drove them apart when they meet again 7 years later were not realistic and the hero didn't seem very understanding about the heroine's objections, basically just wearing her down instead of getting her point the first time she tried to explain it. His actions didn't seem so much like a lover as like a stalker."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Prolonged Hostility -- 2.5 Stars.","review":"With this work, Julia Quinn has tumbled into the writers' pond of thinking -- that the swells of conflict are the keys to remarkable reading. Ah yes, every romance reader's dream is to drag through three hundred pages filled with down and dirty quarreling all in the name of love.Even with dry wit sprinkled throughout, the author's words are long and drawn. In this Quinn book, we find two people, who are the ages of 31 and 24, and they go at each other to the extreme.Victoria is the nastiest. This little shrew is supposed to be a vicar's daughter. I guess she missed the lesson on forgiveness. On the other hand, Robert was absent the day his governess taught Life's Lesson 101-- \\"Believe none of what you hear, and half of what you see\\".For more delightful reading check out Quinn's \\"The Duke and I\\" and/or \\"An Offer from a Gentleman\\" both are fun.Grace Atkinson, Ontario - Canada."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst I've read in a long time!","review":"First, let me say I LOVE Julia Quinn. So I was very disappointed when I was only to the end of the first chapter and the two main characters had already fallen in love (a really unbelievable love-at-first-sight situation). Of course, the rest of the book takes place seven years later, but the beginning of the story, the background, was so rushed that you really don't even get to know the characters. I really didn't like either of them.Really, this book reads like something a high school student put together. I can hardly believe that Julia Quinn, who exhibits (in my humble opinion) near genius in most of her writing, wrote this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not this time...","review":"Robert is next in line for the earldom. Victoria is a vicar's daughter. Man see's girl by a pond. They fall instantly in love. The father's of said boy and girl get in the way. Seven years later boy and girl reunite, get married and live happily ever after.Blah!Believe it or not my 6 sentence summation was more entertaining that JQ's 372 pages.I have always been a fan of JQ, but I have to be honest here...This book was just awful! The characters were bland, and the love at first sight plot between these two wasn't believable in the least bit; that's were I think Quinn dropped the ball on this one. As a loyal fan that's read almost every book she's written I know she had the talent to pull this one off, but obviously she didn't use it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good","review":"Although I got kind of annoyed with how Victoria kept on refusing Robert (even though she found out he was innocent of just trying to get into her pants and then abandoning her) all in all \\"Everything and the Moon\\" was a good book. I liked Victoria, except for her stubbornness, however Robert was the book's saving grace. He was sweet, intelligent, and most of all kind. He is a nice change from some of the cruel heroes that are so prevalent in books today. The plot was was well done and generally fast moving. \\"Everything and the Moon\\" was a good book that I would recomend to anybody as a plesant (if a tiny bit dull) read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!","review":"Other Julie Quinn books are entertaining, but Everything and the Moon was boring, redundant, and full of cliches. Usually she comes up with a somewhat original story line, but this one has been written over and over again. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seductive, touching, and laugh- out- loud funny!","review":"I absolutely loved this book;I couldn't put it down! The characters, Robert and Victoria were so charming, and the dialogue was beyond compare.

Like the other review stated, it started out good, but fell flat about a third of the way in. The heroin sounded like a harpy, screechy witch. There really was no plot. I'm sorry I paid for this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone! There are some of Julia Quinn's books that are wonderful, but this one is not one of them. The writing, the dialogue and the storyline is pathetic. She has so many excellent books it is hard to believe she wrote this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Because they were meant to be...","review":"It's love at first sight for Victoria and Robert. Fine, you say, then where is the fun? Add in a pair of interfering fathers and a night of crossed signals and you have two lovers hopelessly ticked off at eachother for seven years. Can true love see through all the pain and distrust? Well, that's why you have to read it!Lose yourself in this wonderful Regency romance that has all the fun you expect from Julia Quinn, but without an annoying murder subplot that is so typical of the genre. This story is simply about when it's meant to be. Read it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy this book!","review":"One of my favorite books by Julia Quinn and I have them all! I wanted to give it 10 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not worth the time","review":"You could tell immediately that this was an early effort of Quinn's and frankly, I am surprised it was published. It was that bad. The plot was too simple and she did not have the experience required to extend it into a full length novel. Boring, boring, boring. I never imagined I would tire of hearing a hero say \\"I Love You\\", but I definitely did as the over-worked phrase was repeated way too many times for it to carry the importance you associate with the words. None of the spirited, funny trademark dialog that we have come to expect from Quinn. Stay away from this one unless you just have nothing else to do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Dialogue","review":"Julia Quinn is incomparable when it comes to dialogue. Her characters come across as real people saying and thinking things that real people say and think. They're funny, sad, gentle, sensual, loving, lovable and unforgettable!This is the story of the star-crossed lovers who fall in love, get separated and then meet again.. he wants revenge, she wants to erase him from her history. They both fail.You might find yourself feeling a little sorry for Robert by the second half of the book because Victoria does not give up.. she drives him to the edge, several times, but he never gives up on her. There a part when he is faced with 'eight hens' and his groom advices him that 'now might not be the best of time to be a rooster..\\" where I laughed so hard, people thought I was going crazy..Lovely book, lovely read.. don't miss it and if this is your first Julia Quinn, don't hesitate, she'll get you hooked."},{"rating":"2","title":"A delightful read!","review":"\\"Everything and the Moon\\" is the first book written by Julia Quinn I've read. It will definitely NOT be the last. I absolutely adored this book. The main characters, Victoria & Robert, are intelligent and lively. Their conversations are sure to make you smile if not laugh out loud! Robert is one of the most likable \\"heroes\\" that I've come across in historical & romance. I found Victoria's concerns very easy to identify with and liked her immensely. This is one of the best I've read in a long long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Read!","review":"Although the misunderstanding was serious, the book did not warp itself into a tedious melodramatic tale! The characters were absolutely fantastic and the interaction between them just made you melt. I disagree with one the reviewers about Victoria \\"Torrie\\" being stubborn and cliche! I was glad that she did not give in right away! Even if they are both somewhat to blame for the misunderstanding, I think more of it should be heaped upon the hero! This was why I found it amusing that Victoria made him work for it a bit! It's great to see an arrogant man on his knees!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kuralt","review":"Read book long time ago.

I don't think there's even one time I don't bring this movie up when talking about crazy movies. You've got the dirty streets of New York filled with hobos and weirdos crawling all over! A liquor store owner has just discovered an old crate filled with alcohol titled, 'VIPER'!!! Wait till you see what affects this stuff has on the locals! That's all I'm gonna say.Synapse did a really good job with this two-disk edition with having tons of extras that include: behind-the-scenes footage, commentary with actors/actresses, and really nice art work inside the keepcase! I'm trying to compare this flick with another but having a hard time haha. This one is truly original! I would say this is up there with 'Bad Taste' or 'Dead Alive' as far as off-the-wall craziness goes! If you've enjoyed those two horror flicks I've mentioned, than this is bound to be a real treat for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"HOW DID THIS MOVIE GET PAST TROMA???","review":"From beginning to end this movie had Troma written all over it- the melting, the bad acting, the music, the penis football game; it was perfect! I have seen alot of crazy movies in my time but this was highly original and well worth the watch. It starts out with a good foot chase scene and then gets to the first melt victim, the following half hour or so was a little slow but the last half hour more than made up for ANY shortcomings. I found myself at the end wishing for just one more melt scene and when it didn't happen I just watched the movie again ( I'm a glutton for punishment!). The last song was horribly done by the lone mobster in the movie, but was a great finishing touch to this cult classic. I LOVED IT !!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"this movie will not play in a dvd play, xbox 360 or laptop","review":"wrong region code and you can only change your region code 4 times on your computer 4 times before its permanatly stuck. this movie will NOT play, waste of money"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine Film","review":"This is the version we have all been waiting for, especially the extras that come with it.

The movie was more of a comedy than it was horror, and the use of paint for \\"melting bodies\\" was atrocious. I can't believe I wasted my money on this garbage. The title of the movie fits it well, at least the \\"trash\\" part does. Don't purchase this movie if you value your hard-earned dollar. You were warned. I can't believe that out of 33 reviews, this movie only got two negative reviews. That just goes to show that our culture will watch anything and call it entertainment. Wow, some people are so easily satisfied when it comes to visual and plot entertainment. Not me... I wouldn't have even given this one-star if it hadn't been required in order to post a critique. This movie was worse than awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trash is right, AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH","review":"Street Trash is by far one of the WORST movies Iv'e ever seen next to Natural Born Killers,House of the Dead,and Batman and Robin. A cheap-priced ale turns homeless people into a muck of slime. I thought this movie was going to rock but instead it sucked wasting some decent special effects for a film made in 1987 and the budget it had. Street Trash is boring and badly made and the acting is terrible(since when do fillmmakers think clowns can act?) and the direction is disjointed. Please folks do NOT watch this piece of TRASH and rent the better 1989 fillm SLIME CITY,instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"So silly and stupid that it's great.","review":"This movie is so silly and stupid that it's great.

It's actually one of the sickiest movies ever made, and I love it. PUT IT ON DVD ALREADY. Another movie on my wish list. A must own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Humor that time has largely left behind","review":"It is unfortunate that it is generally true that the humor that appeared in Mad Magazine the 1960's has not aged well. It was generally incredibly stupid, used a minimalist approach in the images and the language was squeaky clean. The two primary characters in these stories are Fester and Karbunkle, one an unshaven small guy and the other rather large and dimwitted. Most of their actions can be described as extreme slapstick, such as large and heavy objects being dropped on their head.Since I lived through this humor the first time, I have a predilection to enjoy it that more modern people will lack. Yet, I did not find it funny, at best I would consider it slightly amusing.

I had to buy it for myself after reading the first one in advanced reader form (booksellers get these). I waited for the rest of the series and it was well worth the wait!There are few books I read that have such a blend of humor, action, struggle, magic, wonder, and destiny.

Good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow but clever","review":"This was my first Goddard mystery, and frankly, if it had moved any slower it would have lost me. Readers looking for action should look elsewhere. The prose is pleasant but tends to be wordy. But there's a reward for sticking with it. The reward is a good four star tale well told. However, be forewarned, the number of twists invented by Goddard along the way may cause the reader to anticipate the ending. Afterwards, you are left to wonder how so many boring people could get into so much trouble."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good historical mystery","review":"I enjoyed following the different characters through the twists and turns of this story set in WWI-era England.

I'm not making this up. It wasn't good either."},{"rating":"2","title":"So happy they put this on DVD!","review":"I learned about this show on Cartoon Network and loved it from the moment I saw it. I haven't watch all the episodes in this in this First Season yet, so my review is not going to be that in-depth.The only drawback I can think of so far is the fact that the first couple of episodes aren't as funny but as I go up in episodes, it does get funnier.I'm really glad I bought it and glad I found it on Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, Christmas Spirit Back In Music","review":"It is hard this day and age to find good holiday music. With most of the newest albums including Destiny's Child remix of 'Oh Holy Night' and Ricky Martin's 'Feliz Navidad' you could imagine how excited I was when I stumbled upon this item. After reading the album's track list, I was interested, and took the gamble of purchasing (even though I had never heard the artist, Sammy, before.) - yes, I know that was stupid, but I was desperate. I am glad I was. This CD is full of good, holiday music. Sammy is a sensation, allowing a sort of edge on some songs (track 3 for example is wonderful)and other, more traditional songs remain very warm. I liked her a lot. The choir sang well, a bit more youthful than many others, and I enjoyed the fresh new arangements to many Christmas classics. A must buy for anyone with taste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing but...","review":"I really enjoyed the arrangements...they seemed fresh, lush, and vibrant. The choir was delightful to listen to but Sammy's voice just doesn't pull through. That vibrato and color of her voice isn't very becoming and quite frankly it's almost insidious.

I read the product reviews. Both claim that this rotary blade is intended to work on fabric. Yet when I recieved the blade, the packaging said \\"for paper only.\\" Several reviewers even said it work well on fabric despite the packaging claims. I don't know what fabric they used it on, but it couldn't cleanly cut through cotton. I tried to cut a pretty scalloped edge onto a fat quarter, like you'd find at all fabric stores. While the blade did indeed separate the fabric into smaller pieces, it took at least three passes. The finished edge was not scalloped but tiny, fraying squares. This product DOES NOT WORK ON FABRIC. Please fix your description."},{"rating":"2","title":"small scallop blade","review":"I was looking for a little bigger scallop design and this one is a smaller scallop so if you are looking for a smaller scallop this one is perfect.

I have noticed that good teaching books get the point across in a little over 100 pages, this one repeats itself so much that I was ready to stab myself in the eye after the 3rd chapter. This is one of those \\"pefect world\\" books that makes you question when the last time the authors were in the classroom. It seems to center around mostly secondary situations. The authors tell stories about great classrooms but never explain how to achieve them, or they talk about strategies that everyone does as if it was something they thought up themselves yesterday. My main quesion for them, how do you expect teachers to know how to teach this way? Most secondary ed students take barely any methods courses and mostly just subject area courses, they teach the way there were taught.... taking notes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work","review":"I could not get this microphone to work on my computer.

But something went terribly wrong in the execution. Maybe it's not as bad as the subject line would suggest but it's a huge disappointment nonetheless. Even has \\"Worms\\" as Jar-Jar. With the exception of the occasionally harmonica bit, the band just isn't terribly interesting. And a lot of the melodic aspects and tonal richness of Beth's singing are gone -- sometimes she just sounds like a squaking crow.I started listening to Beth after hearing her guest performances with the Chemical Brothers & really enjoyed her voice in that context, but with a conventional band (and production that ofter underemphasizes the vocals in favor of humdrum backup) it's just not that interesting. I've tried, really, playing this over and over, but it still disappoints."},{"rating":"1","title":"RAMBLING, SHRILLING.....","review":"Droning vocals. Was hoping for so much more.

This is absent any life her previous albums exhibited."},{"rating":"1","title":"so very disappointing","review":"I'm a loyal Orton fan; Trailer Park is her best, and I'm a fan the \\"other side of daybreak\\". This cd is a complete disappointment. It is trite, boring, and political in a very dull and usual way; it has none of the distinctive thoughtfulness, charm, and melancholy that so characterize most of Orton's work. I get the distinct feeling that she didn't have this cd in her, but just put it out there because there were so many (ourselves) who were waiting. Orton's merit is that her songs come from her heart; these songs come from her head. These songs sound little different from so much soulless folk-pop, and have all the authenticity of a millionaire rockstar whining about being downtrodden.We wish Beth the best; but we also wish she would give us her best; and if she can't do that, well, we'll be content with her 'classics'."},{"rating":"1","title":"No thanks.","review":"A leading Americana music magazine whose opinions I usually agree with gave this CD great review. Sorry. It just doesn't resonate with me. Too much reliance on atmospheric percussion that bubbles just below the surface. No memorable melodies to latch on to. Sameness of material.

I put it on and turned the volume down low so the neighbors wouldn't be disturbed. The volume didn't affect the quality of the music because it was made to be listened to that way. Beth's 1999 album \\"Central Reservation\\" also had a quiet rush about it but the disarming humility of \\"Comfort of Strangers\\" is unique. The music is straightforward without being bland witch adds up to perfect vehicles for Beth Orton songs. As I drifted between to tired to sleep and the actual thing the songs did their job of soaking in and keeping me just alert enough to enjoy them while not keeping me from resting. The songs have a lot to give and if you take them in and slowly taste them you'll experience their true richness and depth.this album contains enough of her best stuff to make this essential in her body of work. Beth is truly good at she does and she makes it seem so easy here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Look at the cover.","review":"You can get a good idea of what this CD sounds like by looking at the cover.

I enjoyed the entire book, but felt that the chapter on AIDS was a bit too dry and politically correct, & it seemed out of place with the chapters on other viruses. This book will open your eyes to things we should all be concerned about. But it isn't just a non-fiction medical journal, this book, with its knowledge of the researchers and their personalities, reads more like a thriller than a technical journal. Read it and enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Like others...","review":"I expected this book to be sensationalist copy, full of holes, and misleading info and generally radical in it's views.However, when I delved into the depths of Laurie Garret's book, I realized that she wrote a wonderful text full of insight about our future as far as our healths are concerned. With the recent rise in Anti-biotic resistant microbes, and newer diseases not native to America popping up(Nile fever), her book has quite a bit to say about the past, present and future of medicine.Very in depth, including extensive writing and research of AIDs.All around a great, though lengthy, read."},{"rating":"2","title":"brilliant study","review":"This is one of the best books i ever read, and i read a lot. it has depth, and good writing, and the feel of a mystery throughout.

A wonderful adventure into the inner realities of our world and the microbes that infest it. As a required summer reading book for a high school student, I was \\"taken back\\" by the sheer size of the book. Nevertheless, the depressing undertones and scientific facts only lead to a more engrossing experience. The only complaint I would have is that at some parts the techincal mumbo jumbo seems to overpower my limited experience in biology. This makes it a bit harder to read. Overall, a good novel!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bringing Preaching to a Whole New Place","review":"To put it mildly, The Coming Plague very strongly resembles the pacesetter in a long distance track event. It starts strongly, and fades just as quickly. What starts out as a very interesting discussion of a number of virulent, and quite frightening diseases, lapses into a protracted lecture on the subject of Man Bad, Woman Good. What should have been an objective discussion of the threats facing humanity, devolves into one individuals biased take on the subjects of ecology, politics, and male bashing. I purchased this book in the hopes that it might more comprehensively discuss virology than The Hot Zone did. Rather, I was left with nothing more than a one sided take on the authors clearly liberal view of the world"},{"rating":"1","title":"Entertaining But True?","review":"I read this book about ten years ago.

THIS BOOK PUTS ENOUGH FEAR INTO PEOPLE THAT THEY IMMEDIATELY ARE PUT INTO A COMFORT ZONE BECAUSE IN THEIR MINDS, AS LONG AS THEY ARE NOT ONE OF THE VICTIMS OF THIS DISEASE, THEY ARE NOT AS BAD OFF AS THEY COULD BE. THERE COMES A POINT WHERE WE HAVE TO BE REALISTIC AND WHERE SUPERSTITION HAS TO BE CAST ASIDE. THE SO-CALLED \\"END OF THE WORLD\\" PSYCHOLOGY MUST SOMEDAY STOP.

Especially in a highly referenced book purporting to set forward accurate scientific information, it is regrettable t hat not infrequently it is just plain wrong. The devil is in the details. There are entire sections where there are fundamental misunderstandings of the field, and the primary citations are only to discredited work. The section on the human leukemia viruses HTLV is but one example. A significant problem is that almost no reader will be able to discern for themselves which por tions are junk, and which superb. Get a pound of salt if you read this. And beware of quoting it as a reference. But do consider reading it nonetheless."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Coming Plague","review":"This book is thoroughly researched and has fascinating history about diseases and the social forces that help them spread. However, it is somewhat burdened by the excessive detail surrounding HIV/AIDS. I preferred the shorter chapters about the hemorrhagic fevers and the adventures that medical researchers went through to identify them. I have been reading this for a couple months, and expect to finish it...one of these days."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incrediblly readable book that will scare you","review":"The Coming Plague is a wonderful historical work on the emerging viruses on the 20 and 21st centuries. It reads like a novel because the emphasis is on the people who tracked down and identified the new viruses. It's not for the squeamish, but if you want to understand how the planet is under attack from within, read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Riviting, informative, very readable for non medicals","review":"This book clears up all the mininformaion coming at us as we discover new plagues. It starts with a history of plagues like the Black Death, the world wide flus and goes on to explain toxic shock syndrome, Legionaires' Disease, Ebola and Aids, and many more (unfortunately). I read every page and have a new understanding and respect for the \\"wee beasties\\". It certainly makes a case against the overuse of antibiotics. It ranks among the top books I have ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great insight into diseases after WWII.Slows down in middle","review":"As others have stated, real life is a lot more frightening than Hollywood. First chapters are great and read like a novel. Halfway through the book, chapters start giving too many facts per paragraph which tend to make the book boring and slow. Last couple of chapters make up for it with a great conclusion. Provides great insight into how human activity (and arrogance) have contributed to the emergence of diseases after WWII. It's scary how ordinary activities can be dangerous and irresponsible when confronted with diseases that threaten our own existence. YOU MUST READ THIS BOOK if your care about human nature and the impact we, as a society, are having on the world around us, and how that world is fighting back with soldiers called: bacteria, viruses and parasites. After reading this book I'm not so sure who's going to win that war."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book, though out of date now","review":"While this book had a lot of good material; it's strikingly out of date due to advances in biotechnology and synthetic biology. The big plague threat today is a bioengineered virus. If you want to read about this horrific threat, the book Rohan Nation: Reinventing America after the 2020 Collapse is best. We need to be prepared; it's inevitable that either a natural plague or, worse, a bioengineered plague is going to devestate our overpopulated planet."},{"rating":"1","title":"A course in indecisiveness","review":"A Course in Phonology seemed to me to be a course in bad editing. The one thing that most kept this book from being helpful in the learning of phonology is that it never used the same terminology chapter to chapter. The terminology switches were just assumed by the author to be known by the reader. The glossary did not have entries for any of these terminology switches, in fact the glossary had precious few entries that gave definitions past its own root word. The second annoying thing about this book were the homework assignments at the end of each chapter. There was no answer key, and they spent an entire chapter discussing rules for English phonology, then decide to give French, Catalan, and some bizzare Micronesian language as the assignments all of which had different rules that were discussed in the chapter. The accompanying workbook also had it's problems among which was the missing answer key."},{"rating":"1","title":"Metro lines and stations not clearly marked.","review":"The bright side is the durable material this map is made from, which guarantees no wrinkles and easy folding.However, when it comes to the information presented, then I was disapointed.

Cobb (Walter Matthau) is a small town lawyer who is ordered by District Court Judge Bell (Harry Warren) to defend a German prisoner-of-war, Sergeant Wilhelm Geiger (Peter Firth), who is accused to murdering the local prison camp doctor, Doc Hansen. It seems a straightforward case and Cobb is as convinced as everyone else at the start of Geiger's guilt. But then a \`confession' by the doc. is discovered which casts a doubt about a previous camp death as well as his own. And as Cobb investigates, much to the annoyance of Judge Bell who wanted a quick verdict, some disturbing facts emerge about the p.o.w. camp, Camp Bremen, and its supervisor, Major Lilly(Joe Horvath). Cobb engages the help of the local town marshal (William Schallert) to investigate further and a whole conspiracy emerges. This is an excellent film with a convincing plot and very well acted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie","review":"This movie was so moving and thought-provoking! Just one of the best I have seen.

I suppose that people were wasting their hard earned cash in the 1970's visiting theaters to watch junk like this and that is why we got so many sequels to the squalor they call, \\"Blind Dead\\" films. This is purely a waste of time and good money. If you see this at a five and dime store, don't pick it up! It's awful and has no suspense what-so-ever. The boat is a silly model that is floating in a man's bathtub, if you can see a toe, that is a man.

In my estimation this film holds the dubious distinction of being the worst of the four films. The action is excruciatingly slow, the women not as attractive and the storyline adds nothing to what has been done in the two previous films. Also bothersome was the idea of placing the slow-moving corpses about a ship, it just didn't work for me.Of course the genius about making sequels is the fact that you already have established an audience that will by the film whether they like it or not.

Note to self: If trying to escape quietly on a stone floor, remove heels.The acting and dialouge was pretty sad. There are better ghost ship movies out there, but no worse ones come to mind.Parental Guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity in the version I watched. It does look like the camera cut suddenly when the models were undressing. I suspect there may be copies with some minor nudity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ghost Galleon","review":"While the ship model was trash the rest of the movie was good.

This book delves little beyond the surface and I'd definitely recommend that a newbie do more research on nutrition after reading this book. As a veteran vegan of one year, however, I still found interesting tidbits that were new to me. I'll be keeping this book around for as a loaner to those curious about the lifestyle, and also for the recipes in the back. I do give this book props, however, for detailing the history of vegetarianism and veganism, something you don't find in most other books of this nature. I think it's beneficial and grounding for all vegs to know how the movement began."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent beginner vegan book!","review":"This book is an excellent guide for beginners of veganism. I got it after I had read a couple of other books related to veganism. I thought it would be very informative and supportive to the change I made, and it has truly lived up to my expectation. It covers a wide variety of topics related to veganism, but I have especially enjoyed the information it gives on choosing a plant-based diet. It also provides many websites that are useful, especially if you are interested in ordering products that are vegan and often hard to come by in smaller communities. I highly recommend this book to anyone who has recently become vegan or is considering becoming a vegan...it is more infomative than persuasive, and it gives you lots of ideas and recipes in an enjoyable and easy to read format.

With that aside, this second entry in the Susan Shader series (And I hope there are more to come!) is an excellent thriller, featuring the very interesting Susan Shader, and also her sidekick, David Gold, who is also an integral part of this series.This time we have two despicable killers, one that Shader thinks she's helped put away (early in the book), and then a serial killer called The Undertaker, who is as sick and bloody as they get.The book has several unsettling scenes, and you're never quite sure who the Undertaker is. The characters of Wendy Breckinridge and Tony Garza, as well as Scott Carpenter, are also great ones, although the fate of one of them is truly sad, and one has to wonder why Shader allowed it to happen...but it's realistic enough, and brings the book to a hair-raising close.A brilliant read.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."},{"rating":"2","title":"How Many Ways Can You Say It?","review":"It sounds juvenile. Bo Carter here writes 14 metaphors for sex using potato diggers, pencils, and pincushions to stand for parts of the anatomy. But what starts off as funny mellows with age into something comforting and sly. You're in on the joke. And in his world, men and women enjoy themselves A LOT. I mean, when was the last time you heard that? In so much of today's music, sex either screws you up or makes you a status symbol. Here, the music (a lone guitar and temperate, folksy, semi-blues picking) and lyrics suggest we are taking it way too seriously.

I couldn't quite remember how I stumbled across Bo, and I just now remembered: I was researching the song I was named after (Correna, Correna) and stumbled across his name on wikipedia. Searching further, I came across this.So I laughed. A lot. I giggled until my face got a little red, and I called up my friends and told them they had to come over and hear this. And they did, and they laughed, too. But with time, my feeling about this cd has changed. I actually LIKE it. I pop this cd into my cd player and it mellows me.

The book is laid out very nicely and has extremely easy to follow step-by-step instructions and explanations. I would strongly recommend this book for anybody that is going from a 2D CAD program to Autodesk Inventor. Additionally, the book comes with a CD that takes the user through various tutorials. I use this feature frequently. The only reason I did not give the book 5 stars is because I felt the index was slightly lacking. I could not always find the topic I was looking for in the index.

It's almost, but not quite, 5 stars. It fits in the country/pop genre, altho it's not too poppy, still recognizable as primarily country. Anyway, Rebecca, from Kentucky, has an excellent voice for country music and is a strong singer. Her voice moves easily through its considerable vocal range. The songs are enjoyable to listen to for the most part, tho a bit on the fluffy side. The ones I really enjoy are:Heartsounds - energetic kickoffOut Here on the Water - fun song about fun on the lakeWas It as Hard to Be Together - done by other people, I like Rebecca's the bestMove MeWhen My Dreams Come True - humorous, tongue-in-cheek songTennessee in My WindshieldIn summary, this is an energetic, fun, and optimistic album.

One woman's coming out jitters are smoothed out in 3 pages while the issues around an abusive ex seems to scarcely affect her emotionally at all... c'mon! The bird subplot was specious. No real use made of the setting-- New Orleans for heavens sake cries out to be more of a focus for an erotic novel if any place does! I envision seductionas with baguettes and gumbo.

The characters are shallow, and the lack of depth of emotion does not allow the reader to become involved in the book. The reader cannot identify with the characters because she knows next to nothing about their backgrounds or who they are as people. The plot needs to be more focused and better planned, because it appears ridiculously unbelievable. Overall, it's the story of two lesbians who meet, have a lot of sex, say they're in love, and whose lives are somewhat affected by poorly constructed outside circumstances."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"was this book like written because ms.ennis had to fulfill a contractual obligation? one of the most disjointed books i have ever read, and i swear that i read the same subplot in a different book by different author. i take no pleasure in panning this book, but it was bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad, really bad","review":"Forget the plot.

Yes, have some sympathy but don't go around telling the whole world. NOBODY CARES. The romance is shallow and Ms. Ennis never makes it or the characters believable. None of the characters are believable. It really has the feeling of being slapped together in a very short time. Don't waste your money on this one. Hot romantic scenes cannot make up for the disconnected nature of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid","review":"The first time I used it the handle popped out of the cylinder.

To me, (so far) this is the best book using equations to describe the overall picture of brain functions. Even though it might not touch in-depth research topics, I am sure it gives anyone interested in neuroscience very solid foundations on which more advance topics are built. (It actually invites me to more in-depth research topics, such as reinforcement learning, reward-punishment system, etc.)If math is your familiar language (says, system of differential equations and Bayesian probability), and you are interested to know, in technical details, how the brain functions, this book is for you.

He's dull and boring on stage (although I'm sure his audience, floating over the clouds of the influence, may disagree), his jokes are dull and tired, and the documentary plods along like a crippled mule.Unlike Supersize Me, the host isn't photogenic or interesting to watch.I enjoyed the advocacy for individual liberty and the history of marijuana, but the remainder of the film doesn't justify purchasing this film. A very valid point is raised when a federal officer raids a dealer with an unsigned warrant.

I think he got stoned beyond the point of being funny most of the 30 days he was high. Most of the content about legislation was common knowledge so I didn't learn anything knew. The most interesting part to me was the closing of legal, medical cannabis stores in California due to discrepancies between federal and state laws regarding marijuana. In the movie they show cannabis stores in California being shut down by the DEA (federal officials) despite the state law which has legalizing it. It was very shocking to see stores get closed down at random and have their patient records as well as their supply of marijuana confiscated and never returned even after they were legally allowed to reopen. It really shows the holes in the legal system of the U.S. Other than that, I think the concept of the movie had a lot of potential but was neither funny nor informative for the most part."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty stupid","review":"Full disclosure - I don't smoke pot, but I was totally drunk when I watched this movie. My review is basically that this movie is completely pointless. Doug Benson is a funny comedian, whether he is high or not. The highlights of the movie were his stand-up comedy routines. Otherwise, this movie had nothing to say. Makes me a little irritated that I wasted my time. This movie does nothing to debunk the theory that potheads are lazy and stupid. This movie was pretty lazy and stupid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Super High Me","review":"I bought this movie thinking it would have some great facts along with humor like Totaly Baked does.

The twisting action works smoothly and flawlessly as expected from AT CROSS products. I purchased the Toffee Colored Pen for a considerable discount from amazon.com.

It does sound like Dean is singing on these songs, along with some other singers. But it's not the same without Jan. Jan's the lead guy.

I recently read and enjoyed - for the second time - the entire story. In this third in the series (following \`Faith's Crossing'), Lex and Amanda have to deal against an unknown entity. They fight various battles, but there are so many individuals who may be guilty that they're not sure who they can trust.Because of this wonderful series, Carrie Carr is one of the more widely-published authors in the genre. Lex and Amanda are easy to love and it's a joy to watch their relationship grow as the series develops."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"Very disappointed in this DVD.

I watched it every Christmas on PBS as a child but it hadn't been coming on the past few Christmases so I ordered it. I'm so happy I did, because I was going through Nutcracker Ballet Withdrawals.

Mikhail's sheer athleticism is breathtaking alone. XXO"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible reproduction","review":"This video is of poor quality, audio is bland and tinny, camera work is inept. Sorry I purchased this DVD. After having watched this ballet in person this reproduction is quite a let down. Those with positive reviews must have been reminiscing instead of critically watching."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor video and sound quality ruin great ballet","review":"According to the box, this production of the Nutacracker by the Kiev ballet is \\"exquisitely danced by the Kiev Ballet Company\\". Unfortuneately you can't tell much about the dancing because the video quality is extremely poor - easily the worst commercial video I have ever seen, the music is highly distorted, and most camera shots are so long that you can barely see the dancers. Don't bother with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor quality","review":"This \\"Blu-Ray\\" is extremely poor.

Gorgeous costuming and sets - well worth the price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a true classic of which my children never tire","review":"My two daughters received this as a gift from my father several years ago (when they were only 1 and 3). It was an instant hit, and has remained highly popular, year round. They love the music, the costumes, and the dancers - they like to treat it as an exercise video and dress up in ballet outfits to twirl around our living room, believing their moves are as elegant as the dancers'. It is a wonderful introduction to ballet and classical music, and a great way to burn off some energy on a rainy or snowy day!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to snuff.","review":"I would have expected way more picture quality from a Blu-Ray. Performance is adequate but cinematic choice leaves much to be desired, IMHO. I would have p[referred a \\"5th row seat\\" view."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Exquisite","review":"I am a dancer and ballet is my favorite type of dance. I have seen dozens of different Nutcrackers over the years, from the traditional to the avand garde. Nothing can compare with this version. Baryshnikov shines. And Kirkland is a most sensuous Clara/Marie. Their duet at the end replaced the traditional \\"sugarplum fairy\\" dance. But, what a duet! I never get tired of watching it. A true Christmas treasure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forgotten version of the Nutcracker","review":"I love this version of the Nutcracker. Back in the 1970's and 1980's PBS would play it on Christmas Eve. Every year I looked forward to watching this. Unfortunately probably due to it's age this version is not on PBS anymore, I think. I have missed it quite a bit and was very pleased to find it on Amazon. Watching this takes me back to the feeling of Christmas I would experience as a little girl."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you're looking for a treat, this IS it!","review":"While it may omit some traditional characters, this version of the children's Christmas classic is really hard to beat. Starting with wonderful choreography and technique and ending with beautiful sets and costumes, this video is everything that it promises to be. I can show this to young students for fun or advanced students for technique. It's great! I also think that Baryshnikov did a wonderful job balancing the tradition begun by the Bolshoi while cleaning up the loose ends of the plot."},{"rating":"2","title":"The definitive Nutcracker for me...","review":"I was fortunate enough to see Baryshnikov with the American Ballet Theater at the Kennedy Center about the time of this recording, which captures the magic of his live performance. Kirkland demonstrates a childlike quality which radiates in this performance of Clara. Flawless performances from both stars and supporting cast. Great performance by the orchestra. I especially enjoyed the Waltz of the Flowers, the Dance of the Sugar Plum fairy, the Dance of the Mirlitons. I too hope this will be re-released, I would love to replace my recording from PBS of this ABT classic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Magical","review":"Okay...seriously, this was filmed in the 70's, do not expect the same cinematography that we have today. But, I grew up on this, and it's MAGICAL to me. This is still my favorite version of the Nutcracker, we watched it during the Christmas season as I grew up, when we didn't have a ballet close enough to attend. Baryshnikov is magical onstage, and gelsey kirkland brings it to life. It's not traditional in the sense, that the main character is a child...it was coreographed as a young woman, so you get to see the pairs dancing between kirkland, and baryshnikov. Beautiful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Barishnikov Dazzles for the Holidays!","review":"This is about the best version of the Nutcracker I have seen. It deviates a little from the original story line - the Sugarplum Fairy and her prince take a back seat to Clara and her nutcracker. But the dancing and costuming, etc., are so extraordinairy and create such a magical world, you do not mind the slight differences.I highly reccomend this version for anyone who enjoys ballet, The Nutcracker and/or the dancing of Mikhail Barishinikov."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Performance","review":"I have been watching this recording since I was little. It is my favorite performance of the Nutcracker, Baryshnikov did the choreography, and it is much different from other Nutcracker's you may have seen, but it is incredibly beautiful and dark. The dancing is completely effortless and perfect. I would recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"duck50","review":"Very simply, the picture quality of this version is terrible. I played it on an audiophile grade Oppo Universal Blu-Ray player which will upgrade the quality of any DVD and it was still very, very grainey with overly washed out colors. I recently viewed a 2008 production by the San Francisco Opera and it was superb. Look for another version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tchaikovsky - The Nutcracker / Baryshnikov, Kirkland, Charmoli","review":"Wonderful as all Baryshnikov performances are. The popular Christmas ballet at its best!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"You need this nutcracker","review":"The nutcracker ballet is such a part of Christmas for me. It's a tradition that started with my mom and now continues with my daughter. Baryshnikov is truly an amazing dancer and I love watching him dance. We still like to go to the ballet as a family each year. But with the DVD we can also watch it at home."},{"rating":"2","title":"HOLIDAY FARE FOR EVERY DAY OF THE YEAR","review":"Under Tony Charmoli's customarily fine direction,with Baryshnikov's early choreographing, his and Kirkland's first rate dancing, a sparkling dance ensemble, beautiful sets and color still undiminished, and a masterful score, was created a delightful film whose charm is irresistible. Without need to compare how this one stands up against other available DVD performances, I feel confident in recommending it to all age groups, for its consistent high style and its two stars, who glitter brightly among the other jewels. Watch it for the holidays, and in between holidays to provide some holiday cheer."},{"rating":"2","title":"GORGEOUS!","review":"Everytime I see this movie I feel like I a kid again. I watch it every Christmas and the magic of the dancers and music take me back to simpler times. Baryshnikov and Kirkland are magical together and the choreography is amazing. Such a magical movie that should be watched by any and all regardless of whether you appreciate dance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christmas ballet","review":"This is probably the best version of the Nutcracker out their, if you like ballet that is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Suprisingly Weak Nutcracker","review":"Considering the many high rating of this production I was very disappointed and suprised to find it below average. The costumes look more like Halloween outfits and the scenery looks cheap. The worst part is the story line which is so lost that unless familiar with the Nutcracker a viewer will not understand this one. The entire last half is just disconnected dance after dance. The dancing is just OK but with no story line it is just dancing. In contrast I very highly recommend the Royal Ballet version with Miyako Yoshida and Jonathan Cope, excellant in every way that this is bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"Save your money and don't buy this. The recording seemed to play like it was coming out of a box and about 20 minutes into the music, the CD started skipping. Not once, not twice, but repeatedly over the course of 5 minutes. While I can make some concessions for the skipping for packaging error, the quality of the sound makes this a worthless buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best ever Nutcracker","review":"A role that Gelsey Kirkland was born to dance, she can look twelve in one scene, and then when magically whisked away with her prince, she looks 21. I much prefer this version because you actually get more dancing. I am bored with the Balanchine version; quite frankly, if your child isn't in it, it is not interesting from a ballet perspective. I just saw the production in NY, and had to rush home to see the Baryshnikov one because I was not satisfied. Alas, my laser disc is no longer functional. Why wasn't this re-mastered for DVD? It should be a classic. For the person who couldn't take the \\"Oedipal\\" conflict, you can easily view his (Drosselmeyer's) role as merely summoning Clara back to reality and wakefulness. Your child won't know to ask."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enchanting!","review":"I grew up watching a video of this Nutcracker every Christmas Eve, that we had taped off of PBS. When I saw that it was available on DVD I bought it right away. Having just finished watching it I am pleased to say I was just as, if not more, enchanted by this beautifully produced Nutcracker, as I was when a child. The \\"special effects\\" are a bit cheesy, but to me it just adds to the charm (and you must remember that it was made in 1977). Gelsey Kirkland is such a graceful dancer, she's like a feather on a breeze. Of course, Baryshnikov is also stunning, and I think he makes the Prince roll, which is not always that exciting, quite fun to watch. The whole production is beautiful from sets, to costumes, to the entire ballet company. I'm glad that I can again make this the magical start to my Christmas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where's the DVD?","review":"This by far is my most favourite version of the Nutcracker. Mikhail Baryshnikov has what basketball players could only dream of, an amazing \\"hang time\\". Also, this review would not be complete without mentioning the wonderful conducting and choreography. Every step is in languid movement with the music, the one thing that all others lack. It can only be described as a wonderous dream. My only question is, when is it going to come out on DVD?!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Bad, but not the Best.","review":"This is my fifth Force FX lightsaber. Its beautiful but a bit heavy. The sound is very muffled and the hilt it a bit too thick to be accurate. Although its my favorite design, the Luke Skywalker Green lightsaber is much better. Its the brightest and loudest I have out of the Ep.2 and Ep.3 Anakin, Darth Vader, and this Obi Wan.

I own both Fiskars and Olfa cutters, as well as several blades for each as I needed a variety of cuts of my artwork. All rotary cutters are used on quilt quality cotton fabrics.Both Fiskars and Olfa provide a high quality rotary cutter, but Olfa appears to require slightly less pressure to create a clean cut. I would attribute it to the sharpness of the blade and possible to the shape of the handle of the cutter itself.I re-sharpen my straight edge rotary blades, however with pinking blades you have to buy new ones as they become dull.

More, it contains so much--a very complete timeline on Hindu history, a children's Hindu ABC primer, information on Samskaras (stages of life), and the best part: a wonderfully complete Hindu glossary.

It is written from a Saivite viewpoint (Saivism is one of the 4 major streams of orthodox Hinduism), but the authors take care to point out the information that is specific only to Saivism, and also compare their viewpoints to other streams, as well as to religions outside the Hindu family.

I installed 8 of these timers in my own house 5 years ago. Given that I installed them correctly they have worked wonderfully. I have never had one lockup on me. However, I have had 5 fail because the buttons broke off. They appear to rely on a set of very small plastic tabs that retain them against the spring tension. I have found that a tab will break off causing the button to hang crooked then eventually another tab will fail and the whole button will fall off. There is no way to repair short of total switch replacement as Leviton doesn't offer replacement buttons. The frequency of use certainly seems to be a factor as most of the failures are in the rooms most used. However, I think that they have a flawed design or material spec. problem. I recommend that you save your receipt for the warranty claim. Maybe they will get the message. I like the product just wish they would hold up better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Leviton fan timer switch","review":"This is a high quality switch that I installed for my bathroom fan.

According to the manufacturer's website, most new house's electrical systems include a neutral wire configurations and since my house is one year old it did not occur to me check before ordering. My configuration only has a 3-wire setup and without the neutral wire, the timer won't work.

However, the screws that came with it is cheesy. The head is slotted and different gap than standard slotted screw. I threw them away and got my own. The specification or someplace should've mention that this switch works only for certain wiring. I was lucky to be wired the way that it wants. Power, all three wires, have to go to the switch first then to the fixture for this to work.

IT seems the electronics failed: It will no longer countdown and turn off. The only way to turn off the fan was to reset the breaker. I really loved the look and functionality.

My two stars are because I felt like there was no fair warning that this was an abbreviated version."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Book of the Kings","review":"'The Book of the Kings' is the national epic of the Persians. No other work captures so much of the history, culture, or identity of one of the greatest empires in history.This is a must-read for any student of Middle-Eastern history, of mythology, or any person who appreciates a national epic for what it is: the one work that perfectly captures who a people are in a medium no less powerful than a flag or national anthem.The English have 'Beowulf', the Italians 'La Commedia', the Romans 'Aeneid', the Greeks 'The Iliad/ The Odyssey'... 'Shahnameh: The Persian Book of Kings' is the one and true epic of the Persian people.It must be read by anyone who wishes to appreciate their culture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for beginners","review":"It's truncated and written in story form with random poetic inserts, instead of being the long epic poem it is in traditional Farsi. That said, it's great for someone who just wants to read the stories and learn some parts of Persian mythology."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting read, not for the casual fan","review":"Buyer beware, if you are a casual fan of Ali, this is probably not the book for you.Of the 15 fighters in the book, most people would be hard pressed to recognize half of them. The format of the fighters stories goes as follows- A background of where they came from, how they happened to get a shot at fighting Ali, and where they are now. Not a lot of details on the fights themselves. I still found the book interesting even though I didn't know half the fighters. They all got to stand in the spotlight with Ali, marking their place in history, some of them a one hit wonder, but all of them changed in one way or another."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"The book was in very good shape, I was worried it wasn't going to be. It arrived in a timely manner."},{"rating":"2","title":"More enjoyable than informative, nothing really technical, well-written portraits","review":"I've been reading a lot of boxing books lately despite not being a big fan, mainly because it seems like the people who are involved in it are some of the most interesting people in any sport. This book is another one which strongly reiterates that. Like many of the other reviews say, you really do feel like you get to know something about these guys, about what they're like as people and nobody comes across as two dimensional."},{"rating":"1","title":"Promise unfulfilled","review":"The composer Xenakis brings most to mind is George Antheil. Both composers made a huge initial splash. But repeated listening to these pieces reveals that they are little more than empty effect. Although dates of the pieces here span two or three decades, all of the music is rooted firmly in the sixties. There are many composers who experimented with similar textures during this period. But for the best of breed, this kind of music became an important part--but only a part--of a larger toolkit. Without this experimentalism, we'd have never had Ligeti's \\"San Francisco Polyphony\\" or Lutoslawski's mighty \\"Third Symphony\\". But Xenakis appears to feel that the effect is the thing. There's not much in this music beyond theatricality.This has often been considered to be groundbreaking music. But it's important to build something after breaking ground. Xenakis has left us an empty lot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tastes like dirt","review":"Not the fault of seller.

We have four children ages 17-10 and we all watched it-even though it was in black and white. The movie is a classic and although many years old still made my children laugh. It also made them think about issues that are hard to imagine now...like, kids didn't wear shoes? ;)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Read","review":"I don't advocate this much, but when you compare the novel and this movie, I would say go read the book. This book leaves out and alters so much of the story that it completely changes the meaning of the book. Omitting the Tom Sawyer sequence at the end is a complete crock. When Peter Jackson set out to make the Lord of the Rings, yes, he had to cut much out in order to not make 3 different four-hour long movies, but he didn't decide \\"Ok, let's change it from 'The Ring being destroyed' to 'Indians do a dance and then tell a story about how the White Man took his land'.\\" Someone wrote that it shouldn't matter if it doesn't follow the book exactly. This is a case where it changed just about every possible aspect from the book just enough to be able to still call it Huck Finn. In fact, I could promise that just about the only two things from the book that were not altered in at least one blasphemous way were the title and the character's names."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was an okay movie.","review":"I think this book was very boring . But the movie was alittle better. I wish that he had published some better book than the ones that he has out.Mark Twain is a very creative man and I admire that. Recently i had visited his house in Conneticut. It was really nice and I enjoyed myself. Otherwise , the my most favorite book would have to be Tom Sawyer because it was an exciting aventure. Iy was also nice how he put Tom Sawyer as a continuation in Huck Finn Book, eventhough I thought that book was really boring.

Cains: \\"The Postman Always Rings Twice,\\" \\"Double Indemnity,\\" and \\"Serenade.\\" His writing reached its peak with these three. The first two are hard-boiled and terse and nasty, and they move like bullets to their sordid ends. But \\"Serenade\\" is almost lyrically operatic, in keeping with the soap opera that is the protagonist's love life. This tremendously forward-looking and unpredictable (and brief and economical) book melds a number of Cain's loves into a tapestry of nearly ludicrous proportions. Read it! You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"HARD EDGED BUT EXCELLENT LOVE STORY","review":"One of the greatest love stories ever written, in my mind. Full of aggression, cynicism, pace but also of passion. His picture of pre-War Mexico is magical, if somewhat seedy. It is a tragedy that it is out of print - the Postman Always Rings Twice shadowed this more sophisticated, but just as readable novel, due to the Film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cain was able.","review":"Serenade by James M. Cain, the story of an opera singer, has an ambitious, over-the-top plot. A plot which, quite befittingly, could be turned into a pretty good modern day opera.As the novel opens, John Howard Sharp, once the toast of Europe because of his magnificent operatic voice, is now penniless in Mexico. He meets and falls in love with an illiterate prostitute who turns his life around. Together, they enter the United States, where Sharp's singing ability again brings him fame and wealth. But, Sharp carries the seed of tragedy within him and by novel's end tragedy is in full bloom.Had Serenade been written in today's world, it would correctly be criticized as homophobic and racist (toward Mexicans). But, when first published in 1937, it must have been described as risque and avant garde. This is a bold, full speed ahead example of fiction writing. Despite its over-the-top storyline, Serenade is well worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"a very strange, ..and not very good..., effort by James M. Cain","review":"'Serenade' is one of the oddest books I've read, and unfortunately it is not among the author's better efforts. Although quite readable and, at fleeting moments, very interesting I found 'Serenade' to be a rambling mess. The characters were not well developed, or believable, and the plot was absolutely ludicrous. I think it would be merciful for fans of James M. Cain, and indeed mankind, to let 'Serenade' and his equally miserable 'The Butterfly' go quietly out of print.Oh, let me add some words about the plot. We have a washed up American opera star trying to scratch a living in Mexico, circa 1935. He meets a prostitute, falls in love, then brings her back to America. Miraculously his voice is restored to Caruso-level brilliance. Oh, they then run into misadventure. And we also discover our opera star had a homosexual dalliance with a rich British promoter. Shock, horror, boredom.Bottom line: a real mess."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly Effective as an Album","review":"I don't really like greatest hits packages, but this one does a nice job summarizes the first few albums that had Joe Walsh onboard. Putting aside the radio hits, this is a surprisingly effective and cohesive look at a creative rock trio in the late 60s and early 70s. I especially like the slower songs, such as \\"Take a Look Around,\\" which features plaintive singing, organ work, and sounds a lot like very early Todd Rundgren. \\"Ashes the Rain and I\\" is another quieter song that really works.But the highlight is clearly \\"Bomber,\\" which hits you over the head with multiphased songs, changes, and sequences, an epic tune that leaves you blissfully satisfied and ready for that final toke before you go to bed....."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE JAMES GANG'S GREATEST TRAX","review":"Despite the popularity and airplay of signature songs, \\"Walk Away\\", and \\"Funk #49\\", The James Gang never had a hit single and their Greatest Hits album is really 'greatest album tracks'. When guitarist Joe Walsh joined the group around 1970, they became a hugely popular boogie driven hard rock band, steered by Walsh's creative and quick turns on guitar. Some of this is decidedly progressive with heavy accomanying orchestration, (surprise!), and some of it is just meek and slightly bizarre, (Midnight Man), but The Gang were best as a blues influenced power trio. \\"Bomber\\", finds Walsh flirting with cloud gazing riffs, razor edge chords and echoey distortion in a 'pass the bong' Zepplin inspired masterwork that defines '70's FM radio."},{"rating":"2","title":"James Gang-Love anything with Joe Walsh!","review":"Have most of the James Gang records but wanted a MP3 selection.

The \\"story\\"/song that accompanies the illustrations takes a quick backseat to the visual feast but is fine and true to its religious origins. I haven't yet tested this out on my 6 year old (Christmas being a bit away), but my take on this book is that because of the lack of ACTION! he won't appreciate it unless we block out a lot of the bustle of the day and get into a cozy space that allows for more concentration than the usual pace of our evenings.

There is very noticeable distotortion of most (if not all) of the portions where the volume is moderately loud or louder. It sounds like you're listening to a cheap walkman with blown headphones.I'd like to give this disk 2 stars, but the extreme distortion at so many points in the soundtrack really can't compensate for the excellent performances by the cast.

There are a few pearls of wisdom, like thinking about how endings have affected you in the past and how that can add insight to frightening feelings that may surface during the repatriation period.

Apparently one of the screws was so tightly fastened into threaded brass ferrule that the ferrule actually \\"spun\\" in the plastic receiver that was holding the brass ferrule into which the faceplate screw was fastened. This necessitated the removal of the faceplate by \\"coaxing\\" it off the switch box faceplate mounting screws.

(The have D, E and F)The on/off switch on this one just doesn't feel right and it's not as responsive as the Westek. The major problem with this one, though, is that it would not work at certain angles. It only worked when plugged into the same wall as the switch.

The transmitters (wall switches) didn't work to control both outlets. I tried both A and B frequency settings on both outlets and both switches. One switch controlled neither outlet on the A setting and would turn only one of the outlets on with the B setting. The other switch would turn on both lights, but turn only one of them off. My deduction is that there is terrible quality control at the manufacturer to allow the frequency ranges to be so diverse.I bought two competitor's units at my local home improvement store for $9 less each. They work splendidly.Don't buy this junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would be great - if it worked","review":"This is a great product - except for the switch itself which is cheap and completely lets the product down.

I wouldn't recommend buying this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I bought two of these so I could have a switch on both sides of the room. Initially, everything seemed ok. Then, I frequently had to press the ON several times for the light to turned on. Eventually, it didn't work at all. I switched to Channel B and everything was fine. For a week. Then, the lights started turning off at random times unexpectedly. Now, if I turn the lights on, with a second or two it, they turn off. So I tried the other plug in module. Turning on is an iffy thing. Levitan usually makes reliable products: most every switch and outlet in my house is Levitan. But this Anywhere Switch is a real disappointment. It's not worth anything if it doesn't work reliably 100% of the time. As a follow up, I did go down to the big box hardware store and bought a similar product for $15.

He provides a short quiz you can complete at the beginning of each chapter to identify easily which areas of your charisma need work. Allessandra believes that you don't have to be born with charisma, that anyone can increase his or her level of charisma. He demystifies it in this clearly focused, very readable book. Alessandra probably could write complete books on each of charisma's seven keys. In fact, the section on adaptability is essentially a summary of a book he co-authored, The Platinum Rule. But instead of seven volumes, here is one well-edited book packed full of content. We at getAbstract recommend this book to people who want to improve their charisma, or to understand the tangible aspects of this intangible quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Marketing Crime","review":"I think charges could be brought against Alessandra for this offering. He banks heavily on the statistical knowledge that very few people who buy this kind of book ever read beyond the second chapter. Therefore, the first two chapters and the cover are merely razzle-dazzle fluff constantly mentioning \\"charisma,\\" but rarely saying much about it. He then offers a weak thesis that charisma is related to communication then proceeds to stuff the rest of the book with what is obviously old material on the subject of communication occasionally tying it to charisma.

The author (or writer) is down-to-earth and a lot of the advice is actually useful. I thought the approach was a bit westernized in that the definition of \\"charisma\\" was definitely rooted in our own culture, but that part wasn't a surprise.

This book has many different twists and turn that will keep you reading long into the night. The way Shara feels about being the odd-one-out in the InnerWorld, then people start disappearing all over the place. The mysterious person that turn up to lead Shara and Gabreil on a serious wild-goose chase over time and distance ,not knowing that if she does what she has been told will destroy her family.Gabriel is the one who is the most pratical in the quest. As it is usually the woman who is pratical it was a change to let the male be serious. The way the plot leads you to the time when the Greek Gods rules and discribes in detail the orgies they had. Here is where Shara and Gabriel discover they attraction to each other and share the same 'mating fever'as the action gets more intense. I'll not tell the end , but definitely a must read and keep."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST READ AND A MUST SHARE!!!!!!","review":"We received this book from a family friend and it has taken off into a study with the church youth group. It is a challenge to witness as Mark Cahill does but you will agree, it is a challenge one will feel great about as the witnessing continues throughout your own life. Get one for yourself and for all your family and friends. Pass it on to a stranger. You never know who you can help."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Tips!","review":"In a succinct manner, Mark explains the need for evangelism. His many stories are very encouraging too."},{"rating":"1","title":"wrong focus","review":"Cahill focuses heavily on the afterlife as the reason why people should accept Christ.He doesn't focus enough on how Jesus changes people in THIS life here on earth; how we can have a blessed relationship with him on earth. Rather, his tool for evangelism is: tell people they need jesus or else they will not go to heaven.Great writing style doesn't mean great content"},{"rating":"2","title":"Every Christian should read this book","review":"When it comes to conveying the heart of Christianity in a few words, this book really cuts to the chase. The author answers one of the most critical questions a Christian, old or new, can ask: How can I most effectively share my faith with family, friends, and complete strangers? And after all, isn't that what we're here for?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for all Christians","review":"Essentially it is an easy-to-read book that contains convicting truths that each of us is commanded to share our faith. It then proceeds to show you how to witness, with numerous examples and a wealth of knowledge that can make you a bold speaker for the Lord. God bless you as you read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous","review":"The book came lickety split & was in \\"NEW\\" Condition & the seller exceeded my expectations.The book itself is a dynamic tool for witnessing , altho I would disagree with one on one evangelism with strippers & call girls..Lots of helpful hints & surveys, using the 10 commandments & Ray Comfort Techniques"},{"rating":"2","title":"Explains why evangelism just makes sense","review":"This book explains why doing evangelism should be a no-brainer. Read it, think, and then tell people about Jesus!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great witnessing resource","review":"Highly recommended for anyone who has a passion for sharing the gospel of Jesus Christ. If you want God to get the glory out of your life and see others come to a saving knowledge of salvation through Jesus Christ, then I say don't hesitate to get this book. It's so good that you will probable read it within a couple of days!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Get a real pet thermometer","review":"In the past I've had occasion to use this Pet Temp. The last time I used it on one of my cats (a couple of weeks ago), the cat's behavior told me he was sick but the Pet Temp said \\"normal.\\" I took him to the vet anyway and sure enough he was running a temperature. The Pet Temp has given me so many erroneous readings that I finally decided to buy a real pet thermometer (just like the one the vet uses). The vet remarked that he's compared the Pet Temp's readings with the ones generated by his thermometer and he said the Pet Temp is unreliable. That's good enough for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pet Thermometer Covers","review":"These are used with the Pet Temp thermometer. I find that they are pretty easy to apply.

This was just what I wanted and I was thrilled to find it to get some of the great oldies songs missing from my collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought the last 2 were bad...","review":"This film is obviously the second to worst of all the films in the howling series (right next to part 7) and has the exact same plot as the first one, only done wrong and mixed with some new nonsense about a nun. Not really worth watching except to complete your viewing of the whole howling series. just a warning though of how low the series' standards have sunk... they try to pass small dogs off as vicious werewolves. not even kidding."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Howling IV:The Original Nightmare.","review":"With Each sequel Howling gets worst and worst and worst, and less scarier and more boring. oh well."},{"rating":"1","title":"These are the Days of our livesssssnore............","review":"Do you like soap opera acting for 2 hours?

Please don't listen to these other reviews saying\\" Oh this is so much like the the book, or this is so under appreciated\\" If this is like the book, then thank goodness I never read it! I enjoyed the first three Howling movies, which had their own charm in different ways. The original just had really cool werewolves, the second had Christopher Lee ,and cool gothic architecture(plus Sybal Danning ,wink wink) the third had alot of humor,and that strange Australian sensability to it, but this? Come on there is nothing to this movie but words,words,words,words,words,then two minutes of werewolves. I love b movies, I love schlock, the was just too dull for me. Yes the end is okay, but be sure to rent this one before you buy. I wish I had."},{"rating":"2","title":"Howwll!","review":"I loved this movie so much!

That's all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Howling IV: The Not So Original Nightmare","review":"This is living proof that crap needs a million dollar budget. This movie was bland. It had no style, no original elements, and overall, nothing good about it. Well, I take that back, the main character's husband had the best mullet. But other than that, nada. Unlike the original Howling, which had awesome and unique looking werewolves, this one the werewolves are, well, wolves. No make up required. They turned into the average, everyday wolf. Didn't put a whole lot a work into that did they? This movie was a B-movie, but didn't have a lot of the GOOD B-movie elements.What I learned from Howling 4: Howling 3 is way better as a B-movie.If you liked this movie, I recomend: Banging your head against a brick wall, because for as much pain as your going to go through watching this movie, you might as well inflict it on yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beyond bad","review":"The fourth entry into the Howling series finds that after three films the series had already outstayed it's welcome. The story is similar to that of the original film, involving a colony of werewolves that has one thing on their mind. Howling IV: Original Nightmare, isn't original in the least, and despite some solid makeup effects, nothing can save the film from the atrocious acting (from Romy Windsor and Pretender's Michael T. Weiss) lackluster directing, and predictable story. It's a terrible film, but believe it or not, there would be more Howling films on the way after this, which would get even worse! Do yourself a favor, skip every Howling sequel and stick with Joe Dante's original tongue-in-cheek classic, because no Howling film after that is even worth seeing."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie sucked !!!!!","review":"The best part of the movie was when you get to see the shopkeep naked .

I don't like to see any celebrity manipulate people through their fame. I was offended by the video, because it's so manipulative and arrogant. People shouldn't campaign for a not guilty vote by joining up with other celebrities. Let the truth speak for itself, and the jury think for itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"I wish it came leather bound.","review":"Great work. This is a true translation that offers insight into the meaning that may be lost on the modern ear in many previous translations. It doesn't have the same feel as those that came after (viz., NIV, NKJV, etc.), where a very formal language is preferred, but it's held up over time. I think it's the informality that gives it its special charm. It also helps to know that Philips was not only a skilled translator, but a mature Christian. I think the text will please on levels that others don't approach. Best description: it's kind of folksy.My Dad gave this to me when I was 9. I've been reading it off and on for about 30 years. If it was the only translation available, it would be more than adequate.I only wish Phillips had finished more of the Old Testament before he died."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT HAPPY","review":"THIS BOOK CAME TO ME WITH A BROKEN BINDING AND WAS IN HORRIBLE SHAPE.

The J.B. Phillips new testament translation is a favorite of mine, and hard to get these days. Everybody sells \\"The Message\\" which is simlar, or NIV. The language here is less stilted than King James, but not chopped up like NIV or toal paraphrase, like Peterson's The Message. Praise God, it's good!"},{"rating":"1","title":"dougv","review":"An excellent translation, but this publisher used a font that is too hard to read--the letters are too thick and too close together.Recommend that you buy from another listing on Amazon, but be sure it's therevised edition. I'm giving tne above edition away, and I'll look for differentedition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helpful translation","review":"There are many translations of God's Holy Word available today. Many treat God's Word with reverence, respect, and without translational bias. From my brief studies of Phillips NT translation, it provided me with new insights into God's love for us and was done in a reverent, respectful, and conservative manner. I have enjoyed my studies so far in the NT in Modern English and will recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good addition to my Bible library","review":"My curiosity about this book was aroused when I heard a well respected pastor mention this translation several times in several different sermons. When I went to the local bookstore to see the book for myself (they didn't have it in stock and I purchased it on Amazon) the salesman who assisted me at the store (a gentlemen well into his 60's +) told me this was the first translation he ever read after the King James and it gave him much insight. I consider it as sort of a condensed commentary and it is a nice addition to my Bible library."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent anthology of vintage Central Asian music!","review":"This is an excellent cd of vintage music from the Central Asian countries of Mongolia, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, The Caucasus region, Tadjikistan and Azerbaijan, etc. These recordings capture a timeless beauty and essence of the classical and folk musical styles of the Central Asian peoples. The Tajik pieces are impressive, and those tracks #20 and #22 are true classics. The Azeri pieces are great and fans of Mongolian hoomei, or throat singing will be familiar with the Mongolian tracks on this cd. This is a great cd and it is one of the bset collections in the Secret Museum of Mankind series. All of the selections are classics from a bygone era. This cd, I must give a five star rating to just because this muisc is so good. It would be nice if Yazoo would release a further volume of this vintage Central Asian music classics. This kind of music has never sounded better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good quality re-issue of scarce jazz sides","review":"This CD collection (both volumes) is a must-have for the serious student of pre-swing Jazz. If you have a fondness for the early works of Fletcher Henderson, Duke Ellington, or JellyRoll Morton (who has one side featured on this collection, by the way), I would heartily recommend you check these CDs out.Since the metal stampers for these sides have long since been discarded by the companies that recorded them, the only source left is commercially issued 78s in varying condition. Old Yazoo has done a great job of finding clean copies and digitizing them properly. Surface noise varies from song to song, but each one is a classic in its own right.If you've been hunting through piles of 78s for the last four or five decades, you might have some of these. But all of them? And in this good a condition? Probably not. Consider these CDs an \\"instant 78RPM collection\\" of the finest calibre."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was such a good idea, too!","review":"Oh, what an attractive idea... finish a worthwhile sewing project in an afternoon. But the follow-through falls very far short of the concept. The so-called step-by-step photos are very unclear. There are text references to points 1, 2, 3 in the photos and the photos have no numbers. (See \\"Bob's Bias Tape Maker\\").Plus, why in the world would a round gathered bag need grommets if this is a shortcut book? I gave the book two stars because (1) the intention is a great one, and (2) the large photographs of the finished projects are beautiful. Almost made it, but alas, didn't ring the bell."},{"rating":"1","title":"An OK Hacker Book","review":"Having read a number of books on this subject, this was an just ok read. From the explanation the author gave of the kids, I came away thinking they were just script kiddies and nothing more. The author does not go into detail of the hacks and mostly covered just dos attacks and defacing websites.I wish the author had talked about more old-school hackers like lod/mod war, capn crunch, kevin poulsen (my favorite read: the watchman).However it was interesting to hear how the kids got involved with hacking and what each hackers personality and lifestyle was."},{"rating":"1","title":"No whiz at gathering information.","review":"How can you trust an author who can not even get his information correct? The pages available for review talked about a boy growing up on the treeless tundra of Fairbanks, Alaska.Well I live in Fairbanks and it is a green leafy town that is surrounded and filled by millions of trees, birch, chokecherry, willow, black and blue spruces as well as cottonwood trees. and several rivers and hot springs. Those are surrounded by hills and then mountains. He was writing totally away from reality!I then went to the library and found other erroneous parts of the book.

Hackers are an interesting breed and this title does not adequately explore why they do what they do. It isn't as simple as the author makes it out to be.If you are looking for a breakthrough title that presents some new, startling information, keep looking because you haven't found it here. Aside from that, the book is of average quality. It isn't poor, but at the same time there isn't anything exceptional about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty interesting","review":"I didn't know much about hacking or the hacking community before I read this book, but I have a better understanding of it now. The basic message of the book is that not all hackers are geeky teenagers with destruction in mind. If you're not a hacker, you probably can't completely understand their world, but this book is still an interesting insight into the lives and activities of some well-known hackers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible book","review":"This may be the worst book I have read in years and I would like to get my money back.

There are far better books about hackers and these kids deserved a better author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hackers","review":"This book is horrible.

This was written in easy to understand language that even someone who isn't familiar with SPD can understand. Some of my other books can be a bit technical. I lent this book to both my mother and mother in law to help them to understand what my 7yr old daughter is going through and why she has some of the behaviors that she does. Until they read this they thought she was just being naughty or stubborn. It was a huge eye opener for both of them and has resulted in them being a lot more tolerant with her. As a result of their understanding they are able to handle her peculiarities better and spending time at either Grandmother's house is a lot more pleasant for them and for my daughter.

In general I found this book very dry and hard to read, I kept falling asleep reading it no matter when I tried to read it. It just did not flow and keep my attention nor did it read like a text book, it just was not for me and I would not recommend it. I would like to offer I have read about 15 books on sensoery integration so I was knowledgable in this subject matter, maybe to a person just starting the sensory issues it would be better suited."},{"rating":"1","title":"not that helpfull","review":"I was disapointed with this book. It was more about family dynamics, especially how to have a good marriage than SPD. It was more about the author's austistic brother than dealing with SPD. Maybe because I have already read alot about SPD, but I thought this book was not worth buying and with the exception of the vinette about \\"Holland Schmolland\\" which is both funny (for those of us who have been there) and sad, not really worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing, too little about parenting","review":"I expected this book to focus more on parenting.

I'm glad I took a chance on this DVD, because Creatures From The Abyss (AKA Plankton) turned out to be a hoot. From the bad dubbing and inane dialog, to the cheezy, but fun SPFX, this one reminded me of later films by Lamberto Bava (Graveyard Disturbance, Prince of Terror) and Lucio Fulci (Ghosts of Sodom, Zombie 3). The plot is simple: 5 kids out for a good time take refuge on a deserted ship, where they soon discover mutant plankton, which attack them one by one. Some of the effects reminded me of Carpenter's The Thing, but much more crude. So grab a six pack and enjoy.

The single highlight -- for me and seemingly for those present in the audience: Gruberova singing Donna Anna's \\"Non mi dir.\\" But only a true \\"collector\\" would buy a DVD just for that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't live up to the ridiculous price","review":"This production wasn't all THAT bad, but the acting was pretty much non-existent, except for perhaps Zerlina and/or Masetto. Allen seemed like he wasn't completely in the role of Giovanni, Gruberova could have used a little more makeup and acting, as far as Murray...well...she could have done more, especially during the \\"let me show you how many women Don Giovanni has slept with all over Europe\\" aria instead of just standing there like a dead stump, and Leporello could have given more emotion, in my opinion. And I do have to say that the entire statue scene could have been a little better. I just couldn't seem to buy into it.HOWEVER...The singing was quite good in parts, especially in terms of Gruberova and Mentzer. That, at least, gave this DVD some redemption, but I still don't think it's worth nearly [the price].My advice? Borrow it from a friend or try to find a copy of this in the library before buying it. It's certainly something that can wait."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad-Bad-Bad","review":"Regrettably, I have to agree with Sepand Ghanouni (December 29,2005). I found this production profoundly disappointing. Perhaps it's only a question of poor video equipment or lighting or God-knows-what, but almost every scene comes off as dark, gloomy, and indistinct - and the acting is...well, how can I put it? Was the entire cast hungover, or depressed, or what? The visual aspects of the opera (lighting, costumes, acting) turned me off so thoroughly that I could hardly focus at all on the music and singing. Mozart should sue."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste","review":"Don Giovanni is by far one of my favorite operas, so when I saw this DVD I bought it immediately. Big disappointing. The video quality is old-fashioned TV, illumination too dark. The most disappointing part was not technical, but artistic; in the scene when the Comendatore comes to Don Giovanni's house (my favorite scene, I was astonished when I first saw it in Amadeus) the Comendatore is NOT THERE, just his voice. It lost all its impact when you see Don Giovanni talking to the audience. People usually wait two hours for this scene, and then it comes THIS? Sometimes originality is not better. I suggest to keep listening a CD version of the opera, and use your imagination for the rest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Educator review","review":"I bought this to show my students. The opera is in Italian, with English subtitles. The kids got into it. It is well done. The beginning shows shots of the conductor/orchestra pit, which I loved as this is part of what I teach them. There are one or two words that are questionable when it came time to show it to my fifth graders, but most handled it well, and class that didn't I just left the subtitles out. The DVD comes with program notes as to the story for each act/scene, so this was easy to do. I would reccommend this for any other educator looking for a good version to show their classes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don Giovanni","review":"Great story by Di Ponte. Great music by Mozart. Great scenes by La Scala.Wish they had done something a little more imaginative with the Statue who came to dinner, but other than that, a wonderful performance. So great to be able to buy good opera on DVD with surround sound. It's a long way from here to anywhere with serious opera companies. Fills the Winter nights."},{"rating":"2","title":"fine production of fabulous opera","review":"This La Scala production of one of the greatest operas ever written is a delight to watch. The cast is excellent with fine voices and some pretty impressive acting for opera singers. If you can draw your attention away from the marvelous singing, keep an eye on the interactions of the singers. The staging is thoughtfully done. The setting is dark but elegant in keeping with the content of the opera and creates an appropriate period mood. The camera work is commendable -- carefully zooming in when needed, giving ensemble views as appropriate and occasionally showing the orchestra director superimposed on the picture. While there aren't many frills on the DVD, the very fact of scene searches allows you to go quickly to your favorite arias and hear them again and again. Mozart's music is easily accessible to a beginning opera listener and continues to delight an experienced listener. If you have any interest in opera, I would recommend this dvd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful production values","review":"This is a poor use of the DVD format - obviously just a copy from a video version. There are no DVD features, aside from chapter search. The production values are just awful - grainy, fuzzy, dark."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant cinematic production, exciting conducting","review":"The production is classical and sumptuous, with wonderful silhouette effects and glistening reflective black floor. Very well sung and acted throughout; I especially liked the virile-sounding Don Ottavio of Araiza. Muti leads a dynamic, romantic rendition of the score, only slightly distracting when the camera repeatedly cuts to him during crucial arias. An altogether riveting performance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mutti's 'Don Giovanni'","review":"Mozart's operas have never been the easiest to set, and this production's director does little to alleviate that stigma. The sets are austere and repetitive, the costume design is good but hackneyed by overuse, and the lighting often obscures the more delicate details of the staging. But, if the backdrop to the music is slightly disappointing, the music itself is anything but. Mutti leads a roaring interpretation that lets down neither his lightning fast tempo nor the jubilent spirit at the heart of Mozart's music.The casting is superb! From Zerlina (Metzner), meek and innocent (even through her final curtain call) to Leoporello (Desderi) whose antics on the stage make us fall in love with his character to Thomas Allen's Don Giovanni who is the perfect blend of regality and wickedness. All around this is the best recording of Don Giovanni available on DVD, and one those eager to aquire Mozart's grand masterpiece in this format first need look in to."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Real-Life Motivational Narrative","review":"Loree Hirschman tells her story with candor and lets the drama of her story speak for itself.

He also has trouble with his schoolwork because he didn't because he wasn't taking things seriously before. The only thing he knows is how to play ball, while in college he is tempted to fix games with local gamblers. He has a hard time focusing until sherry comes along.

But he meet a girl named Sherry that he really liked and they started dating. His basketball team started off strong. This book is an example of hard work and teamwork.I liked this book because it was mostly about basketball and I like to play and watch basketball.

No, it's not a fictional account of the election of John Paul II -- it was written many years before the current Pope's election.Surrounding the main plot are a number of sub-plots dealing with the very human problems of abortion, infidelity, divorce, homosexuality, and many of the other issues which continue to plauge the world and the Church.This book is highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Pope from the Steppes.","review":"First read this some 20 years ago and reread it recently.Was more enthralled the 2nd time.I liked that the author appears to have inside knowledge of the Vatican.He impresses us with it as he slowly unravels the story of Kiril Lakota,a cardinal from behind the iron curtain(when there was a curtain)who unexpectedly and reluctantly is elected Supreme Pontiff.Not being of the faith it was all a mystery to me and this story managed in a little way to de-mystify a few things.How they elect a pope for one! It dawns on the reader that even persons that high up have foibles and prejudices like us mere mortals.A comforting and worrying thought at the same time. A must for all Morris West fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent. Subject: The Life and Times of His Holiness","review":"The author did a very nice job of illustrating how the church leaders can feel very compassionate towards a person or issue, yet the churches' position comes across as cold and condescending. The character development was excellent. I developed a sense of pity for the loneliness and isolation that the Pope must feel until death. The plots that only superficially involved the Pontiff were great and really kept the reader engaged. This book gave a very well rounded depiction of the papacy, Rome, and the questions facing the church today.My only problem with this book was that it was laden with verbose narratives about evolution, faith, eternity, and other complicated issues. The book did not quench my thirst for papal history and traditions, but this was fiction, so that will have to wait for another day and other book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoughts of a Pope","review":"A prescient book about the future Popes, evidently published the day John XXIII died.Prescient in that John Paul 1 evidently wanted to give much of the Churches wealth to help the poor and John Paul II was from Eastern Europe (Poland).Interesting extracts from the Pope's 'diary' where he writes his personal thoughts about wanting to make his mark on the Vatican and the world.I was a bit disappointed in the end where it was rather left hanging without a final climactic action but overall an excellent read.The film of the book had a better finale but was only loosely based on the book (inspired by?).The Shoes of the Fisherman"},{"rating":"2","title":"Morris West thumbs up","review":"The Shoes of a Fisherman is very well written. You have to put yourself into the setting of the early 60's. The combination of action and contemplation keeps up the interest and makes you think.

But then my taste was all in my mouth. Now the lengthy internal monologues, stilted conversations and sexist language would make a modern reader toss it in the garbage. Sure, it's been overcome by events, having been published 50 years ago, but that's not the problem. The problem is the nearly unreadable style. It would now rise as high on any popularity chart as a Thomas Hardy novel. Maybe not quite that high. It's possible to write about the past and make it engaging, but West is too busy sermonizing and pontificating (Sorry!) to write an interesting story for people today to enjoy. It didn't age well. In retrospect I wonder what the hell I found so compelling back then."},{"rating":"2","title":"Explore the inner trauma of our first Ukrainian Pope.","review":"Even if you saw the movie, you should read this book which opens up a variety of spiritual questions. You might be especially surprised, since viewing the movie is often seen as a Roman Catholic rite, that there is a strong homosexual element that is dealt with in the book which is not at all obvious in the movie.

After my husband's death I read several books dealing with loss and death. Those books were very good at describing grief and what to expect, however, suicide was not covered. And in no way did those books prepare me for what I was going to go through. I found myself in this book over and over again. I found out that it is NORMAL to feel guilty, to withdraw, to punish yourself, to be blamed for the suicide, to blame others for the suicide, to love and miss my husband but also feel relief that he is no longer in my life, to feel that life will never be anything but a living hell.I have had significant insights about myself and other family members after reading this book that will help me continue to live on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Healing After The Suicide Of a Loved One","review":"I read this book a few weeks after my son took his life.

On the other side is the problem of people being unjustly sentenced for crimes they did not commit - fortunately new DNA evidence has exonerated a number of them.

What she wants is to force an accused person to prove that they are innocent and to do so without a lawyer.

Too bad it fell apart so completely that my only motive for completing the book was to see if its plot was as lame as I suspected. Alas, it was. The author relies on the \\"idiot plot,\\" with the main character behaving like a dunce solely to advance the story and prevent a premature conclusion. Why waste time on a book where you can guess who dunnit simply by the introductory description of a character? Furthermore, the moralizing in the book is superficial and serves only to fill pages up with words."},{"rating":"1","title":"shallow, a fantasy for men only","review":"Los Alamos is a book by a man, about a man, for men.

It's a near identical rip of Fat Man and Little Boy, but with a lame fictional subplot of a murder mystery. The characters are very forgettable, the reason for being for some characters in the story is in doubt (the main character for one, the murder victim for another - a bad combo for a murder mystery). The author basically piggybacked a half baked short story into a pre-existing historical account to flesh it out to novel length, implausably working his main character into recorded historical events.

However, after struggling through the first 100 pages, I still had no interest in the murder of Bruner. Instead of building the murder case/investigation up, Kanon opts unsuccessfully to develop the romance between Connolley and Emma. Their stilted conversations became tiresome, and Kanon's feeble attempt to portray the two as flirtatious fell quite flat. As a thriller, the book is okay. As a romance, it is unsuccessful.

The writing was full off cliches that were like one liners in a bar. The unnessessary love scene was not even written well. It was like a teenager describing sex for the first time. The only reason I finished was to see who did what. Even after you find out, the book continues to drag on after. To much time was spent trying to set up the back ground and the chemistry between Connelly and Emma. From the get go this was a horrible trash pulp novel. And Like a cherry on the top I even found a typo. Go figure from a printing executive."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great period piece","review":"Joseph Kanon's novel Los Alamos is a wonderful period piece that uses the almost unbelievable setting of the Manhattan Project as the basis for a mystery and love story that, because of the situation and time, are more significant than would otherwise be the case. The blending of real and fictional characters in what is one of the centuries most fascinating stories makes for a gripping tale that has much to recommend it. This is a fascinating story and led me to unexpected hours of research on the actual history of the Manhbattan Project just to check things out.

I did not even feel i had learned anything about the Manhatten project."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dud.","review":"What a disappointment! This novel does nothing to set the atmosphere, reading more like a modified screenplay (which I'm suspecting was one of the motivations playing in Kanon's mind). The characters are poorly (re)imagined, the settings dismissively portrayed, and the writing style unremarkable. Also, I had the feeling that the author didn't work on immersing himself in the circumstances of New Mexico, WWII, or the Project. It's all too contemporary in parts (seems like it's pulled out of the 1980s instead of the 1940s). Finally, the plot is too simplistic and rather dull. A dud."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money","review":"Nothing happens--after 250 pages!--so I just gave up. The story just meanders, goes on and on about nothing really. A security officer from Los Alamos is found dead with his pants down. So, I was thinking: Is this a comedy? The hero/sleuth Connors sets out to solve the crime...very, very, very slowly. He meets Emma, the wife of one of the scientists, and falls for her...uggh! I was convinced it was a comedy when at the memorial service for the deceased, where Oppenheimer himself quotes from the Bhagavad Gita, Connors gets a woody over Emma. What? That does it. I read a little more and gave up. Hopeless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like Soup Diluted with Water","review":"The subject is very ambitious and intriguing; Los Alamos in WW2. But unfortunately, this book is extremely poor as a novel. It is lengthy and tedious, and I felt like drinking soup diluted several times with water. It contains several interesting matters such as a guilty conscience of the scientists for creating the dreadful weapon, but they are described only superficially and not appealing at all.And the characters are all dull and flat, especially Connolly, the protagonist. It might be a little better if he were a mechanical narrator who just reported the life in Los Alamos to readers. But he artificially displays his \\"personality\\" with an abrupt adultery. That makes the story increasingly diffuse and boring.I won't accuse this book as a complete waste of time, because it let me have a glimpse of the inside of Los Alamos in WW2. But I feel terribly frustrated why such an intriguing subject could not become a better novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting read","review":"I liked this book, partly because I lived in Los Alamos as a child and partly because I am interested in the historical aspects of the Manhattan Project. As a thriller it was pretty good independent of those aspects, because the plot was complex enough that you couldn't see where the author was going with it from a million miles away. Of course the guy gets the girl in the end, but it seemed fresh and interesting to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bad","review":"Curiously dissapointing.

A man's been killed, and the circumstances seem to imply a homosexual liason gone wrong. The problem is that the victim is a security officer at the Los Alamos Atomic Weapons Facility, so someone must investigate thoroughly to make sure nothing's compromised. A peacetime newspaperman improbably turned detective shows up to investigate, and thus begins Joseph Kanon's Los Alamos.Moving from the desert to diners in New York City, the book has an easy sort of grace to it. The characters are fluent, and believeable, and the plot is fast enough to be interesting. Our hero gets a girl, the bad guys are interesting, it's all worthwhile, far as I was concerned. There are also interesting supporting characters, including General Leslie Groves, J. Robert Oppenheimer, and a bunch of scientists. This makes for a very entertaining book."},{"rating":"1","title":"interesting plot with no conclusion","review":"The premise had promise a murder of one of the people inviolved with the nations most secret project, the building of the first atomic bomb. The main thrust of the book is not the building or the interpersonal conflict that arise from the creation of the bomb, you learn nothing of it from the book. The point seems to be how often the main character can have sex with the wife of one of the bombs builders. Once the covert spying network is uncovered nothing happens. Great expectations, no delivery."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good read with a bit of history thrown in.","review":"I'm not quite finished reading the book yet, but I'm really enjoying the read.

This film is like a mid-century propaganda film. It does nothing but make false claims. It claims antidepressants actually cause neurotransmitter deficiencies. That there is zero evidence that they help depression and that depression is basically made up by the drug companies. It shows footage from the Columbine shooting several times when only one of the shooters had been previously prescribed antidepressants. Obviously antidepressants weren't the common link in that situation. I could go on and on.

She's a good writer and has a good grasp of Jewish women, but she didn't sustain the story. For the first two-thirds of the novel, I couldn't do anything but read. Whether Ragen got bad editorial advice, or just ran out of premise, she opts for a storybook ending that is so preposterous, it is laughable. It is also insulting to Christians. If a Christian novelist described Jewish belief in the same shallow way she describes Christian belief, they'd be stoned. Despite this. It's worth the time spent because it is a promise of better things in newer Ragen efforts. I'm hopeful. I made my sister read it and she agrees. We're both waiting to read Hannah Mendes. I hope we won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a preposterous storyline!","review":"I agree with another reviewer here about how the storyline andcharacters for this novel are just utterly preposterous! If theprotagonist of the novel really was an ultra-Orthodox Jew, nothingthat was expected of her after marriage would have been a surprise.The husband is originally portrayed as a sympathetic character but almost immediately becomes a caricature. He starts beating his wife and torturing her. Her parents don't give a hoot when she calls them to tell them that her husband is abusing her. Supposedly their lives revolved around her before she married. All of a sudden, they stopped caring. Real people just aren't like that.While the writing style was engaging, I finished this book merely for the entertainment value. The plot twists were so outrageous that they were quite amusing."},{"rating":"1","title":"shocking","review":"As a Hassidic woman myself, I found this book to be far fetched and unrealistic. The storyline was actually humorous because it is so far from the realities that take place in our community.

At first she is portrayed as this ultra orthodox girl, but when she gets married she doesn't realize that she has to COMPLETELY cover her hair and wear skirts? Even I, as an unorthodox Jew know that much.... I don't think that a truely orthodox girl would put herself in certain situations the way Bat Sheva did - like going to an unkosher restaurant. And even though there is a little sympathy for her husband at first, after that he is portrayed as a \\"monster\\", even though he had to face a wife that had values so different than he was raised to expect, and he just didn't know how to deal with her, and get her to understand the values he believed in. Doesn't he deserve some understanding for that?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jephte's Daughter","review":"This is a wonderful book, written by a very talented author. I have enjoyed Chiam Potok's books as well, as they also give me a glimpse into the Hassidic world.Near the end of the book I felt uncomfortable as the author began to deal with Christianity. I am a Christian and do not see my faith at all as the author described it. However, I read on, and really appreciated seeing how a Jewish person sees my faith. Very enlightening. I have also read The Saturday Wife, years ago, and did not realize till I was nearly finished that it was the same author. I will look for more of her books. I believe that to know the scriptures (both old and new testaments) gives added enjoyment to the reading of this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"easy listening","review":"I highly recommend these tapes, particularly for older or extremely busy people. You can pop them into your cassette while driving or in cassette player at home and listen to them while you are doing your house work. They make studying the Bible much easier and relaxing. The acting on these cassettes ranges from excellent to average. Thankfully, they spent the extra bucks to get high quality narrators to protray the Father and Jesus. Though both are extremely valuable, the New Testament segments seem better produced than the Old Testament segments. Quite obviously, the original author deserves considerable credit. The tapes cover the entire Old and New Testaments, but do not include the Apocrapha from the Catholic Bible, as this is the King James Version.

Cairncross extends those thoughts and comes up with a series of conclusions that you may or may not agree entirely with, but surely are thought provoking. Good summary of the key points on the first few pages, all of which are expanded with good reasoning in later pages. If you like the style of the Economist, you'll like this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Naive, simple-minded and utopic...","review":"This kind of book is likely to lead the reader in wrong and simplistic insights of what is going on. Yet the beginning offers a relevant overview of the evolution of communications, that is, the Telephone, the Television and the Internet. Consequently man can quite well understand that these three medias will merge in the future and that information will really overwelhm the customer. Nevertheless Frances Cairncross loses her relevance as soon as she tries dramatically to convince the reader of an happy end, a \\"global peace\\", where most people are freed from policy. But she does not speak about the power of money, the deep consequences of theses big corporations that she only touches on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good overview; too superficial if you're looking for theory.","review":"A good enough overview of some of the forces that are shaping our society. Rather than base her findings and especially forecasts on any visible data, much of the book is formulated as speculation. (\\"This is going to happen\\", full stop.) I bought the book under the assumption that it might help me with a paper on how the Internet alters the perception of Distance in US and European culture... following some of Baudrillard's arguments. Well, no full-on theorizing in this book, neither the depth not the elegant style of (e.g.) Nick Negroponte or George P Landow... but if your favorite aunt is a moderately successful businesswoman who thinks computers _won't affect_ our culture & society, I suggest you give her the book as a present. david skreiner"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland","review":"Bland and simple.

The decrepit seaside village and atmosphere is superb, and the film captured my attention and I never got bored by it. There are many times when not much is happening because the film doesn't have a high body count, but it's well directed and I wouldn't consider it to be a slow moving film. It doesn't have a lot of gore, but some scenes are kind of violent and the Templar knights look great. Also, there's some scenes in the film where crabs are crawling over the remains of the sacrificed victims. It never explains what this is supposed to mean or why that's happening, but I actually liked it.

Sgt. Pepper by the Beatles, Breakfast in America by Supertramp, Eldorado by ELO, Aja by Steely Dan, Dark Side of the Moon by Pink Floyd, Goodbye Yellow Brick Road by Elton John, and Songs In the Key of Life by Stevie Wonder. This soulful album rounds out a perfect collection. I love all forms of music from John Coltrane to Jim Croce, but this album has always spoken to me. It is worth it for 'As' alone, or the blatt of the brass on Sir Duke! Village Ghetto Land is beautiful and extremely haunting at the same time, and you won't soon forget the lyrics. This album is an old friend that finally needs to be replaced with a CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"perfection","review":"There is some music that is so good and so passionate and so ..perfect that one can only theorise that its composer has been momentarily brushed with the paintbrush of genius. Stevie Wonder has been lucky to have been privy to multitude brushstrokes. On this album..this magnum opus...he is at his best. There is no such thing as a filler on this album and every song says something important...every word is meaningful, every instrument augments the message. From straight pop to well crafted R & B, songs of unconditional love to lost love to obsessive love; social commentaries to simple melodies- this album has it all. No music collection is complete without this on the second shelf, poised in the centre of the wall of cds, for easy reach."},{"rating":"2","title":"10 STARS FOR SOUL","review":"You know I found the album of him with two records and listening to it is just so AMAZING!!!

Just wanna' say however that they blew a once in a lifetime opportunity with the remastering of these albums. Whoever they got to do the re-mastering must have some high-end hearing loss, because he tweaked the highs way too much, perhaps trying to go for a contemporary R&B, over-hyped sound. It's pretty consistent across all the new CDs, which I eagerly bought - a sharp, brittle high end. And too much compression as well, sort of squishing the life out of the tunes. I'm just thankful I bought a copy of Mobile Fidelity's Gold Master's Series \\"Innervisions\\" before they went out of print. To my ear, that's what all Stevie's records should sound like. And for now, I'll happily keep listening to the original versions of all these classic albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"Original master tape","review":"Audio Fidelity does not use the Original master tapes on this and about all of the CD releases. They claim the sources they use are going to give the consumer a great sounding CD.If you're not using the Original master tape then you're comparing HDTV to analog TV.This version sounds very slightly better then the Motown release but compare the cost.I wish Mobile Fidleity would release this because they use nothing but the Original Master tape and the sound comes through.A great Stevie Wonder CD, but all of his CD's are great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor sound","review":"Like always with AF releases, the sound is just so bad and lifeless.

It is an offense to the artists."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Album, Poor remaster","review":"Many people will look for the gold copy of an album to offer superior playback - it would be a given you would think. This is one of my all time favorite recordings. It has been butchered and sent back a notch by Audio Fidelity. Not sure what went wrong here - I compared several cuts back to back - The AF Gold and the latest Tamla remaster from Universal/ Motown on two players, Sony SCD 555 and Ah Njoe Tjoeb 4000. The dynamics are gone, the detail is down, the recording is veiled. To smooth a recording is acceptable - until you loose the dynamics.What a bring down.

In commercials, Stevie's \\"Isn't she Lovely\\" can be found, and the soundtrack to the movie \\"The Best Man\\" includes the rousing \\"As\\".There isn't a single song on this album that made me reach for the Fast Forward or Stop button on my CD player.

I remember when it came out and I knew that Stevie was destined to be great forever. I hoped that he would progress from here but I think this CD remains his best work ever.

The variety and inventive melodies, effects, verses are just outstanding. What \\"makes\\" this album is not only the SW's odd, throaty voice but the arrangements themselves - simultaneously musical, exciting, poetic and of a refined caliber rarely seen today. Perhaps what I am praising is the excellence of the work itself, the attention to detail.As for favorites, one could as easily choose \\"Black Man\\", \\"Isn't she Lovely?\\", \\"As\\", \\"I am Singing\\"....all are superb.

Unlike other reviewers, i appreciate some \\"air\\" in the Motown remasters for the sense of proximity it creates. However, i like the way this gold disc clarifies the mid range, ungarbles the high end, and provides \\"bap\\" in the low end. If you want a real treat, compare the versions of \\"I Wish\\". It will make you wonder what is wrong with the tapes Motown used 11 years ago. On disc 2 i compared \\"I Am Singing\\" and found similar results.To me, the soundstage (if i'm using that term correctly) is too snug and tight on all the Audio Fidelity Wonder issues. They could be spread out some more, but i don't know if that's possible without re-mixing, and that runs into money, as Chico Marx once said."},{"rating":"1","title":"Need a better method of shipping","review":"Although these candies did have a very good flavor I was very disappointed.

The Major Arcana has pictures that somewhat explain the meaning of the card through artwork. But the whole rest of the deck is nothing more than a deck of playing cards. They show the symbol and a design with the number of that symbol on each card. No pictures to depict the meaning of each card at all!

The people who are included in this book are old stars, and of no interest to younger readers (30 something and below).

It also contains a handful of photographs, although you'll probably want to supplement them with more from other sources. It could be even better (the author focuses too much on late-war versions and not on the boats as they existed in their heyday, which is likely to be of greater interest to most modelers). But especially because there' s a fair amount of misinformation about these boats in circulation, and some inaccurate kits and aftermarket superdetailing products on the market, this is an indispensible resource for anyone who is planning on investing a large amount of time in a U-Boat project."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cannot get this book new","review":"Don't bother ordering new from Amazon, I waited almost 3 months before they finally admitted they could not get this book.

David Parst is Pastor of the OFallon Bible Church. He has a beautiful, slender wife and a great kid. But he wasn't strong enough to resist the overtures of a female member of his congregation. Her husband finds out, and exposes his sin in the middle of an evening church service. Then he goes outside and commits suicide.From that moment on, David's life and the lives of his wife and son go in different directions. We get to see how their lives transpire over the next 30 years. And we get to see the powerful, redemptive, gracious hand of God at work in the most difficult times.This book is a powerful look at how a moment of irresponsible sinning can not only bring down our own lives, but it can adversely affect the lives of the people we love. It also shows how God is working behind the scenes in our lives even when we don't realize it.This is a wonderful debut book by James David Jordan, and I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Journey of Faith","review":"I couldn't put the book down!

The book grabs your attention from the get go. I simply could not put it down. This is a tear jerking story about the trials and tribulations of a family and the awesome power of forgiveness.

And so the nut is under constant pressure and impossible to turn.I had to buy one of these recently, when my bow had a problem right before a gig. Worst money ever spent.Do yourself or your students a favor and avoid these at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissappointing","review":"I had read several reviews of Landmarq which were very positive before buying this DVD, most of them commented on Tracy Hitchings talents as a vocalist. While the band sounds good musically, her singing ruins an otherwise good performance. The sound of nails on a chalkboard comes to mind. If you want to hear a better example of Landmarq as a band, get some of their older CD's with Damian Wilson on vocals."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ellen Burstyn's best picture","review":"The movie on which all the TV shows were based, this is Ellen Burstyn's hard core, smart mouthing film about a woman whose husband dies, and she takes her son and goes in search of her dream of being a singer. Along the road of life, she encounters some fascinating people. The person who stands out the most is Harvey Keitel, who plays a mean, nasty husband who woos Burstyn and stirs her passions until his pregnant wife shows up. He kicks her out the door of Ellen's motel room while trashing the place, scaring the bejezus out of Ellen and her son. She moves on.Playing the piano and singing in lounges for meager pay, she meets Kris Kristofferson and falls in love. At this point, the only job she can get is as a waitress, where she meets a fellow waitress with a mouth worse than Ellen's. The restaurant scenes are hilarious, and the basis for the TV shows. It's one of those not to be missed films, filled with wisdom and cynicism."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed with This one","review":"I should have known. Filmed in 1974 it has nothing to offer. I just watched it on Turner Classic Movies. Everyone is praising this film. How Come?? It is a dreary account of a widow trying to get to Monterrey Ca to be a singer. Her 12 year old son is a spoiled, obnoxious, foul mouthed brat and she is so naive it is ridiculous. She does absolutely nothing to parent her son, the problem being she is trying to be his friend, not his mother, which would NOT be typical behavior of a woman of her generation. It was disgusting. I will not be buying this one, I do not recommend it to anyone, unless it is to show how NOT to bring up a child."},{"rating":"1","title":"Screaming Dysfunctional People!","review":"If you like to hear dysfunctional people screaming and yelling at each other; constantly arguing; and a woman volunteering to be a victim of abuse for herself and her son, you'll LOVE this movie!The kid is very irritating: constantly complaining and whining. But we have to remember that he never had proper adult role models in his life. His step dad verbally abused him (while his mom did nothing to stop it); and his mom was a complete airhead who had no idea what it took to be a nurturing parent.The restaurant scenes were just as bad!Disgusting!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely boring","review":"I read all of the first 4 chapters, skipped some of the middle, read the ending, and don't feel I missed much. I was truly bored, I didn't feel the events in the characters life were developed enough to for my satisfaction. I also didn't care for the main character, which probably added to my sense of frustration while slogging through this title."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a terrible video!","review":"This video reeks.

However, if you want the Boston \\"sound\\" with some great music and lyrics then you will not be disappointed. There are only a couple of tunes that miss the mark and Schultz is his usually tremendous self. Delp is missed but there are few around who can compete with him. You learn to appreciate this album for what it is....Boston without Brad Delp."},{"rating":"2","title":"Boston Walks On","review":"Boston has always been one of my favorite, I am 41 years old and have listened to Boston ever since they came out. Having their Lp's, (one of their picture albums), 8-tracks, cassettes and CD's Boston gets better every time they put a new album out. Their album Walk On goes to show that, they keep the music layout they have had and mix it in with the new music layout and make it better each time. The song Walk On is one of the best they have done, the music force in this song shows the intensity the band Boston puts into their songs. Their song Amanda, on this CD also shows that they can perform more than one type of music. Again I feel this is the best album the band Boston has come out with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tom's bets production yet","review":"As much as I like Brad Delp's voice, I must admit that I've aquired a taste for Fran Cosmo's and David Sikes's voices as well. The songs on this CD are much better written then on the previous three CDs. \\"Walk On\\" is a cleverly written song (something Boston isn't normally associated with). Tom made a wise decision to recruite song writters Sampson and Laquidara. Tom did do a fine job on \\"What's Your Name\\", a favorite. Brad did an excellent job on the previous three, but now that he's offically back in the group, Boston sounds much better Live. Can't wait to hear Boston's next CD with Brad, Fran, and David all sharing lead vocals."},{"rating":"1","title":"This does stink...","review":"I've read most of the other reviews & some people are just too loyally blind to recognize this thing for what it is.... creatively bland. You've got to call the baby ugly sometimes. I'm a huge Boston fan & will always see them in concert when they come around, maybe these songs (if played) will translate better live than on record/tape/CD... just like KISS Rock & Roll All Nite on ALIVE & Thin Lizzy's Cowboy Song on Live & Dangerous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forgetable","review":"This is the type of disc that you CAN'T WAIT to buy when it is first release. Then a year later it ends up in the used CD stores dollar bins. VERY disappointing, who is Tom trying to fool here? Stick with the first album and 3rd stage. They are all you will ever need."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where's the classic Rockman?","review":"This should be five stars but Tom wanted to go with a heavy bass sound and hide the harmonies and layered crunch that everyone loves.Even if Brad isn't on the album,it could have been redeemed by altering the sound.It's the classic crunch that everyone loves.Tom says he wants the albums to sound different and I can see th point.Zeppelin did this on every album but they still rocked.These guys were great on this tour and these songs were equally great.Don't overlook \\"I Need Your Love\\" and the \\"Walk On \\" medley.Just the classic crunch would improve these songs so much."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Brad = BAD","review":"Take Brad Delp out of the Boston sound and you have no Boston PERIOD.

In my teens I used to really like Boston and I said \\"Walk On? I didn't know Boston came out with a new album\\" My friend started laughing and said \\"Dude, put it in, you will be amazed\\" So I did, and yes, I was amazed: amazed at how unbelievably horrible this album is. When they were producing this album, were they saying \\"Ya know, Third Stage didn't quite have enough reverb in the mix, we REALLY need to turn it up to eleven on this one!\\" I mean, there is a ton of bad music out there but I don't think my friends and I have laughed at an album as hard as this one. Well, maybe the new Nickelback one.....On tour soon!! At a local casino near you!! One night only: Boston with special guest, Blue Oyster Cult!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"No Delp, but still vintage Boston","review":"While this album is a slight touch down from the debut or Don't Look Back, this is definitely a must for anyone who is a Boston fan. All of the songs are really great, especially the album opener \\"I Need Your Love\\", which has fantastic melodies that soar as high as on any Boston album. Vocalist Fran Cosmo does an outstanding job at the lead vocals, and at times he sounds just like Brad Delp. He brings to the plate many years of excellent vocal experience and is an excellent replacement for Delp. Tom Scholz revamps the earth shattering Boston sound through his guitar and organ notes on songs like the absolutely incredible medley of \\"Walk On\\" and the power rocker \\"Surrender To Me\\". Also to note, despite the beautifully performed \\"Livin' For You\\", this album is all about a return to rockers just like the first two albums. All in all a must have for anyone who loves the Boston sound and harmonies!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Boston...what more do you have to say?","review":"This is probably my least favorite of their albums, but it's still excellent and still Boston."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's Brad?","review":"Sorry, Tom, you weren't Boston all by yourself. It's like going to your hometown and not seeing Fenway, the Museum of Fine Arts, Cheers, the Ducklings, or the public market."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boston?","review":"Some would have you believe that Boston is only Tom Shultz in the studio, alas they are wrong. Listen to \\"Walk On\\" with out Brad Delp (The Voice of Boston), it sounds like Boston but it doesn't rock like a Boston album. I listened to it a few times and said this is not the same group I wait years for the next great album. Yes, I'll admit I do like the track, \\"What's your name\\". If your going to buy a Boston album get the Third Stage (Best Boston Album) or buy Boston's Greatest Hits with Brad Delp on \\"Higher Power\\" a new Boston track, that ROCKS. Tom Shultz had enough sense to bring Brad back on the Greatest Hits because he knew with out Brad there is no Boston! Walk on, and walk out of the record store!"},{"rating":"1","title":"what a disaster","review":"I would like to say I'm a fan of this band but having only one good album to their (or Tom's)credit makes it impossible. The worst part about everything they've done since Don't Look Back is that it tries to \\"sound like\\" the Boston from the first two albums and that's just not a good idea creatively. Focus on the writing first and not the surface appeal. George Lucas made that mistake in everything after the first couple Star Wars movies and Scholz does the same. The difference is that Lucas probably could have done better. Boston reminds me of other artists like Alanis Morissette, who have their time in the sun but never really know what to do with themselves after their place in time is passed, but at least Alanis has done some occasionally decent soundtrack stuff. I can't see at all what others see here and I'm astonished at anyone giving it more than two stars. Stay away from this album..."},{"rating":"1","title":"pass this one up","review":"With Walk On coming out 8 years after Third Stage, a person would think that Tom Scholtz had more than enough time to write plenty of strong material for a new, but I guess not. Walk On is a total bomb. Boston is a great band, but with this album they really missed the mark. None of the songs make a lasting impression. Stick with the first three albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"fell over, do not walk on!","review":"Even on this album Tom Scholtz stuck by his promise that all Boston albums would NOT have Synthesizers, violins or any other orchestral instruments. Ooohhhhh! so thats why this album is pure dog [poop]! If you want a good boston album, go out and buy Third Stage! The only good song is get organ-ized purely because all great prog-rock bands have a Hammond organ at one point. Yes, asia, UK, Genesis and toto."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not Boston without Brad Delp","review":"Some potentially good songs here but just not the same. Only for those into ritual self-abuse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Walk Away","review":"Tom Scholz is a perfectionist and he takes a tremendous amount of time recording albums. It took eight years to follow-up 1978's Don't Look Back with 1986's Third Stage. Along the way most of the original band left leaving just Mr. Scholz and vocalist Brad Delp, but those losses were easily overcome. In the seven and half years in between Third Stage and Walk On, Brad Delp left and this was no minor bump in the road. The secret behind the band's success was not only the orchestra of guitars but Mr. Delp's roof raising vocals. While Mr. Scholz replaced him with sound alike Fran Cosmo and a second vocalist, David Sikes, neither have the depth and range that match Mr. Delp and the songs suffer. There are a couple of decent tracks like \\"I Need You Love\\", \\"Livin' For You\\" and the title track but basically the rest of the album doesn't offer much."},{"rating":"2","title":"It rocks pretty hard","review":"I was not a fan of Boston \\"back in the day\\" (I wasn't even around then) but I have to say this is an awesome rock record. The highlight for me is the titular \\"Walk On Medley\\" split into the four tracks \\"Walkin' At Night\\", \\"Walk On\\", \\"Get Organ-ized\\" and \\"Walk On (some more)\\". As a single 12-minute song (the tracks flow into each other) it's gotta be one of the best rock songs I've ever heard. If you want to pick a track, I'd have to say \\"Walk On\\" is the best of them; it's under 3 minutes long but has an incredible amount of passion.The other songs are not quite as jaw-droppingly amazing. \\"Surrender to Me\\" and \\"We Can Make It\\" are good despite being a bit too synthy-muzak sounding; they also have the most recognizable melodies apart from \\"Walk On Medley\\". \\"Livin' For You\\" is pretty skippable.Overall, four stars. \\"Walk On Medley\\" is just that good, and even \\"Livin' For You\\" has a nice harmonic moment or two, just like I expected from a Boston album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Boston beyond their glory days, but with very impressive guitar","review":"Boston will never be able to top their classic debut and near-perfect follow-up Don't Look Back. But Walk On is a darn good disc. The guitar solos really stand out and the playing is fierce. Walk On rocks a lot harder than Third Stage. I was worried about the loss of Brad Delp on vocals, but Fran Cosmo is no stranger to Boston and actually does an outstanding job. If you like the first three Boston albums and are looking for more by Tom Scholz Walk On won't disappoint."},{"rating":"2","title":"walk on rocks!","review":"boston, a classic rock band of the 70s, 80s,and 90s! although this album has not sold very well, reasons: brad delp. brad delp gave boston its feel and sound, but fran cosmo has given boston a new and refreshing sound that's unique and powerful. examples: i need your love, livin for you. the whole album captures the feel of a movie through music, letting you visuallize what the song means to you. i totally recommend this album to anyone who is a boston fan or loves songs with true meaning. the album cover is another special edition to this boton release. great cover art that follows the music of the album. the cover sure got my attention when i first saw it back in 94'. well if you looking for an album next time your at the music shop pick this album up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Women's Fossil Blue Watch","review":"This watch looks great on my wrist.

He captures the essence of Larry Bird, from his childhood to his journey through high school and college to his emergence as both a basketball legend in the NBA and a larger-than-life sports hero in Boston. You may like this book even if you don't care for basketball. You will definitely enjoy this book if you area a hoops fan. And if you are a Larry Bird fan and you haven't read this book... shame on you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's called organization, Larry","review":"This book is great for any fan of Larry Bird. But, if you are not, you will become aggravated by reading this book. Grammatical errors and poor writing are littered throughout this entire book. Larry is my favorite athlete of all time, yet I still think he sounds like a moron in this book. Rich Garces is so good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Condition","review":"This is definitely the book I needed, but was not happy with the condition it is in. It was not very expensive so it isn't a big deal, but I have bought other books from Amazon in used condition - listed as good, and they were in much better shape. This book has pages falling out, and smells and looks like it has been in a damp basement. I would have rather spent the extra five dollars and gotten the new copy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfair expectations?","review":"Larry Bird was one of the greatest forwards to ever play the game. He was blessed w/great physical skills as well as an unbelievable work ethic. He shares his life story about his humble origins to his rise to worldwide celebrity. Unfortunately the book is poorly organized and poorly written. It's written in an overly simple manner and needed more personality. It reminded me of Larry's game, solid and fundamental but not overly flashy. I guess I was looking for a more entertaining book, and not a simple recounting of his life. The book could use more personal anecdotes and behind the scenes sharing. Overall, I was disappointed and wanted much more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story....Poorly told","review":"to any larry bird fan this is a very good book. if you play basketball it is ok. And if you are just an average reader who reads this book for whatever reason, then this book is Ok. The story without a doubt is inspirational to young basketball players, however the story is weakened by its lack in structure. bird constantly bouces from subject to subject in one paragraph. The book is definetly worth a look."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wear this to walk my dog on a dark street at night","review":"Works great for what I purchased it for. I wear this every night when I walk my dog on a fairly dark street.

Everyone is likeable.You can be sure someone will find a 'body' or 'body parts'at the beginning of each episode.The lead Jim Longworth is probably the kind of guy many of us would like to be and the kind of guy many women want. Part of his charm is wry wit and subtle sarcasm. What's not to like.Everyone in this series is somewhat vulnerable. Perhaps we sense that and for that reason we relate to this series. They do MINUTIA in a way that many of us can relate to....ie when his girlfriend tells Longworth's character about her day at the hospital and about a female Dr. that is giving her a rough time.This is not a gritty series and is suitable for most family viewing IMO.It has most of the elements of a decent series...drama...humour...romance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Mistake Making the Whiny Girlfriend a Co-Worker","review":"The whiny, self-righteous girlfriend is ok in small doses, but the ridiculousness of having Jim's boss tell him to stay away from her and then turning right around and hiring her as a 'forensic nurse' - really? I am midway through the second season and if the writers don't cut back on her intrusions and preachiness, I am done watching after this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Preachy; liberal slant.","review":"Season 1 was great and I couldn't wait for season 2. I'm about 3/4 through season 2 now and found it to be slanted and preachy. In particular, Ep 9: Iron Pipeline & Ep 10: Swamp Thing. Ep 9 - Oh noes guns are bad! Unless cops have them. Apparently if you are a liberal cop that hates civilians having guns, you get the freedom to assault a buff dude buying an AK in a sporting goods store. That's ok, it's probably just because he's some back country redneck, so all is forgiven. Which brings us to Ep 10. How many times did they snidely refer to \\"swamp rats\\"? Hey, those rednecks are dirty and live in the swamp shootin animals and not buying their meat at the store. GIT EM!PS - Please stop asking the question \\"why do {you/they} {need/want/have} [insert firearm]?\\" It is annoying and not a valid question."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Glades Season 2","review":"I love this series and can't wait for Season 3 to be available.

I have a good long game, but my short game is my weakness.

Well worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"90% Marketing 10% Substance","review":"The two disk package is not worth the money!!! There is very little substance as it relates to game improvement instructions. I was surprise at the lack of game improvement information on these two discs. Before buying the discs I read numerous reviews. Needless to say, I am more than disappointed in the product!The one good point is the fact Phil has a lot of personality and very likable. Unfortunately, that doesn't help my game any. With the hinge and hold technique you will get the ball in the air but controlling the distance and speed is the problem. I would only use the technique if I want to lay up out of very very deep rough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Golf Video I have seen","review":"This is a great instructional video of the short game. Phil's teaching style makes it easy to understand and interesting for the viewer. He goes over techniques that I once knew and have long since forgotten. Great refresher and explanation behind my successes and failures."},{"rating":"1","title":"Golfer Beware","review":"When I look at a two-disc set, I expect two discs full of instruction. Well, Disc 1 does present lots of tips for putting and chipping. But Disc 2, except for a brief segment on bunker play, is mainly an infomercial for the set, 2/3s of the disc devoted to great short game shots Phil hit during tournament play and some behind the scenes, self-promoting footage.Just be aware that you're really only getting one disc of instruction for your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hinge and hold works!!!","review":"After watching this video a few times and taking the included booklet to the range I can honestly say that I have lowered my scores by at least 5 strokes!!

The program consists of 2 sections, putting and chipping. The reason I bought the DVD was for the chipping. Basically, Phil shows how he chips without going into much detail about it. That's because he chips ONE WAY FROM EVERYWHERE. He explains that he had a chipping green in his back yard and grew up practicing all the time. That's it! Great for him, but didn't help me much. Better to get Dave Pelz short game instruction (if you want instruction). There are also some of Phil's trick shots, but I could have seen them on YouTube. Actually, I could have gotten all of the benefit of this DVD by seeing the clips on YouTube."},{"rating":"2","title":"Phil's DVD","review":"You will still need to know the basics of a good golf swing to gain from this video.The tips on chipping is worth the cost of the DVD.

However, after about two weeks of practicing about 20 - 30 min a day I was able to win not only my division in our club championship hcp tournament but also won the whole she-bang: club championship.

The DVD is well-organized, concise, and quite fun to watch. Phil and the producers hit a home run on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Short Game DVD","review":"I really enjoyed this DVD. The production is excellent and there are some great tips. For the length of the DVD there really wasn't a lot of different things covered.

If you can get past it you will find some great tips and techniques you can use forever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chipping and Sand - Very Good","review":"Solid advice on chipping and sand shots. Some good ideas on putting.Interesting section on flop shots, but this is not the central theme of the DVD.Phil can be hilarious when he gets opinionated, \\"Why would anyone want to do that?!?!\\"This DVD is worth the price, BUT it won't help unless you PRACTICE!

I find my self watching this DVD over and over through the golfing season."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dated but still a nice little book","review":"I have had this book for quite a long time noe; several pages are loose and a few are stained with the red color of Tandoori Masala Powder. I wouldn't recommend anybody to rush out and buy this book unless you have a pretty extensive collection and are looking for another book for comparing recipes from multiple sources. There are no pictures and not much textual material beyond the recipes. The recipes are quite good though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous night cream.","review":"I was originally recommended this product on a cruise 8 years ago. A little goes a long way with this cream. One tub will last you a long time, which helps justify the high cost. I typically use a \\"pea-sized\\" amount to get full coverage. The cream is lightweight, but it does leave a bit of a shine and has a tad of a greasy feel, so I would recommend you use this at night. I use this overnight and allow the cream to absorb into my skin. When I wake up the next morning my skin never looks more radiant. It smooths and evens the surface of my skin, and really diminishes fine lines. I feel this is a high quality product that is worth the money, and also a great opportunity to pamper yourself. I'm only 35, but it's never too early to start taking care of your skin!"},{"rating":"2","title":"love it and well worth the money.","review":"Some products are just worth the money. Good quality face cream is one of them. This face cream is amazing and worth every single dime. Will buy again."},{"rating":"1","title":"America The Horrible","review":"Seeing this documentary it leaves you wondering who were the bad guys in this war. It thoroughly trashes America. Ken Burns took great pains to paint the US as this awful, racist country. He doesn't explain the fears and mindsets of the time. The narrator goes on and on about how badly the blacks & Japanese Americans were treated, despite them serving. It is a constant theme in every episode. Ken Burns is definitely a hardcore, left wing propagandist."},{"rating":"1","title":"How Ken Burns WIPE OUT HISPANICS","review":"I cant believe that in 6 years of making this movie never once did Ken Burns run into any Hispanic names or even pictures of one?

The interviews are great, the pictures are unbeliveable, and the stories that the soldiers that were there grip you so much, it is if you were there yourself. Mr. Fussel got me to tears describing the death camps and how they really were on a crusade to save people as Eisenhowertold them on d-day. I just bought the book recently and can't wait to start it. Ken burns is awesome!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"War by Ken Burns","review":"Excellent presentation of a piece of social history combined with graphic scenes from combat that bring home the futility and horror of war.

He was thrilled, now he can watch it when ever he wants! Great for the war history!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent if somewhat laborious","review":"This is a comprehensive social history of the effect of the Second World War on America both at home and on the battlefield. It is by necessity US-centric but I presume this is its intention. The show is quite emotional and gives a good impression of the thoughts of the period. My only criticisms are: the repetition (maybe needed as episodes were shown with a time interval on television); some historic inaccuracies and myths (for example, the Germans never had any intention of invading America); and the irritating piano 'music' which worked in the 'Civil War' but is irritating in this programme. In fact, the sound track is all a bit overwhelming - I found myself getting distracted when it played over interviews (I would love a switch that would allow me to turn the music soundtrack off!) However, when everything is considered, it is quite an achievement in history based television."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great item and definitely worth while!!!!","review":"This documentary was an awesome watch and filled with lots of information. The title as well as the seller were very professional. Will definitely buy from this guy again if the opportunity ever arises again. I got my shipment well before the estimated arrival time. AMAZING EXPERIENCE!!!! Recommended to all buyers interested in war documentaries."},{"rating":"2","title":"For All Our Fathers","review":"I just finished watching the final episode of The War. My father, who served in Africa and Italy, as well as Korea, passed away January 19th of this year. I am so sorry he and my mother were not here to watch this extraordinary documentary. As much as I loved them both, I never knew what heroes they and all our parents were for their courage and bravery during the war years. Thank you, Ken Burns and team, for making sure their stories will never be lost."},{"rating":"2","title":"The War DVD Set","review":"Very educational and moving. I didn't know very much about WWII before I bought the set. It makes me want to learn more. We are very fortunate to have this film available to us before it is too late. I think the men and women who lost their lives during this war will be happy to know that we care and will never forget."},{"rating":"2","title":"The just war .","review":"Terrific job by Kenny and Lynn. This is a must have DVD, to be watched every two years or so, to remind one that war is, no doubt about, HELL !Many times during the series, I was shaking my head, as Alec Guiness at the end of the movie \\"The River Kwai\\", and repeating...madness, pure madness !Great series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mis-marketed: Should have been part of \\"The American Experience\\"","review":"I think most of the reviews here reflect that people came to this documentary with very different expecations. Many were expecting a thorough history of WW2, which is wasn't, and probably didn't intend to be. But Burns made things worse by being inconsistant himself as to what the documentary was about. I think the piece should have been heavily edited and shown as a part of \\"The American Experience.\\"My added complaint, though is that I think the material was presented with too much over-ripe emotional manipulation (ala Spielberg who never trusts the material--or his audience--or both!) The series didn't let me decide for myself that this material was powerful--I had to be hit over the head with a hammer to make sure I knew it was!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The War","review":"\\"The War\\" is what you would expect in quality and accuracy in a production by Ken Burns. Brutal, factual and a piece of history unknown to those who did not live through it. But something that every generation ought to see to help understand the status of the political world today, and the changes that 70 years have brought.Good movie of first class PBS quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ken Burns","review":"Great documentary by Mr. Burns.

I have nothing but respect for those this was about, as well as those who made this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic for many ages","review":"I bought this for my boyfriend (25 yrs old) who watched the documentary on PBS when it aired. He loves watching them over and over again because the war is very interesting to him. He brought them over to my parents house and my dad loves watching the DVD's as well because he lived through this. My dad is 63 yrs old. I think this DVD set is a great value and will be a great gift to people many ages."},{"rating":"2","title":"The education of a lifetime","review":"I have never had much interest in watching war stories, but I could not stop watching this depiction. It is so realistic and incredibly well done that it should be mandatory in all schools. My father was a marine in WWII at Iwo Jima. His mother said he was never the same after the war. It's clear why. Now I understand everything he ever said about it. It's a must see."},{"rating":"2","title":"WW II Through the Eye of Ken Burns","review":"Too young to fight, but old enough to join the legions of kids who planted Victory Gardens, bought saving stamps and war bonds, and became \\"Jr. Commandoes\\" collecting scrap metal for the war effort, this film history certainly resonated with me. Burns has mastered the art of drawing together the thoughts and impressions of those who fought and their families waiting anxiously back home for them. By focusing on four typical American towns, and threading throughout his masterpiece the vivid recollections of those who actually experienced the horrors of war, whether it be in prison camps or on the bloody beach heads, Burns has truly recorded a living history that should be required viewing for any American who aspires to become our Commander-In-Chief. It should give them pause before deciding that they should launch this nation into such bloody and costly conflict."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"AMERICAN RACISM DURING THE WAR\\"","review":"By changing the proportions of actual events, Burns rewrites history. Now, if he'd called his film \\"American Racism During the War\\" instead of \\"The War\\", he would at least be honest, and the film would be more credible as a history.The definitive documentary on World War II isThe World at War (30th Anniversary Edition)by Jeremy Isaacs. Being admittedly slightly Anglo-centric, the series is believable as a history.Just remember proportion. The War (not The American Racist War) was overwhelmingly centered around Germany's desire to conquer the Russians - 20 MILLIONS of whom were annihilated, not about a handful of mistreated American Negros."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Big \\"F\\" For Misleading Us Into Expecting A Comprehensive Effort.","review":"The hype from Burns and PBS lead us to expect a comprehensive effort worthy of the title. Instead, it is a weak documentary that quickly shifts from \\"The War\\" to a handful of bitter tales that are told with the sole goal of revealing bigotry in America."},{"rating":"1","title":"The War: Film by Ken Burns","review":"The first two segments, Disc One and Two were defective.How does one get to talk to a 'complaint department?'Poor merchandise for 70 plus dollars."},{"rating":"1","title":"The War begins without most of the world","review":"Two episodes into The War & I can find absolutely no cohesiveness in this film.Prereading about this series, I read that the producer's viewed over 1000+ hrs. of film. So far a lot of it is stock footage & readily familiar. My disappointment only increased when seeing a German unit at Stalingrad, exposed backwards, or the narrator trying to describe the invasion of Poland with scenes of murdered peasants. This short clip, these dead peasants, were filmed in the Ukraine in the summer of 1941, almost two years later.With these examples, there is a lot to be desired not only in content, but quality control.The producer's have mounted a inward-looking narrative, & so far are succeeding. K. Burns & co. like mirrors, & because of this lose any hope of capturing the true reality, the real scope of something so enormous as WWII.Ken Burns has made premium Americana, but now he's decided to try & go international; I'm afraid The War just won't cut it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inaccurate account of WWII","review":"Too much narrative about what was wrong with the U.S. during the war vs. stressing the sense of duty and dedication to seeing victory. The book focused on issues such as Japanese detainment camps, woes of the blacks during the War, etc. Very little was mentioned about how the U.S. as a whole pull together to ensure victory. Instead of feeling uplifted by the monumental feat of pulling to country together to win the war, I walked away feeling depressed. Ken Burns once again wrote and directed with a leftist vs. American slant. All part of why this country is heading in the wrong direction."},{"rating":"1","title":"America Won WW2","review":"I have no argument with this being an Americacentric series-even if they did come in, as usual, 2 years late but why does it neglect or underplay the allies role? American victories are portrayed as such but non american victories (yes,there were some) are depicted as allied victories. The link up between Russian and other allied forces were described as 'American and Russian' yet clearly there was a British (soldier holding Union Jack)contingent.Where were the Australians mentioned or given adequate credit-they did after all stop the Japanese in New Guinea. For a series titled \\"The War\\" it should be more inclusive-after all the war started in September 1939 not December 1941."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hulk Hair","review":"I've caught a few minutes of each episode so far. Funny how people are writing reviews for the DVD that hasn't been released yet, and base their opinions on aired TV material, not the box set that will be released in a couple weeks.From what I've seen so far it's damn good. And I'm sure, like most other people, I've seen a lot of WWII stuff already. But I just can't get the image of Ken Burns out of my head now. The guy looks like the Incredible Hulk with that wig on his head. Sure, the guy can make a great documentary, but he should have bought a better rug than that. Take a look at Ron Howard. At least he wears a hat."},{"rating":"1","title":"In A Word...TEDIOUS","review":"The war footage and comments by the survivors are riveting, but there's way too much (repetitive) filler in every episode. I have yet to make it thru a 2 hour segment without dozing off. I had to resort to taping the episodes and fast-forwarding thru the \\"homefront\\" portions. Glad I decided to watch a few episodes before buying.

My high expectations for this set were surpassed by leaps and bounds. As the son of a WWII veteran and a baby boomer, I closely identify with this war. This piece taught me many things I didn't know about the war and the reality of the situation my father (Normandy Beach) and uncle (Battle of the Bulge) experienced. As an educator, I deeply appreciate history and Ken Burns showed me the impact this war had overseas and at home. This is a must for all Americans and Western Europeans. It will make them truly appreciate what we have today. Each episode delivers an understanding of WWII that can't ever come close to those who were there, but takes you as close as you can get."},{"rating":"2","title":"WWWII DVD/The War\`","review":"This item was purchased for my husband for Christmas 2008 who loves WWWII video and reading. He had seen it advertised in a magazine and had torn out the sheet and I'm sure knowing I would follow through. It was advertised new for $70 +. I went to Amazon.com and found it new for about half the price. He tends to love WWWII Japanese. I am assuming since he was interested it will have plenty on that subject for WWWII. I would not have a preview on this as far as content until after Christmas and his viewing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Up front and back home view.","review":"As with other films of Ken Burns this one brougth one up close view of the front lines and the home front.I pride myself in the fact I try to stay up on history,and WW2 in general so much is still owed to those folks and always will be.I always bring away from each thing I see on the war something I did not know as I was born in 1940 I do remember things that happened durning those years.I know in school today not that much time is spent on just one subject but,this film should be a part of every history department so those who want to see it can.I am proud of being a vet and also that Ken picked N.H. to live in as we are about 15 miles apart.You can throw a sixth star on this one.Jim Ciampa"},{"rating":"2","title":"The War","review":"I watched bits and pieces on PBS and felt I had to have the full story to pass on to my family.

Actual photos and films of the time and events display the effects at home and abroad of this hugh world undertaking. The music is memorizing and emotional that blend with every scene that you'll never forget.

Well done to Ken Burns and Lynn Novick for a very well done documentary."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far it's amazing","review":"I have found it to be brutally honest, both in reinforcing the good parts of our national mythology about The War and in reshaping it in something more durable and useful for the future.

A single violin, or that's what it sounds like,screeching away, is extremely inappropriate to what might've been a great work. I cannot understand how Ken Burns could have sunk this low, after turning in a masterpiece like his The Civil War. What could he have been thinking? Not only is the music dreadful, but it's distractingly loud and there's no way to turn it down without losing the narration as well. This is a terrific disappointment. Shame on you Ken."},{"rating":"1","title":"The War - A Film By Ken Burns and Lynn Novick","review":"Buyer beware. As the saying goes, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. The packaging was the first clue as the glued areas seemed incomplete or coming apart a little. But the real telltale was the disc markings or lack therof. Zero hub marking (barcode, etc) and a little bluring of the white on black fine print on the disc cover. In my opinion this was an obvious knockoff.

That person told me there had been a delay, and if I did not receive what I ordered in three days to request an Amazon refund (I paid by PayPal). Again, it did not arrive, so I requested a refund through the Amazon A-Z guarantee. This caused me considerable inconvenience because I needed \\"The War by Ken Burns\\" to teach a class.

Referring (only) to this first hour of film, if I had wanted to look at a few black and white photographs, I would have gone to the kind of thrift shop that carries old photos and asked for five or ten of them.Also, the narration is annoying and inexplicable. Must all words be of one syllable and spoken so slowly?

I spent too much time watching this but learned so much.The stories, history and visuals were well put together. For those who have a limited knowledge of World War II I feel that this is a great introduction. The facts and dates, battles and stories are integrated in such a way that they make a vivid impression of just what took place.I have an increased level of respect for the veterans who had to take part in the war... even as someone who, for religious reasons, doesn't think that war is the answer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ken Burns - The War","review":"The War is a fascinating study and an important piece. In today's world, with so few youngsters really knowing what happened during World War II and the effects it continues to have on our modern world. I would recommend this film as required viewing to youngsters as early as 6th grade.The film follows the events of famous as well as ordinary Americans from four parts of the United States and how this war impacted the lives of the men and women who fought it both in Europe and the Pacific as well as the home front. This film ranks up with the well known BBC series World at War and is just as well made and as important.Knowledge of this film should be required viewing in every middle school and high school curriculum in the United States. This film is much too important not to miss!"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"The American Perspective of WWII\\"","review":"I wish I had read these reviews more carefully, as the information is here. If you're already familiar with the detailed history of WWII then this would make a nice addition to your perspective. But most of the narrative is either \\"at home\\" in America during the war, or endless interviews and letters of the people involved. Some of it is quite good, but much of it is boring. I know the general historical arc of the war already, and that's about all you get from this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grossly skewed view of WW2","review":"This WW2 commentary from the most liberal point of view that I have ever seen. It was more apologetic than it was informative. The point of view was, so many people died in WW2... we should have just laid down and negotiated with the aggressors to gain piece. This is a horrible depiction of what actually happened. How dare these pricks depict the US this way (i.e. rounding up the people in the US that could have had an impact to the outcome of the war). The commentary was just as harsh on how the US reacted to the war then the atrocities that were committed by the Axis. Thank God the makers of this move were not in power during this time... because if they were, we would all be speaking German and/or Japanese right now (assuming they did not wipe out your grandparents... killing you).

The film is suppose to be about the war,yet over and over again we hear How bad the United States was.We hear about How Vicious war is(this is a Anti-War film it seems), Everyone with half a brain knows WAR is hell. It paints Generals and the military as incompetent and uses the same interviews from the same people from four different towns,especially some whiner lilly fruitcakes naggin' on and on.For a Younger Generation such as myself it is more of the same garbage being thrown at us from those on the left who want to indoctrinate much like the Nazi's and Communists."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding!","review":"Great DVD set that every family and history schoolroom should own.

There have been some excellent accounts of WWII, my favorite \\"The World at War\\" (circa. 1973), which I didn't think could be equaled in terms of the personal accounts of those who were there. We're so lucky to have those who survived so much tell their story here in \\"The War\\", and I get the sense that the survivors feel fortunate to tell it. My thoughts throughout the series were with my parents; a most difficult time. I've come away with more of an appreciation of the socio-cultural changes that WWII would be a precursor.It's impossible to tell the whole story, but to cover the whole story within a smaller story is what impressed me most, and covering them with such personal insights from those who experienced it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ken does it again","review":"Ken Burns invented the format with the Civil War, and has done it again with WWII.

Some stories are funny, some are sad i got sad when the ones they were telling about died. The combat part is interesting,the social part is told a little differently at times, its great how Japanese Americans from internment camps become great soldiers for America. The growth of Mobile is intresting how quickly it declines after the war is understandable. The combat part is enough to satisfy with out over doing it.

I tried watching a few episodes, but couldn't avoid falling asleep. Ken Burns should not have titled this film \\"The War\\" I think \\"The Homefront\\" would have more accurately reflected this film's contents. Others have recommended the BBC series World at War for scope and accuracy, so I will probably get that instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"A grade school account of WWII","review":"After viewing the first 4 episodes, I'm very disappointed. There's no mention of the Hitler-Stalin Pact and that the Soviet Union invaded and occupied eastern Poland only weeks after Germany invaded western Poland. No mention of the Soviet invasion of Finland, Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia in the late 30s. There's no mention of the other Axis countries such as Romania. The war was much more complicated than most Americans realize and this film will not help educate the viewers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ken Burns loses his way...","review":"Ken Burns is an extremely talented filmmaker. But with, The War, he has lost his way as an objective documentarian, exposing his political point of view in this most sensitive and important subject. I stopped watching this film within Disk 1 when he allowed an interviewee from Minnesota to state that the young men who joined the service did so for every other reason than patriotism. \\"It had absolutely nothing to do with patriotism.\\" This is both blatantly false as well as an insult to the hundreds of thousands of WWII veterans. To allow this template to be placed upon the motivations of our American servicemen at the outset of the film was all I could take. I don't need to see any more of a film like this and will prefer to spend my WWII doc time watching unvarnished documentation of the war with the far more comprehensive, unbiased and educationally important serires, The World at War by the BBC."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating look at WWII","review":"Ken Burns has done it again with his absolutely stunning documentary on WWII. To see this war throught the eyes of some of the combatants is well worth the length of this series. Done in chronological order it makes the war more understandable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent and Moving Documentary","review":"Ken Burns and Lynn Novick have excelled with \\"The War\\". I've seen many of Ken's films and this one rates high above the rest . This documentary is exceptional. My father-in-law is a World War II veteran serving in the Navy during the Japanese island invasions aboard a destroyer. So when we watch the series, it's like a personal narrative along with those in the film. If World History is an interest or even just a curiosity for America's past conflicts, then \\"The War\\" is a must see."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"My husband is really into WWII and he absolutely loved this documentary (among his Band of Brothers and Saving Private Ryan).

Dad was a supply sergeant who did his job well and came home safely.Ken Burns, the pre-eminent documentary filmmaker of our time, has created another masterpiece with \\"The War.\\" I have watched each episode so far and am extremely impressed. It's not the most comprehensive story of WWII, but from a human standpoint insofar as relating the stories of common Americans (who performed uncommon feats every day), it's superb.I'm sorely amazed at the bashing Ken Burns has taken here. You people who criticize him haven't even seen the entire series yet and you're tearing it and Ken, to pieces. Frankly, I think you're a bunch of idiots.I've spent years studying WWII, talking with veterans and their familes, watching films and reading books. Burns' \\"The War\\" is first-rate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flooded with data","review":"This book is great if you are preparing for a history quiz. I'm glad I bought it, but only because I also have access to google. The writer touches on various events without discussing them in sufficient detail. The book is organized by geographical elements, which is novel. But it fails to dwell.

I understand that this is supposed to be a satirical look at American gender roles, but it was probably a lot more applicable back in 1970s. I am a feminist and this book didn't tell me anything I didn't already know. Maybe if you're a raging chauvinist, this book has something to teach you. To me, Brantenberg's prose seems trite. The writing is simplistic. The sex scenes are graphic, but moreover, so are the non-sex scenes. I felt as though the author was secretly smiling to herself and saying, \\"I'm so clever\\" while she wrote it. It's hard to define what makes for a great book, but here's something I can define: this book is not great. Or good.

It seemed good and might be, however the supporting documentation was horrible, the tool did not exist on Freud's (dissapointing) web site and no specs were available. They did supply a CD with the tool, but it didn't work and several requst to Freud for another went unanswered. Without this information I question Freud's commitment to the tool and worried about future parts and service.

Despite only occassional use the RPMs vary wildly with loading and it seems to have lost some significant power. I am sending it to Freud for repair. Although changing cutters from above the table is nice, all the raising and lowering of the motor is done from beneath the table. I have found it easier to adjust the precise cutter height by reaching under the table as the adjusting hole plugs with sawdust almost immediately. In addition, the height adjustment is very crudely executed with tremendous play between the base and the motor which shifts when the crude locking lever is engaged. These combine to undermine any pretense at precision. For a company that makes such precise blades and cutters I had expected a much higher standard of execution."},{"rating":"1","title":"Attractive features, but poorly built","review":"I purchased this router a year ago for permanent installation into a router table. I was attracted by the height adjustment and spindle lock from above the table, and thought I could save money over an expensive router lift. However, from the start, I noticed a lot of backlash in the height adjustment. Also, the spindle would shift from side to side if the height adjustment direction was reversed. I decided to live with it. Then, the height adjustment socket in the base (made from plastic) stripped, forcing me to reach under the table to change the height. Recently, the spindle lock stopped working. Today, the motor died. I'll stick with Freud blades and bits, but avoid buying anything from them that plugs in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointed","review":"I bought this router based on what I had heard about this product line.

Perhaps these attitudes were more prevalent when this book was written. I was born in 1965 and I was held almost all the time as a baby. While I appreciated the hold your baby message as well as other, I truly did not like all the conclusions that were drawn from the author's observations. In most cases she offered no supporting evidence other than her observations and I found myself thinking of numerous other causes/effects for the behaviors she described.

I am much more conscious now of decisions I make everyday that affect my family and people I come in contact with.It is not an easy read (not terribly difficult either) but it's worth every minute you spend on it.Highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good, should be read by parents new and old","review":"This book is thoughtful and exciting. Will most likleychange your whole outlook on child growth and life itself.Seems to contain minor contradictions but its main messagecomes through strongly.If you ever plan to raise a child, or have ever been one,read this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful!","review":"Wear your baby close to your heart so they feel secure. Sleep with your baby so they're by your side and not alone. They know not where they are, what is happening, and all they know is you, your smell, your safe arms. Such a beautiful piece of work. Read, listen, enlighten."},{"rating":"2","title":"What you don't know CAN hurt you!","review":"I so appreciate Ms. Liedloff's book....I only wish I had read it sooner. Her style is poetic and yet scholarly. I was thrilled that she gave voice to those of us who knew \\"continuum\\" or \\"attachment\\" parenting was right but felt like we were alone in the world (and sometimes in our own home!) I was also left with hope that it's never too late.... Despite the fact that I've only partly continuum parented due to external, intellectualized objections I rejoice that I'm learning (from my children) and now have global/ethnographic support for doing so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reality check: she hasn't got kids!","review":"Hello! This women hasn't got any kids! Don't take parenting advice from people who don't have kids! Seems elementary, but OMG -- when my kids were born back in the early '90s, I knew parents who were trying to do this. Their kids were like little bats attached to the mother's chest 24/7. One thing it might be useful to point out is that in cultures where this is still practiced, the men hold all the power. The women are basically farm animals, and their children are the product -- belonging to the farmer. If you want any power of your own, Girlfriends, you have to put down the kid now and again. Meantime, why are you taking parenting advice from a single woman? You think if you do what she says, you're going to have a nice life like her?"},{"rating":"1","title":"author should try it on her childern,...","review":"but wait ! she has none...If you think this book helped you, good for you.Like most baby books, it may or may not apply to 15% of the population, in my opinion it would apply to much a lower number.And like in any advice book, don't take it too seriously, see if it works for you and your baby, don't go religious with it.Every suggestion in this book is drawn from the life of a primitive tribe, and unless you live in similar environment, this is where the fantasy ends end reality breaks in.Carrying your child on you all the time can result in an over clingy child.Letting a child go his marry way around knives (just like the tribe-folk do) will more likely to result in a catastrophe than anything else.take that book with a grain of salt, it sounds good in theory and might work in a jungle."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst book for parents!","review":"I was excited to get this book. However, I hadn't read far when I realized this book had more about evolution than anything else. It had little about the indian tribes who were of more interest regarding parenting. I was offended as a Christian with the constant referal to evolution. This book insults we American parents quite a bit also. The main theme is how we should continually (24/7) hold our babies. That's impossible. We can hold our babies quite a bit of the time, but how about driving a car, bathing, etc... This puts an unnecessary burden on wonderful parents who are doing their best, not to mention a backache. Save yourself time and money and leave this book alone. I threw mine away! Let the Lord guide your steps."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must read for parents to be","review":"I think this is THE single most fabulously informative book I have ever read. It shows how to live life and let everyone BE who they are. How to trust your child with their own well being and how to allow them, and everyone, to know what is best for THEM.As I read the book I began to underscore certain parts until I realised I was underscoring pretty much the whole book.Go read it and see for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved It.","review":"I read this book in two days. I couldn't put it down. There were parts that I thought were a \\"bit much\\" and some generalizations were made that I wasn't convinced about. However, the point she is trying to make was loud and clear. I have recommended this book to many already, and should I be graced with another child, I will definitely raise him/her with a new perspective, and my children now are getting a better quality parenting because of this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"An emeser oytser","review":"Henry Sapoznik's notes alone are worth the price of this collection, so the extraordinary sound quality (for recordings from this era) makes it nothing less than a metsie fun a ganef!

I really don't mind Yakima making their money on the big ticket items such as towers, boxes, etc. but the little adapter items should be priced more fairly. It seems to me that once you are locked into a Yakima system they fully intend to hose you on the little things. Too bad.

Ellie marries the earl and his jealous cousin is mystically present at every disaster that follows her around damaging her new home as she insists she did not do it. He does not believe her and thinks our intelligent lady to be remarkably inept. This is interspersed with their constant bickering and topped off with too many grammatical errors in need of editing. I loved the Bridgerton series but this book is not a winner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Utterly Charming","review":"Even better than \\"Everything and the Moon\\". While Robert and Victoria were starcrossed lovers, Charles and Ellie seem to be on a \\"collision course\\" with destiny. I loved Charles and the \\"lists\\". The calculated mishaps the murder plot made it much more interesting. Both Charles and Ellie are strong characters. I was really impressed with Danelle Harmons review as she is one of my favorite romance authors. I wholeheartedly agree with her assessment of this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Witty humorous & differentI","review":"I really enjoyed this book. The characters were amusing and it played in just right with the story line. I thought it funny when a rectors daughter married a rake. Ellie was very witty and humurous especailly the parts abourt her future step mom and ofourse the \\"wet Rat\\" look and tackling the Lord. LOL Read the book and you'll know what I mean. I've read all but 4 of Julia Quinn's book, and she has yet to dissappoint me. But then again I could be bias."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome.....","review":"This book was one of the funniest I have ever read! I enjoyed it from the start. It was so awesome to read a book that was refreshing and funny throughout. There were moments of seriousness, but somehow I ended up laughing because of something that Charles and Ellie would do or say. Definitely a great book if you are looking for something that is not serious or dreary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"The heroine was probably written as a smart, independent but spirited young lady. Instead, she comes off as a shrew who constantly bickers with the hero. I just didn't see what his attraction would be to her. And likewise, he came off as just wanting to jump in the sack instead of taking his time to get to know his new bride. I usually live Julia Quinn books, but there was just way too much bickering in this book for me! Avoid at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn","review":"I've read all of Quinn's books and I usually like them enough to give them a 4 to 5 rating, but this one is just plain boring.Although the idea seemed decent(the main characters marry before they really know each other), it was just poorly executed. Charles and Ellie get married within first 50 pages of the book and the rest 330 pages or so is just constant fighting. In the last couple of pages they do 'realize' that they actually love each other and they live happily ever after.I know that Quinn's trademark is humor, but it seemed that it was just overly done in this book. There is no real romance,no real character exploration, no real plot, no building up etc., just (cheap) laughs and some sex."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I must say, as someone who has always enjoyed Julia Quinn's writing, this one came across wrong from the very start. The characters are not believable, let alone likable, the plot overused, and frankly, a \\"hero\\" who is drunk off his feet the entire first chapter was more than enough to turn me off the entire thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Feel Good Book","review":"I loved this book. The main characters Ellie and Charles were made for eachother. I love the fact that Ms. Quinn allowed her heroine have such a strong backbone. I hate books that make the heroine too reliable on their men. The couple were always supportive of eachother. The lists that they put together were very funny. I found myself laughing out loud a few times. This was a book that I couldn't put down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing and Annoying","review":"This is Regency romance at its worst. The characters are unappealing and unrealistic. Can you imagine a lady, especially a vicar's daughter,chattering to a stranger familiarly,cutting off his boot from his injured foot and letting him lean on her shoulder to limp back to his carriage?I was particularly upset by the scene in which the heroine walked in heavy rain by herself to the Earl's home. She turned me off by not only looking bedraggled and dishevelled, but by seeking out a bachelor in his home to discuss their marriage.She even changed into his married sister's clothes. No lady of good upbringing in polite society at that time would ever stoop herself or be brazen enough to compromise herself in this way. The whole story sounds unconvincing because there is no chemistry between the Earl and the lady.I got some very enjoyable books based on readers' reviews but I didn't get it right this time. Bad luck for me"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute","review":"I was looking for a mindless way to spend a rainy day and I was given this book. I got through it in one day and had trouble putting it down. It certainly isn't a masterpiece, but the two main characters were quite cute and I liked the fact that they were friends throughout the book without your typical huge misunderstanding. All in all it was a nice way to spend the day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Liking it","review":"As I said in my review of Everthing And The Moon, I did not like this story as much as Victoria's story. While Everything And The Moon fought against social norms and stereotypes, this story did the total opposite and instead made it seem like norms and hierarchical structures where indifferent. In addition, I think the emotional development wasn't as strongly created as Victoria's story - of course it wouldn't be as this is more focused on convenience rather than a struggles against all odds for true love."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Monty-Python Argument....","review":"The two main characters, Ellie and Charles, argue and bicker with all the maturity and absurdity one would expect of 12-year olds. Occasional wit made some of the dialog fun, but overall, it was an eye-roll. The book was pathetically short on plot. And what little it had encompassed the cliche elements of \\"someone\\" trying to create accidents designed to kill the Earl. Charles is forced to marry Ellie, a complete stranger, to save his inheritance per his father's will. And, oh my, how coincidental that Ellie has a soon-to-be stepmother who is forcing her out of her father's home and into marriage with anyone who will have her. I do enjoy some of Julia Quinn's books, but this one was not at all credible and was a waste of time to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clumsy","review":"I have enjoyed several other novels by Ms. Quinn but couldn't force myself to get past the first 200 pages of this one. I thought the beginning was interesting, but the vast majority of the book so far has involved the protagonists arguing with each other or falling down. A lot. Clumsy characters and clumsy writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Best I've Read","review":"I was looking forward to this book based upon the first book I read \\"How to Marry a Marquis\\" from Ms. Quinn. This book fell very flat in terms of plot - no intrigue, no chase, and no thrill. However, I am still willing to consider reading other books since I thought her dialogue was well written and clever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too simplistic for me","review":"By the end of the first half of the book - I was ready for the ending. I didn't feel any chemistry between the two characters. I have read and enjoyed the books of Ms. Quinn', esp. The Duke and I, but this one was not up to snuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charming book","review":"Eleanor Lyndon is minding her own business when Charles Wycombe, the Earl of Bilington falls out of a tree very drunk.

But dark forces that could end it for them.\\"Brighter than the Sun\\" is the first book that I read by Julia Quinn and I really liked it. Ms. Quinn gives her readers charming characters and romance. This was the first book by Ms. Quinn, but it will not be the last."},{"rating":"1","title":"A real disappointment","review":"I have read all of the Bridgerton series, and a few others (such as To Marry a Marquis), and LOVED all of them. This one I found extremely disappointing. No chemistry - at least on her part - and as others have said, it is just not realistic in terms of behaviour in the period. I never would have pegged this as a Julia Quinn book. I guess I would recommend buying it based on the many reviews that are far more positive than mine (and about 3 or so others who felt the same way!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Programming Book I've Seen","review":"This is probable one of the most incoherent books on programming that I've seen in a while. I am an experienced C++ and Java developer, but I have never used Visual C++ before. When I buy a book I expect both a coherent explanation of examples, and when buying a book this size and cost, also a thorough, understandable reference section. This book provided neither of these.The examples were incoherent, there was very little continuity, it jumped around. Also, there was no easy way to find out about certain functions or tasks. I highly recommend you don't buy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A moving account of the life of St. Luke","review":"This is an account of the life of Lucanus the physician, better known as St. Luke. Ms. Caldwell has an uncanny ability to make the character so real he almost leaps off the page; his struggles regarding his personal beliefs/disbeliefs in God may very well mirror your own. An excellent book for anyone interested in learning about the life of this particular saint"},{"rating":"2","title":"This Book Rocks My Socks!!","review":"This book is REALLY awesome. I like how Taylor makes St. Luke ( Lucanus) like a real person instead of some holy guy that you can't relate yourself to. It's full of Israelites, Romans, and Lucanus' quest to find who he is and what God calls him to do. It's truely hard to put down and is a beautiful story. I'm 13 and I reccomend this book to kids my age and up. If you want a really good book to read... this book is for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dear and Glorious Physician","review":"It is a classical for me. I have read it several times, and continue to be amazed at the exact description of historic details of places and people.

It is literary jewel for which I always have an special place on my library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Mystical","review":"I found this book too farfetched, some description too graphic, and too much emphasis on the mystical and too \\"wordy\\".

I think what I enjoyed the most about them was that the authors' skills placed a human into the skeletal narrative of the bible's description of these people.The narrative, while entirely fiction, does a good job of describing the plausible experiences of a bible writer's life.As Luke was author of the gospel of Luke, and the book of Acts of the Apostles, and his academic experience was that of a medical doctor, he was aptly suited to live such a life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dear and Glorious Physician by Taylor Caldwell","review":"This is a page turner and I will say that I could not put it down.

I forced myself to finish the book and when I did, I was disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MOVING AND MULTI-FACETED TREASURE FOR THE SPIRIT","review":"Reading Dear and Glorious Physician moved me and has re-kindled my own passion for my faith in Christ-God. As a literary piece, I find it to be full-bodied, rich in texture and brings to life the life and times of St. Luke. Caldwell successfully stimulates the senses as she brings to the fore the smells and scents, the sights and sores, the music and chaos in those times. Burrowed in the pages, I am always transported! What else can I say? Oh Yes, I read up to the Acts of the Apostles, as she intimated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Caldwell's Dear and Glorious Physician","review":"An absolutely delicious read.

You can do a light spray for daily wear or a heavier spray for a date. Girls will recognize the scent, but never guess what it is because it mixes so well with your own body scent.

At home it is a great light to illuminate tight spaces. I also like leaving it beside my bed in case I have a need for a little light but want to avoid brighter lights that might disturb my wife.This is not the kind of light you will use for extended periods of time. You use it for a moment or two at a time. Because of that, the batteries will last for quite a while.

Wouldn't recommend unless you are looking at very similar pocket penlights say for medical field. And I actually like some of the plastic body models years ago that did not emmit that blue light but a warmer yellow....yes I know it's the type of bulb that makes a difference and these bulbs last a lot longer.

That makes it particularly galling when, two years later, the flapper quits. I have never found a flapper replacement that will work, including a Fluidmaster replacement. In some cases, it could be the tank gasket is giving out, but that doesn't matter much. If you have to take the tank off you might as well rebuild the toilet. Obviously unacceptable.

This included taking the old parts out, removing the tank, cleaning everything, replacing the fill valve and flapper assembly, replacing the tank, installing the handle, and adjusting the flush settings. The only special tool required was a saw to cut the overflow pipe shorter. All of the repair kit parts fit and operate correctly.The product shipped with instructions for a different product model number.

After testing the water leak again, I found out that it was STILL leaking through the red gasket. I got so frustrated that I decided to research it online. It turns out most of the reviews online explain the same problem.No matter how tight you make everything, water leaks through the red gasket. Not just around it... through it.

I am very handy at fixing things around the house and I enjoy repairing things not just for me but for the neighbors as well.The Fluidmaster would not stop running. It would turn on every 10 to 20 minutes and run for a few seconds. It was in our bedroom so I would hear it wasting water. I purged it several times per their instructions and it just kept running. I purged it and adjusted it again and again and nothing change. It kept turning on for no reason every now and then. I finally got mad and bought a new one but made by Korky.

I couldn't wait to get the book and sit down to devour it. When I got it and looked at all the subtitles - I thought I was in for a hilarious read. I was very disappointed. Don't get me wrong, there are a few laughs. Often, however the author goes a bit too far and the satire comes off as being mean and cruel, not at all funny. I thought he had a great outline for the book, but didn't know what to do then.

Backlight, alarm, world time, stopwatch, and, of course, the atomic time keeping are some of the features found on this watch. One little inconvenience that is worth mentioning: you will probably have to take this watch to a jewelry/watch store to make it fit. While I paid $30 for this watch, I also paid additional $7.50 at a jewelry store to make it fit.

I had so many left over parts and pieces for alternate applications that I could almost have built another unit. The speaker mounting options seems to have been well thought out. My only complaint would be that because there are so many mounting options, I had to think my installation through."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Mounts for the Price","review":"Overall, these mounts are quite good. They mount very easily and tightly to the wall and can be snugged down just right, holding the speakers in place. They obviously aren't going to be as 'firm' as metal mounts or as attractive, but for the price I'm not sure you could find much better.A couple of things that keep them from being 5 stars in my opinion:- Depending on how they are angled, it can be difficult to access the hex to tighten them down. It looks like the hex could easily be stripped. I didn't do this, but be careful so you don't.- If you move your speakers a lot, the plastic could wear down as the hex screws are pinched on the plastic. Any movement could slowly wear away the material; however if you plan to position them and not move them, this is a non-issue.I would definitely recommend these if you are looking for nice mounts that don't cost as much as your speakers. For most people's common speaker use, these be just perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"They worked perfectly and were very easy to install.

The 5th edition has 80 more pages and Three chapters (the first three)that are not included here. Furthermore, most of the statistics are from the 80's or early 90's. Still a good read.

If you want to be great in the Kingdom you must first be a servant. The Bible emphasizes servanthood leadership not the otherway around.

You can see how she uses her whole body to change from the loving Odette (in white) to the cruel Odile (in black). One reservation: I wouldn't use this book to introduce children to the ballet. The bold theatrical makeup, designed to be visible from the audience, is almost overwhelming in the closeup photos. For a child, Rachel Isadora's illustrations are a better introduction to the story. Still, Ellison's book is a \\"must-buy\\" for balletomanes and Nina fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Supreme Portraits On a Budget","review":"Nina Ananiashvili, in addition to having world-class ballerina skills, is a treat for the eyes ... she is beautiful.

However, I didn't care for the variations introduced wherein Rotbart is unharmed, and the swans can transform near the gardens by the lake, even by day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been better","review":"A mediocre treatment of a terrific subject. The capsule summaries have to be short, (or they wouldn't be capsules) but too often they fall flat, barely catching the essence of the film.

The illustrations are sparse, and aren't even from the cartoons themselves, but from advertisements for the films.It really pains me to be critical of the work, but there is enormous room for improvement.

On a scale of 1 to 10 with 1 being Novice and 10 being Expert, I would say a solid 5.

Save your money and watch the bloody thing on Cartoon Network. If you still aren't satisfied, just pick up the movie trilogy. The dub is much more prepared in the movie version and the voice acting is more realistic, not the tweaked out voices you hear on TV. The English version of Mobile Suit Gundam was completely rushed. I'm giving it an extra star because all of the footage that is not in the movies is incredible.

The characters were a bit cliche and the ending was pretty cheesy. But that's the point, eh? Miss Lange was cute and managed the distressed horror-film-female role, but I also liked that she had a tough personality. Instead of running and screaming (then falling and looking back like they always do), she faced her fears- throughout the movie.

Brad Rowe ( so good in Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss) is miscast and a complete bore as the house handy man...and Allison Lange tries so hard to be Julia Stiles( looks alot like her as well) that she comes across as a bad wannabe.

What girl is stupid enough to take her diary with her to high school and, worse yet, leave it laying around for her enemies to read? If this is the case, not only does Christina deserve what she and her family gets, but the viewer also deserves what they get for sitting all the way through this excruciatingly painful mess. I also knew who was behind all the mayhem surrounding the property from the first time the camera landed on their face--very transparent, like everything else in this badly scripted, horribly acted waste of time.

Honestly I expected it to be terrible, as good cheese is hard to find, but really it wasn't too bad at all. The movie starts with a murder in the old house so I wasn't under the impression that it was haunted but that someone, or perhaps something, is living behind the walls. You don't know who it is or why they're doing what they're doing, but the list of supects is long and twisted: the horney/violently jealous boyfriend, the apparently incestuously minded/hothead father, the weird/weird handyman, the angry/weird sheriff, or just some Jason Voorhees type. The daughter just thinks she's going crazy. The movie deftly implicates all of these while at the same time deflecting it. The acting while not great is definately on the upper level of the B-eschelon. The story is well told and has some interesting, quirky elements.

Her characters either meet or interact in quirky or interesting circumstances and there are moments where they say things that are laugh out loud funny! I like how Caroline and Blake meet, the secondary characters James, Penelope, and Perriwick are delightful, and overall, the plot of the story leads to a satisfying conclusion. I'll continue to read all of Ms. Quinn's novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, Ms. Quinn","review":"This is the third book I have read by Julia Quinn. The first was the Duke and I (I loved it!) the second was An Offer from A Gentleman (Equally loved it!)- the third, To Catch an Heiress -- I haven't even finished it. I just can't get thru it. Caroline seems more like an 11 year old girl and Blake at times seems younger than that. I enjoy the romances where the hero and heroine spar off of each other - it keeps me interested, but this was just pure ridiculous. I haven't yet looked up the copyright to see if this was her very first book ever, but I do know that this is not going to sit up on my keeper shelf with the other two of her books I have read. I hope this is the only bad apple in her list of books, because I just bought all of them based on what I enjoyed with the Duke and I and Offer from a Gentleman. This is a library or book exchange book only - do not waste your money. Sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT ONE OF HER BEST","review":"I generally enjoy Quinn's works, but I found that I did not like the main characters in the book. He had way too much emotional baggage. It seemed like he was brooding about his dead fiancee constantly throughout the book. The story line was dull and the characters never did seem to hit it off. I prefer reading about characters with less psychological problems. However, I did enjoy the subsequent book - How to Marry A Marquis."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"This was my first julia quinn book, and, well.. lets just say it may be my last...

Perhaps, I should say \\"started\\". The conversations between the main characters were asinine and I lost interest with only one-third of the book read. If you are looking for a strong-willed, and intelligent heroine, as well as humor, I suggest you read \\"Hearts Aflame\\" by Johanna Lindsey."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT A TERRIBLE BOOK BUT....","review":"Not a terrible book, but not one of her best.

I hate to see a triangle with a heroine in love with a hero who is in love with a dead woman. It just kills any sort of romance in the relationship department. I have read all of Quinn's books and I must say this was the only book I truly disliked. I only read about halfway through the book and could not continue. The plot was dreadful and I didn't like to see the poor heroine suffering as she is trying to win the affections of a man who is still suffering over his lost love. Pass on this book, but buy any of her other books. My all time favorite is \\"Everything and the Moon.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully fun to read.","review":"I absolutely loved this book.

Individuals can only learn.I am always concerned when someone misuses a metaphor, particularly when it figures prominently in their work. If they can't get THAT right, what else have they gotten wrong?The ideas in the book seem tired to me as well, but I would like to leave you with the above thought as an example of critical evaluation of a books \\"cover\\" or title. It is a particularly useful skill for readers who are considering investing time and money on a book before there are reviews."},{"rating":"2","title":"Purchase And Devour","review":"After reading Rosabeth's book, I took one immediate step.

Her chapter, \\"People.com\\" was particulary useful, inspiring and exceedingly helpful. Rosabeth continues to make complex issues understandable for the layperson and the professional alike.

Both children are rallying for their health teachers to show this film at our high school and junior high. You must watch \\"The Smoking Fry\\" in the bonus titles. It will totally \\"wig\\" you out.

McDonald's takes the brunt in this eye-opening and graphic film but the film motivates the individual to choose better.Moving, amusing and enlightening, this film is a must see for all American consumers.

It was long over do that a documentary come out about America's grossly obese epidemic and obsession with fast food.

I think this is a documentary every one should see."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Interesting film - I get the same reaction...","review":"This is a very thought-provoking film (if you are not a McNeocon minion). I get the same reaction as the filmmaker whenever I ate that McGarbage - this film just reinforces my willpower to continue to stay away from that \\"food\\".I think the most important point, the one that the critics of this film (Madison Ave. mind-slaves) missed, is that corporations are drowning our society in this garbage and that the fast-food \\"healthy\\" menu items are mostly just as bad as the \\"regular\\" stuff.I agree that people have to accept responsibility for eating this junk but the McCorporations have to do the same for selling it in schools to kids and for pressuring the government to give them carte-blanche to distribute this junk.They should show this film in every school in America."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie!","review":"I saw Super Size Me at a film festival and thoroughly enjoyed it. However, I just saw Muffin Man and these movies are saying the same thing - in very different ways. Super Size Me is just for the quick laugh.

That he would pack so much BS into this to scare the public is just insanity. Most people lack the critical thinking or life experiences to see thru his veil of lies.He did not just supersize his meals. Most of the meals he would take away two cups of something. It stands to reason that one cup was a soft drink and the other a large shake. You can also see him eating many sundaes.To someone who has not had food allergies, you might not recognize that his chest pain and vomitting are signs of a food allergy. Also, if you are allergic to foods, your body reacts to them much like poison, so your liver is going to work overtime to get them out of your system. I would expect the doctors to have told him that. If not, they are not very good doctors.

Not only will this movie get the viewer to think about nutrition and fast food, but it will get the viewer thinking about exercise.The documentary follows the director as he decides to quit exercising and to eat nothing except foods purchased from McDonald's. Of his self-imposed restrictions, he can't eat the same thing until he has tried all the items on the menu, and if he is asked to super-size the meal, then he will do so. Throughout the film, he speaks with doctors who monitor his progress. The doctors, and we the viewers, are surprised at the results (although we could figure out the weight gain).This movie will make you think about your own nutritional choices. If this documented experiment doesn't, then the pictures of the food slowly degrading will. I would recommend this movie to fast food junkies everywhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only one thing surprized me.","review":"This documentary was well done. It was an interesting story what happened to Morgan Spurlock after a month of destroying his body. However, the only thing that surprised me during this movie was that somebody would do this to themselves to prove a point that most thinking people would already know. McDonald's bad. Fast food bad. Yes we know.

If you do ANYTHING three times a day you will find that it is harmful. The ancient Greeks said \\"everything in moderation\\"!! They should film a documentary about a man exercising excessively everyday, I bet he would have many health problems as well. McDonalds is on the hot seat while the movie theater you're sitting in is putting extra butter on your popcorn. In other words people....you have choices in life. If you need a movie to tell you Big Macs aren't a healthy alternative then I weep for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely Dangerous and Fraudulent","review":"Morgan Spurlock is a fraud and has managed to make one of the most dangerous films in the past few years while selling it to the public as a wake-up call for eating healthier. Almost everything he claims as truth in this film is a lie and the fact that he refuses to release his daily food logs to the press, or anyone else for that matter, should raise red flags to anyone who is considering taking this \\"documentary\\" seriously. Basically what you should know is, if Spurlock gained 25 lbs in one month he certainly did not gain it from only eating three meals at McDonald's alone. His false claims and phony theories are now being debunked as total lies and manipulation by many educated dietitians and physicians. Spurlock is a wolf and this film is the sheep's clothing he is lying behind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Super Size Me","review":"The DVD condition was perfect; the film was a documentary about fast-food restaurants.

When you let people sue food companies, you're saying that it is the reponsibility of the food companies to moderate what their customers eat. WHEN THAT happens, food companies are coerced into making only products that are healthy. THAT coerces me into not having as many options as I would have had just because a fat-lazy bum couldn't moderate himself and decided to make a quick buck by exploiting the system.THIS MOVIE SUPPORTS TAKING AWAY PEOPLE'S RIGHT AND RESPONSIBILITY TO CHOOSE AND MAKE DECISIONS FOR THEMSELVES.It is these EXTREME leftists that make us democrats look bad.

The rest of this 'documentary' is Morgan Spurlock stuffing his face with the largest, greasiest meals that money can buy and sitting around - he even uses a pedometer to make sure he doesn't get too much exercise - attributing every little ache and pain experiences over the course of a month to the \\"toxicity\\" of McDonald's food.If you have been somehow deluded into thinking fast food was actually good for you, this might be an informative watch.

Big surprise. But quite comical. I think it is a good wake up call that America really does want fresh, good food, there is just nowhere to get it. Hopefully this will spur some entrepreneur to start a new chain of good food - rather than fast food.As for the allegations of wrong doing on McDonald's part, I still don't buy it. McDonald's offers a very convenient product at a great price. It is unfortunate that some people overindulge. Perhaps we should tax them more to pay for the increased medical costs of obesity. But they are indespensible on road trips when I don't know where else to go!

First, it is extremely unhealthy as well as addictive. The US government spends 2 million dollars a year advocating a healthy diet. McDonalds spends 2 billion a year on advertising. Children recognize Ronald McDonald more than George Washington or Jesus. If the government really cares about Americans they would regulate and control all of these fast food companies from advertising and luring in children with toys. The government should be encouraging children to eat healthy, instead they're sending them to the wolves. If a child has diabetes before they're 15, they will lose 15 to 20 years off the life.In conclusion, the government should be doing more."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Truth Hurts","review":"Believe it or not, \\"Super Size Me\\" is one of the most important documentaries ever made. Morgan Spurlock shares with us his \\"journey\\" of eating nothing but McDonalds for one month. As we watch his weight gain, mood swings and body fat counts, we are also horrified at seeing his blood pressure rise to dangerously damaging levels. \\"Super Size Me\\" is funny, insightful, unbelievable and very thought provoking. Spurlock shows us in his unconventional way, the importance of eating right and maintaining good eating habits, yet he isn't pontificating or sanctimonious in his approach. The parts of the movie that deal with children's school lunch programs are especially interesting, and make us realize the ultimate impact of starting bad eating habits at an early age. Overall, this movie is very truthful, and should be required viewing for anyone questioning the nutritional value we get from eating fast food on a regular basis."},{"rating":"2","title":"rent, don't buy","review":"this movie has nothing new...FAST FOOD IS BAD FOR YOU...

But he ate 5000 calories of McDonalds a day. If you eat 5000 calories of anything a day you'll get fat, not just McDonalds. Eating fat doesn't make you fat or give you health problems, eating carbs will. Watch the movie \\"Fat Head\\" for proof. There, a man ate nothing but McDonalds and fast food for a month and lost weight. But unlike Morgan Spurlock, he ate a reasonable amount of calories at McDonald's - 2000 calories a day.In addition, Morgan Spurlock refuses to give out his food log out to the press - makes you wonder what he has to hide. On the other hand, the guy in the movie \\"Fat Head\\" posted his food log on the web for all to see and scrutinize.Morgan Spurlock is a fraud and I wish I could give this movie zero stars for the disservice he is doing for the public."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yup","review":"Bought this movie back in 2009 and it was great!

I am by no means a health nut, but I was a lot heavier growing up. Not until I met with a nutritionist, did I get some perspective on things. The movie shows what I have been seeing ever since I started to pay attention to what I was eating.McDonalds is only a side note to the story.

Second, he claims he wants to talk about McDonalds AND individual responsibility. However, the whole film is about corporations, mainly McDonalds and a couple of others. Every once in a while he will say that he values individual choice and responsibility as well.

But eventually, there was a sense of being beaten over the head with a blinding flash of the obvious. Yup, I just mixed some metaphors.Is there anyone reading this who doesn't know that McDonalds is unhealthy? Filmmaker knew he was riding a one-trick pony, so he threw in some interviews with folks who should be interviewed for such a film. At first, informative. Later, silly.

No kidding!I know a lot of people who are overweight, some to the point where it's now affected their health drastically. It's not because they eat McDonald's 90x a month. It's because they have poor dietary habits in general and don't exercise. One can gain a lot of unhealthy weight simply by eating home cooked meals high in fat and being a couch potato.

At least McDonald's has other options! For example, at In-and-Out, they only have ONE option! Oh yeah, and they have fries too! But somehow, In-and-Out has this image as such a classy fast food restaurant! Obviously eating a Super Sized meal at McDonald's for THREE meals a day is going to make you obese! It's insanely too extreme! It's like if I wanted to prove that being a vegan is unhealthy by only eating a head of lettuce for each of my meals! This experiment doesn't prove anything besides the fact that one man can jack up a corporation's reputation from one movie! McDonald's sure took the bullet for pretty much every other fast food chain!And by the way--Subway sucks! I can't believe this guy praises that place!

Barry was a soldier who was assigned to the 101st airborne division and he fell in love with Calpernia after watching her perform at a \\"drag\\" nightclub and theatre. Eventually a witch-hunt was persued under the DADT laws which was further helped by his back-stabbing roomate Justin Fisher who initiated it. Without giving too many details it results in tragedy for Addams and especially Winchell. The movie helps focus on the influence of the DADT laws in the creation of the tragedy that struck Winchell and its influence in generating a homophobic environment. Winchells parents were involved with pressing for re-examination of the DADT policys within the military and the real Calpernia Addams currently does transgender activism and continues to create television and theatre works."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT!!","review":"I love this movie and have not seen it in some time, I decided to finally buy it and what I got was a great movie from a great source.

I know Ms Wolf has a personal and political agenda. Admittedly, I had trouble getting started, largely because of similarities of voice in the early chapters, but once the plot begins I had no trouble following it and Medea herself down it's dark labyrinths. And I felt thoroughly gratified with her and at her sentiments at the end. Who hasn't reached that point, where the only gesture meaningful and appropriate is a raised middle digit--figuaratively speaking, of course? And who more than Medea has better cause?

The real stars of the movie carry it well with Martin Mull and Roddy McDowall taking kudos for scene stealing. This movie had it's own self-deprecating humor woven in and I for one think it is a perfect sendup of the genre and a clever beginning for Brad's career.

I found myself identifying more with Fay (mother in law of the main character) by wanting her in the story much more than she was because of me feeling she had every right to react and feel as she did. In most of the book, she was just pretty much around in a negative way, and her grief didn't help any. Just didn't get much from a typical story in that we all have relatives (in laws) who can be as unnerving (even in death) as those in the story. The ending was pretty much an \\"I'm running out of storyline so I need pack it in with a typical see the world\\" type ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much ado about_______?","review":"I've always wanted to read a Welty book and I picked this one.

The story is pointless. The protagonist is a weak, spineless woman who allows herself to be abused by her father's second wife without much resistance. I was annoyed from the moment I started reading this by every character in it. If that was Welty's goal then I give this 5 stars instead of 2. Maybe one has to be a southerner to understand this book. The pulitzer board refused to give Pynchon the prize in '74 but they give it to this terrible book. I have read a few Pulitzer prize winning novels and this is the only one that I did not enjoy at all. I give an author one chance and Welty used hers up. May I suggest Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird, Hersey's A Bell for Adano, Hemingway's Old Man and the Sea or Momaday's House Made of Dawn (just to name a few)if you want to read deserving pulitzer winners. This book is a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thank goodness it was short","review":"I was just glad I was able to finish this novel in about an hour - while it isn't the worst I've ever read, it was overall dull and sort of pointless to my liking. I never really cared for enough of the characters to really connect to the book, and whenever there was a glimmer of amusement or cleverness, it passed as quickly as it had begun. I never mind literary vagueness, but most of the points in the story were just a tad *too* vague. That having been said, I will comment that the ending of the book did please me - I won't give it away for future readers, but what Laurel does with her life is an enormous relief; had she done otherwise I would probably have dashed the book against a wall!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A WASTE OF TIME","review":"I picked up The Optimist's Daughter on advice of several recommendations. It is supposedly Welty's best work. Ha! This was certainly among the worst novels I have ever read. The language is poorly structured and she seems to go out of her way to dribble meaningless streams of words.

Today's readers want to see evil and ignorance vanquished, whether it's a genuine villian or just some hillbilly white trash grabbing up an old man's estate with both hands.But this is an evil and ignorant world, and Welty does a wonderful job of telling a story that feels not so much like a story but real life itself.To me, I was impressed with Welty's incredible economy to tell this story.

My expectations, therefore, were high and I felt disappointed and wholly unsatisfied when I finished reading it. Perhaps this is due to some failing or intellectual lacking of my own (after all, the book DID win the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction) but I found her characters to be rather flat and her attempts at abstract descriptions difficult to follow. If I had reread certain passages a few times, I might have been able to follow her train of thought but I read fiction for pleasure, not to practice my study skills. Throughout the entire book, I got the feeling that she was simply trying too hard to be poetic.

Keeping him immobile in that bed was killing him and he was losing the will to live. She was right to try to wake him up. Laurel and the townspeple irritated me far more than Fay.

The language is simple but beautiful, and Jessie is someone who we can all love. And the illustrations...oh!!!

We had a cheaper product than this before that we liked better - we could read the display better, there was FAR less static and we didn't have to switch so often.

I got an open box unit, so I don't know if this unit was already broken. I just returned the unit for a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Finally, the scan feature I've been waiting for... wait, it doesn't really work...","review":"Good signal output as far as these things go. The scan feature would be phenomenal if it didn't take 120 seconds to scan and then pick a less than optimal channel. Scanning on your own while driving is dangerous, but this thing didn't solve that problem for me. It's almost there, keep trying Monster.Even though I only gave it 2 stars, it's still perhaps the best transmitter on the market as of Aug. 2007:-("},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor reception","review":"I bought this at CompUSA. I live in rural Vermont. The AutoSearch works fairly well. The static when connected is acceptable. A big problem is that suddenly you'll get blasted by static when the FM signal is interfered with. I'm bringing it back for refund. I agree with the previous reviewer - it's NOT worth it. My wife's old 8 station Monster works much better.I'm going to try going back to my old Belkin charge which connects to a cassette."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well designed; not perfect, but very good.","review":"I bought the manual select FM transmitter for my brother and I liked it, so I bought this one for myself. True, in heavy traffic congestion (I live in Chicago)the static is not cool, but I don't see how Monster could get around that.

I'm happy with this product and was able to find it for about $70."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cuts out and background static!!!","review":"I am returning this product because lack of quality sound output. There is a lot of static in the background when the songs are at low volume and when the music is paused, and when the units low signal strength gets lost the sterio will play horrible static that is twice as loud as the music that was being playing. I used the auto scans prefered \\"stations\\", but they did not work any better than the manualy selected ones. The buttons on the unit are not repeatably responsive, meaning they would not work all of the time.

However, even though the auto scan feature worked flawlwessly, the overall sound quality forced me to return the product for a refund. The trouble is twofold: the bass is very \\"boomy\\" and the highs (cymbals, high guitar, high vocals, etc.) are \\"scratchy\\" as if listening to a worn LP. This happens at any frequency I chose.This was my first purchase of an FM transmitter and it seems from reading the reviews that they all have issues. Can someone tell if there is an FM transmitter sold that really works well?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Thrilled","review":"I wasn't thrilled with the Monster Ipod transmitter at all. Actually I returned it to Amazon and am awaiting their judgment on my return. I did n't like it because there was too much static, breaking up of transmission.

I have only intermittently been able to reset the unit using the button; most often I have to unplug the power adapter from the car and plug it back in before it will reset.Caveta: This is my first transmitter purchase so I don't know if the behavior is normal to transmitters or if my area (Honolulu) is prone to this problem. But regardless, the fact is that this unit cuts off completely, blasts me with static (loudly) since the volume has to be turned up louder than a regular FM station would be.I would not recommend this product. The auto-scan feature is gimmicky and the sequence for setting the menu presets is non-intuitive (i.e. press a button, press another button, hold one down for 3 seconds, press another button). There's only 3 buttons and I couldn't remember the sequence, no matter how hard I have tried."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless","review":"1st Received - Had a button broken.

That one is excellent and I will probably buy me one more of those."},{"rating":"1","title":"AutoScan just doesn't work","review":"The AutoScan feature seemed like a good idea but I have tried it repeatedly following exactly the instructions on the product, but after selecting \\"Auto\\" nothing at all happens. Yes, it says to wait, but you can wait and wait and wait and nothing at all happens. It works in manual station mode but you don't need to pay this much for that technology.

But in all fairness, the description does say that it will only work with the classic iPods, you just have to look carefully to find it.

I live in the metro nyc area and would love to use this everyday but it's not worth the headache.This only has 3 buttons, so why is it so hard to use!!! The autoscan takes minutes, not seconds, to go thru the entire radio network and ends up picking the same 3 stations all the time. When I press the main button sometimes it scans, sometimes it picks a station, and sometimes it just does nothing. During songs, I hear blasts of static. Sometimes the Monster turns off and then then I'm listening to the radio station. I also need to hold the ipod up by the steering wheel while I'm driving otherwise it gets even worse reception. I know my cheap new corolla's radio is partially to blame but the Monster cable should work well enough to make listening to my ipod in the car a pleasant experience but it doesnt."},{"rating":"1","title":"works ok... but...","review":"This sounds fine - it's clear etc.... rarely static... however...

This model has some problems: The worst being anytime there is a quiet section playing, the transmitter completely stops working. If you listen to anything with any dynamics, expect to be interrupted by loud radio static when the device cuts off. Another problem is the size of the plug - if you use any iPod case or cover, it will not fit. You will have to remove it from the case every time you play the iPod in your car. It gets annoying if (like me) you want to use it every day. It has also locked up my iPod a couple of times, requiring me to reboot. Do yourself a favor and get the older model which works very well.

Much to my delight, I found a NEW copy for sale, and when I got it, it was much larger in size than the previous one.

This professional review says it best (www.splendidezine.com/ review.html?reviewid=10815329601128299), where the folks at Splendid Ezine ask if this 40 year old Spaniard is really trying to break onto the dance scene with A-Chi-Li-Pu and expect his more contemporary fans to take him seriously.

A sub-character with very very very little to add in the big scheme of things has got me perplexed. Did he die of AIDS? Did he slip in a pool and drown. I just didn't get it.With that aside. Rescue Me was an intense ride in romance and the heedy side of drugs, premarital sex, and kids(pretending to be adults) acting like piranha while their mom is away living la vida loca with the car salesman. And then there's Gabriel, the black angel, who waits ten years for Amanda who dumps him like a rotten sack of potatoes for James(Jimmy)who can give her everything she's always dreamed of, a life outside of her run down drug shack. When Amanda realizes that her big house and soccer mom status isn't enough she searches for Gabriel to come back into her life.

I say pass on it and take something else to the beach to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Much Like a Screenplay","review":"The storyline was interesting but Grazer failed to fully develop her characters. Instead, she jumped around from one scene to another. The plot was uneven and, IMHO, underdeveloped. Grazer looks like she has great potential (Stepmom was an excellent story). She's very creative & inciteful. I would definitely watch out for her next work, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did I read a different book?","review":"I really hated this book. I didn't like any of the characters, and the writing was so uneven. Amanda made no sense, and the rest of the people in the book seemed paper-thin - so many things would happen for seemingly no reason. I kept waiting for everything to somehow tie together, but it really didn't. Gabe was too perfect - we are asked to believe his life pre-Amanda was just working in a car factory and hanging out with his drug dealer buddy. Also, why did Amanda end up marrying James? Even with the events leading up to the marriage, I find that hard to believe. And what about her boss at the TV show? Why was he even in the book? I honestly had to force myself to finish the book.

Compared to Grazer's fabulous The Starter Wife, this was not good. It wasn't \\"fast-moving\\" like others claim, but in reality, bounced around so much that I could barely track what was happening. More importantly, it didn't engage me enough that I even cared what was happening! I became so bored and confused (a feat, I know) with the storyline that I eventually skipped to the end, something I also never do.

I bought this book after reading the Starter Wife and noticing the 4 Star review people were giving it. I felt that the book was poorly written and seemed to drag out yet it was only 270 pages. From someone who grew up in the 1980s, I thought I would connect with the characters yet I felt no connection to them at all. I thought the book would be bit more like the Starter Wife with its focus on Hollywood but it didn't do that at all. I have given the book to a friend to read to see what she thinks but I told her I thought it was AWFUL.

The sexual encounters were numerous and very explicit. It seemed as though the majority of the book was about the sex that Cady and Sid were having instead of the war that they were fighting.This book is not a love story.

To make matters worse, if you have a boy that sometimes misses (even when sitting down), the miss tends to go right onto Elmo's hand, which is the button that you press to make Elmo talk, and is the thing that does not like moisture when you wash it.So, if your kid is a Sesame Street fan, go ahead and get this, but otherwise I would look for something more practical."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading Title - total waste of money","review":"This article has absolutely no information on ways to swim with dolphins.

When the DVDs arrived and I watched them, I initially realized that one thing that had changed was me in that I had managed to learn a lot in the years since the series was first broadcast. This does not detract from the product and it is still well worth the price.

He deals with every subject imaginable, including scientific work which ordinarily, I would not have attempted to follow, but he makes it all so easy that you begin to feel quite clever and to wish that you'd had him as a tutor. The series was 3 years in the making with location filming in over 20 countries and I would energetically recommend it to anyone to broaden their knowledge and especially to those with children, who will, I promise, be fascinated by all the events which shaped the world as we know it...an absolute masterpiece!"},{"rating":"2","title":"history of science and technology","review":"This is mostly a history of science and technology with a little math history and anthropology thrown in. The main information is in the audio with the video being illustrations. It is at the high school level. When it deals with things 5000 or more years ago it is less accurate. Partly because that period is mostly conjecture and also because of more modern discoveries. One example is that DNA measurements of Neandertal \\"man\\" shows it is not related to modern people.This program is the inverse of Civilization by Clark which is really an art appreciation course (in spite of its broader title) where the main information is in the video of famous works of art and the audio is a nontechnical description at the middle school level."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ascent of Man","review":"I saw this program when it was originally on PBS back in the 70's.

If they last a year, I'll be more than pleased.Delivery was prompt with no troubles at all.

Like all of Christensen's books, whether they are police related or martial arts, you will laugh a lot at his biting humor while learning much from his experience in the trenches.This book not only shows lots of techniques, but Christensen talks a lot about the psychology of dealing with bad guys as well as how to deal with a police administration. Often, dealing with a naive, stupid and uncaring politically motivated police administration is tougher than wrestling some crazy doper to the ground.Great in-your-face book.

It's all just too confusing, and, for my money, the author's \\"voice\\" comes across as presumptous, self-important, and irritating.

I have had nothing but trouble and every task is a struggle. Simply trying to keep the text from twisting nearly drove me crazy.

Most interesting are the final chapters on the conditions needed for a democratic polity and the responsibilities of the individual in a system of democratic citizenship.

They say it has \\"a 35% larger radiant surface provides more radiant heating than other oil filled radiators\\", which translates into faster heating and it feels cooler to the touch. We have a 20-month old who needs to touch everything, so its good knowing that he wont get burnt touching this. Its also pretty energy efficient as it turns off when the rooms gets warm enoughCons: The thermostat is a bit inaccurate, but thats easy to get around by offsetting the set temperature.

The instruction step literally at one point said \\"If you don't already know how to use (a tool), we reccommend you not use it\\" then went on to another topic. That would have been fine, except the fact was, you couldn't follow the steps in the book as laid out in the book without using that tool. Other instructions were skimpy, missing, or wrong. Seeing as how you can download Linux free on the web and burn your own CD, the only reason to buy this book for 30$ would be easy to follow instructions. Which this book DOES NOT HAVE. An awful book.

It then goes on to talk about connecting to the internet with a dialup connection (under ideal circumstances)and explaining the superficial features of Gnome. The book has absolutely no content on using the shell or administering your system. Any and all information in this book is either trivial or severly lacking in detail.This book isn't even worth the software that comes with it, which can be downloaded on the web for free.

It's not _loud_ - it's just clicky - but I've bought quiet switches before and this one is louder than I'm used to hearing from switches advertised as specifically quiet.

It's not a very good one. The premise is good, the characterizations as usual are very nice, but the plot goes nowhere and stays there from about halfway in until the last, disappointing page. Changing narrators in the book was a nice risk, but it ruins everything. Having the book be about computers and then putting in a 14-year gap was also not the wisest thing. If you want to start off on the right Francis Foot, try PROOF or WILD HORSES or ENQUIRY, and there you're neck-deep in characterization, plot and thrills. Francis is a master, but even masters have an off day."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best ever.","review":"I read this book many years ago when I was in college.

Only about half of the book is really about Bob Wills, and it's a poorly-written book to boot. It's similar to listening to someone just \\"ramble\\" all over the place, from one subject and time period to another, with little or no warning. It never flows and is hard to follow. The only reason I give it even 1 star is for a few bits of information about Bob Wills that I might not have read anywhere else and it does have some good pictures."},{"rating":"1","title":"More about Diocletian than Constantine -- and with a bias","review":"Don't bother with this one. Burckhardt was a 19th century academic with an ax to grind against Constantine and a mission to rehabilitate the Christian-persecuting Diocletian. He pursues both of those ends with blind and tedious enthusiasm.The book takes about 240 pages just to get to Constantine at all, as Burckhardt loses his focus amid 60 page digressions on pagan practices in the ancient Mediterranean world.Perhaps most annoyingly, the modern translator has seen fit to strip out all of Burckhardt's references which makes the book into an unverifiable manifesto as opposed to a serious scholarly work.There are much better and more accessible works out there on Constantine and his times than this one, such asConstantine and the Christian Empire, just to give one example.

It covers the Ministry of the Holy Spirit completely and accurately. This is a subject many pastors do not understand let alone teach. Tony Evans book covers the subject completely and in language that a child could understand.I recommend this book to anyone regardless of denomination. To the non Christian it will be interesting reading however the finer points will not be evident. The Promise outlines the personal relationship one must have with Jesus Christ in order to receive the gift of salvation.Religion will not in its self suffice as this is mans attempt to attain salvation through merit. Salvation is bought and paid for by the blood of Jesus Christ and it cannot be atained through works. This book covers the subject very well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brought Colonial Times To Life","review":"This book brings the times of that era gone by, to vivid life...The scenarios, the lifestyle, the little things like a poetry recital in moonlight is so revealing...so realistic...it opens up that time period to modern eyes, which can't fail to appreciate it. What i particularly liked other than the story itself, was the intro to ruswa...it gives insights into his motivations/inspirations...and you can then fully understand the story and how far to actually take it as fact...The translated poetry is pleasure itself...and it's a very touching book, especially the start...It pulled at me in a mysterious way, evoking strong feelings of something akin to bittersweetness..some dusty memories...my grandmother brought up (almost) in that time period told me stories of how it used to be and this is a leap back to those stories/memories...It's a great book...which will pull you in."},{"rating":"2","title":"4 stars","review":"Would've been perfected if the pages weren't dented and crinkled.

I determined the impeller \\"keeper\\" had come off the motor shaft, the impeller had flown off and was ruined, and of course no more suction. (ShopVac has sent a new power head.) Closer examination suggests the same problem may occur again--and again. The impeller is made of extrememly light aluminum, and although there is a stablizing collar on each side, the keeper is nothing more than a friction fit/push-on nut rather than a threaded fitting. In addition the attachments are cheap, and their storage and power cord storage interfere with one another. The price of this model has been dropping.

It's one thing to have predators speaking to prey, that happens in picture books all the time, but to have African animals talking to Australian animals, and to have Woodland animals conversing with Savannah animals?

Herman Rosenthal was her father's friend yet a figure of contempt for her mother, whose sympathies lie with Charles Becker and his saintlike wife, Helen. Delmar has done her homework, as evidenced in the accuracy of her treatment of the trial and its aftermath.Historic fiction, yes. But an intriguing look at Mr. and Mrs. (and Miss!!)

Williams simply walks through the steps he takes to make a program without explaining why he is doing it or what predefined functions and classes mean.

Watch it on YouTube it brings tears to my eyes."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Hate to Say It: Lackluster!","review":"I preface my review of Siempre by stating I'm a huge Il Divo fan and have seen them in concert once. It was an amazing show! I frequently listen to their first two albums, which I really enjoy. However, my least favorite Il Divo songs are the ones where they take a once popular English song and transform it into a version in another language. With that said, I'm somewhat disappointed with Siempre. Of the nine new songs, most of them fit the pattern I mentioned before. This time, they chose songs that I'm either tired of or didn't like the first time around. So here I sit with a new CD I have no desire to listen to again. I'm hoping it will grow on me."},{"rating":"1","title":"English Please","review":"I just bought 3 CD's for gifts after hearing Il Divo on several TV shows this week. They sang in English and why would I not expect their CD to be in English also? No one said it would not be in English and not a word on Amazon that it was not in English. The music is beautiful - but I would appreciate being able to understand the lyrics. Very disappointing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Il Divo, Siempre","review":"Il Divo is one of my favorite groups.

The songs are blah and unoriginal, and the sound quality of the CD is the worst I've heard in a long time. The producer of this waste of money needs to go back to the drawing board. Il Divo's heavenly voice deserves better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fifteen minutes, yes. Siempre, no.","review":"Sounds better than freeway traffic noises, but not much.

I could not believe the voice blend of this group. They are absolutely magnificent! I ordered this Siempre CD and The Christmas Collection CD. My only complaint with the Siempre CD is that they only sing one song in English (Somewhere). It would have been nice to hear 'Without You' and 'Tell That To My Heart' in English too. However, I love their voice blend so much that I try and overlook the fact that I can't understand a word they sing :-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"IL Divo??

Amazing - \\"Nights in White Satin\\" really stood out. Thought the \\"artists\\" were doing a not so subtle bit of satire. It was about as good as I'd expect Lady Gaga to be doing a cover of \\"Ave Maria\\". At least Rod Stewart's forays into new genres are graced by vigor and intellect. You'll find neither here. Its not often a musical group can simultaneously tarnish multiple musical genres on a single CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"They Just Keep Getting Better","review":"Every album they put out tops the last one.

Lewis was a gifted writer, and it is evident in The Great Divorce. I read some of the reviews on this site, and I think that the people writing the negative ones are not in a place where they can read the book with some imagination. It is not meant to be a factual account of heaven and hell (who could write that?), but it is meant to make you think about yourself and the things that are keeping your heart from being ready to meet the Lord. Give this book a shot. I don't believe that you will be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Fantastic!","review":"IMHO, this is Lewis' 2nd greatest book (behind Mere Christianity). Every Christian or aspiring Christian should read/listen to this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fun Read","review":"I could not put this fictional story down. The story representing heaven and hell is short but captivating. The numerous characters in the book reject the offer to heaven and give excuses that are really excuses people give for rejecting heaven while they are on earth. I must admit that there were parts of the story that I did not understand, but the basic premise was obvious and interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable and thought-provoking story","review":"For some reason, I find myself returning to this book about once a year to re-read it. It's a short and easy read, but it's length is deceptive. Lewis is an excellent observer of the human condition and this allegory is very thought provoking. Written over 40 years ago, it still stays fresh.I would highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"C.S. Lewis does get you to think","review":"I decided to pick up The Great Divorce after a 15-year hiatus when I saw a play based on this work. The play was splendid, so I decided to reread this short but power-packed book. Based on the decisions made by the characters who made the bus trip to a place between heaven and hell, I decided that not much has changed since Lewis' day (or since I last read this). Some very insightful comments are made, and I found myself challenged in several ways. Lewis has a way of putting things that, though complex, he makes sound almost simple. I appreciate his insights and hope that I can apply some of the lessons into the last half of my life. I'm grateful to people like Lewis when they are able to have such an impact in the way I think. Definitely one of my top five Lewis favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"This is one of my favorite C.S. Lewis book. I have read it twice but had misplaced my original copy so I bought it again because it is a great addiction to your reading library. I don't want to give it away, but the way the author writes about the topic of the afterlife was very very interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Our daily Great Divorces from God","review":"C.S. Lewis presents a story of one's journey towards God or away from God. The central characteristic in each of us is Free Will and our daily choices to embrace God or not. A much more succinct journey than Dante's, Lewis challeges us to look at the direction our life is headed based on the choices we make. Based on George MacDonald's definition of hell: I am my own, Lewis ' character is invited to embrace eternal Joy by giving himself to God. I use this book with high school seniors and they say it is a must read"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic","review":"What may happen when we die ? What holds us back from our true nature and happiness. C.S. Lewis tells a great tale"},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny but serious too","review":"I enjoyed the various characters who took the bus ride to the afterlife. Some carried their sinful ways with them and didn't make it to the mountain (heaven). The observer who told the story seemed very humble to me and I liked him right away. It was interesting to read the descriptions of the afterlife from C.S. Lewis' perspective."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Idea...Different Perspective","review":"This is a wonderful book that uses an ordinary man's dream to show the great separation between Heaven and Hell. It demonstrates that nothing fit for one can be taken into the other and that you MUST \\"sell all that you have and follow Me.\\"I highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"A powerful work!","review":"When you encounter a writer and a work that provokes thought to the degree that CS Lewis does you read and then you re-read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful reading of great book","review":"I listened to the audio version and it was superbly done. The book itself is great, and then this reading really adds to it. The reader does a great job with the various British accents, fitting them well to each character. This is a great way to enjoy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another possibility","review":"I remember enjoying this book because it opened a door. You must understand that I view religion as an important tool for giving people a since of security and moral foundation. Religion hands people comforting answers to questions that can be difficult to take without support (i.e. What happens when we die? and Why are we here?). It also helps to setup responsibilty over and above the laws of the land. When you are held before your maker you will be more caitous than if you were to break a traffic law and are judged by your next door neighbor. This book shows that there is a wide array of possible scenarios for life after death. My belief is that it doesn't matter what you choose as your answers. It matters that you do believe in your answers to give you the security to live your life. I happen to like C.S. Lewis' view of Heaven and Hell. It makes me wonder if some of the Bible could have been someone's answers put down on paper."},{"rating":"2","title":"thought provoking","review":"This book show's how horrible sin is. How it ruins people, How it ruins their minds. Read this book and think about yourself. Think about what you are holding onto in life, and ask yourself if its worth it. This book should shed some light on the subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Question of Solidity","review":"The interaction between the Ghosts and the Solid People in \\"The Great Divorce\\" is heartbreaking to me, because it reminds me of how I desire to cling to pieces of Hell and still enter Heaven. Yet, in order to become a citizen of God's kingdom, you have to surrender yourself wholly to the forgiveness and grace of Christ, which I believe is one of the major themes of this book. C.S. Lewis asks a question that could possibly be the most important one we answer in our lifetime: what are you willing to sacrifice in order to obtain the eternal happiness of Heaven and the glory of God's presence?"},{"rating":"2","title":"An unforgetable little book","review":"This is one of the little known but POWERFUL books by CS Lewis. He has a way of making you really think about your life and what you're letting control you. As he points out in this book, amazingly things that annoy and torment us we tend to cling to and keep around. Hmmmm, why do we do that? You will ponder this book and its message for years to come."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glad to divorce this one!","review":"C.S. Lewis is one of the most praised writers in the christian literary world. I am not a fan of this book. I found it extremely hard to follow and all around just a hard read. I ended up having to find a study guide online to make it through the class."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outside the Box","review":"C.S. Lewis takes you on a trip that will vastly expand your horizons in \\"The Great Divorce\\". It's a 'get out of hell free' ticket to heaven where you will meet some incredible people and be exposed to some 'outside the box' thinking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another boring \\"classic\\".","review":"Just plain boring, and difficult to read because of that. I just wanted to get it over with. The book just seems to be preaching about all of our human pitfalls. Yeah, no kidding - we see that that every single day on the news and on every so-called reality TV show. I won't be reading any more from this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Book Ever Written","review":"This is the best book ever written. What else needs to be said? Lewis artfully mixes Platonism, Orthodoxy, and Imagination to the benefit of the reader. A tale full of deep Christian metaphors. Lay mysticism at its best."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Great Divorce CD","review":"Very disappointed in the audio book, it's like trying to listen to a Theatrical Movie with a British accent that was hard to understand. I feel like it was 10% good and the rest of that 90% just filler."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Much Allegory... Read Love Wins Instead","review":"I tried to get into this literary classic and just couldn't quite understand it. It came highly recommended to me by a friend of mine because he knew I had just read and enjoyed Rob Bell's, \\"Love Wins\\". Apparently Lewis and Bell think similarly on issues relating to Heaven, Hell, and the afterlife. But, there was just too much use of allegory and symbolism in \\"The Great Divorce\\" that I couldn't bring myself to finish it simply for a lack of understanding on my part. If I can't understand a book then I don't see the sense in continuing to read it. And, so I reluctantly stopped reading this one about halfway through. If you have no problem understanding allegory, then I recommend this book. But, if you are like me and find it difficult to understand allegory, then save yourself the time and read Love Wins instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Great Divorce","review":"I ordered several C.

Lipsha's quest for identity connected with the young men and women alike. But Tracks was even more efective. Fleur's fight against the loggers and land developers turned 32 college sophmores into hardy land conservationists. The incredible transportating of a successful hunt with the meat tied to the hero's body struck a cord of awe at having been given a view of survival that took them beyond their trips to their local grocery stores. Erdrich opens windows to another culture, different values, and to history in ways that made my students begin to \\"see\\" the world beyond their dormrooms. What other author writing today can do the same with such poetry?"},{"rating":"2","title":"read this for a class and loved it","review":"This made me want to seek out Louise Erdrich's other books. She has an excellent style that blends humorous, sad, and political."},{"rating":"1","title":"short but confusing","review":"I made two mistakes in reading this book. First, I read it very quickly, and I think that's why I tended to get the relationships of the characters confused. Second, this book is one of a series, and, although its events occur first, it was written later. Therefore, perhaps the author intended for the reader to be already familiar with the characters. The book has alternating narrators. One is Nanapush, a Chippewa elder, who is telling Lulu her mother's story. Lulu's mother is Fleur, the central character in the book, a beguiling woman whose parents died from a white man's disease. The other narrator is Pauline, half-white, vengeful and somewhat crazy, who becomes a nun bent on self-flagellation, perhaps attempting to assuage guilt from having lured Fleur's lover toward a young, beautiful girl. I was somewhat puzzled that Nanapush seemingly so easily forgives a huge betrayal by his lover, Margaret, and I was amused by Fleur's wily act of trickery at the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"Great book-- I don't see why a couple of other respondents said this book is lifeless, etc. The plot is excellent, and the dual narration adds to suspense.

This was quiet possibly the most wretched book I have ever had the misfortune to lay my hands on, since I am an avid reader it took alot to earn that position with me. The story line moves horribly slow. The narration flips back and forth with each chapter between a wise old man, and an illogical, mentaly ill future nun who engages in strange practices of self torture. The parts narrarated by the nun do not make sense, do not enrich the plot and break the flow of the book since it is mostly nonsense taking place in her head. To much nonsense and unneccesary sex.

No one at T-Mobile knows what the problem is, and they pretend not to know the problem exists even though I have read reviews in many places complaining of this problem (after I had the problem and looked for soln, which I have not found). Motorola quality control has obviously gone downhill. In summary, don't buy this phone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't charge!!","review":"I've had this phone for about 3 months now. It will NOT charge! I have tried many different outlets, but for the past few weeks, the phone won't charge. When it does charge, it doesn't hold a charge. I've heard of others having this problem as well. The phone is also slow. It doesn't go where you want it to go right away. The phone is awesome for a while, but then all of these problems start happening. I wouldn't buy this phone. I am going to pay the price to get a different one. I hate it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Motorola Rizr","review":"I biught this phone only to realize that right out of the box it had white screen problems, I exchanged it and the same thing happened again. I sent the second phone back for a tmobile shadow and I couldn't be happier. If the white screen is fixed then it could be a decent phone, but it is annoying and frustrating."},{"rating":"2","title":"The very best dimmer for all your needs","review":"One of the best features of this dimmer is that it has much less depth than others so it can fit inside a switch box that is full of wires and wire nuts. I like this straight rotary type, the type that turns off by simply turning the knob all the way to the left. You do not need to push to turn it on or off. By starting with zero it is much better for a light bulb. It does not jolt the filament with full voltage. Easy to connect by using wire nuts. If you've had to wrap a 12 gauge wire around screws, you'll understand why this is better. Do use electrical tape over the wire nuts. And, best of all, it is truly the most affordable dimmer on the market. Also, Leviton has come up with a feature that solves a lot of problems. They now include both a white and an ivory knob. Many times I have had somebody say - Oh, I wish it were ivory like the old switches. So, forget the rest. Buy these. You'll be happy."},{"rating":"2","title":"dimmer swich works great","review":"had to replace an older version dimmer switch. had a hard time finding a dial type.

Interesting game.","review":"My order arrived ahead of the scheduled date and was in very good shape for a used book. There was a little dogearing on the edges, but that's about it.

I would gladly buy books from Scott Holden-Jones, et al, again.I picked up the book for the story, rather than the game materials; however, it looks like it contains everything you need to get a game going, although there might be a game master's edition out there.

I was hoping to received a useful reference and this was not so I returned it."},{"rating":"2","title":"In the middle","review":"If i could i would give this book 3.5 stars. It is about a teenage girl facing many problems. Her parents just recently divorced and shes switching back and forth between them, her friends dont understand her and she gets to the point where she becomes pretty depressed. She also has this nasty teacher that gets her into trouble as well. I felt like this story wove the words in better than other SAT books i've read. It was interesting and kept me engaged. I read the second half of the book straight through. Although this book is interesting and helpful, I didnt feel like I could connect with her issues. Yes, I know, this book is meant for vocab but I think that it may not appeal to some people who don't like hearing about other people's problem.I agree with the fact that sometimes we don't need to know about what's going on in the bedroom, but its a minor part of the book and not a very big deal. 12 year olds should not be reading this but high schoolers are just fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"A thought provoking book","review":"I read this book years ago and just reread it. The issues are always important. The author does a great job presenting a non bias view of the tragedy of a father killing a son because he can't cope with the son's drug use. The problem is here years later I want to know how the survivors have moved on with their lives and generally what has happened to them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Best mix missing from this release","review":"The Eurythmics' \\"I've Got A Life\\" has been #1 on Billboard's Dance/Club chart for 2 weeks as of mid-Dec 2005. The one and only version of this song you should care about is the David Guetta & Joachim Garraud Mix. This is the mix that has made this song a massive hit at dance clubs worldwide. It opens with basically a 90 second acapella of Annie Lennox's vocal, then breaks into a wicked bassline which carries you into the rest of the song. This is a truly amazing mix. Unfortunately, it is not available on this CD single, or any of the others that have been released so far.Why do record labels do this? Why do they release an amazing mix to clubs to promote a record, then put a different set of less stellar mixes on the actual CD releases. Everyone who hears this song out at a club wants a copy of THAT version of the song, not some watered down version. And record companies wonder why CD sales are falling..."},{"rating":"1","title":"hoop earrings","review":"I gave this product a low rating ONLY because the wire would not stay closed.

Additionally, the photocopied pages vary in quality from faint copy as if copied from a copy, from a copy, to darkened pages leaving large sections of the pages blackened and unreadable.

This is a fun musical comedy with Eleanor Powell, Burt Lahr, Virginia O'Brien, Red Skelton, and the Tommy Dorsey Orchestra at their best. It opens with the band performing \\"Hawaiian War Chant,\\" featuring spectacular solo playing by trombonist Dorsey, drummer Buddy Rich, and trumpeter Ziggy Ellman. Unfortunately, the sound quality on this VHS is so poor that only about 25 percent of the dialogue is understandable. This is no exaggeration--it's so bad it needs subtitles. The musical numbers are also diminished by the poor sound. I recently saw the movie on Turner Classic Movies (TCM), and the sound was fine. My recommendation: Don't waste money on this VHS version. Wait for it to show again on TCM, or until it's reissued on a quality DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good musical!","review":"Ship Ahoy, is a must-see for musical fans. The plot is not very strong, but the performances by the actors are great!Red Skelton plays a hypochondriac author who meets Eleanor Powell while on a cruise. She's a dancing star with Tommy Dorsey and his orchestra and when she gets sent on a mission, she thinks she is working for the government. Frank Sinatra sings a few songs, the expressionless Virginia O'Brien stars as a friend of Eleanor Powell's, and Bert Lahr, best known for his performance as the cowardly lion in \\"The Wizard of Oz\\"The Wizard of Oz (Two-Disc Special Edition), adds some comedy as a friend of Red's.Don't miss Eleanor tapping out a message, moarse code style, to the audience while performing with \\"On Moonlight Bay.\\"I agree, this movie should be put on DVD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Eye Opening","review":"This book is like sitting and having a real conversation with a real man of God about a real subject. It does include personal experience but it educates and offers many scripture references. It was a awesome read and I had a hard time putting it down. Well worth every penny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Ultimate Spider-Man Story... EVER","review":"I have always loved this storyline but now after playing the Ultimate Spider-Man video game I love it even more; hopefully Bendis & Bagley adapt that game because its story is a direct sequel to VENOM. It reveals the truth behind the death of Peter and Eddie's parents, and we also get to see Venom with the white spider on his chest. ANYWAY, this story is even better to me now, and I heartily recommend it to anyone who even remotely likes comics. I'd give it five stars if I knew how to update my previous rating... oh well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Comic book is not as described","review":"The item was not described properly. According to them, it had a \\"very good\\" shape, which is not entirely the case. The comic came with water stains and a lack of flexibility when it comes to open the book and read it. Furthermore, since it got wet, the cover and pages have an awkward shape. Not recommended at all!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad art and weird story line","review":"In the ultimate spiderman graphic novels venom stars in a three volume series (volume 7, 11, and 21). There are a lot of negative things about this book. First of all the art. A lot of the characters in this book look realy distorted and Peter Parker looks nothing like how he should look like. Second is the story line. In this versian of Venom's origin Eddie Brock was a long lost friend of Peter parker. The black suit was actually something their Fathers created as a cure for cancer. I like Venom's origin a lot better in the Spiderman 3 movie. There is also a lot of stupid little details in this book that only I would pick up, in the begining Aunt May was talking about Jimi Hendrix and later she was wearing a Led Zepplin shirt. She is way to old to be from the 60's rock generation. Thats just silly! If you are a die hard Venom fan purchase this book but if your not don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Venom Reduced","review":"Okay folks I admit this is a Good Story. Venom is introduced in a less confusing simplified Origin. I like the the idea that Pete and Eddie were friends at one point. Although somewhere in the first or second year of Ultimate Spidey...a Reporter named Eddie Brock is mentioned...Could be a distant realitive but, not likely. Also his death at the end? Why does He have to DI (Yeah I know according to the Ultimate Spider-man game, he didnt but as far as I'm concerned that doesnt apply...). And Venom seems to be reduced to some slobbering idiot (much Like the Goblin...notice a Trend here?) Good Story. Could be Better though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Venom is unleashed","review":"This book was pretty good, and was actually the reason why I started collecting Ultimate Spider-man comics. It introduced the Ultimate Universe to Eddie Brock, and old friend to Peter. When they learn of a suit that could cure cancer, Peter Parker (Spider-man) accidently put it on. His strength and attitude was increased. He got rid of the costume before it permantly changed him. Eddie Brock figured out that Peter was Spider-man and put the suit on himself. He became Venom, a very crazy, strong, and strange-looking monster. If your looking for a book that has Venom at his best, this is not it. This Venom is very different from the regular Marvel Universe's Venom. This story is basically a shortened version of a story that marvel did in more than 100 or so issues! Its still a good story, plus it has Ultimate Shocker and Ultimate Nick Fury! I hope this helped you in making your decision on getting this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"love it!!!!!!!","review":"venom is like,my favorite spidey villan,so i expected this to be a great comic. and it certainly delivers!from spidey finding his childhood friend,to spidey wearing the suit,and finally eddie getting the venom suit.it has great artwork(as always)depicts venom very well.it also shows how peter trys to pick up his fallen relationship with mj.i think that any spidey fan would love this comic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"FUN BOOK....REAL WITCHCRAFT!!!","review":"IT seems i seem to like every book that wiccian purists hate!!!! this is a really fun read!!!! but lets start with the bad.

The spells in this book are useless to anyone who practices the rede of \\"Harm none\\". Also I have big problems with anyone who makes statements like \\"these spells will be ineffective if you don't use ALL of the herbs listed\\". Give me a break!

Don't give to students!","review":"This book is not *completely* useless, but I've got to say it's the worst one on Pagan and magickal practice I own. There are a few good recipes and a few mildly useful spells and lists, but then there's far too much inaccuracy, some really lousy and dangerous magickal ethics and several laughably bad attempts at high magickal language. The worst and funniest--I laughed off and on for the rest of the week--is a spell to call wind . It's very impressive-looking in a Ceremonial-Magick-tinged kind of way, and might even work....except it calls ALL FOUR CARDINAL WINDS AT ONCE.

Coupling his great equine skill and understanding with an obviously skilful pen, Mark Rashid has produced a wonderful book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hokey stories starring an unbecomingly self-satisfied author","review":"There are two things that make this book a surprising disappointment. One may not be a problem for everyone, though I find it annoying and unattractive, ie, the repetitive and slightly self-important harping on 'giving a breed a chance' and 'being gentle.' For some, that makes it a crossover, feel-good book with links to human relationships. For me, PW got it right with this line: \\"reiterates these two themes ad nauseam, illustrating them in long-winded and meandering anecdotes.\\"But the other problem is that it's very poorly written. Rashid, who probably has a thousand great stories, needed a good editor who could have cleaned up and sharpened his material."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"This bbook is a lot of fun to read.

The other Richard Scarry books we own have the worm and bug hiding out here and there, but this is the only one that I've found, so far, that has the \\"where's gold bug\\" consistenly throughout.

I'm talking about she loved this book so much that she drew on every page and then started tearing out the pages and sleeping with them under her pillow.I give this book two stars because I hate it, and I'm the one who gets stuck reading it to her. I can't stand the stupid cars that look like a pickle, etc. This is why I hate Richard Scarry books. He didn't have a lot of great ideas. He just had a great publisher. I remember loving these books when I was a kid, too, but it was really like an addiction. Richard Scarry books are like junk food."},{"rating":"2","title":"You can't go wrong with a Richard Scarry Book","review":"Wonderful book. The drawings are fabulous and the story line is engaging. The pig family get into all kinds of trouble as they make their way by car to a picnic. All the wonderful transportation vehicles get involved in the mayhem as they travel along...fire engines, tow trucks, buses and many silly cars as well...like the pickle car. My grandson (21 months) LOVES the book and loves pointing out all the vehicles as we turn each page. I love the fact that you can make up your own story as you go along as well. It's also fun for my grandson to search for the different Scarry characters that are always in his books.My own children (4 boys) had Richard Scarry books...and I saved them all these years and now read them to my grandson. Cars and Trucks and Things that Go was not in our original repertoire, so I purchased it... and as usual...the book didn't disappoint."},{"rating":"2","title":"An All-Time Favorite","review":"This is probably my favorite book from my childhood. I spent many hours enjoying the adventures of the Pickles Pig, his family, Dingo Dog, Officer Flossy and Goldbug. The mix of real vehicles and absurd creations made the experience both educational and fun. I bought this copy for my nephew's first Christmas in 2009, and I plan to pass on my copy (duct-taped binding and all) to my son once he's old enough to look at books without ripping out the pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"We read this book together almost every day.","review":"This is my two year old son's most requested book, with Scarry's \\"Best Word Book Ever\\" coming in a close second. He loves pointing out new details in the pictures and asking the names for everything!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of the best","review":"My 3 kids could look at this book every night. It was the first Richard Scarry we bought and loved to death. They can't get enough of looking for Goldbug. I recently bought The Best StoryBook Ever and they love that as well. Brings back memories, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"richard scarry children's author","review":"Many creative vehicles are a great way to discuss transportation possibilities with very young boys, and I suppose girls, but my boys needed more persuasion to sit and develop an interest in books with Grandma.I loved it, too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cars and Trucks and Things That Go","review":"My grandson and I have spent hours pouring over the pages of this bookwhich contains wonderful images of every type of vehicle, both real andimagined. The pages have provided opportunities for reading, counting,dreaming, laughing and what could be better for a 3 1/2 year old andhis grandmother to share? I urge you to purchase this wonderful bookfilled with magical visions to tempt a new reader to spend time with abook - a treasure at any price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cars and Trucks and Things That Go","review":"My children loved this book back in the 70's and now they are requesting it for their children. I'm a preschool teacher and this book keeps children attention for a long time. The childrenhurry to get to that book first during silent reading time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eternal delight","review":"You will be asked to read this every night. Your child will sleep with it, and bring it out to breakfast. The hardcover binding thankfully is up to repeated page-turning by a toddler, and the printing is vibrant and clear. I prefer \\"What Do People Do All Day\\" as it tells more stories, but who can tell a three-year-old!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My son loves this book!","review":"\\"Where is Goldbug?\\" My 2 year old son loves to find GoldBug on every page. He's happy now just looking at the different vehicles. As he gets older I am sure he'll love the story too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Passing Richard Scarry on to the next generation...","review":"I loved Richard Scarry books when I was an older sister looking for library books for my younger siblings--the stories and recurring characters were fun, but the most fun was looking for the little jokes scattered throughout the book...the appearances of Lowly Worm or Bugdozer in the margins of pictures, the mix of fanciful (the alligator mobile) with the mundane cars on the same street. It's a book that can be read aloud for the main story, or provide hours of fun looking at the pictures for all the details. I got this particular Richard Scarry book for my 2 year old nephew as he is a big fan of all \\"things taht go\\" and my sister told me that it was an extra big hit, since he had previously had a copy of the book that was destroyed in an unfortunate book tearing incident, and he was overjoyed to have a new copy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Richard Scarry's Cars & Trrucks & Things That Go","review":"Wonderful book!

It came in great condition and the delivery was speedy too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite book","review":"This was my favorite book as a child and now it is my 4-year-old son's favorite book. It is neat to see all the different imaginative vehicles. We only sometimes read the actual story. The real thrill of this book is to find Goldbug on each page. Where is he hiding! Appeals to a wide range of ages because even small kids like to look at the pictures and find Goldbug. Whereas older kids enjoy the story more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Probably the best Richard Scarry book ever for little boys","review":"This was my favorite Richard Scarry book when I was young, and I still love it today. It is so creatively done and has so many engaging illustrations."},{"rating":"2","title":"My 2 year-olds favorite book","review":"My 2 year-old got this book as a birthday gift almost 5 months ago and he still asks us to read it 5 or more times per week. Every page has so many things to look at and talk about. We have new versions of the story quite often keeping the reader/parent interested too. There is a little bug hidden on every page that my kiddo loves to find and even after all these readings it still holds his interest. We love it and can't wait to get more Richard Scarry books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Child's Book for Any Generation","review":"My son (born in 1977) loved looking for Goldbug in this book when he was a toddler.

You can listen to it start to finish and not skip a track! The entire cd demonstrates some of the best guitar work Ive ever heard and the tracks have got a great sound. Very catchy lyric that actually carry some feeling, something a lot of music today had been lacking. Some of my favorites are Sweetbird, October .... what I'm talking bout I love of em' all! Go out and get this CD, you CANT be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"For the Beginner","review":"There are many introductory works that survey Buddhist beliefs and history, just like this one (and I've reviewed a number of them), so content-wise this one is not unique. Its explanations are concise and aimed clearly at the general reader, which will make some of it seem a bit simplistic to a more knowledgeable person. What makes it stand out, however, is that, of all the introductions, this one makes one of the nicest to give as a gift to someone curious about your own interest in Buddhism. The text is not over-whelming and is broken up by nearly seventy black and white illustrations of Buddhist art and life, making it a non-threatening read. While it may not be the best introduction, it may be one of the better for other practical needs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not satisfied.","review":"The handle on this cleaning rod is free-floating.

If I put the anteana for the house high enough towards the ceiling, I don't even have to be near a window. Great buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over Promise-Under Deliver","review":"This unit is well designed and easy to use. There is only one problem - it just doesn't work; the reception is a major issue. Unless you are in a dense urban market, where there is an overabundance of satellite signal presence, you will be dissapointed with this product. In addition, you would think that for $350, XM could include a retractable antenna, rather than the cumbersome and unsightly clip on antenna. This is a prime example of a product that had great opportunity but failed to deliver on its most basic value proposition --portability."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great until it needs repair","review":"Greatly enjoyed my Delphi XM2go portable for 15 months until the earphone recepticle in the radio became intermittent. Spent lots of time searching, and I have yet to find someone who will repair it. I give Delphi an \\"A\\" for design and functionality, and an \\"F\\" for customer support. Never again will I buy a Delphi product."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's Great!! If/when it works.","review":"It has been less than nine months since I have been using my Delphi. I am now on my third unit. The first two units just completely stopped working for no apparent reason.After the 2nd time, Delphi tried to tell me it was installed wrong and that was the issue. Then how has it been working at all? I am now having it replaced yet again.Based on this experience, I plan to resell my new radio and purchase a Pioneer."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this thing","review":"It would have been 5 stars except the personal antenna is awful. I bought a different personal antenna from the XM Fan Store and it works great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Truly \\"Mobile\\" just yet.","review":"I thought this would be the ultimate Radio finally they have a portable version. I thought wrong, sure its portable it will go from the car into the house using the home dock and Antenna (if placed in a window) it works just fine. If you where planning to purchase this item to listen to at the gym or on a walk \\"outside\\" even the mobile antenna (included) and not internal as it should be will fade in and out. Sometimes if you are standing in place pointing the antenna at the sun while hold your leg just right you may get a good signal for as long as you can hold that position. Don't believe the hype the MyFi is still not truly mobile yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor reception","review":"I returned mine after one day of use. If you intend to use the MyFi as a portable satellite radio receiver (as opposed to listening to recorded content) while you walk/run around your neighborhood, you can expect very poor reception (i.e., more than 50% drop-outs). It was very frustrating and the external antenna had no perceivable effect.I live in a suburb of a major city (Boston), by the way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love It !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I purchased this unit from another supplier, but I buy items from Amazon all the time. I am overly pleased with the adaptability of this unit, I'm using it in my car, my truck, my boat, my home, and as a \\"Walkman\\" type personal radio, we use it at work, it is the most adaptable radio I have ever seen. I do however have one complaint, it doesn't concern the radio itself, but the satellite service XM. They do not offer premium channels any longer. As long as the radio has a clear view of the southern sky, it receives its signal, I have satellite television at home and during inclement weather my signals are interupted, not with this radio, however I drive through rain and cloudy days with uninterupted service, I only loose service temporarily when the unit is blocked from it southern reception. Great unit, love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Unit....but 2nd generation will be better","review":"I was quite impressed with the deal I got. After mail in rebate it was only $89.99! There was no shipping either but shipping was slow. Amazon stated it would be shipped within 24 hrs, but it took 2 weeks to ship. Don't pick free shipping. Otherwise a great little unit for the price but don't pay retail for it anywhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too fragile!","review":"I bought this radio as a gift for my boyfriend. We were very excited once we got it activated. That same day, we were using it in the car when it fell off the seat and onto the rubber floormat inches below.The display cracked, and now I have to go through the hassle of returning the product for (hopefully a full) refund.For a product that's supposed to be \\"portable\\", I don't understand how it could be so fragile.For those of you who've already bought one, be careful not to drop it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality, can't see screen in bright envirnment.","review":"I have had this for a little over a year and now the unit is turning on and off for some reason. Called Delphi not much help. Put in a new battery and reset all the setting to default and it is still doing it. Also you can not read the screen in the car on a bright day. I would never recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Growing pains","review":"Like much new technology, when it works, it's a dream, but there are also frustrations. The portable xm radio encounters dead spots in which it can't receive signals from the satellite. This doesn't happen with my car xm radio, but it happens frequently with my xm portable. Short of wearing a car antennae atop my head, I'm not sure what the solution is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rushed to market, horrible product unworthy as a doorstop","review":"My unit was returned immediately, the MiFi is absolutely horrible. This unit was advertised as a \\"walkman-like\\" device (for use jogging, backyard, in open areas, etc.), nothing could be further from the truth. The MiFi is plagued with the most horrific reception one can possibly imagine, even with a clear view of the sky. Circuit City review board is jammed with comments on this unit to the effect that over half are not only disgusted with sound and very poor reception but burned the rubber on their tires to return the unit to the retail for full refund.Quite honestly, it has been a very long time indeed since I've owned such a poor electronic device. This product was quickly rushed to market, the most profane aspect of the MiFi is that its central function is billed as a walkman-like device, but it does NOT work as such a device, even with external antennas connected. If you buy this unit, I absolutely promise you will regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"angry","review":"this item is horrible. it gets no reception. its not portable and doesn't work in my car. also you can't return it to amazon! they say it can.t be returned because it is hazardous - how come they areable to stock and ship it then if it is hazardous. they say to return it to delphi but delphi says they don't take returns. now i guess i'm stuck with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spotty Reception in Urban Settings","review":"1.

The product is a little too big to use for running, I'm going back to using my SONY armband radio."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for college students and others wanting variety","review":"I have to say I was on a mp3 player kick for too long. I ended up researching my options and have to say I made the right decision. First off, I like variety of new music and paying $1 per song or about $10 for the cd just didn't seem like something I wanted to do. I researched the myfi and realized I get 5 hrs of recording time, so I thought perfect for those dead spots when I cannot access the satellite radio. I like the fact it has portible capabilities and I can take it anywhere. I diffently think its the best bang for the buck and would recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"This product is to experimental to be sold","review":"I thought this product would be a great device to add to my daily 4 mile walk. Was I wrong; reception was terrible. I spent most of my time aiming the antenna all over the place, trying to keep it working. The way it was advertised I believed it would truly be portable. It is heavy and awkward with all the wires hanging all over. A company should perfect a product before they release it for sale. We have an XM radio in our SUV and it works on our road. We also get XM online service and its reception is flawless. But this product isn't worth the packaging its wrapped in."},{"rating":"1","title":"UNIT FAILS EARLY","review":"When it is working, it works fine. But 1 year and 3 mos. after I started using it, it failed. It would play for a couple minutes and then the screen would go blank. I would power down and power up again, then it would work for a few minutes and then repeat the cycle. I called Delphi and they would not fix it under warranty then I called XM and they only offered a different unit which was unappealing to me for $29.Based on my experince, I would HIGHLY reccomend getting a different receiver if you want it to last for more than 15 mos.Additionally, the power button was difficult to use while the unit was working. This unfortunate incident is to be my first and last experiece with Delphi electonics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great","review":"I am over all very disappointed with this unit. Car reception is very spotty even traveling down major corridors in the SF Bay Area. Walking around is worse no matter what you do with the antenna. The talk shows are so heavily compressed they sound like they are using a cup and string to talk to you. The music stations do not sound as good as FM radio, which I was terribly disappointed to discover. Friends who have the more standard home/car XM units think they are great. This one suffers from very poor engineering. It goes up on eBay tomorrow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Reliable Connection in Auto","review":"I only use in my auto. I've had it for ten months and, since inception, it would intermittantly lose its connection. Now it's always searching for the antennae. Spend a little more $$ and purchase or upgrade the receiver."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Do It !!!","review":"This is the one gift that I asked for at Christmas. Now I have just brought it back to the store and feel great that I did so. It could be a great product and the whole idea of it is great, but there is no reception for me ever. This was one square foot in the house where it came in and whenever I so much as drove past a building (I live in the city) it would drop. I am going to warn you now, it's not worth trying out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware battery is defective","review":"Battery comes defective and you have to register the unit to get a replacment.

Well after it took three reset attempts to get it working. I got NONE to Very Little reception! None @ Home . Had to be upstairs by the window at the Gym...even then it really didn't work. I even took it to work to see if i could record from the radio...Guess what NO RECEPTION!!!I was VERY upset that i had spent 350.00 on some thing that was not working at all. Besides that the size is not that portable.It is kindove bulky and does not travel well attached to your clothing.On a happier note when i recieved stations at all ...they were great! I loved them all!.I just think that XM has a little work to do and i am sure that a newer better more receptive device will be out soon. I wil probably be one of the first in line to try it. Mi-fi is a great idea...just has a few glitches."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very small complaint","review":"I really like the Delphi MyFi.

Not really a portable (see earlier reviews about standing on one leg & pointing toward the sun), hard to see & use buttons, non-intuitive and BTW: worked for one day & then \\"lost\\" installation signal! When I called support, I was told \\"they have no tech people\\", and the people who answer their phones are (maybe) familiar with the service but not the radio! A product produced before it's time. I am fairly \\"techie\\", (have been working on computers for 40 years), and this is one of the MOST FRUSTRATING pieces of equipment I have ever seen!

I'm a public transit commuter and will listen to a prerecorded program while commuting on the train and baseball games at all other times! It's great - a much better value than satellite tv (which I don't have) with much of the same content. The unit is easy to use and carry fits in my coat pocket. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great until it breaks down","review":"Like a couple other reviews, I loved mine until it broke. Returned it under warranty and the second one lasted also only about 13 months and dark screen after a few minutes of play time (with a new battery).

This is the best XM receiver there is-when it works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Unit! Almost perfect.","review":"I bought my first unit 4 years ago and used it heavily. The only part that fell apart was the bottom of the unit where you dock it to charge at home or in the car. So I bought a replacement unit and hope I will not have the same problem. There is the occasional signal fade in and out, depending where you're at. The battery needs to be changed every year of so depending on use. But overall I highly recommend this unit if you love commercial free and different types of music as I do at home, in the car or at the gym."},{"rating":"1","title":"Delphi, XM2GO","review":"The instructions say you must face the antenna south, that would be impossible in my apartment, no window faces south, I guess that is the direction the satellite is.Best I could do was face east, did not work at all, went up to window facing east and did get some spotty reception, all and all this is not a workable product, not because it is poorly made or anything like that, just that its very nature makes it for myself or too many other people not viable product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great and even worse service","review":"It was ok on a clear day outside.

It never after the first week worked off the cradle (bad battery? On a new unit?). The unit keypad stopped working completely after a couple of weeks. In order to use this \\"portable\\", I have to have it cradled and use the remote--otherwise, I cannot use it away from home.I'm frustrated enough to buy a new (different brand) unit, but first I'll make an attempt to get Delphi to stand by their product and replace it.

It's not perfect but I haven't had the reliability issues of some of the writers. I had it semi-permenantly mounted to my car's dash. The cradle is attached to a beacket attached to my dash. So I can remove it to hide it or use it at home. I hardly listen to anything else but XM now, but that's a review of the service not the unit. The faults I find with the unit itself are:It's display is hard to see under many conditions.The buttons are small and not intuitive.It sometimes reverts to channel 1 on power-up.Overall I'm happy, but it could have been a better design. I guess I'm lucky mine works!"},{"rating":"2","title":"That 5 hour recording feature is there for a reason!","review":"With an ipod, I would have to take the time to download songs and pay $1 a piece. That was getting expensive. With the xm2go reciever, I just plug it in at home at night, schedule recordings, and I have a selection of songs to listen to the next day. If you want to listen to live broadcasts, that built antenna really didn't work at all for me. Only got reception 50% of the time outdoors, and none indoors even near a window. The home & car kits worked great tho."},{"rating":"2","title":"XM2go","review":"This is my 2nd XM2go radio, first one wore out after 6 years of constant use carrying on my belt while walking.

It does have 5 hours of memory for those times in my walk when South is blocked."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get an extended warranty!","review":"My Delphi MyFi just lost the display after a year and a half of use. It still plays fine, but it's tough to find a channel without a display. I called Delphi, but because it is out of warranty, I'm out of luck! They don't even HAVE a repair process for devices out of warranty. So I've got a brick now.It's a great device, fits nice in your hand, reception is good here in the suburbs of Chicago, battery lasts a good long while, the xm2go feature is easy to use. All good features.But, like a cell phone, once the warranty is over -- if it breaks, throw it away! :-("},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT PURCHASE THIS ITEM!","review":"I have been surprised and dismayed by the XM MyFi. One fairly critical piece of information left out of all materials is the fact that the antenna HAS TO FACE SOUTH IN ORDER TO OBTAIN ANY SIGNAL WHATSOEVER. Thankfully, the happy folks at XM Technical Support offered this encouragement when I noted that my office and home face north -- \\"You can still use it outside.\\" Thanks. That might still be moderately helpful if the portable XM really worked well. Instead, you have to work into just the right position, like a sad, contorted scarecrow, in order to get a passable signal. Here I am, wired like a demented robot with an earphone cord as well as (another thing they hesitate to mention) antenna cord pinned to me, and if I move (Lord forbid that you move with the music), the signal cracks and disappears.This product was introduced long before XM had the technology to support it. Odd that AM radio (and possibly even ham radio) are starting to look better all the time. Hmmm."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I can give it a good rating","review":"XM2go is a great concept but it is flawed by quality issues and design nuances.Unable to delete one song at a time. Where did they go wrong with that?Poor disk management. After 5 hours it writes over the 1st song in queue. So keep an eye on your recording time.Unable to cycle through channels with a pushbutton on front like the older XM unit I had. You must use the thumbwheel.It locks up and audio drops out. I think I have a lemon because it froze and I had to remove the battery to get it to \\"work\\" again. This happened numerous times and my anger was getting intense as I am listening to a \\"recorded\\" song and the unit freezesOverall...Dissatisfaction! Avoid this one and wait for better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Portable XM radio","review":"There are WAY too many accessories, cords, attachments for this device. When using it out in the open, I have reception problems even when I am in a totally clear space. I have also had trouble locating headphones with the antenna built in that fit it. I do use it sucessfully in the car - but there is a base, and the unit, and the antenna and the cord to plug it into the car lighter - just way too many cords. Same thing for in the house, and even though there is a \\"bigger\\" antenna - I have tried positioning it in EVERY window in my house and have been unable to obtain a signal anywhere. It's a good idea, but I don't think the technology for receiving the signal is at the level it needs to be in order for it to be a true portable device."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Product, Bad Service","review":"I have had a MyFi every since it first came out. It's a great product. It has the ability to record up to five hours of programming.My only major problem is that XM has increased their commercial time little by little every month. Now on most stations, there are 4 or more commercials per hour. This is unacceptable for a subscription based radio service that advertises itself as having the most commercial-free stations.Sirius does not have as many commercials. Go with a Sirius product such as the S50."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Battery","review":"I got my Dlphi MyFi for a Christmas present. I signed up for a one-year subscription. After I signed up I was told not to use the battery that came with the radio because it might explode! That defeats the purpose of the radio for me. I want to use it when I am on my bicycle or motorcycle. For that I need the battery! It's been almost a month and I am still waiting on a replacement battery. The satellite radio works fine but I need a battery! I feel like I have wasted a month of my subscription. So far Dlphi has been unresponsive."},{"rating":"1","title":"2nd MyFi down","review":"The second MyFi has lost its number-pad so that only the scroll can be used to dial the stations. The thing is heavy, chunky, fragile and when you record (two segments only can be programmed), playback is limited to the beginning of each segment as XM buys it, so you can't go half-way into an hour-long show if you leave it, but have to listen to the whole thing again. Insult to injury is the dust that blows into the screen, so forevermore the sun on your screen reveals the build-up.

I took a one mile walk and had reception for about 10 seconds. Sure, it comes with an external antenna that you hook to your hat or shirt but who wants to go jogging with a mass of cords or lay by the pool and fool around with trying to get a signal. My advice is wait for the size and price to go down by half, wait for a built in antenna that works, and in the meantime get yourself an IPOD. This is by no means XM to go."},{"rating":"2","title":"MyFi can meet your needs if you know in advance how you'll use it","review":"Purchased in July, 2006, the MyFi seems like good deal since it is last year's technology and is priced to move before completely outdated.Likes:Style, size, car and home adapters included, easy to navigate, good battery lifeDislikes: Inability to edit what you've recorded. In this day & age, this is NOT a technical difficulty, so this limitation is either due to Delphi laziness or RIAA rules - both of which are inexcusabile. Also, portable reception is worse than I had hoped. Without any external antenna, I never get a consistent signal, even in the middle of an open field. Works fine with an antenna, but I wanted more portability.Overall, I'd buy it again, and will add a portable antenna to get reception while on the go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never Listen To Local Radio Again.","review":"I became an XM Satellite Radio subscriber in December 2003. I almost never listen to local radio since getting XM. I have both the SkyFi and this portable XM, the MyFi. The SkyFi is in my car and is almost perfect. The Myfi is great too. My only negative comment regarding the Myfi is the inability to really use it indoors for live shows. But I can record 5 hours worth of programming on it, so long flights or trips go really fast. I just recorded 5-hours of '70's music for an upcoming flight from St. Louis to Las Vegas, and that will certainly keep me entertained on the trip. The audio quality is top notch. XM has exclusive programming like major league baseball. I sat on the beach last summer in Hilton Head and listened to games from Chicago & New York. The audio was perfect. I would recommend new buyers get the Skyfi first, along with a boom box for indoor use. The Myfi would be a great second satellite radio."},{"rating":"2","title":"XM Radio","review":"Very sensitive and well packaged receiver.

Then a burglar helpfully removed it from my home, and I replaced it with a Roady2, a less expensive, less attractive device that still got XM.Reasons I still feel I traded \\"up\\":-- The reception in the Delphi MyFi XM2GO is inferior. Unless the conditions were exactly right, I had trouble getting the signal.-- The keypad is obnoxious and strange. Yes, it looks cool. I do not buy radios to look at, I buy them to listen to. This keypad is difficult to use unless you look right at the thing when you use it.-- It's heavier than other models, annoying in a portable device.So \\"thank you\\" to the burglar (whoever bought it at a great price from the fence got what he/she deserved) and I suggest at the very least that you try this radio before you buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product, but can't wait for 2nd generation","review":"This thing finally makes XM worthwhile, usable, lovable, listenable, and so on and so on....

I have also not tried it in my car yet. If you are planning on carrying this with you when you walk around, you must have music recorded. You cannot listen to it live even with the portable antenna cliped to your shirt.

Especially on the songs from Quadrophenia. Roger and Pete did their best on songs like \\"Sea And Sand\\" and \\"5:15\\". However, without John's bass, you could tell something was missing. His background vocals are missed as well, especially on \\"Another Tricky Day\\". Pete's voice was a little weak on that one. I could hardly hear any bass in any of the songs. It's almost as if they don't have a bass player. Roger as usual was awesome. The guy never ages! And, his voice keeps getting better! I would suggest buying this DVD to add to your Who collection because they do have few songs on there that aren't on their other live DVD's.

The opening sequence of the movie is so horrible that I just knew it would be a complete waste of my time if I continued to watch such garbage.

Now, seriously, for a film that is supposed to be highly performance based you'd think they would have good actors. Nope. Not here. Every scene drags on endlessly and the actors obviously have no idea who it is that they are portraying. I would expect Lionel Dahmer to be represented as more than just a fat putz that goes \\"What?

I am was anting to see what was going through the mind of the family at the time frame. This movie should be tossed in the trash because that is all it is. what i saw int his movie..Lionel should be arrested also. he was a lousy father and he knew what Jeffery was doing. The acting is terrible in the movie. Very low budget looking. Another thing I didn't like they actind like Jefferys mom was dead. They really didn't explain much about her.

The storyline was cool, but certain things were just too cheesy. For one, look at Christopher Lee's hair in this one. It doesn't have that neat, slicked back look anymore. It bulges on the sides. Secondly, everytime he has one of the three men murdered that killed his servant, he counts it off. Like when the first one dies, he says, \\"the first.\\" I began to suspect that he would say \\"the second\\" when next one died, and unfortunately, I was correct. And what's this at the end when he resorts to throwing things at the people who are trying to get rid oh him? This was the biggest disappointment of the movie. Dracula is superhuman, and you see that in Prince of Darkness when he breaks a sword in half with his bare hands. Yet, he is now reduced to chunking whatever he can pick up to defend himself.

Especially one with a notorious psychopathic personality disorder like the Count. He's hardly likely to put himself in harm's way for yet another rubbish servant, is he? He didn't exactly give a monkey's when Clove got shot in 'Dracula, Prince of Darkness'. Instead he shrugged his shoulders and went swimming. Admittedly fully clothed, but with the help gone you're not used to being self sufficient. Anyway, I think he'd be more likely to offer the three gentlemen in question employment. If they can kill his servant then they must be pretty handy acolytes. The rich are not like you or me, they think differently.

A haunting score compliments their understated performances, brilliantly set in south China. Their story unfolds, a story of a faithless bride, caught by her husband and forced to follow him to a cholera outbreak, and ultimately, the restoration of their relationship to a level far deeper than ever before.The tensions in the air are beautiful, and the development and growth in the characters are refreshing.

And all of this is beautifully done. What is missing is life, elan. Some activity would have been nice. Once, the good doctor confronts his wife about her infidelity, nothing much takes place. Yes, there's a cholera epidemic in the midst of some of the most stunning scenery on earth. Yes, two previously irreconcilable spouses, probably never in love in the first place, somehow find each other as well as a mutual purpose in life, and should go on to spend a fulfilling life together.The problem seems to lie within the screenplay, which is curiously flat, devoid of emotion. This film simply fails to draw the viewer in.

It is a romantic drama depicting the story of a marriage conceived for convenience that evolves into one of love despite major setbacks along the way. The background for this marital evolution is a life of volunteerism in a disease stricken region of China.

Walter discovers Kitty's affair with a diplomat, Charles Townsend (Liev Shreiber); Walter then will force Kitty to come with her to a remote village ravaged by cholera.He is very much in love with her, but it is not reciprocal. After the affair is discovered, their relationship soon becomes cold, and indifferent.This is a movie about love lost and love earned - the director showed this well, the script was decent enough and believable, still a little too predictable for my taste.

The novels and short stories written by Somerset Maugham (1874-1965) are little jewels of sensibility that are not so easily adaptable for the cinema medium.

The setting is the Chinese countryside in the 1920's during a cholera epidemic. Walter is a bacteriologist who is fighting the epidemic while Kitty is isolated and very bored at home. The issue between them is infidelity and it takes a lot of maturing on both of their parts to face it.

I honestly thought that since I read so many good reviews of this film, it's going to pick up soon. But it never did. Honestly, the only good thing about this movie was the scenery and acting. That's it. The storyline seemed good, but, was this movie a bore! It lasted roughly two hours, but it seemed like a good five. I was wondering when the heck this movie was going to end. It was so long and drawn out. The entire movie was dialogue. That's it. There was no action whatsoever.

The only thing requiring assembly is taking the round plastic disc and sticking in on the bottom of the pole by pulling off the rubber cushion on the tip. The same cushion you pull off to jam it in the ground to take pictures. To mount your camera you just unscrew the ball on top the pole. All very easy to do. The telescoping pole is easy to change heights by twisting the sections and pulling. All-in-all a great hiking pole.

I'm big into self-discovery and learning about how psychothereapy works these days, and certainly understanding the role that cherishment (or lack thereof) plays in the individual and in society at large sounds valuable and interesting, but the authors make you work too hard for too little.

Today I tossed it across the room in disgust. Mr. Bryson's bias for things English and against things American once again rears it's ugly head. If he ever gets over this malady he would have something useful to say. Circumlocution, as Ambrose Bierce said, is a literary trick whereby the writer who has nothing to say breaks it gently to the reader. Mr. Bryson has added nothing of value with this book. Everything he had to say on the topic was in Mother Tongue. If you have any interest in this area stick with Mother Tongue, it's the much better choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"A trivia book that tries to pretend it is a history lesson","review":"Bill Bryson once again writes a book that is supposed to be funny but just isn't. In Made in America he apparently tries take selected historical events in American History and then dig for any negative information about it that he can find. The only person he had anything good to say about was Benjamin Franklin.There are a few slightly amusing facts about word origins and advertising. But for the most part it is just a bunch of negative trivia."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made in America","review":"I am so sorry I hadn't taken the time to read the customer's reviews of Made in America and The Lost Continent, prior to buying them.

Bill Bryson turns his well-known ability at writing humor and travel literature, and applies with ease toward the English language. Neither this, nor his other work \\"The Mother Tongue\\", should be missed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bryson as usual","review":"As usual, Bill Bryson is informative, witty, and brilliant in his relaying of this history of the United States. I had to dock him a star in the ratings this time out because this is billed, based on the title, as a history of the English language in America. It is more appropriately described as a brief history of America and its culture, with some occasional attention to the language. Since I bought it due to a recent interest in word origins, I was mildly (and only mildly) disappointed at the lesser degree of attention paid to etymology. However, since I've read most of Bryson's other books and can't get enough of his writing style and his no-nonsense approach to fact-finding, and since many of the stories he relates really are quite fascinating, the book is still a very welcome addition to my library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read","review":"As a non American I found it a good introduction to one of the world's great cultures.

Worse, you may find yourself imitating his style, making snarky comments that get you in trouble. A sample: Bill seated himself in a restaurant, despite a sign saying, \\"Wait to be seated.\\" When the waitress commented sourly, \\"Well, I see you seated yourself,\\" he replied brightly, \\"Yes!

Chesbro has provided me much entertainment over the years. I had never heard of Chant until I finally secured a copy of \\"Dark Chant in a Crimson Key.\\" Chant quickly became my favorite character(sorry Mongo fans). This adventure relives Chant's Vietnam experience and brings it to the present. There are typical (by Chesbro's standard) ninja fights and themes of love, sex and their ability to create and destroy. What bothered me is that this reissue does not have an introduction by the author. Amazon comments offer more than the somewhat pricey (but high quality) text does. I am more than happy to give Chesbro some money since I have been borrowing copies of his works and picking up used ones and I think the work is worth every penny but I wish there was something more than just the reissue. Mongo fans will love the \\"Chant\\" series. I hope Chesbro continues with this series. Chesbro fans are welcome to comment."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is my favorite Helen Kirkman book","review":"Helen Kirkman is in my opinion, fabulous. Her writing style is what some call 'stream of consciousness' which is a flow from inside the character like a very deep point of view. I found it to be very unique and a really new way to enjoy a great Romance. She has an excellent handle on the era and I have even gone back and ordered her books that are no longer in print.This is my absolute favourite of here books. The sensitive way she brings us into the minds and hearts of the characters and the bond that heals them is poetically beautiful."},{"rating":"1","title":"good hero, but hard-to-read-style","review":"I liked the historical setting, and the hero was likeable. The main problem I had with this book is the style. In scenes between the two main characters there is too much description, mostly problematic because it's describing the same thing every time! I already KNOW that's how the heroine feels! Let me know when she feels differently!Then when you get to the battle scene, there is an inverse problem: it is brushed over so briefly, there really isn't any sense of danger or tension.Gorgeous cover though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story - interesting writing style","review":"Destiny has a great story - as do Helen Kirkman's other similar novels. The battles are excellent, romance heated, and the story kept me turning the pages until the end, even tho I had an early meeting the next morning. Kirkman's writing style is different from other authors in that she mixes what is actually happening with what each character is thinking, as well as with what multiple characters are saying -- and if you aren't expecting that, it can make the reading difficult. Now that I expect it, I really enjoy the ride. I usually read it quickly for the good parts, then immediately re-read it to get all the details of the battles and mental dances. Kirkman truly understands obsession!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to follow","review":"I originally bought this because I'm a huge fan of Viking romances and the cover art was beautiful. But as I started reading, I had a hard time following. The writing style is very very choppy. It stopped and started so much I got a headache.

You can remove the shoulder strap and attach the holster to a duty belt for side carry as well (beware: with big, heavy hand cannons, make sure your pants stay up with side carry). I also purchased a Bianchi Duty belt so I can carry it at my side. I like the holster very much and the Hush system works well for silent draw."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I was disappointed by this book. With such rave reviews, this book seemed like a wonderful find. Although, as the book's story drew to a close, Ms. Shapiro's ability to \\"pull me in\\" as a reader increased, overall the story lacked depth. Her straightforward narration, and undeveloped use of tension and anticipation, made it difficult to keep reading in hopes that the story would get better. The major conflicts/events, such as Ryan's death, were simply stated, and then described, draining the potential emotional power from this pivotal part of the whole book. This was the first book by Ms. Shapiro I have read. Maybe some of her other books are better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Minimal, Dark and Disturbing","review":"Unlike some of the other reviewers I have not seen Damage, or read Josephine Hart's other books. I came to it with an open mind.It is a dark tale of a woman's obsession with her beautiful adopted older sister, and her resentment and growing hate for the beautiful, tall and lean, blond Elizabeth. The prose is precise and jagged. At time disjointed, but always beautiful.I found the description of Ruth's stealing personal items from her sister and squirreling them away and bringing them out later as fetishes when the need took her, piquantly sordid.The Lake incident was heartbreaking and I had to stop reading and compose myself. Tragedy follows tragedy and we see Ruth gradually taking on the identity of Elizabeth. Disturbing at times, eventually becoming an emotional car smash that one continues to read in utter fascination."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply,the best book that I have ever read on Baseball.","review":"Jordan's book is a vivid evocation of what it was like for him to come to terms with the failure of a promising career, while at the same time reaching maturity.His writing style is honest and his prose is, at times heartbreaking and at other times very funny.A real treat for Baseball fans and fans of quality writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good story","review":"Not a baseball book but a very good read.More of a discussion of a life experience where promise is unfulfilled.

Mr. Jordan had difficulty living with himself during this period; his ability to confront his motives led to many insights which made this book one of the most honest and insightful coming-of-age stories I've read.

It's mostly about the roots and growth of the Mafia in Sicily and too little about its origin, growth. and power in America where, during Prohibition, outlaws became kings by supplying hootch to a thirsty public. That subject, of course, has spawned books on its own, but this book could have treated the American Mafia larger than it did because how and what The American bosses - Luciano most famously - did (including their actual organization) grew directly out of their Sicialian roots.Still, for the most part, a terrific read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Educational","review":"My first mafia book. They way i see it, it provides the readers with a solid picture on what the Mafia is about.It is educational based on collective facts. Back to the basics i would call it.

It was so intense that I had to skip the part. I feel that she did not represent the characteristics of an English woman or educator during that time period."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good.","review":"I don't like the way this movie ends. It changes its point of view. At first we follow Anna's moves. And in the end, it was the Prince's 1st person monologue. I don't like it. I felt uncomfortable. It's the way of story telling is unnatural.Chow Yun-Fat's Thai is too slow. Everyone around him speaks slow Thai. I guess many of the cast are not Thai actually. A native Thai told me he couldn't comprehend what they were talking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbox does not include subtitles for the Siamese!!!","review":"I'm sure this is a great movie, but I rented it from Amazon's Unbox service. I don't speak a word of Siamese, and the Unbox version does not include any subtitles. I was unable to understand anything that did not involve someone talking to Anna - for instance, the situation with the traitor and whatever happened with the concubine. All I can say is that I am CERTAIN that I missed most of the movie because of this. I have requested a refund from Amazon and do not recommend that anyone rent this from Amazon Unbox. I don't know if their purchased videos include the proper subtitles, but the response I got from customer service was that Unbox does not support subtitles, so it's probably missing them too. What a disappointment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I bought this DVD some years ago, because I like Jodi Foster and I loved The King and I. It was a mistake. Jodi showed no spirit in this film and she acted as though she wished it were over as soon as it started. Either she was directed badly or she was just not right for the film.Not much else to say. After seeing The King and I with it's beautiful music and great acting, all I can say is that I fell asleep watching this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Miscast","review":"This movie was a disappointment. The King and I is one of my favorite movies, so I really looked forward to seeing Anna and the King. Although I like Jodie Foster as an actress and have enjoyed many of her movies, this one fell flat. No chemistry between her and the King. Zero chemistry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring spectacle/dull romance.","review":"This is the fifth incarnation of this story (three have been produced within the last few years - the first two being truly dreadful animated films) and for the life of me I can't understand why film makers think this story so fascinating they have to cram endless versions into our gullets. Of the three live action versions this is the least satisfying. There is no tension between our protagonists - they get along famously from the start. We are subjected to two and a half hours of boredom amid lush photography and deservedly Academy Award nominated Art Direction and Costume Design. This is one where you go out humming the sets. Stick with the original Dunne/Harrison version of the classic R&H version with Kerr/Brynner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth owning on DVD","review":"I'm not a movie buff nor do i collect dvd's but i thought this one was particularly worth owning. I don't understand why so many critics panned the film for being dull or too long. I was totally absorbed and enjoyed every minute of the 2-1/2 hours.The cinematography and production design was amazing -- especially in light of the fact that they were not allowed to film in Thailand but had to recreate the palace and its surroundings from scratch. Just absolutely visually stunning.I also disagree with critics about the lack of chemistry between the leads. I thought there was plenty - maybe more of an intellectual nature than a physical one perhaps.Chow Yun Fat has such a strong screen presence - definitely holding his own against Jody Foster's intense yet restrained performance."},{"rating":"2","title":"It keeps on getting better","review":"Everytime I watch this movie, I'm awestruck at the beauty and wonder of it. From the scenery, to the drama, to the love story, and finally and most of all, to the music, I'm drawn to watch it over and over again. So much of the dialogue between the King and Anna points to moments in my life that makes me want to return to the time and place over and over. I loved \\"The King and I\\" with Deborah Kerr and Yul Brenner, but this story is so much richer without all the music and allows you to see into the souls of each character. This story is for all of us who ever had to give up the true love of our lives."},{"rating":"2","title":"watched it 5 times!","review":"Received this dvd timely. This is now my new favorite movie.

Chow Yun Fat doesn't even look Thai."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't know why many people gave it 5 stars","review":"I didn't even watch the whole movie because it hurt to watch Jodie punched a blow of disrespect to someone of higher status (the royal family). If you have any respect for your elders, your grandparents, and especially royalty, please don't watch this film.This film makes it look as though Anna is of higher status than the king. It is not all that surprising since this movie was adopted from a book written in the age of Britain imperialism so the content of this book highly favoured the British. The writer of the book probably thought that she was indeed better than Thailand as did many european countries who attempted to set up colonies over the world.Recommended for those who can see past through the movie's faults."},{"rating":"1","title":"a \\"box-office failure\\" indeed","review":"What can one say about this pretty but slushy, mushy film. Hmmm..it's boring, Jodie Foster was miscast, people reacted to this film when it was released in the theatres just like Superman reacts to Kryptonite.I watched this film with an open mind; I realised that it was not the usaual action-packed Chow Yun Fat flick but this was beyond painful.."},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie was SUPERB!!!","review":"\\"Anna and The King\\" is a wonderful movie filled with heart and soul. Especially if you have watched, \\"The King and I\\" and have fallen in love with the way the king says \\"etc, etc, etc...\\", you will definitely fall in love with this movie as well.Jodie Foster looks beautiful in her English gown and Chow-Yun Fat and the rest of the crew looks absolutely brilliant in the Siamese outfits.The scenes shot in Malaysia are breath-taking and it makes you want to visit the country, itself.The search for the white elephant at the end of the movie with the kids of the king is very inspiring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic movie!","review":"I ordered this movie for my cousin for Christmas. It arrived on time & in excellent condition. The price is excellent & they enjoyed it? Ordering was easy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"If you are a fan of the original movie with Yul Brenner and Debra Kerr I think this remake will be a let down. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved It! Loves stories don't get much better than this.","review":"Ignore the critics and see for yourself what a wonderful, truly lovely story and movie this really was. Set against the backdrop of what is now Thailand, this beautiful story unfolds of star-crossed lovers whose sheer passion, respect, and admiration for each and their inability to display it makes this story all the more compelling. A must see for any true romantic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"See this Movie!","review":"This is an absolutely beautiful film - a feast for the eyes. Chow Yun-Fat is excellent and the story is lots of fun. This and the Sixth Sense were my two favorite movies of 1999!"},{"rating":"2","title":"better then the other ones","review":"I think this movie was better then the other movies that are the same thing just a little diffrent. This movie was good but Jodie Foster did not do as good in this movie as I had hopped she would not that I am a big fan of hers anyway but still."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet as opposed to sexy","review":"Jodie Foster's performances in Little Man Tate, Contact, etc. pushed me to see Anna and the King in the theater, and although I think the military aspect of the movie was not quite feasible and extremeley predictable, I thought the excellent acting, beautiful scenery, and beautiful personal story more than made up for it. (Think of movies like Twister, where the special effects make up for the poor plot-this has much more!) What a breath of fresh air to fall in with the gentle love story of this film after the sexy and uninhibited styles of so many others. This film is excellent...if the action side of it had been better, I would have given it five stars, but as is it still deserves four."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anna and the King (En Espanol)","review":"Excellent service in the process of get it and excellent quality or the product. I got it realy fast.Thanks!Federico"},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE IT!","review":"This movie has everything a good movie requires. It has a story, plot, action, good character development, excellent photography, emotion. My dad says this movie might be more true to the history of Thailand(Siam back then) than the musical. But most of you say the romance part never happened. Anyway, I love this movie. This movie is more action packed than Ever After(Another good movie from same director). The photography is superb. I first saw it when I rented it on VHS. I on the DVD version of it. I give the DVD 3&1/2 stars. The extras are okay, I like the making of Anna and the King. The music video is okay. Other than that the extras aren't all they could be. But the DVD offers the best thing it could have on it, the movie. Rent it or buy it, and Enjoy. You will not be dissapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"Jody Foster was just so terribly miscast in this. Apparently she thought acting this role was pursing up her mouth all the time. Instead of sticking to the story they threw in battles which, of course, Ms Foster helps to win. The whole thing was ridiculous. She never unbends from her starchiness at all and it gets very tiring and boring. I guess they thought a handsome king and gorgeous dresses would satisfy everybody. I read the book many years ago, have seen the original 40s movie many times and, of course, The King and I many times. This version is pathetic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good film","review":"I have the Disney version of this with Yul Brenner. Love them both. Hard to go wrong with Jodie Foster, anyway. She is brilliant - and exceptionally talented. All the actors do a great job in this. Worth every penny."},{"rating":"2","title":"not your father's King and I","review":"This was a pleasure-packed film from the opening scenery to the text at the end chronicling the changes brought about in Siam owing to the influence of Anna. The country and the people(at least those of the royal household) are absolutely beautiful. The king is one to whom it would be very easy to feel loyalty to.After seeing the movie, I feel compelled to read the history of Siam, and thus, Thailand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forbidden affection","review":"Anna and the King is a colorful and generally touching version of the English teacher's unusual relationship with the King of Siam. Chow Yun-Fat is superb and very credible as the King. Comparisons to the older version with Yul Brinner and Deborah Kerr are difficult to make, since this interpretation seems like a different story entirely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely brillant","review":"I watched this movie while flying. I found myself not sleeping on an 8-hour flight to watch this wonderful movie. Yun-Fat Chow was absolutely believable (handsome too). His performance made me want to watch more of his movies. I read some of the comments and a couple wrote about it was not true, Western viewpoint through movie, etc. This movie was about romance and something much more than did the actress maintain her accent etc. It was a touching movie without all the sex and hype that we get nowadays. I will buy this movie. It is good and you won't be disappointed if you take the time to watch it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Liam Kicks Bond and Bourne's [...]","review":"This is a classic Luc Besson film - it's got his fingerprints all over it, even if he only co-wrote and produced it. No-nonsense, gritty in-your-face action - old school torture and interrogation and subterfuge...this is the film that Quantum of Solace should have been! Make Liam Neeson James Bond please. But seriously, it's such a punchy thrill-a-minute film that it makes you almost long for a sequel. Great direction by Pierre Morel (and a million times better than the dreadful \\"Transporter\\") - the only thing better than this was probably the original Nikita. I'll say it again: SEQUEL!!The story was especially poignant because it involved family. While watching this, I also couldn't help feeling sorry for Neeson - who just lost his wife. RIP Natasha Richardson.Here's to Liam's future. Great job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Taken by Liam Neeson","review":"One of the best movies I have ever watched! I have watched it several times and would highly recommend it !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable because it's me","review":"Timing is everything as they say. Having a daughter and just becoming a new father, I saw this movie. Because of those facts, \\"Taken\\" hit a chord in my soul. I believe if I saw this movie before I had any kids, I would've rated it 3 stars. The movie is too perfect in setting up Liam Neeson's character to be sympathatic. Also, he's overly protective which crosses into obsessive paranoia. Anyway, this has got to be high on the Father's Day gift list for now. It's fun and gratifying. I've seen the non-extended cut on cable and the only difference is the extended cut has a bit more \\"oomph\\" in violence in key scenes which adds a lot to the character. Get it dad. You'll enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"run of the mill thriller that makes no sense if you watch closely. and liam neeson just isn't an action hero. sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Neeson as Comic Book Superhero?","review":"The story line doesn't come close to being plausible. The action scenes are absurdly exaggerated. It's hard to get into this film because it's so silly."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad story line","review":"Liam is an amazing actor that usually chooses roles that allow him to flex his acting muscles. This is not one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"A predictable implausible revenge flick","review":"There wasn't much new or interesting about this film. Very predictable and therefore pretty boring. Very violent. Very implausible action scenes. I'd rather watch the Bourne movies repeatedly than see this again. The plot is very thin, basically an excuse for Neeson to act out revenge fantasies. He takes on ten guys at a time and doesn't suffer a scratch. The scenes of strung-out girls forced into prostitution are disturbing, not appropriate at all for teens."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"After hearing so many good things about this movie, I was very excited to finally get to see it. I was terribly disappointed almost immediately. Starting with the way they really drive home the fact that he doesn't have a good relationship with his daughter, to the laughable action and ending, there wasn't even one aspect of this film that I liked. This movie felt like the dialogue was taken right out of an 80's action film. 20 years ago that was fine, but now we need better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrendous","review":"I'd give it 1 1/2 stars, because there are certainly worse films, but it doesn't deserve 2 stars. I've never been convinced by this actor, and I find him quite creepy. He's awful in this, but I started to feel sorry for him...then I didn't, because he accepted the role, right? The whole thing is 100% improbable, predictable, and full of prop room basics and characters from Central Casting. The pop music diva angle to the storyline is pitiful and insulting to anyone beyond American Idol intellect. I was afraid the ending was going to be just what it was, but when it actually happened all I could say was \\"of course.\\" Totally bogus, move on folks, nothing to see here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Taken Review","review":"In my personal opinion, I don't think Liam Neeson is cut out for James Bond type of action thrillers. Even though he pulls it off, he is too intelligent of an actor and the roles he has played in his other films have had more depth and substance to them. The story of the film is interesting and reminded me of Mel Gibson's Ransom which is similar in that both actors play fathers whose child is kidnapped. There were multiple ethnic groups represented as the \\"bad guys\\" and I didn't get a sense of how they were all connected to each other. The film moves very quickly without much continuity between the scenes unfortunately. I like Liam Neeson as an actor. I did not like this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware!","review":"After a month, I neither received this dvd, nor did I receive any response to 3 emails inquiring about it. Is this person still in business? And if not, an email would have been nice so I could know to purchase it elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thought this would be a LOT better","review":"Disappointing vigilante film that wastes a great actor like Liam Neeson. I'm sorry, but he just doesn't cut it as an action hero. And in this day of great action movies like the Bourne Trilogy or 'Casino Royale', or even 'Shoot 'Em Up', there's no reason for this film to be as lame as it actually is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie viewing...","review":"First time trying Amazon videos...will definitely use again...movie is definitely worth having in your collection...you will watch is more than once..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"Great movie, love it bunches.

I had a hard time relating to the main character, he seemed phoney and ingenue. If the plot is going to such a stretch (the kidnapped girls father happens to be a retired spy?, Really?), then the other shit has to be believable. I don't know if a lot got cut out during the editing or if it was just poorly directed. I wonder if the directors cut is any better. Two thumbs up on saving his daughters virginity though!!!!!

Thoroughly entertaining.","review":"Great and efficient flick.My only thing would be that he would be assassinated at the end for all the trouble he caused in Paris.

Well-filmed, tightly-edited garbage. All the dialogue, every character who is introduced -- nothing is handled with even the slightest, faintest hint of subtlety or nuance, as though the screenplay was written by a 12 year old who's never been outdoors."},{"rating":"1","title":"the kind of movie that gets you thinking","review":"Unfortunately, your thinking is all about how farcically preposterous the whole thing is.To be honest, there is nothing that Liam Neeson's character does during any 4-second interval of the film that is not believable. Taking all his actions together, though; that's where the absurdity comes in.One might argue that this is meant to be a fast-paced thriller that will provide a couple of hours and entertainment and nothing more. But for my part I couldn't lose myself in this movie on account of being unable to believe that Liam Neeson could be this sort of man, or that anybody in the world had such a skill set.I wonder what the French thought of this film: it was almost an insult to their culture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stars for Neeson and Grace","review":"The stars are for Liam Neeson and Maggie Grace, but not so much for the film. It's a standard action/international thriller--nothing that has not been done a thousand times before. Shooting an innocent woman in the arm to make her husband talk does not make me admire the so-called hero in the story, and neither does his leaving a man to be electrocuted repeatedly until the power eventually goes off. Yes, I get that he is trying to rescue his daughter, but if it were so easy, there wouldn't be so many women still hidden away, as they are right now.There's also no indication that he was going to notify the French police or Interpol about all the captive women he saw. Sure, they could be moved, but at least there would have been some leads and perhaps DNA left behind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wooden performances, poor script, awful execution","review":"Come on.

But the movie itself is deeply silly and wholly unworthy of Neeson's talent and dignity. As supposedly a highly experienced government covert operative Neeson's character's skills seem to be restricted to knuckleheaded violence when a moment's pause may deliver better results.The movie could therefore be accused of ignoring its own internal logic: how this highly trained professional uses his specialist skills to rescue his kidnapped daughter... apart from the fact that it really has no logic other than seeking an excuse to set up the next fight.Some effort on reseach and writing could have produced a decent thriller out of the idea behind this film. As it stands the movie is probably best watched after three beers on a Saturday night with all critical faculties suspended. To be fair, in these circumstances, it passes the time entertainingly."},{"rating":"1","title":"didn't get the movie!","review":"I ordered the movie and there was an error that popped on the screen.

So called \\"white slavery\\" is very real and Leeson pulls no punches in the single-minded pursuit of dealing the first deadly blow to those who profit from the human trade.This very fast-paced actioner does not rely on gimmicky technology or special effects. One-to-one human combat (Isreali style?) prevails in tightly choreographed fights that are believable.I saw the Euro version -- probably a few minutes of added intensity.Neeson ought to consider this character as a franchise. Kinda made me think of a slightly older Bourne.Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie kicks total a** !","review":"Just wondering, but how many of the people who say this movie is \\"not realistic\\", on the Left, thought Avatar was really good, or \\"Che\\", or let's say, \\"Blood Diamond\\" or \\"The Bourne Identity\\" ?This movie is taught and tight, and Liam Neeson is, as always, excellent. I really liked the martial arts. I have been studying martial arts for years, and have recently been reading a book called \\"The Dirty Dozen\\", by a Green Beret/Special Forces guy. I can tell you, the MA in this movie is very realistic and is exactly what the U.S. special forces uses.I think that the older you are and the more conservative in your overall worldview, the more you would like this movie. I loved it. Nice to see a movie not corrupted by the typical leftwing Hollywood agendas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth buying!","review":"When I first watched the Taken movie, I did not know what to expect. I think this movie was one of the best action/drama movies I have ever seen. I feel that human trafficking was a great topic for this movie to address. This is something that happens in our everyday lives and it does not receive the proper attention. Liam Neeson is the perfect character for the over-protective father figure. I admire his passion to have a safe return of his daughter. I understand that this movie is not based on a true story, but I am guessing it can relate to the real deal. Going into the second movie, there was never a dull moment in this one either. I especially enjoy this series of movies because the story-line is realistic and meaningful to me. I hope people can learn to enjoy this movie as much as I did. They are worth buying and watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"Great movie and great delivery.

The film is an adrelanine rush as a retired special ops man goes to find his daughter as she is kidnapped in Europe. The film exposes what happens all over the world as young women are forced into prostitution. You will find yourself embracing the violence as a dad hunts for his daughter!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must watch for action movie fans","review":"It's been too long after Bourne Ultimatium for action movie fan like me to get completely thrilled, let alone the disappointment by Quantum of Solace. Disregarding the car chasing scene in the construction site and the absence of a ear catching score, the movie is simply perfect. Liam is just so convincing acting a mightily calm and capable ex CIA agent who killed with no mercy in Paris for her kidnapped daughter. The cinematography and the choreography are just superb. In short, a must watch for action movie fans. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"SO entertaining!","review":"Much kudos to whoever wrote this story.

The film stars Liam Neeson as a retired CIA agent who learns his daughter has been abducted in Paris; upon receiving a frantic phone call from her, he tracks her down -- and finds himself on the trail of a massive criminal enterprise. Taken is a sprightly piece of work, and Neeson is compelling in the lead role, but the film is weighted down by contrivances and leaps in logic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Experience","review":"The movie is grey and it was a good download/viewing experience.

It showed that the true meaning of love will motivate endeavour and sacrifice.When I saw that \\"Taken 2\\" was in the pipeline, I signed up to be notified when it became available.....but then, I have found that Liam Neeson is a wonderful actor and brings something special to his roles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"Taken is one really great movie!!

Don't get me wrong, I do like those movies with the rest of the lemmings, but have been jonsing for some intelegance as well. Taken was the perfect blend of thinking and action + a raw look at the white slave trade in some parts of the world. I got chills just watching what the girls had to go through and was (again) blown away by his ability to show the vulnerability of the dad side of his character as well as the emotional void of the assassin.I really wish they used Liam for the upcomming movie \\"one shot\\". He was my ideal for Jack Reacher... oh well, you can't have everything."},{"rating":"2","title":"High-Caliber French Thriller","review":"Fueled by Pierre Morel's vigorous direction, Liam Neeson is the whole show in a preposterously entertaining action-thriller. \\"Taken\\" (2008) starts slowly, but once the kidnapped-daughter plot takes over, it's full speed ahead with plenty of gunplay and fisticuffs along the way. Neeson acquits himself impressively as a no-nonsense action hero. The unrated director's cut remains preferable to the studio-imposed PG-13 edit.

First of all, Liam Neeson does an amazing job, as a sort of obsessive-compulsive John McClain type anti-hero. His concern about his daughter's trip to Europe turns out to be correct when she is kidnapped, and he spends most of the movie doing whatever it takes to rescue her. The rage and violence that Neeson shows is credible in light of the brutal kidnapping of his daughter, allowing him to be more complex than the heroes in many action thrillers. The action is non-stop and includes some great sequences. The subplot involving police corruption adds to the story instead of bogging things down, and emphasizes that Neeson is on his own with his rescue mission.The Blu-Ray has excellent image quality and audio, with a decent if not huge array of extras. If you like action movies, this is a definite must-see."},{"rating":"2","title":"Taken","review":"This was one of the best movies I've seen in a great while!

After a bit of a slow start, which introduced the characters and got you interested in them, the director then ramped up into overdrive and didn't let up for the rest of the movie.

The main character wins every fight, and hundreds of rounds of high powered ammo was shot at him without a single hit; so that was kind of like watching a Superman episode.

He is prepared to rescue his daughter by any means necessary. What follows is a thrill ride across Paris, through streets, cellars, apartments, offices and bridges, as Mills methodically and ruthlessly wrings information from various felons and follows the clues to a final showdown on a barge in the Seine River.The action is fast, furious, and fatal, as Mills leaves a trail of corpses behind him. The good news is that they all had it coming. The bad news is the PG-13 rating should be taken seriously. The short running time (90 minutes) and almost continuous action cover up some gapping plot holes, while leaving little room for moral ambiguity. \\"Taken\\" is highly recommended to those fans of action movies who still miss \\"Dirty Harry.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Single-Disc Extended Edition Case","review":"Let me first state that this is not a review for the Movie but a review of the DVD's case.

It was just ok, I probably won't watch it again and I'll end up giving away the DVD. Liam Neeson is good in this movie and it's a good action movie, which I normally like, but the plot was just way too far fetched for me. I also found the character of the daughter and ex-wife very annoying, as the daughter was just a whiny spolied rich girl that gets whatever she wants and the ex-wife seemed very mean unnecessarliy to the exhusband, which made it hard for me to find any sympathy for those characters.Probably won't rent or purchase Taken 2, even though I know others I love these two movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"MR BURR","review":"I ENJOYED THIS MOVIE IMMENSELY HOWEVER, I LIKE VIOLENT MOVIES WITH A MORAL THEME.

As much as I love Liam Neeson, I hated this movie. The whole premise is ridiculous. First, it's unbelievable that as a father he would remain as composed as he did and just happen to call as his daughter is \\"taken.\\" There's no way an intelligent viewer could suspend his imagination long enough to believe he could do the things he did to reclaim his daughter. Set aside the fact that he becomes a totally unsympathetic psychopath during the process. The body count is higher than a Terminator movie yet we're supposed to remain behind his cold blooded killing because he's a father who loves his daughter.

To do that you would have to completely suspend all common sense and belief in reality.This is quite simply a comic book superhero disguised as a human being.

This guy travels to Paris and within minutes finds his daughter's first contact. He then miraculously walks right in on the bad guy's lair and proceeds to shoot them all without a scratch on himself.He then plays tough guy with these elite movers and shakers of the slave trade and manages to shoot them too, while jumping onto their boat off of a bridge.PLEASE!!!

That MUST be a reflection of the immaturity of the viewers or the sheer ignorance of the viewers, it's hard to tell.While the theme and concept are good, the reality of REALITY is just ignored and create success in each pivotal scene just absurd. They're just not even remotely plausible. Liam's character seems to be a combination of a Navy Seal, James Bond, Batman, and maybe a tinge of the six million dollar man who never misses a shot, escapes all harm . . . effortlessly and just ridiculously cannot be stopped by machine guns or anything else.

The first twenty minutes serve to \\"develop the charactors\\" then it's shoot this, break that, fly threw this, jump on that, swing from this rope and mimic spiderman.

I honestly feel a little dumber after having watched it. Who is really going to pay $350,000 for that girl anyway??

Liam Neeson tries to breath a little life into this one, but there isn't much really connected with the story to make the story interesting, and the supporting characters are very limited in their performances. I understand you don't look to movies like this for realism, but it's hard to believe that the French authorities wouldn't have some interest in taking action if a couple of American teenagers had been kidnapped.

His daughter goes to France with her best friend and she gets kidnapped. I will not say anything more about the storyline of the movie. But I would like to say this though. The movie is pretty disturbing once you find out what happened to his daughter and why. I won't spoil it in how it was disturbing but I would say that people ages 15+ could see this movie.

Once you get past the first twenty minutes, the director kicks it into the stratosphere, and my word do the bodies pile high. Neeson intimidates, maims and kills every bad guy in his way.

However, this film is a revenge film and not a spy thriller, so don't go looking for any heavy character development or government mysteries. Nor does this film have a Bourne-sized budget, and some of the \\"bigger\\" action scenes suffer for it.What this film does have is Liam Neeson as a one man dispenser of asskickery who pistolwhips and throat chops more bad guys in one scene than Damon did in all the Bourne films combined. Maggie Grace (Remember her from seasons 1 & 2 of LOST?) does an amicable job as the daughter in distress, but the main attraction for action fans is seeing in what way Neeson's PO'd poppa is going to exact his brand of justice next."},{"rating":"1","title":"not happy!!","review":"When the movie came in the mail, the package was damaged!

But he must now decide if that is the life he wishes to lead. In the meantime there's disention in the ranks, a pair of wise lawmen on the gang's trail, and a woman with the fire of a stallion eating away at his heart. All this and more will face the son of a wanted man. It was a terrific story that keeps moving until the final page. I loved it. The story has everything that you look for in a Louis L'Amour book."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was so disappointing","review":"Son Of A Wanted Man is the first audio book I've ever listened to and I was so disappointed with it! I was hoping to hear the story as Mr. L'Amour intended it to be - as he wrote it. Instead, it's a lot of bad \\"character acting\\" and ridiculous sound effects. It completely detracts from the story. Please tell me that not all of the audio books are like this!Beau L'Amour should be ashamed of himself for ruining his father's work this way. It truly is awful. The voices don't fit the characters and they certainly don't convey the personalities of the characters.My father taught me to read with Louis L'Amour books.

This book:1. Describes the various people involved in the beginning and growth of Motorola, both scientists and businessmen.2. Explains the scientific discoveries and engineering breakthroughs that affected Motorola, including those by its own employees, and by others3. Shows how specific events like wars affected Motorola and its business.The book is written in chronological order, beginning with the the beginnings of the company around 1900 to the modern-day; 1990s.

You don't need a review by an amatuer -- it has been covered well by professional critics.The narrative could justly be called the ultimate \\"family values\\" novel. Much, but by no means all, of the story is told through the eyes of six-year-old Rufus. However, James Agee also gives the reader fully grown-up glimpses into the hearts of all the main characters. We see the deepest bonds of love transcending profound differences. Devout Catholics and deeply conflicted agnostics cling to each other in the face of death's finality.This is no sweetness and light, easy answers book. It is troubling and haunting, but in the end inspiring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forced and dreary fiction","review":"I went into this book thinking that I would be captured by its originality and sentimentality, but found neither. The story was trite and exploitative. In addition, it almost entirely left out the decedent's blood relatives, which is curious given the circumstance's of Jay's death.Finally, the insertion of the uncompleted portion's of Mr. Agee's writings was forced. It was written in a different voice as although not meant to be part of the same work. An unfortunate editorial decision to include it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A tedious masterpiece","review":"This book is as tedious as the time period in question: the literary device here is obviously to make you understand the horror of living every darned second of pain and misery of a night when a close relative dies. Vivid, evokative, but tedious as hell. I shouldn't have bothered to finish this book. If you read the first 20 pages you know everything you need to know."},{"rating":"1","title":"So this is how it ends: with a whimper...","review":"James Agee's 1955 novel \\"A Death in the Family\\" is considered a classic by some. To me, it is overhyped, and utterly joyless. Mixed in with an interesting story of a young family picking up the pieces after the father dies in a car accident, is the worst \\"poetic\\" ramlbings I've ever read. Did Agee really have to break through the flow of the story with annoying musings that make no sense? The mother, a morbid Catholic, tries to deal with death and her husband's lack of faith. Her brother, Andrew, is easily the best character. With skepticism of religion, and his conflicted emotions, he is an understandable character. Major boos to a santicmonous \\"man of God\\" in the novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip It","review":"I knew by the third chapter that I wasn't going to like the book, but I always try to finish and hope that something comes along to redeem the book and make it worthwhile. No such luck. It was a chore to read this one. And I only finished because it was a book club pick. Perhaps it would have been better had the author lived to see it to completion. If you are looking for a good book to read, choose another... this is not the one."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"maybe i am just dense but i don't understand why this novel is so highly regarded. to me it is just plain dull and boring. i especially don't like the fact that is unfinished and parts of the manuscript are stuck in. these unfinished pieces are weird and confusing. i absolutely loathed reading it, but i must admit it does have a little merit in its exploration of how children and humans deal with unexpected death."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confussed...","review":"Sorry to all of those who liked James Agree's book. I didn't. I didn't follow the parts that were in italic. Who was speaking? Nothing happened in the book. You knew someone was going to die, but Jay Follet didn't die until about a third way into the book. Did Jay's fahter die or not? I couldn't tell. I know Jay left him to come home, but was he dead or alive? I thought Mary was a very believeable women in her response to her husband's death, for the time period. If Mr. Agree had wanted to give the book a little bit of a happier/funnier tone he could have gone on more about Aunt Hannah before she found out about Jay's death. She seemed to be a very quirky person her her time. I felt bad for Rufus. He got picked on all of the time, by the school boys. He never had a friend, which is sad. A boy his age needs friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"father's death provides focus to everyday issues","review":"a father's death provides focus to everyday issues such as family interactions, society views, childhood mockery, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Flawed Masterpiece","review":"As other reviewers have stated, the opening passage \\"Knoxville: Summer 1915\\" (which was separate from the original manuscript)sets an impossible standard for the rest of the novel. It is undoubtedly one of the most adept, vivid, moving prose poems in the English language. The novel itself is characterized by a profound honesty and humanity-- these are some of the best-rendered characters I have ever encountered. The plot is very simple (the most crucial incident in the book takes place within the first fifty pages), and yet its message is beautiful and wise and sad. This is not a \\"perfect\\" book by any means, but it is a masterpiece in its own right."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heartbreaking...","review":"A thoroughly moving portrayal of death. The characters are beautifully simple people and because their lives are so ordinary, it is easier for a reader to empathize with their loss. I'm not sure that \\"Death\\" is what you would call a \\"great novel\\" - very little happens - but at the very least it's some \\"great writing\\" and almost always manages to strike an authentic chord."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful classic","review":"This book is a beautifully written novel about life and death in the early 20th century as seen through the eyes of a young boy. It is almost lyrical in the way it is written. The story revolves around a young family's father being killed instantly and unexpectantly. The character portrayals are so sharp that the reader feels he knows them intimately, and it is easy to relate them to our everyday acquaintances and relatives. This book is a must-read true classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's important to remember Agee didn't have a chance to edit","review":"When you read this book and I hope everyone gets a chance to....please....remember he died before the editing process was finished. I loved Rufus and Mary and Aunt Hannah. This is what death is like to a small child. Mysterious, scary, poignant and lonely. I hope someone will read this book and agree with me."},{"rating":"2","title":"A perfect book in many ways","review":"A Death in the Family is devastating and heart-breaking and a perfect narrative. Anyone who has suffered a shocking loss experiences many emotions and may not know how to give voice to them; Agee finds a way to express them in sharply tuned phrases and precise observations. Although written many years ago, this book is not dated in any way. I was stunned by the prose - the careful use of words, the economy of sentences and the attention to important details. Impressive."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Death in the Family","review":"This is the story of a father's untimely death and the family's reaction to it. At the beginning of this story you immediately know that this is a very close family. When the father is suddenly killed in an automobile accident we are taken on the journey the family must take as they realize the immediate and future changes to their family, their feelings and life. Agee did a great job of bringing the reader along. I felt the pain and grief due to the descriptive and emotional way this was written. He touched on other topics especially the church and the role it played in society during that time period. I found myself angry along with Mary's brother Andrew at the priest who refused to complete the service because her husband had not been baptized. This was definitely a good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful, yet Confusing","review":"Recently I read A death in the Family by James Agee. My reaction to the book was I loved it, there was so much feeling invovled in the book. You were forced to learn a lesson, not to take anyone or anything for granted. The only problem I had with the book was everything in italics. I was totally confused, to me it had nothing to do with the book. After reading it I found out that the editor's put all of the italics in, because Agee had died before the book was completely finished and the editors were not sure where to put it, so they put it at the end of each section. Over all, I really liked the book, it was warm and it shows how much family really does mean to some people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay, he's a good writer--but I still didn't like this book","review":"Agee was an excellent writer, and in this book he evokes both the joy of living and the numbness of loss masterfully. But after rereading this book a couple times (I felt its reputation warranted another chance), I cannot shake my initial impression that his portrayal of wife and daughter were a bit on the sentimental side. Mary in particular drove me crazy. Her sweetness was cloying, her strength undermined by breathy speeches--which are emphasized with too many italics for my taste. I wish I could agree with all the positive reviews, but for me the quality of writing could not make up for characters and dialogue that drove me bats."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Death in the Family","review":"The ending was not very good, seemed that too many things were left unanswered for me.

Those of you who have enjoyed this novel - take a minute, go to the library, check out or read Agee's biography; cuz this book is based on his father dying when he was six years old.

Wonderful & Enjoyable!"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"Having learned hiragana from the brilliant James Heisig's book, I was happy to see in the review that this book claims to use the same \\"mnemonics\\" method of helping memorise the shapes of katakana characters . Indeed, characters in this book are superimposed over pictures. However, in nearly all cases the pictures have very little to do with what the character looks like (imagine a picture of a person twisted in a very bizzarre way that stands for \\"centurion\\" (SE)).Practice examples are interesting to read as they give tidbits of japanese culture, but they all imply the knowledge of characters that have not been covered yet, making following them extremely painful, and there are not enough of them at all.Rather than taking a character apart and seeing what parts it consists of, the book just lists them in alphabetical (a-ka-sa-ta) order without trying to find any kind of relation between them.You are definitely better off waiting for Heisig's katakana book"},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless!","review":"This book is not worth the time or money. It teaches you how to write the letters, but provides no practice except for reading animal sounds, a snakes and ladders game, and a word search.

Neither of the characters were jerks, which is usually what I end up thinking at the end of her books - that either the main guy or girl was a total jerk. I felt like these two characters were really well developed and stayed consistent throughout the story -- there were no stupid miscommunications to tear them apart, which is nice. Neither of the main characters changed or said things that didn't make sense to their characters just to confuse the romance or create a big reunion. The romance was built slowly instead of having them fall in love immediately, again, not typical and nice to read. I thought the extra characters were good and didn't ake over the story, plus I thought the mystery was well balanced, too. It's obvious early on who the guy is going to be but it doesn't detract from the story at all.

The cover and artistry on the back did not please me, and I was horribly afraid I would be disappointed...until I watched it!! This is one of the better Anime I have ever seen! The dubbing was not only good, but EXCELLENT! Childish at some points, it had it's moments where it was very much fun for the older crowd.

Inaho is annoying and manipulative, and she doesn't know how to shut up. Hono and Yuki are fun characters that you can totally feel for if you've ever been stuck in a situation with someone that you don't really like. There are some great lines in there too.

We probably used it for about 7 haircuts then the clipper head broke...in the midst of the last haircut. The cheap screws broke inside and the head just fell off. I tried to finish the haircut with scissors. If you are one person trying to cut your own hair, using scissors can prove to be quite the challenge.If you are looking for a cheap little clipper kit, this is the one you want. But, if you plan on using it on a regular basis or for more than one person, I would not recommend it. This clipper could leave you with a head of half cut hair...By the way, don't store the oil in the combo kit with the rest of the stuff because the little oil container leaks."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst Church I've heard","review":"I have Gold Afternoon Fix, Hindsight, Of Skins and Heart, Priest=Aura, Quick Smoke at Spots, Seance, and Sometime Anywhere.

Using it for home networking, and if I accessed stuff through Apple protocols and family members used different usernames, there was no way to both have access to the the same things. Ended up using its SMB protocols, but the tech support said they'd look into this and release a firmware update. That was almost a year ago, no firmware updates since then.

The trimmer itself is EXACTLY what I want. Great adjustments. Does a fantastic job on trimming everything from my beard to sideburns to whatever. However, here I am less than two years after my purchase and I am looking for another trimmer. Why? The battery has died. Worse, though it is described as \\"corded/cordless\\", it only works cordless. In other words, even though you can have the trimmer plugged in, it still runs on battery (which won't hold a charge anymore). I wouldn't mind if I could just plug in and use the trimmer corded but I can't. And the batteries aren't replaceable. Yes, I did follow the instructions on battery maintenance but nothing helps. Looking at the owner's manual, I see that the MB-300 does operate with AC. However, it doesn't look like they make it anymore (if they ever did) so I'm stuck. Does Remington really expect us to buy a new one of these every 18 months?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked Great, then battery died","review":"Was quite happy with this razor for about 4 months. Then the battery started dying, slowing lasting for shorter and shorter time periods. Eventually it just stopped holding a charge at all. And on top of that, the plug doesn't supply enough power to use the razor, so it's pretty much junk now. Disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless","review":"If you want a good trimmer, prepare to spend a lot more than $30. This thing barely cuts, it can't hold a charge, and it's loud. To give you an idea of what to expect - two weeks ago the battery died mid-shave, which was probably only the second or third time I'd used it. Today I needed a little trim and guess what, I couldn't finish this time either. Never had such problems with my $100+ Norelco. This thing is absolutely USELESS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Battery died","review":"I bought this for my boyfriend's beard because he lazy about keeping up with trimming it. It worked great at first, but after maybe 4-5 uses over the course of 4-5 months (I told you he doesn't trim up often), it stopped working. It lasts for about 5 seconds of use then dies, and you can't use it while plugged in. Very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent product at an excellent price. Read about the charger though.","review":"Product lives up to my expectations. I have a full beard and use the product to trim it at setting \\"3\\" (slightly longer than stubble). Excellent quality, especially given the price. The construction is solid and does not feel flimsy or fragile. The adjustable head has flexible \\"teeth\\" which look like it could break easily if handled roughly. But this is hardly an issue for its intended use. Very good battery life. I like the fact that the cutting blades are hinged and can be lifted and cleaned from underneath, no special tools required. Highly recommend.Update: Had to remove 1 star for the charger. I had to travel recently to a country where the outlet voltage is 220 volts, and realized that the charger is rated for only 110 volt AC input. This forced me to carry a (rather heavy) step down voltage adapter while traveling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product for a good price","review":"Bought this because my husband's last one died and we were desperate for another one! The price was right (around $15) and we like the fact that it has the adjustable height without having to change the trimmer head. It does a good job.We wish it would work when plugged in (if it has lost its charge, and you plug it in, you have to wait for it to recharge before being able to use it, as opposed to being to use it while plugged in).The fact that it doesn't have a \\"base\\" for charging (just a cord you plug in) doesn't matter to us, but it might to some consumers so please be aware that you'll have to lay it flat somewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing simply amazing!","review":"I bought one a year ago stilli n service today...no snags nothing cutting hair cutting facial hair.

There are 2 very small prongs that hold the blade in place. When you remove the guard and clean the blade of your hair, they break.

Can not reccommend anyone ever buy this piece of junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Battery kills it","review":"After about two years, the battery on this thing is completely shot, which makes the whole thing useless. Even when plugged in, I have to turn it off, wait a few minutes, then I get about 20 seconds of trimming before I have to repeat the process. It's been getting worse and worse, and today it finally got to the point where it's no longer able to do its job and is garbage.This would be a 4-5 star product if they had decided to use a battery that wouldn't make the product worthless after just two years. You get what you pay for."},{"rating":"2","title":"This thing is sweet!","review":"Perfect traveling trimmer. I have a full beard and mustache, and couldn't be happier with this. It doesn't have a base, just plug charger into the bottom end, which makes this ideal for taking on the road.Update a year later. This thing is still the best trimmer I have ever purchased.

Reading various reviews, it became apparent that a beard trimmer by itself was what I really needed. Based on other reviews here I purchased the Remington trimmer and have used it for several months. I couldn't be more pleased with it. This thing is super light weight, very easy to hold and just a delight after struggling with my shaver's mediocre trimming attachment. Wish I had known about this thing years ago. It actually came out of the box with a mostly charged battery and was ready to use, something I don't think I've ever encountered. The multiple settings make getting the right length easy and it seems to hold a charge for a really long time. I'm quite pleased, and think it is amazing for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"charger did not work","review":"the shaver works just fine and i charged it the first time i used it and it worked but the second time i use it and went to charge it the battery wouldnt charge. i tried everything and even basically pulled it apart but still could not figure out why it wasnt working"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product 5 Stars Minus 1","review":"After owning several Wahl trimmers, I wanted something more reliable but didn't want to break the bank. This product is perfect and was on sale for $14.77. This product feels well built, the charge lasts for and weeks, and has nice adjustable guard for various lengths and for trimming sensitive areas that is also removable for precise beard and mustache trimming.My only reason for 4 star is the misleading \\"Made in PRC\\" label which I do not believe is a TLA (Three Letter Acronym) for \\"Puerto Rico Commonwealth\\" but more likely \\"People's Republic of China.\\" Really Remington, are you really that concerned to have a \\"Made in China\\" sticker on your product when I believe all Apple products and just about every other high tech device I own was probably made there? 5 star product well built in China minus 1 star for trying to hide it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Battery Problems with 3+ Trimmer","review":"Tried this trimmer for 3 years, a total of 3 trimmers.

I like to keep it short, like the length it would be after not shaving for a few days, and this trimmer has an adjustment that is short enough for me (which many don't).The device works smoothly. It does not pull out any hairs, like some of my old trimmers, and the battery seems to last forever. I charged once it when I bought it a few months ago, and it is still working.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Breaks easily when used without guard","review":"If you only plan to use it with the guard on, you're probably fine. If you plan to use it without the guard, especially for more intensive / multiple-angle tasks like head shaving, don't buy it. The top is designed so that if any significant pressure is placed on the blade when used in a pretty normal hand position, it can pop open. If it doesn't pop open, the plastic (!) pins in the hinge will break off. (The hinge is to allow you to open the top and clean out the hair around the driving pin.) I owned a prior model and it lasted for seven years of once-weekly head shavings with no guard, plus beard trimming. This version lasted barely six months before the first hinge pin broke, and less than a year before the second one broke, rendering the shaver unusable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hope the battery lasts!","review":"I've own at least three of these in the past.

The functions are great for trimming beard and mustache, but after only 18 months, the battery will no longer hold a charge more than a week or two. Nothing quite as delightful as getting halfway through trimming your beard before going to work on Monday morning and having the battery die halfway through! And BTW, it won't work on wall power; you have to wait for it to charge up enough to finish....I'm used to the fact that electronics are so cheap now that they're disposable, but this is insulting. No more Remington for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing deal for the money","review":"I broke my old razor so needed a new one fast, I had started to look too much like a lumberjack.

What is Remington thinking, really? Of what use is a product that seems capable of many good years of service, yet in about a year, can no longer be used without first charging it up every day or two. That it can't be used while plugged in, unless it's already charged, compounds the frustration & annoyance! No matter how long it's charged, even overnight, it will not hold a charge for more than a day, two at the most. And when it's dead, even plugging it in does no good.

The two things I don't like about it are that it won't work when plugged in with the charger -- the charger simply recharges the battery. So if you want to use this thing, you have to make sure it is plugged in and charging for at least an hour before you use it. The other thing I didn't like is that it cuts unevenly.

I got exactly what I was looking for, but I'm surprised how well it works. There aren't any parts that seem like they'll fall apart, and it's got a great feel in the hand. I like the action on it a lot. My first trim was immediately better and much quicker then the previous trimmer I had (which had died on me).

Even after being fully charged, I am lucky if I can trim my mustache and goatee before it dies on me. And of course, you all know how painful THAT can be! The battery life wouldn't have been an issue if it had some type of override, that would allow me to run it straight off the AC outlet. Guess I got a \\"lemon\\" based on all the positive reviews, but it will be hard to return as all the packaging was recycled some time ago. When I replace it, I will be looking for a better charging system, maybe a rechargeable lithium ion battery would be better.

Well worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"After 5.5 solid years with my previous Remington trimmer, I expected a similarly pleasant experience with the 200. Instead I have had only problems.It's one plus: it shaves well.On the negative side: it only shaves well when it's plugged into a wall socket. Thankfully, my beard is short, I couldn't even imagine using it for thicker hair.Though it shaves nicely when plugged-in, the charger burnt out after 3.5 weeks. The batteries proceeded to last only two shaves without a recharge. What if I was away on a business trip?Either I had great luck with my first Remington or miserable luck with the newest Remington."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good trimmer, horrible battery","review":"The trimmer itself is great. Numerous depth adjustments and the guard can be removed for sideburns or detail work. However, the battery will not hold a charge for more than 2 days. I only trim my beard once a week, so I have to charge the trimmer before every use (minimum of 2 hours charging for 2 minutes of trimming operation time). If this trimmer was simply a corded model it would be fine. Since it's battery only and can't work when connected to the outlet (until the battery is charged), it's frustrating. It works (in it's own special way) and my pride won't let me replace a working machine. I'm patiently waiting the day when it dies so I can get a different trimmer with a working battery or a cord. Save yourself the $25 and pass on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid","review":"Solid construction. Significantly better than my last Remington.

I went over my beard and head at least 20 times and each time got a bit more trim. After the ~20 times my hair and beard looked neat, but that is not what I expect from a highly rated trimmer.

It was incredible, always fast and sharp. When I lost it, I bought this model, but I was really surprised by how badly it cut. It will NOT cut close to the skin AT ALL. It was not able to cut the hair under my nose, and it will simply not cut closer that 1/4 inch because of the way the blades are positioned. So if you need to get close to the skin, for example under the nose or down on the neck, you're going to be screwed by this shaver. Not to mention that it pulls like the dickens. I am just perplexed by what Remington has wrought."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shortsighted engineering by the unshaven or prepubescent","review":"This thing is a piece of garbage for two very specific, and complementary, reasons:1) the battery dies after two or three days of sitting (fully charged) if it's not plugged in.2) it does NOT OPERATE ON AC FROM THE OUTLET unless the battery is charged. This means that after it's discharged, you must wait for it to recharge before using it again. I want to jam this things non-functional blades into the throat of every neckbeard that was responsible for saying \\"yep, seems fine.\\" during the approval process. simultaneously.In summary: the Remington MB-200 Titanium Mustache and Beard Trimmer would chuckle at you, if it could hold a charge, while you are forced to leave the house with a half-trimmed whatever it is that is on your face."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless","review":"Battery has never held a charge more than a day or two.

This will definitely do the job if you're looking for something in that category. The blades are ultra sharp, and the trimmer itself has a good sturdy/ergonomic feel. Cleaning the blades is tremendously easy. Just pop up the blade and brush/blow out the excess hair. I have realized that sometimes trimmer can make unequal cuts. But, to fix that make sure you use edge side of trimmer or the flat side, and not both. Overall, I am very satisfied with the results and would recommend it to anyone. Although, I'm sure there are better ones out there with more superfluous features, but this trimmer has everything you need and love."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great trimmer, even better price!","review":"I ordered this trimmer for my husband when his old trimmer bit the dust.

Adding to the problem: the battery is not replaceable. Adding even more to the problem: you can't run the trimmer by plugging it in. The included adapter only works as a charger.

I'd imagine you could easily use it to keep many other areas of your body trimmed as well. It has 9 adjustable settings on the length that could certainly be long or short enough for anyone. We use 4 out of 9 on my eyebrows. It seems to hold it's charge for a quite a while and cleans up quite easily. The only potential downfall to the product is that it is dry only so you can't use it in the shower. Overall, it is a very versatile trimmer that offers an even trim at whatever length you desire.

I recharged the battery many times but nothing fixed it. The machine turned off at some positions and at others it worked fine. I tried to take it apart to see if it was a problem with the battery but the screws were of the worst quality.

The guard adjust to cut anything from a medium length beard to a close stubble and the adjustment wheel securely locks into place so there are no worries about the guard retreating while in use. One nice thing about this trimmer is you can keep it plugged in all the time with out worry about overcharging and killing the battery. This trimmer is replacing my 2 year old, $50+, phillips norelco whose battery no longer held a charge longer for 5 seconds, and I can say with out a doubt, this $15 trimmer works 10 times better than my old trimmer, or any other I've owned, for the matter.

After serveral months I can say I am very pleased with this trimmer. It is solid and well built. It has very good battery life. It is comfortable to use and does a great job! I had thought of buying a more expensive model that would vacuum clippings, or one that would operate while plugged in (for those occasions where you forget to charge it) but hours of reading reviews left me concerned about complaints of poor performance and flimsy parts. I'm glad I saved myself some potential aggravation and money too! Shortly after getting this I recommended it to a friend, he ordered one and is also very pleased!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't hold charge","review":"When the trimmer is working properly, it works wonderfully. The trimmer has plenty of power, and the trim adjustment range is more than adequate for me. Where it falls short, however, is in its ability to hold a charge. Like several other reviewers, mine worked great for the first few weeks, but now it only runs at full power (for about 10-15 seconds). It seemed like a great trimmer for the price, and it would be if it weren't for its inability to hold a halfway decent charge."},{"rating":"1","title":"Remington MB-200 Beard Trimmer","review":"I was a little hesitant to buy this trimmer after reading some of the reviews. I'm glad I bought it. It has worked well for me. I didn't give it 5 stars simply because I had nothing to compare it with. This was the first time ever I grew a beard. I found the settings worked very well and was able to get a nice even trim and lots of complements.**Update: I reduced this form 4 stars to 2 stars simply because the battery does not hold a charge, and you can't use it while plugged in to recharge. I have some time ago shaved off my beard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Works great. Love the adjustable head. Easy to clean and easy to handle.

I LOVED this thing when I got it. That lasted about a month. Now the battery won't hold a charge through a single trimming. I have to stage trimming, do one sideburn (quickly) then wait a couple hours for the battery to hold enough of a charge to do the next one. No way I could do my beard or mustache at once, have to space my face out over the week. The power adapter isn't one where you can run the thing while plugged in, you have to wait for the battery to charge. Completely useless. Don't buy this trimmer, it doesn't last very long so you'll just be replacing it soon. SO, I'm off to buy a new trimmer...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't be more happy","review":"I didnt think that paying for a good shaver would ever be worth it after using a super cheap one for a couple years.

I use it only once or twice each week and it cannot hold a charge between shavings.

How the heck do you expect us to charge this while its standing up like every other shaver in creation!! i dont want my razor laying on its side like its a beached whale!!! How lame is that!!!! Why didnt they show that on the picture!! I wish I hadnt ripped the box I never expected this plug to go on the bottom, and why dont they make the one with the vacuum catcher on the bottom. This gets hair all over the place. Why discontinue a great product and make this pos. Also the top plastic trimmer adjuster piece is closed in the a cage, I have never seen that before, its weird. The only other razor that sits on the side is called the man groomer but you only use that for body hair once in a blue moon. To have a razor you use weekly sitting on its side is ridiculous.

I used it about two times a week, for quick trimming. Unfortunately, it's a lot flimsier than it looks, and the slider bar broke rendering the device useless as anything but an edger. The slider will not hold the guard in place any longer, as the two plastic clips on either side fall to the lowest slot regardless of the position the slider is in.

I couldn't have been more wrong.I have a fairly thick beard and after several months it's become quite apparent that this trimmer is never going to produce an even trim. It doesn't matter what angle or how much pressure I use, it just never gets everything.In addition to the inconsistent trimming, the battery holds very little charge. If I don't plug it in every other use, I'm left with a dead trimmer the next time I need it. That wouldn't be so bad if you could use the trimmer while it was plugged in, but you can't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short life span","review":"The Remington MB200 had a good start but a short run.

I thought the story would have been much better had it not been for the \\"witticisms\\" of the characters. The dialogue sounded as if a 30-year old jaded Gen X-er wanted to desperately fit in with a 15-17 year old crowd. Getting past the \\"honest to blog\\" and \\"wizard\\" sayings was tough. They jump out at you. It's like Joey Gladstone's \\"Cut. It. Out.\\" from Full House, but more prevalent and annoying.I wanted to like the movie. I liked the storyline, and thought it was on its way to being well done, but the overuse of awful catch phrases and the overly-witty Juno did it in for me.Jason Bateman and Michael Cera did an amazing job, as did J.K. Simmons. Their performances were well worth all the hype this movie's getting, and the film is worth watching for these guys."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wreaks of Conservative Politics","review":"First of all the move was written by Barbara Nicolosi of Act One, a group that trains Christians to work in the Hollywood mainstream. She claims she is not preaching in the movie about pro-life and that \\"Juno\\" is about people struggling to make real decisions in the real world, but people who know anything about real teenage pregnancies know that it is not some cute little thing that happens to young girls. At least the statistics, starting from illiteracy, earning power, etc of teenage girls show that teenage pregnancy affects young women in a negative way for the rest of their lives. It is just amazing what the conservatives will do to hammer in irresponsible ideas into people just to support their cause, which at this time is pro-life, and it ain't cute!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed by Juno","review":"Maybe it was all the hype, all the buildup...but when I finally sat down to watch Juno, I have to say I was decidedly unimpressed.

I found the acting...OK, the storyline....eh."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Quirky Nine Month Trip Through Life","review":"I don't know what I was expecting with this one, but it turns out that it's quite good. It's not really a movie about teen pregnancy - that just forms the backdrop. It's more about Juno's journey through these nine months of her life, how she experiences things, how and what she learns, etc. It's not quite a romantic comedy, but it's definitely not a drama, and it's not something sappy. It's quirky, and overall it's positive and fun. Feel-good but also serious, a little odd, and interesting to watch. No boredom here.Ellen Page does a good job - a cynical, slightly strange teen. Supporting parts by J.K. Simonds, Allison Janney and Jennifer Garner are very well done, good solid perfomances. Jason Bateman's role is a little less well done, but he basically plays a guy who won't grow up, which he does well.I'd give it a good solid 8 (out of 10), and it's something I'd watch again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Juno is SO irritating!!!","review":"Ugh! The one-liners from Juno get so irritating! They are funny the first time, but after 5-6 of them in a row, it's just like STOP!

Part of that is my weakness for Ellen Page: In my eyes, she can do no wrong. Well, rather, she COULD HAVE DONE no wrong before making this film. Then I watched it again, and my opinion went south. This film is offensively indie. It is obnoxiously quirky, as if the director felt the need to remind the audience with every other line that THIS IS AN INDEPENDENT FILM. Ellen Page's dialogue sounds as if it was written by Hollywood's idea of a 40-year-old mother trying to bond with her child through the use of outdated or irrelevant slang. Michael Cera plays --- surprise --- a socially awkward/inept teenager. Way to escape typecasting!"},{"rating":"2","title":"love this movie","review":"I love this movie.

After having sex for the first time in a chair juno finds herself pregnant and being an assertive little thing get in her mind she's gonna do right by the baby and not only put the baby up for adoption but find parents she sees fit. She looks in the Penny Saver and this is the story that goes on from that. Its not a sugar coated story of teen pregnancy but its not a depressing one either. It simply approaches a sensitive topic with humor and along with a great soundtrack and a great cast including Jennifer Garner and Ellen Page."},{"rating":"1","title":"Best Picture? and Best Actress? What a Joke.","review":"You have got to be kidding me? What a pathetic comment on Hollywood that this movie could be nominated for Best Picture and Best Actress.The movie was as average as it gets. If the DVD had been defective half-way through I would not have cared one iota. The only redeeming quality was Jason Bateman's performance...and the last 20 minutes of the movie which had some poignancy.Ellen Page is nothing but sarcasm until those last 20 minutes. Sarcasm is not a difficult role to play people! Close your eyes and tell me that she does not sound exactly like Jeanine Garofalo. She is a Jeanine Garofalo protege, I'm telling you. Her character is so unbelievable...and not one adult in the entire movie ever tells her to shut her flipping mouth and act respectful? It's just not believable.And to top it all off, the soundtrack has to be the worst in the history of film. I'm embarrassed for Hollywood over these nominations for this picture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quirky but endearing movie","review":"It's not hard to see why the movie \\"Juno\\" became so popular. Ellen Page delivered a great performance as the character of Juno that made this movie what it is. Juno's whole matter of fact and pragmatic approach to life and all the issues she was going through was refreshing and unexpected. This is another movie where you really couldn't see where it was going until it went there.The rest of the characters were okay to good, although the rich couple felt a little bit not-organic.From a movie makers perspective, they brilliantly used the runners to both frame and quirkify the movie. It really worked.The movie also touches upon some serious issues, but does so in an organic and pragmatic way, instead of the typical culture-war histrionics we often see.My suggestion? Watch this before you watch another formulaic Hollywood dramedy and comedy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Film","review":"Juno is a charming film of a girl stuck in a bad situation trying to do the right thing, while keeping her sense of self. The film makes it easy to both like and want to scold the title character, Juno. Overall a very enjoyable watch, and heart warming story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid movie","review":"I think this movie was even better than the previews suggested. This is a movie you can watch over and over again. There are subtleties and I believe the best aspect of this film is that not everything is explained or shown. Details of the story are left out, things happen quick, and you don't see everything that you might expect to happen in the story but that is why the movie is so memorable and unique. I highly recommend purchasing it, in this version or the two copy version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Break from Reality","review":"This movie may require you to suspend your beliefs.You must believe: that a store clerks is pithy, that a teenager is even pithier, that parents are supportive of a teen pregnancy, that teens at school aren't cruel, that a teenage boy wants a meaningful relationship more than gratuitous sex, that a neurotic, uptight professional woman is good single mother material, that a man slow dancing with a teenager half his age isn't a predator, that people know when to enter and leave relationships, that teenage pregnancy has no long-term negative effects.If you believe, you will be rewarded with a sweet viewing experience. But a cynic might say it would be appropriate if Juno woke up at the end of the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing...","review":"Video I love this movie ... although I was extremely mad...

Juno is quirky take on teenage pregnancy. It is also a story of a complex young lady who make a tough but mature decision regarding her baby and how it will be brought into the world.Personally, I enjoyed Juno - it is a smart, funny and original. Parts move a little slow (and while for the most part it is original) and at times predictable. What is consistent is that Ellen Page is outstanding . She makes a perfect smart talking teenager.Final Verdict -While not perfect \\"Juno\\" is entertaining and while some of you may hate the movie others may find it being one of their all time favorites.4 1/2 stars"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark Humor Abounds","review":"I did not think I would like this movie -- it was so hyped up! I wanted to know what all the fuss was about, so I watched it despite the hype. And I liked it, despite expecting not to.I love the off-beat humor of this movie. The editing and cinematography were what made the movie fantastic, though. The music helped quite a bit as well.This movie reminded me a little of Napoleon Dynamite and a little of Lars and the Real Girl -- but overall it is one of a kind and definitely worth a viewing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet and funny","review":"When 16-year old tomboy and wise-cracker Juno (Ellen Page) discovers she's pregnant, she decides to look for a couple to adopt her baby. She finds yuppies Vanessa and Mark (Jennifer Garner, Jason Bateman) and thinks they would be super cool parents.I was prepared to dislike this movie because I don't think teen pregnancy is comical, but I was won over by Ellen Page's quirky charm. She's smart, independent, strong and very likeable, a true gem of an actress. Michael Cera plays her clueless boyfriend; he's believably bewildered by the pregnancy and, though more interested in the track team than the baby, is quite appealing, too.Juno becomes a strong heroine in a tough situation. The movie is funny and the characters are real and it has the off-beat feeling that indie movies often have. Recommended if you can overlook the basic moral issue and enjoy the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watching grass grow is more exciting than this movie!","review":"I'll keep it short.Juno is really a 30 yr. old midget.Her parents are clueless and dumber than dirt, but in a \\"nice way\\".Boyfriend is gay, but doesn't know it yet.Husband is a eunuch.Wife is dominatrix.At least this is my impression of the characters.

Worst movie ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't let teens watch this movie!","review":"I don't think teenagers should watch this movie because the girl tricks her boyfriend into having sex with her and then an un-planned pregancy happens. so i think the movie is saying that it's okay for a teenage girlto trick her boyfriend and get pregnant and it's not. so if you're a parent of teen trying to teach them not to get pregnant or you're a teen:stay way from this movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"go fly a kite!\\"","review":"This movie is proberly the best made movie picture in modern times.

The topic of teenage pregnancy is often a difficult subject for a movie, but this one does it with depth, compassion and much humor.The casting is wonderful and Ellen Page is absoultely brilliant playing the title role of \\"Juno\\". She's smart, funny, cool/uncool teenager who finds herself pregnant and finds the seeminingly perfect couple to adopt her unborn baby. The movie explores the relationship with Juno and the parents to be, her parents and her \\"boyfriend along with the relationship of the \\"parents to be\\".It's a very touching story with a couple unexpected turns. You'll also find yourself laughing along the way. I can see why this movie got such positive reviews and I would absoultely recommend it"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's hard NOT to love this film","review":"This simple \\"romantic comedy\\" is so wrought with life, love and sensitivity, it's no wonder Diablo Cody won the Oscar for her brilliant script. Ellen Page is perfect, as a youth who has seen enough to know how to handle things. Allison Janney is excellent, as is everyone else. Previous reviewers can wring out all kinds of angst about the situations involved, but I think Jason Reitman's presentation is the best teen film in years. There's a minimum of gross-out humor, as in most teen films, but almost everything that comes out of Ms. Page's mouth is worth listening to...thanks to Ms. Cody. There's absolutey no meanness, or ugliness or mean-spirit to take away from the love that abounds. I enjoy this film a lot. If you don't, lighten up..."},{"rating":"1","title":"TALK ABOUT GRATING MY NERVES!","review":"First of all, the plot of Juno getting pregnant by Paulie was never fully explained (someone ventured that they were bored or they've wanted to do it, but there is NO passion or anything between the teens), so it's just a convenient and easy-way out for the writers to begin this LAME film. Juno's character was so annoyingly eyebrow-raising, an ungrateful and incomprehensibly stupid character. Her \\"shizzle\\" and other atrocious teen language is so...urgh, no words to describe how off-putting Juno is! I don't know how anybody can like this film enough to call it \\"Best Film of the Year\\" and keep the DVD rather than destroy it. One major problem I had with this film: if Juno was SO smart, then how come she can't handle herself talking to adults (when she talked about Chinese babies being shot out of t-shirt guns referring to how numerous Chinese babies are). Juno's character is underdeveloped, caustic (for no real reason), and all-around 1/2 star. Blech."},{"rating":"2","title":"OMG!!! F-ing BRILLIANT!!!!","review":"Juno is one of the most original movies i have ever seen.... this movie is so funny and so real feeling... i was one of those ppl that thought that it was not all it was cracked up to be... i was completley wrong...Juno really caught my attention with the smart jokes and its spunk... Ellen Page definatley should have won an oscar for this movie. her performance was just AMAZING!!!! Jason Bateman, j.k. simmons, and jennifer garner give excellent performances as well.... the only thing is i wish they put my boy michael cera more in this film...i definatley recommend this movie to anyone that loves a comedy with great performances and a storyline everyone could relate to...5 stars out of 5: im so glad this movie won an oscar!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"An Empty Film","review":"If you enjoy fantastical films that break from reality, then you may enjoy this film. Otherwise you will have to suspend what you know of the authentic world around you.For example, to find this film worth watching, you must accept that:*16-year-old high school girls speak like 30-year-old women*16-year-old high school girls are more interested in sex than 16-year-old high school boys*16-year-old high school girs are experts concerning home pregrancy tests and abortion clinics but know nothing about pre-natal care and the stages of pregnancy*and so on...A clue to how bad this film is can be found in the cast listing. Ever since The West Wing, Allison Janney seems to only get involved with mentally bankrupt, empty, idealogical projects that tend to promote narcissistic behavior. I think she is a wonderful actress, but I wish she would be more discriminating in what she chooses for work."},{"rating":"1","title":"I, LIKE, Lasted Ten Minutes","review":"LIKE the worst movie ever! LIKE Juno answers with LIKE a dissertation (whatever that is) whenever LIKE her lame, weak parents LIKE ask her a simple question.

LIKE no human being LIKE talks LIKE that!I so wanted to punch her in the mouth and SHUT HER UP I had to change to another channel! More Hollywood anti-parenting, anti-values, anti-self-control dreck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"All Hype No Greatness For This Movie","review":"I'm sorry but this movie was just two things for me annoying and idiotic re-make of much better movies before this one. I'm sure most people know the storyline by now you have a young teenage girl Juno who after having sex gets pregnant and now after a while of thinking it over decides to have the baby full term and than give the baby up to a surrogate couple. For me I couldn't seem to care less what happened to Juno or the baby I know it sounds mean but the storyline they used has been done over many times and a lot more better than this trashy movie. The soundtrack also was pretty pathetic except for one or two but all in all the songs they used by this one singer Kimya Dawson made me want to put this dvd in the garbage disposer. To people who are looking for a heart-felt movie similar to this I say try checking out Natalie Portman's movie Where The Heart Is I guarantee you that would be a much better choice than this cornball dvd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"Awful movie...glamorizes teen pregnancy, it's crude and distasteful. Don't waste your time watching it. I'm sorry I did and will not recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Boreing!!!! This movie from my sister in law at her advice. Could not have been more bored with it. For a teenage that thanks and talks like she is 30, she doesn't seem to have a brain in her skull. If you really want to be bored half to death this movie is for you. My advice rent or borrow it before wasting money on it. The script is so dry you could use it to start a fire with it. My husband and I got half way through it before we shut it off."},{"rating":"1","title":"There is no \\"There\\" here....","review":"Juno is a whole lotta nuthin. Some people call it witty,funny, etc.. *YAWN*..Its not very interesting and the whole plot is pretty silly. Teenagers talk like this? Really?? Not any that I know; grunting maybe..One reviewer called it \\"an irresponsible movie\\", I tend to agree. Getting pregnant in high school used to be a bad thing - not anymore. Now rich white people looking to adopt will run to your door if you get stuck with a baby at 16; well, if you have a white, healthy baby (They ARE worth lots of $$$)..Juno is a whole lotta sizzle and no steak. Its not a horrible movie, but its not worthy of all the hype."},{"rating":"2","title":"Class homework","review":"I ejoyed the movie, it was real convient for me to watch it from my computer because the movie was part of a home work assignment."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible","review":"There are a lot of bad comedies out there. And surely Juno can't be the worst of the lot.But in a sense it is because it masquerades itself as intelligent, witty and interesting. And it is none of those things. Just a pretentious bore centered around the most annoying heroine ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible piece of cinema","review":"i wanted to like this movie after all they hype that had been showered upon it. i became a michael cera fan after arrested development. ellen page is a great actress, too, and is amazing in a lesser known film called hard candy. juno however sucked the life out of me with all its \\"cool\\" dialogue. i'm sorry but even the coolest of cool high school girls can't pull off that level of omniscience. this pedantic jv chic was shoving all this coolness down my throat and it was just too big of a pretentious pill to swallow. this movie was far from honest. the script tried way too hard to have the characters say just the right thing while dripping with just the right amount of sarcasm. this diablo cody chic probably stayed up many late nights over her typewriter trying to find the perfect quip or insult for her title character to mutter. it was just awful and painful to watch. hey diablo...if you want to learn how teenagers talk take a tip from john hughes!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I can't believe this was written by a woman. The dialogue is totally unbelievable, abortion clinics are horribly portrayed, and Ellen Page is totally unrealistic. She cries once. And takes pregnancy tests in public, discussing them in an offhand manner with the convenience store clerk. I found it insulting. Allison Janney is awesome, and so is Jennifer Garner, but those are the only likeable characters. Well, and Michael Cera, of course."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly fun movie","review":"Juno (Single-Disc Edition)Recommended by my daughter. I wasn't sure if I would enjoy this movie, but it was fun and entertaining. I look forward to seeing it again. Good vacation movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intelligent, Entertaining, and Sweet","review":"First off, I'm going to agree with the other reviewers who said that some of the opening scenes are pretty awkwardly written. That being said, \\"Juno\\" is a very well-done movie definetly worth watching. Ellen Paige breathes so much life into her unique character, a confident wierdo who's also very intelligent and complex, and there is no doubt you'll fall in love with her soon after meeting her. In fact, most of the characters are very well crafted, with the exception of maybe two, who are added for comedic effect but still sort of take away from the film. Definetly check this out, you'll enjoy it and maybe even love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ellen Page Creates a Unique Character","review":"Ellen Page is a really talented actor. If you want to get an idea of her range, compare \\"Juno\\" to \\"Hard Candy.\\" Ellen has great dialogue to work with, written by the quirky and smart Diablo Cody. Together they have brought a female character to the screen who is intelligent, funny, has heart, and is truly an individual. Highly recommended for adults and older teens."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing","review":"this is a touching story about a 16 yo girl who gets pregnant and then decides to give the baby up for adoption. It is witty, sweet and endearing. Highly recommend to any and everyone! The movie is written in such a comical way, I was laughing the whole time, because of the dialogue. The story was touching, by the end I was so attached to all the characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"its just there.","review":"This movie has to be the perfect example of a hipster/scenester turned script writer. If this is what i have to look forward to in films that are considered \\"edgy and different\\" i'd rather watch the paint peel. Let's see what this film had working for itself- Juno- she is my high school nightmare. the edgy girl who has \\"eclectic\\" taste in music, who thinks she's original and talks with \\"witty\\" quips.....well, i didn't have any sympathy or connection to this character. I found her pretentious and annoying. This doesn't help when the film is titled after the main character. I thought the music in the film was ridiculous...and i have an open mind when it comes to music. i will be getting on my knees and praying that the hipster set doesn't start making movies in droves."},{"rating":"2","title":"I've never been pregnant","review":"but I imagine it is a bit more emotional than how it was portrayed. That aside I felt it was a great movie and quite funny. I've heard a lot of people say the dialogue is too \\"hipster\\" but I'm not sure what that means. I found it easy enough to follow and nothing struck me as that unusual in her music references either. When I was in highschool we frequently would reference older bands as she does. One of the major criticisms of this movie seems to be that it is contrived but I disagree. I find those pregnant teen movies where the girl is taken advantage of acts helpless to be somewhat annoying. Juno acts like a real person which is something movies don't get right enough for young women."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excrutiating....","review":"Dear heavens, this movie just tried a little too hard to be indie, cutesy and edgy. Those things should happen naturally, not someone sitting down at a screen and saying hmmm, let me write something indie and cutesy. Utterly unbelievable look at teenage pregnancy, this movie still hurts my brain whenever I think about it. I give it two stars because the ending was oddly touching if predictable, and I love the song \\"Superstar\\" and have since downloaded the very cool Sonic Youth version featured in the film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than a TV movie","review":"My husband and I rented this on a rainey Saturday night, not expection that great of a film, but my daughter gave it such great reviews. I have to say that Ellen Page is the actress that made this film better than a TV movie. She played the part of JUNO like she actually lived it in reality. The ending is unexpectably sad. Good performance from Jason Bateman. Jennifer Garner played the part of the lame and pathetic wife of Bateman who in the end loses her husband to get the one thing she has always wanted in her marriage a child. Rent it it is not bad for not quite a two hour time. The writing is the real winner in this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Refreshing look at an avoided subject","review":"This movie deserves full marks for an original portrayal of an unplanned teenage pregnancy - a topic which does not especially interest the movie industry but which is a huge problem in the US. It also gives an honest insight into the abundant numbers of dysfunctional families who have no business adopting kids.Juno MacGuff is a funny and complex character played very well by Ellen Page. This movie is funny at times - especially Juno's dad who is brilliantly portrayed by Simmons.This is a thoughtful movie and should not disappoint those who like films with a social message.In my opinion, this movie should be seen by every teenage kid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trying too hard.","review":"Have you ever known someone who put a tremendous amount of effort into being cool? They played guitar 'cause it was cool, were obsessed with classic rock even though they were born after Boy George was popular 'cause that's cool, say quippy little remarks and not care about anything because they are so cool, can rattle off obscure horror film directors, hang in living room furniture on the front lawn, have wacky bedroom decor and accessories like a food-shaped utilities cause they are so cool? If those people bug you, then like me, you will not enjoy this film. I get that sixteen-year-olds thought this film was really awesome. I think it is kind of pathetic that people who have gone to their ten-year high school reunions thought this was a really good film. It tried so hard to be cool it actually hurt to watch. This movie simply will not stand the test of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad batch?","review":"Upon receiving my DVD (I already knew I liked this movie a lot, so that's not the problem), I discovered that the DVD wouldn't play in my Xbox. I haven't been able to try it in any other devices yet but this is pretty disappointing since I typically use the Xbox to watch movies at home."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Unrealistic","review":"Not that all movies have to be realistic, but it is clear that the people behind this movie have never been around a pregnant 16-year-old. Apathy and jokes do not make an unwanted pregnancy easier. Because of this, it was tough for me to watch this movie and accept Juno as a character.There some funny moments, and J.K Simmons and Allison Janney steal the show as Juno's parents with their insight and willingness to stand up for their daughter.Too bad their daughter is nothing close to reality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Acting","review":"This movie has such terrible acting and a typical role by the actor who plays the baby daddy of Juno. I will never see this movie again."},{"rating":"1","title":"False piece of crap","review":"This movie is the falsest piece of crap ever. I'm a teacher, and I've had many students get pregnant.

This wore me out scene after scene (I didn't make it to the part where she softens up per the story formula). Michael Cera in the same role again (please don't become another Jason Alexander!).I wanted to like this, I really did.

She went everywhere trying to figure out who it was because she really wanted to help. When it all came down to it all it was, was a little kid playing with her doll on the phone. Her doll was saying, \\"Help, help.\\"I would recommend this to people because it shows how much people care for little things like someone saying help.

I highly recommend this calculater, it's easy to use, as fast (or faster in my expierence) in graphing sine functions when compared to TI's, and the price is unbeliveable (I got mine for $49).

Sharrock's playing is the seed for no wave and skronk (Thurston Moore, Arto Lindsay owe Sonny a debt of gratitude). On \\"Black Woman\\" Sonny's guitarwork is coupled with his wife Linda's sexy/scary/spiritual voice. At times, the songs are like eavesdropping on lover's getting their groove on. Milford Graves playes drums judiciously, but not tentatively.This great record will freak you out the first time you play it, I promise.

This spring collects hair and soap scum, eventually causing the drain to stop flowing. So much for the \\"ClearFlo\\" marketing hype. And according to Kohler support it was DESIGNED to do this? Designed to require tools for basic cleaning? That's plain stupid.What's worse is you have to totally disassemble the overflow cover to get at it. This requires using a philips screwdriver. WTF? Be ready to head out to the hardware store to buy new screws if you accidentally drop them. Then you have to take great care not to disturb the adjuster, it's fragile.

This set also includes some bonus tracks, including demos and live versions of songs... The problem is, some of these are not worth the space, and this waste keeps the tracks \\"Summertime Blues\\" and the full version of \\"Hell's Angel's Cracker Factory\\" from making it on. I also do not like how the album covers have been reduced to 1x1 inch thumbnails inside of the jacket, although there are some nice liner notes.

I bought a Mckensie D lumbar roll to compensate for the lack of back support, but with the way this chair is designed, no back support will EVER stay comfortably in place as the lower part of the back is not as wide as the top and slants down at an angle.

Only thing worth seeing in this movie is Judd portraying her best Hall Berry \\"Moster's Ball\\" role, in becoming a nymphomaniac.Wait for cable, nothing more to say."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, Ashley","review":"I love Ashley Judd. She is easily one of my favorite actresses ever. She is talented, gorgeous, sexy, compassionate, and whip smart. But she has one major flaw: Picking roles!Apart from a handful of either deep or fun movies, Ashley has been in some monstrous stinkers. And the key to this problem is also one major flaw: She has said more than once that she picks her movies based not on what the script is like but on who the director is.Unfortunately, that has led to a career making films with either flaky indie auteurs or has-been directors who were great back in the day. They directed or wrote Oscar-nominated films in the 1970s and 80s but have since fallen into disrepair. Such is the case with \\"Twisted\\" director Philip Kaufman.Please, Ashley, pick a good script next time. You might even win an Oscar yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was dumb","review":"Well we got Ashley Judd here, but to tell the truth she didn't look too good in this movie. Short hair may look great on Pat Benatar, but it made Ashley look pretty butch. Considering she's trying to play a tough, no nonsense homicide detective, she's also playing a [...] who sleeps around.A string of murders points the finger at Ashley because they are men she's slept with. Halfway through the movie even a dimwit can figure out who's behind this.This movie was boring, unbelievably inane, and held little interest. I mean c'mon the only nudity we got was a dude's hairy [...]. Ashley Judd is a good actress, but this movie did not suit her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Who-Done-It","review":"Some of us movie watchers don't like to look too deeply into what the Director was trying to show; we just love to see an entertaining story and hope we can figure out the killer before it is revealed to us.

Don't let that happen to you, this clunker sits squarely in the list of promising movies gone down the drain because some underemployed scriptwriter thought it cool to stage a twist-a-thon, with a beaten-to-death theme of a suffering cop investigating a series of murders (in The Bone Collector style) where the murderous psycho ends up being either one of the main characters or a friend. It doesn't help the cause that Judd is no Kim Basinger, and the intimate scenes (perhaps the only possible selling point in absence of a discernible plot) are thus about as titillating as a Yoga workout. The movie is decently made but the director clearly had very little marrow in the script to suck on. Skippable tripe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Underrated Cop Movie","review":"Judd, Garcia, and Jackson do fine performances in this cop movie. This is not a typical Judd \\"Double Jeopardy\\" or \\"High Crimes\\" style movie. She plays a cop investigating a murder. When the men she sleeps with start showing up dead, the tension builds. There are no open clues as to the killers identity, so it will take some real detective work on your part to figure out the murderer before Judd does. Well worth renting at least, and I plan to buy it and add to my Judd DVD collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"It could have been good but it's really, really baaad","review":"Not much to add. It's as close to a dog as 2 stars can make it. Why not a 1 star rating? Because of the cinematography which is excellent. Acting is letargic.

Yes, after 15 minutes anyone can. This is a very by-the-numbers crime drama, its alot like most of the star-filled TV mystery shows.The object of this exercise is to display Ashley Judd in racy scenes with Andy Garcia (at that point in the film you are supposed to say \\"ooooooh\\").

Andy Garcia (The Unsaid, Black Rain) is a pompous detective who is also working the case and Samuel L. Jackson (Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill Vol. 2 (cameo) is in this just because what movie doesnt have Samuel L. Jackson in it? The suspense is nothing and the acting is bland and milk toast. Garcia looks like he's trying to hold a fart in. Jackson looks like a black Atticus Finch and Judd is in another movie where she sprouts I can take care of myself (High Crimes, Double Jepordy, Kiss The Girls). Also starring Camryn Manheim (Practice, 10th Kingdom), David Straithain (River Wild, Matewan), D.W. Moffett (Thirteen, Kill Me Later), Leland Oser (Bone Collector, Seven) and Mark Perigino (Mulholland Dr., The Hunted).

An utterly mediocre movie by a good director - the only real mystery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure trash.","review":"Twisted starring Ashley Judd is the most offensive piece of garbage I have ever seen! Judd's character is a cop who sleeps around with suspects, coworkers, etc. Her character is so heartless and pathetic, you have no sympathy for her. Samuel L.

Do me a favor and stay clear from this massacre!"},{"rating":"1","title":"How much money was wasted making this?","review":"This movie is terrible, all the more given the talent involved. Andy Garcia, Samuel L. Jackson and Ashley Judd all give awful performances which can't really be helped given the horrible dialog they are given to say and the stupid things they are given to do. The plot is Ashley Judd plays an alcoholic cop who sleeps with men she picks up at the local bars. The men she's been with start turning up dead and she is logically the main suspect. In the end it doesn't matter what the movie is about because it's all done so badly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do the Twisted","review":"I think when many say they knew after 15 minutes who the killer was, they're actually saying they guessed who the killer was and just happened to be right.Think about this for a moment: What was the motive? That was something I never figured out. The killer didn't have a motive. That's what threw me off. But I guess some would say a crazed killer doesn't need a motive. But come on! Even the deranged killer in 7even had a reason for killing. Even Norman Bates had a reason for killing.It could be the reason was explained but I just missed it because the movie was so terrible. I don't know. I really don't want to have to watch the whole movie again to figure it out.I know if you have a lot of high profile actors in secondary roles, one of them is the killer for sure; but you're thrown off by the fact that you have Andy Garcia, D.W.

So all 3 are fair game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ashley Judd should know better!","review":"I rented Twisted primarily because Ashley Judd was in it...love her movies; i.e. Kiss the Girls and Double Jeopardy...both fabulous movies.

Ashley, Ashley, what were you thinking dear?? You can do better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much to get excited about here","review":"Ashley Judd while delightful to look at, finds herself miss-cast yet again, this time as a tough and sexually aggressive female cop. Meanwhile Samuel L. Jackson and Andy Garcia seem better cast in their roles as fellow police department members. The plot follows a series of so-what murders in which Judd's character emerges as a possible suspect. While the movie is entertaining on the surface it never has enough credibility to draw you deeper in. The final big plot twist lacks any great kick, leaving the movie less than memorable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing to write home about.","review":"The review on the cover of the DVD reads \\"A snappy, sexy thriller...\\" I must disagree. This was the most unsexy, and unthrilling movie I've seen in a long time. In my opinion Ashley Judd doses not fit this roll, it's almost comedic.Twisted is poorly written and losely held to gether by okay acting. Seems the actors were doing the best they could with what they had. I have no doubt the producers and director felt the story had potential but they failed to realize that with this production.The film's ending holds an interesting twist but too many lose ends are left to the viewers imagination.

The first question of the pre-test is not even possible to answer correctly because the answer choices given do not include the answer posted for the question in the back of the book.

Unlike their debut, Flock of Seagulls explore darker, more disturbing territory with these tracks, though they throw in just enough of their trademark pop hooks to make it their own. I think Mike Score must have been listening to alot of Joy Division and Suicide when he put these songs together, however, the rest of the lads joined ranks to smooth it out and give it that ever so polished sheen. Highlights include the classic \\"Wishing\\", the menacing \\"Nightmares\\" and the the ever so dark wave inspired \\"The Traveller\\".
