How can a person who basically looks like he has down syndrome, think he has talent? other than that to william i will say stick to engineering, but get some street smarts, not book smarts, then you would see what kind of ridiculous nonsense you have walked into. Besides that an Asian singing Bailamos? Isnt that spanish for \\"we dance.\\" all i have to say is lets keep it spanish. I can't believe hwo freakin dumb people are to want this. I mean i heard it on AOL and laughed until i peed. It was dreadful and i can't believe anyone could want to hear this piece of flynt.

Just because the American Idol judges said no, he didn't give up his dreams of becoming a singer, and look at where he is now! Bottom line: WILLIAM HUNG ENJOYS SINGING. Some of the songs on the CD are actually pretty catchy. So I say, give this CD a try!(P.S.

If Hung had an ounce of self respect, he would've never signed a contract with the record companies who are just there to make a mockery out of him, but then again he's just as horrible as they are, if you ask me they're nothing but a bunch of money hungry opportunists. At the end, this is nothing but an album about a person degrading himself in order to make money. This thing just leaves a bitter taste in your mouth, and it's an insult to any artist. It's not even garbage pick worthy."},{"rating":"1","title":"William Hung you're outta style","review":"When is this guy gonna realize that he cannot carry a tune? I listened to samples of William Hung's debut album and believe me this cd is a joke and I DO NOT know why William Hung recorded a cd in the first place. Why I think this cd was put out was because William Hung wanted fans to enjoy his singing. So please avoid this album at all costs.

After his embarrassing performance of \\"She Bangs\\" on American Idol, he was given a record deal, something that required no talent to do.With his fresh off-the-boat accent and off-key singing, Hung is perhaps as bad or worse than karaoke night in a bar. He is perhaps a humanized version of the Asian stereotype. Seeing that he has no talent, he can't even write his own songs, so instead he has to butcher classic (and some already bad) songs such as Hotel California. In this CD, he has preludes and interludes of him speaking words of inspiration, which do nothing but to inspire you to plug your ears. The CD could be considered a comedy record, because it might make you laugh, and that's why I say to take a listen to it, even though his 15 minutes of fame have died a long time ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't recommend it.","review":"Okay. Everybody thinks William Hung is a really bad singer. Everyone's right. Even though he wants to sing, he can't. It's like Don Vito from Viva La Bam wanting to model a bikini...and they'd make that an episode if they wanted to. William Hung may have had his 15 minutes of fame on American Idol, but I don't address that as fame. I'd rather address it as shame. Anyway, William Hung is the worst singer I have ever heard. Even though William Hung has \\"presevrebrance\\" --the way he said it on his album--he needs to do us all a favor and stop singing for the rest of his life--in the shower-preferably. You shouldn't go to your local music store and buy this album. Overall, William Hung doesn't bang in this album and I give it a mere 1 out 5."},{"rating":"1","title":"There's a lesson to be learned here.....","review":"First of all I agree that Hung has but an ounce of vocal talent, but it only goes to show how far someone can go with so little. This album belongs in the comedy section next to Weird Al or Carrot Top. The only difference is Hung does not see himself as a comedian.So many people yearn for their 15 minutes of fame. Well, you can blame Hung for taking up some of your 15 minutes.One thing I actually did like about the album are his personal reflections. He admits he does not have the best voice, but he just plain loves to sing. And (although not evident)he sings with passion and encourages others to do the same without feeling ashamed, to be yourself.If anything was gained from this album, it was a good chuckle, a reminder to go after your dreams no matter the obstacles, and another item to add to the next yard sale \\"free\\" pile."},{"rating":"2","title":"HILARIOUS","review":"OK, you saw him on American Idol, and you know you couldn't stop laughing right? Well, this is William Hung's album, and it's out of control! From begining to end I was thinking, this is insane, are you serious?

You'll thank me for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"An embarassment","review":"This album is only a joke. Don't take it seriously. It's an embarassment to the music industry.

I thought he had a record deal?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow...Music At It's Worst","review":"Well I didn't buy this cd but have listened to it. I just want to say this is really sad the record labels would put time and effort into something that really shouldn't have effort put into it. This guy can't think let alone sing. So what makes it right for him to make millions why the rest of us struggling artist are looking for a deal. This is the most ridiculous album ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsure what is going on...","review":"William definately gives hope to showing that we can have talents other than what other people expect from us. He has become the American Idol without all the stress of the TV appearances of the other idols. What a cheat - but that is the way show biz works - and life for that matter. Way to go William.I hated the singing though."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a shame this is what we've come to...","review":"It makes me sad to think that garbage like this is actually available to purchase. Is the music industry so lacking in talent that it's necesary to release an album that essentially makes fun of someone who can't sing? No true music lover takes William Hung seriously, and whoever was responsible for getting this album recorded only had one thing in mind - making a quick buck. Does good music not matter anymore? There are truly talented musicians out there who struggle for years before landing a record deal, and some never do. William Hung goes on American Idol and makes a complete idiot of himself and all of a sudden has an album out? I no longer need any evidence to say without a doubt the music industry is a complete and pathetic joke."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Sad Joke","review":"It's nothing against the guy, but why the heck is this even being released? Are we going to remember him a year from now??? Ummm....no. He's just a poor guy who is being used. He probably does not even realize how horribly untalented he is and a mean-spirited public is taking advantage of it. People will not buy this album for good music. They will buy it to laugh at him so they can feel better about themselves. Talented people struggle and work hard in the music buisness for a record deal. For some it takes years and some people do not get one at all. William Hung makes a fool out of himself and gets one basicly overnight.William Hung....you are NOT an inspiration. You are a joke. A few months ago, you will be doing VH1 and MTV specials saying \\"Hi, remember me? I'm the She-Bangs guy\\" and you will wonder why no one cares. Thank you for ruining the music buisness even more."},{"rating":"2","title":"A True Inspiration","review":"People don't understand the true part of William. It's sad how people also make fun of William Hung because of his 'bad' singing. William Hung is famous because of his attitude toward everything-how he is so optomistic. He is also famous because he makes us all laugh, and how he takes singing not as something big (like most artists today), but as something to have fun with, making all of us have fun listening to his songs. So, William Hung is a true hero to me, and whoever dishrags him shuld go to he** (little kids might be reading this). Best of luck William!"},{"rating":"1","title":"poor man","review":"this poor man was only given an album to be made fun of. poor guy. 1 star for the record company who released this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Farce, Fool, or Victim","review":"William Hung's recording (I wouldn't dare call this an album or CD as that would imply that it contained music) exemplifies what American society has fallen to. We are so starved for entertainment that it appears we are now willing to listen a to someone with no discernable talent under the pretext that it's funny. I can go with that but, somehow we forgot that it was only funny once. This poor guy is spending his 15 minutes of fame as a laughing stock. Shame on us! Good for William. I hope he takes everybody's money and sings all the way to the bank."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outsider Music for the Masses","review":"This album, much like The Shaggs' \\"Philosophy of the World\\" or The Langley Schools Music Project's \\"Innocence & Despair\\", is fascinatingly authentic. Hung can't sing or dance, but he is genuine in a way that virtually no other comtemporary singer is (with perhaps the exception of the rare Cedric Bixler or Thom Yorke). This is what punk music aspired to be: atonal and sparsely emotional. In a way, William Hung is a modern-day Schoenberg. He is missing notes in the grandest fashion: filled with emotion and fascinating.I do not laugh at this album. It is a very sad album, especially knowing that it is only a matter of time until Hung is forgotten.4 stars to this unintentionally brilliant work of art."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous! Horrifying Humiliation for Hung!","review":"This is a horrible case of people trying to make money off of someones misery. This record was made as a joke, and people are buying it as a joke. Come on, is this going to be something people are going to keep and listen to for years? More likely it will end up at garage sales and thrift stores around the country, if not the trash!It is so wrong to take this poor kid, and humilate him (even though he agrees to it), cause I really don't think he realizes that people are laughing at him. Don't buy this record just to mock this guy.

The fact that somebody like this can get a record deal and release an album like this. Most of the songs are covers anyway, can't he write an album of his own songs?. Then again, knowing the idiocy of the general public, they'll probably eat this album up out of curiousity."},{"rating":"1","title":"why can't we have a zero star rating.","review":"I don't have this album. I don't plan on buying this album. The fact that this awful sounding man who resembles a billy goat on an acid trip, has become a star, is a scary scary thought.Everytime I see Mr. Hung singing I'm reminded of Rosanne Barr screetching the National Anthem,and Ozzy Osbourne's horrid rendition of \\"Take Me Out to the Ball Game\\", both of which happened at Wrigley Field.Though I am a fan of Ozzy, I think he was horrible with \\"Take Me Out To The Ball Game\\".Mr. Hung, and his fan base, are further proof of the downfall of the music world. The charts, fame, and money, used to be the product of hard work and talent. There was a day when people who couldn't sing didn't last. The list of these wannabe artists is just way too long to list.I guess the days of real talent, and real voices being the measure of fame and fortune are over in the music industry as we know it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would like to give a negative 1 million stars","review":"Man, this boy is so whack that he needs help.

But now this has gone too far. Although this man is being exploited, I would not be so quick to say he is \\"mildly retarded.\\" In fact, I think that he is sharp as a whip, and knows exactly what he is doing. He found a very easy way to rake in millions of dollars. He admits to not being a good singer in his \\"inspirational words of passion,\\" saying he enjoys singing, and sings from his heart. So do a lot of other people.

None of this charm is carried over into this album.Karaoke backing tracks do little to compliment the attempts at singing. Even the signature tune \\"she bangs\\" has a flat feel to it.Well done to William for making some money but avoid this album like the plague unless you want to punish your eardrums."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save yourself","review":"It's just wrong for the record label to sign this guy just so people buy his album to ridicule him.

I feel sorry for the guy because people are laughing at him, not with him but he doesn't know. As for this CD, his rendition of Hotel California has forever tainted that song. I couldn't bring myself to listen to the entire CD because I need to clean my listening palette.

What a poor, pathetic guy this is ... and from what I have read, he is really being played by people. I am old enough that I can remember carnival side-shows where one would pony up a few bucks to gawk at morbidly obese men and women, hermaphrodites, dwarfs, and the like. Even as a child, I felt a sense of shame in taking amusement from these 'entertainments'. And here we are again, amusing ourselves with a hapless, talent-free fellow. My only positive thought here is at least the poor guy is making a few bucks. I think it is time to stop laughing at Hung, and pursue better entertainment. For everyones' sake."},{"rating":"1","title":"The World has gone nuts","review":"This guy thinks he can sing, well he is dreaming. I am alot better than William Hung. He doesn't sound good when he tries to hit the high notes. He murders every song he sings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Probably the worst trend ever","review":"American Idol is one of the most shallow and trite piles of garbage on television, so it was no surprise that something that is already supposed to be a mocking of modern music is godawful beyond all description.This album was predetermined, because if you have ever watched any of the show you'd know that William Hung was an obvious plant by the producers. His lines were scripted and played for laughs, so this disgraceful CD is a fraud in more ways than one.If you enjoy making fun of foriengers because they can barely speak english, well then you're the target audience for this crap.The joke barely lasts one song and the rest....well, it's exactly as you'd assume. Take advantage of the sample downloads they give you here at amazon.com to see that even thirty seconds of this trash is enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"The First Masterpiece of 2004","review":"Mr. Hung has the voice of an angel, and the face of a star. He mixes his powerful voice, strong emotion, and Asian pride to mesmerizing effect. \\"Y.M.C.A\\" is filled with more campy delight than the original, and he sings latin songs with more passion than enrique or ricky could ever muster. If youre wondering why you must buy this album now, I have one word...Genius. With all these bubble gum pop stars lip synching or using electronics to enhance their music, it is refreshing to hear such a pure, honest voice. William Hung is a star in the making. He has battled haters, such as simon from american idol, but he will always bounce back with a triumphant spirit. This album captures that spirit in all its glory. Pick it up now, thank me later."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better than Kelly Clarkson but jagged like his teeth","review":"This album is so funny. Yet he's no way to stay around for awhile. But I think this Cd is better than Kelly Clarkson, Justin, & Clay's CD. Its the second best of all those who were in the American Idol(Ruben being first).

This is all so stupid!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This gag has gone too far","review":"Admittedly, I've only heard clips of one or two songs from this album, but that was plenty. With all the attention this man is getting on American Idol (plus all the other talk shows), no one seems willing to state the obvious: HE CAN\\"T SING! He has NO conceivable talent whatsoever! There have been geniunely gifted A.I. contestants who haven't received a fraction of this idiot's exposure. The only accomplishment here (if you can call it that) is we've found a way to make fun of Asians without being accused of being politcally incorrect. Good job Wiiliam! You must be so proud.

No zero star rating?","review":"I think the joke has gone far enough. It's bad enough that this tone deaf no-talent has received as much press as he has, but to actually release an entire CD? It reminds me of this Christmas album we have with cats meowing out Christmas classics. It's really funny for the first several songs, but to listen to the whole album would drive you over the edge. I sincerely feel sorry for this guy. He really thinks he's good and hasn't clued into the fact that we're all laughing at him and sadistically encourage him to make a fool out of himself for our entertainment.

People who are going to buy this CD are obviously missing a few cards in he deck.

Of these, the vast majority are either Ivies, other highly selective private schools or a few prestigious state universities (e.g.,Berkeley). The target audience for this book consists of honor students with minimum board scores of 1,300 or better. It provides little meaningful information for the 'B' average student. When I first learned of this book, I expected that it would be a useful resource compared to the vanilla comments in college guides by Peterson, Fiske and especially Kaplan. I was mistaken. If your child is an honor student, the book does provide some useful insights about core curriculum, faculty leanings and campus political climate."},{"rating":"1","title":"the closing of the American mind","review":"This book, like so many voices in America today, tells readers to avoid exposure to facts and arguments from different political perspectives. Is the case for the Right today so intellectually fragile that students need to be counseled to avoid certain classes, programs, and colleges, lest they be \\"corrupted\\"?This promotes a \\"hear no evil\\" dumbing-down of American culture and politics, leading to the current decay of true conservatism in this country. Surely conservatives would do better by counseling their children to seek out diverse sources of information that will challenge their assumptions and force them to sharpen their intellectual skills."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong Person Writing Intro","review":"I reviewed this book and its actually pretty good. I wonder though, what old high roller Bennett had to contibute...the top schools nearest to casinos? How about slots between classes?

You are only feeding an addiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, Priest isn't Priest without Halford","review":"If you are looking for the original captivating Judas Priest sound you won't find it on Live in London. Without Halford, JP sounds like every other metal band. Ripper is a great vocalist and he does his job well however, Ripper cannot match Halford's vocal range and ability to harmonize with the lead guitar. To a new listener Live in London will have plenty of energy but, to those looking for vintage Priest it's not here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Real Deal","review":"Despite the fact that this album has a majority of the band's greatest hits, the Ripper era was not their heyday. Ripper is no Halford.I was fooled into purchasing this album by Ticketmaster.

The sound is less 80's pop and much more anthemic and at times militaristic (ie. \\"My Revenge On The World\\" and \\"Infiltrating My Way Through The System\\").

The site never mentioned it was for \\"10 and under\\" ... site just said \\"youth\\" so I assumed it was for kids up to at least 14 or so years (amazon rep even agreed it should be up to 15). With that said, I will order my son the adult size because he needs this for football with the tether/pull string and his main teeth are permanet, not baby teeth. It is NOT made for braces like the Shock Doctor Double Braces Strapless Mouthguard. It is narrow and may work on normal teeth just fine. It is Latex Free.

How could I go wrong?\\"Well, there are a couple of big problems.First, a lot of space is devoted to covers that Neal rendered. It was a common tactic at DC to have Adams do a cover for a book whose story was illustrated by an inferior artists. They generally promise a story with far more gravity than what's actually presented inisde. An extra story or two could have easily been squeezed into that space.Second--and most disappointing--is that Dick Giordano inks most of Adams' illustrations, and his thick-stroked style does not merge gracefully with Adams' organic and graceful contours. The end result is that instead of enhancing Adams' pencilwork, he often just drew right over it. Thus, a great deal of the illustrations here don't resemble what fans have come to recognize as Neal Adams' handywork."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as I expected it","review":"Installed easly on Sierra 2500HD 08, but it was waste of time and money.my stock was functioning way better than Gabriel ultra.I really dont know what to install.this is my first time to install shock abzorber other than stock.Ultra here has no relation to ULTRA."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this book!","review":"I am taking a class of forecasting and inventory control, and hoped this book could give me some more ideas and tools to work in excel.It is worthless, It is a summary of any forecasting and inventory book with many errors in concept.

Although this book has ten chapters, I found the chapters on The Persuasive Personality, Prerequisites to Power and The manual for master salesmanshipparticularly noteworthy.Someof the other information does reat from Think & Grow Rich but that didn't stop me from picking up a new idea or two this time around.Get this book and learn The Power of Positve Persuasion.

Some of it is a little silly, and I gleam over those parts in a rush.

I am beginning to apply many of the principles for the first time... its not a magic formula, but it has initiated noticeable progress where before I was stagnating for some time. Its small and easy to carry around to read when you only have one or two minutes available.The only strange thing about this edition is that authorship is credited to Napoleon Hill, but much of the book speaks of Hill in third person, as if the revising author (who I think is W.

Sometimes has that desolate, far away sound similar to Renaissance,Aphrodites Child or early Genesis.Hammond organ is the primary insturment with piano doing the more mellower stuff. Rockers such as After the war, Light we see, and Apache 69 contain some excellent guitar and bass guitar work.The jazzy tango from Graham Bond, Spanish Blues and beautiful ballads like Extra Hour and my favorite Chances are all outstanding,not a weak track anywhere.

The volume is well designed, as might be expected from a mainline publisher (Harper Collins) and the text is informative. While the book yields a good notion of who Ms. Stuart Scott was, a better exposition of Ms. Stuart Scott's 'crustiness' would probably have increased our understanding. There are the inevitable errors, of course, including an unfortunate caption of a photograph (on page 49) mistakenly identifying Lincoln Beachey as the aviator of a Wright biplane. Also, there is confusion about the supposed role of a non-existent sand bag in the fatal fall of Harriet Quimby and William Willard at Squantum, Massachusetts, in 1911.

Great item."},{"rating":"2","title":"Twins love it but doesn't work in a tall cased opening","review":"We have twin daughters who love this but we have a large cased opening and we knew that would be perfect.

This is much better and cheaper than the exersaucer and he likes it a lot more!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Made Correctly","review":"This item is SO frustrating. What would seem to be a very easy toy to put together cost me over an hour of wasted time. The seat was not made correctly and I could not get it to fit on the frame.

He is 22 lbs (under the 25lb limit) and the height was adjusted properly so that only the front part of his feet were on the ground.I've contacted Graco Baby - don't know if just ours was defective, or there is a design problem. If you do use a jumper, follow the instructions to the letter. Thankfully, we did, and we were right there to pick up baby and console him."},{"rating":"2","title":"We LOVE the jumpster","review":"I would have given this item 5 stars if it weren't for one thing...does anyone else think it's hard to lift the baby out of it?My son is 4 months old, and he is still pretty small for the seat. We stuff a little pillow behind his back to support him better, but he just loves it!!! The only thing we have trouble with is lifting him out of it. The seat fabric grabs onto his legs when we pull him out, and it gets turned inside out and it makes it harder to \\"free\\" him from the apparatus. No biggie, so far he doesn't seem to mind the ordeal. I guess I will have to work on perfecting my technique...Great fun for all. My husband and I just sit in our living room and giggle at our son because he won't stop squealing in delight...Who needs TV when we have this???"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT, GREAT, GREAT","review":"I bought this when my son was 2 1/2 months. I would sit and help him learn to use his legs and to control his head and body better. Now at four months he uses it by himself and goes crazy. He bounces forever!!! His legs are strong and he is starting to learn to use his legs to stand up and walk. It is crazy! The only thing now is that he is taller than average at his age and is quickly outgrowing it. I love this product so much because he just smiles all the time in it. I hate to see him grow out of it so fast, but he had a great time in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"DANGEROUS.....","review":"Weighing 22 pounds, my daughter is within the size parameters for use of this toy.

Can someone clue me in--I've already shortened the nylon belt as much as possible. Thanks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed--short-lived and loud clanking sound","review":"We purchased this when our son was almost 3 months old. He is a very strong baby and tall for his age. At first he would only shuffle from side to side, but it wasn't long before he could jump like a kangaroo! We loved it and so did he, but now he is 5 months and weighs 18 lbs. He is too tall for it (or too heavy, but not sure why since the weight limit is 25 lbs). His ankles are touching the floor and can no longer sit in it with his feet in the proper position. It is not adjustable to make in any higher off of the ground. Now, we face the problem that our baby loves this but cannot be in it anymore, and he just turned 5 months. He is going through jumping-withdrawal! We could only use this product for 2 months.Also, with every jump it started to make a loud, clanking sound, coming from ABOVE the spring. That sound makes me nervous and I wonder if it is defective or about to break. I'm not convinced it is safe."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lot of fun","review":"i was hesitant to use a jumper, but we received one as a shower gift. my son just turned 4 months and loves to stand with assistance. so we decided to try the jumper. he loves it! just after three sessions, he is jumping and squealing, and spinning around. i am a little worried about pinched hands when he gets a little bigger and more aggressive, but the padded bumper does not mark up the walls. i feel this item is well constructed and easy to clean. it also does not take up too much storage room. i think this is a must-have item for new babies. they get great enjoyment from it and it helps to strengthen their legs."},{"rating":"1","title":"PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS!!!","review":"I do not own one of these myself, but my sister does. She had never used it until we went down to visit her. We placed my 6 month old daughter into the jumper and waited to see if she would like it. At first she was trying to get used to it...as soon as she got the hang of it and started to enjoy it, the seat unlatched itself from the hooks...it happened so unbelievable quick...the next thing i know my daughter is screaming and crying at the top of her lungs...she'd fallen through the base (with the seat still around her bottom) and hit her head on a sharp corner of the door frame...luckily...she wasn't seriously injured...but I can only imagine the dangerous possibilities...the engineering of this toy is rather stupid...please...for the sake of your child...don't buy this...it doesn't even deserve one star!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Active Babies Love This!","review":"My son is 7 months, and has been bouncing in this seat for 2 months.

I have tried manual reamers and electric juicers. I was excited to use one which could apply a lot of pressure quickly and with less effort. The only problem, and it is a big one, is that the juicer leaves a large portion of the flesh unsqueezed. When I use an electric juicer/reamer, there is very little flesh left. With this juicer, the top does not come down far enough onto the removable cup cap to squeeze the whole orange. As a result, you will waste about 25% of the juice. This problem is so obvious that I can take the juiced halves and squeeze more juice out with my bare hand. I will be seeking a refund. I am very disappointed. I can't believe this product is on the market with such poor performance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great for home ... not what I needed","review":"The unit is cheaply made, and literally bows out ward when used. It is very attractive, and does a good job squeezing a lemon, and would be fine in a home bar setting.

For a much better erotic movie get 'Victim of Desire' instead. If you do you will notice that 'Virtual Desire' has used some scenes of Julie Strain from 'Victim' as a filler in this one.

Don't be alarmed; they look dry and thin in the classic European manner of visual understatement. They taste MARVELLOUS, but no one steals them because they LOOK -- eh -- blah.

Is it about being downsized and having to work ...to survive, as some reviews would have you believe? Or is it about how much it ... to work a low-wage job, generally speaking? No. It's a middle-aged white guy playing at poor while his wife brings home the bacon. What is the point of this book? It escaped me entirely. Yeah, making sandwiches for a living ..., but everyone out there who has done it or continues to do it already knows that. I found this book insulting and condescending, much like that Barbara Eren--whoever book. The saddest part about the book is how poorly written it is. There're ample reasons to believe that it never would have been published if ben's last name weren't cheever, something he whines about with increasing shrillness throughout Selling Ben Cheever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Selling Ben Cheever","review":"I've got mixed feelings about Selling Ben Cheever. It is funny at times and the last ten pages or so almost redeem its worst moments, but I still can't wholeheartedly recommend it. I've been reading this book at a time when I find myself unemployed and at moments have been able to appreciate the book on this level. But the fact remains (and Cheever admits as much in the opening pages) that the author did not write this book because he was down and out. I remained conscious of this throughout reading the book and because of this I really couldn't take it too seriously-- it seemed to lack the sense of urgency and pain that accompany unemployment. For insights into those who find themselves unexpectedly cast into the service economy, don't read this book. For the occasional amusing anecdote about ridiculous jobs then this book might be for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would be mildly amusing if published as fiction","review":"Ben Cheever delights in toying around in the real world. I wish he would have had his little adventure then written a novel about it. It would make good light reading; a shallow tale of an immature spoiled rich kid in middle age that flirts with the dangerous real world and how he comes back none-the-wiser. By his admission it is an ersatz adventure. He feigns risk, hoping to enlighten us. Yet Cheever thinks he can ride the roller coaster and describe what its like to climb Mt. Everest. Why else would he publish it as non-fiction?

What's the point? Cheever drifts from job to job, rarely explaining why he left (fired? quit? needed more material for next chapter?). Nothing much seems to happen. Makes the two elementary mistakes of liberal arts majors: (1) confuses entry-level jobs with permanent ones, and (2) thinks there should be grown-ups out there who will provide him with \\"meaningful\\" and well-paid work, whether useful to society or valuable to others or not. The prose is prosaic and never rises above a monotone. Avoid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ego-driven visit to the masses","review":"Cheever by his own admission has never been a true working stiff. He never actually needed the several minimum-wage jobs he embarked upon in order to write this book. And there lies the problem.

Thus he has nothing genuine to say."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a bad, boring book","review":"This was a book that didn't need to be written and it is unfortunate that I wasted my time reading it. If it takes a day or less to train for a job, then you are going to be underpaid. If the highest qualification needed is passing the drug test, then you are going to be underpaid. The writer had to go undercover to figure that out? Maybe for his next book the writer will go undercover to the first grade to explain to us that while the first graders found the material challenging and thought provoking, he found it easy and beneath him. Skip this book and read \\"Nickel and Dimed\\" or \\"The Working Poor\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Valuable Book, Despite the Author's Attitude","review":"I found this book witty, insightful, and fascinating - until the epilogue. Until that point, I had blissfully misunderstood Mr. Cheever's attitude toward his jobs and his co-workers. I had incorrectly perceived that he regarded both with some respect. But in the final section, he demonstrates that he (like author Barbara Ehrenreich) has contempt and even horror for the type of work that he is chronicling, and that he assumes that anyone who sells computers or cars is doing so out of economic desperation.

Where is Findley's criticism of their far worse deeds? After all, they get a whole lot more aid, collectively, than Israel. I'll bet he's never thought of that, and most readers apparently haven't either. But what exactly does the U.S. get for its generous donations to Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, etc. etc. etc.?

We then only used Avent, and continue to use their sippy cups, she is now 18 months.For my nephew on the other hand, we found that his sucking reflexes are not as strong, and Avent's nipples were to tough for him. I bought him the Platex Nurser set and he's been doing great with those since.Final say: Great system, if not to hard for your child. I'd recommend buying one 4oz bottle and nipple of your two/three top choices and seeing which your child prefers before buying a whole set. If a gift, don't open until you know your child likes that type."},{"rating":"2","title":"You can prevent the leaking...","review":"We loved Avent bottles for our daughter who is now 2. The leaking drove me nuts until i realized you can prevent it just by wiping down the rim of the bottle before you screw on the nipple. i think that if a little water gets in there, it makes an air pocket so milk leaks through. just wiping them down to make sure they are dry and of course screwing on the nipple cap tightly will prevent leaking. these bottles are terrific."},{"rating":"1","title":"New moms don't buy these bottles!!","review":"I can get over the leaking part however these bottles flow way to fast for a newborn baby.

Breastfeeding is the best for every baby and mother, plus it does not cause gas. So I recommend that those of you that complain about the bottles and gas, how about breastfeeding?P.S.: when my son was six months old and I went back to work, we started using the Avent bottles for breastmilk and they are the best.

I even saw one mentioning that she had to switch to a different brand because of reflux.The bottom line is... They are convenient for breast feeding and interchanging, but they cause an extreme amount of gas when feeding, due to the awkward nipples that are provided. The bulbous base of the nipple, causes their lips to suck in air around the sides. The entire time they feed, you can actually hear tons of air flowing into their stomach. 5 stars for a product that \\"I just bought today\\" doesn't mean anything if you can only use it 1 day, because your child is screaming from colic due to the aweful engineering.I'd like to see more return reviews from people that used these more than a week."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Bottle","review":"Let me start by saying my son has had no problem switching between bottle and breast.

But, then again I've yet to invest in a bottle system. I've bought at least one of every bottle, except Dr. Browns - hoping someone will buy me some for my baby shower!I've not noticed a lot of bubbles in this. I have the VentAire bottles too and I've not noticed any difference in gas or colic. However, my son thus far seems to prefer the VentAire.

I think that any bottle that requires that much effort to ensure it works properly is not worth the money. Not only that but as my son was drinking I would hear the air bubbles which meant that he had to be burped quite frequently.

Her gas was so bad she developed diarrea which gave her a urinary tract infection and she spent 10 days in the hospital, she was only 3 weeks old. I don't know if mine was an isolated incident, but I recommend doing research before purchasing Avent bottles. Not every child benefits from them. Surprisingly enough, the good old fashioned Gerber Bottles and Playtex Ventair systems worked wonders for her gas. I also agree with previous reviewers' claims of leakage.

Also, my daughter had EXTREME gas from these bottles. She would SCREAM endlessly after every feeding. Even Mylicon wouldn't help her when using the Avent bottles. We switched to Dr. Brown's bottles and it is a remarkable difference. She doesn't scream and I actually look forward to feeding her!

My other daughter, who was smaller and didn't love feeding time as much, has never liked them. I don't know if it's the wide nipple that she doesn't like or the way the formula flows out... I registered for 2 of the starter sets. If I had to do it over again, I would have registered for 1 starter set and then a few other kinds of bottles to see which ones the babies preferred. Also, I had some flow issues with the nipples - some seemed to have no holes at all and although you are supposed to sterilize a pin and poke it through the tip, those nipples still never worked well and led to very slow feedings.

Sure enough I wasn't the only one struggling. Some of the good reviews gave advice on how to put the bottles together \\"correctly\\". No one should have to go through all that wasted formula or breast milk to get a bottle to work properly. I prefer a bottle that is easier to work with.

However, when we started our daughter on formula on day 3, we weren't able to use these bottles with her. She was a big baby but, her mouth wasn't quite big enough for these large nipples. She much prefers the Gerber newborn bottles or the playtex bottles. The nipples are too formed for her \\"taste\\". These bottles cost way more than the other brands and we had less problems with them. They aren't anywhere near worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good bottle system","review":"We like this bottle system. It is easy to mix the formula. Sometimes it leaks, but if you pay attention to what you're doing when you assemble the bottle, it's usually okay. Sometimes there is excess air in the bottle, but it's getting better. The nipple is fine--my baby basically went from breast to bottle and this bottle was fine. Easy to clean too. An all-around practical bottle. I may try different bottles out just for comparison, but this is a great standby."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still leaks","review":"I am currently using these bottles for my eight month old and have had problems with leaking all along. I read the instructions and they still leak. They say they may leak if the nipple is not on tight enough and they may leak if the nipple is screwed on too tight. I have tried making it tighter, looser, and everything in between and it isn't any better. There are times I have no idea how much my son actually got because most of it is leaking all over and getting him wet. I was going to just stick it out but since I have found out I am pregnant again, I will definitely be using a different brand. It's too frustrating to deal with the leaks and mess of these bottles. The positive thing about them, as other reviews have said, is that they are easy to clean with the wide opening."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the inexperienced but voracious eater","review":"If your newborn is a sucker like mine, do not get these bottles. The newborn nipple is too fast. I bought the entire line, having heard how wonderful the bottles were. Well, my kid gags and sputters through every feeding. I have read all of the tricks to get the bottles to not leak, it's a waste of time. I have switched to Dr. Brown, and they work great! Not to mention the ear ache issue of bottles without vents."},{"rating":"1","title":"I read the instructions, they still leak.","review":"Don't waste your time and money on these bottles. I know they're popular but I don't know why. They leak (yes, I read the instructions, to no avail). That's not the only problem, though. On my doctor's advice, I'm adding rice cereal to my daughter's formula. As far as I can tell, Avent doesn't offer nipples suitable for cereal, so my daughter can't eat out of these bottles anymore. She sucks and sucks but can't get any cereal out of the nipples. I'm now using my Dr. Brown's exclusively. They are great. They don't leak. Also, they cut down on air bubbles, which really helps with colicy babies. Best of all, they offer a Y-shaped nipple that's perfect for cereal. If you're a new or expecting mom and are looking for a good bottle, go with Dr. Brown's, stay away from Avent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"On the advice of a friend we selected the Avent system, what a waste! Regardless of how tight the cap was on we still experienced leaks. My major complaints with this system was the gas my daughter suffered while using them, and the hassle of sterilization after each use. As a new mom my time is better spent elsewhere! After two weeks of dealing with the bottles we switched brands."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I bought these because of the positive reviews and because all of my friends rave about them. My son was unable to latch on to the nipples and was having a miseable time getting the formula out of the bottle. It was awful! He is 6 months old now and still can't get them to work right. We switched to the vent air. At least with vernt air you can use the Nuk nipples and they are better for teeth anyways! The Avent only allow the large nipples that in our case were useless. If I could return the bottles I would."},{"rating":"1","title":"adoptingmom","review":"Like many others, I found that the nipple allowed alot of air and my baby had gas for the first time after using these bottles.

I made the mistake of opening all the packages and washing them, leaving me unable to return them if I wasn't happy. Well, I was not happy at all with the bottles. Avent advertises that they are good for reducing colic because of the vented nipple, but I found this to be untrue for my child. She had excessive gas with these bottles and caused much discomfort. I spoke to a few other mothers who said the same thing. The bottles created such a vacuum that my daughter was unable to suck without having to stop often to release the vacuum that was created. I would not recommend these bottles to anyone especially if your baby has colic. I contacted Avent and they told me I wasn't assembling the bottle properly. Needless to say I demanded a refund for the bottles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"This bottle leaked all over and that is after following the assembly directions exactly AND my daughter hated it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Bottles EVER!!!","review":"Our baby is 1 week old, and she wasn't feeding very well (she preferred to sleep). The flow of other bottles we tried was too fast, so we decided to try Avent bottles...BIGGEST MISTAKE EVER!We bought a pack of 3 bottles, and nothing would go through the nipple...even my husband tried sucking on them and couldn't get any liquid to flow. The worst thing was that we had already tried to feed our baby with one, and she had been sucking air for about 15 minutes!!!We called Avent customer service, and their solution was to exchange the bottles, which we did...and ended up with 3 other bottles with the exact same problem. Talk about quality control, WHAT A JOKE!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Throw these bottles out!","review":"These bottles are terrible! Everyone told me Avent is the bottle of choice and even the hospital told me to use these. Well, we used these for about 2 weeks and my poor son was very gassy and these bottles leaked all over.

My son could not get latched on correctly, the nipples were too small, and then when he drank from them it went down way to quickly. And why should a bottle be so complicated that you have to either hold it just right or screw the lid on just right, not to tight you know. Who wants to mess with that in the middle of the night. We switched to the playtex natural latch and everything was much better. Yes you have the bags, but there is no leaking and no extra air. I only use these bottle with my pump and even then they are a pain in the butt, because they don't want to stay screwed to the pump. ERRR!! Very frustrating."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY LEAKY BOTTLES!","review":"I HAD A PREMIE AND FOR ONE THING WOULD GAG BECAUSE THE NIPPLE WAS SO LONG HE COULDN'T LATCH ON, WHEN HE CAN ON OTHER NORMAL SIZED BOTTLE NIPPLES.

HE WAS ON THE STINKIEST FORMULA AND THIS BOTTLE, AFTER USED FOR A MONTH WOULD LEAK AROUND THE COLLAR AND THATS EXACTLY WHAT YOU DON'T WANT, TO HAVE TO CHANGE AN INFANT AFTER EVERY FEEDING BECAUSE IT WOULD LEAK SO MUCH IT WOULD SATURATE HIS BIB.

I purchased the Avent bottles for my first child because they attached so nicely with the breast pump and the bottles were good for storing in the freezer. I was extremely pleased with them. I never had a problem with leaking or gas.I did hear that some of the other nipples (size 2 and up) can give a faster flow of milk, so I just stayed with the newborn size and never had any issues.Leaking was never a problem and to be honest, I never even read the directions, I just used common sense in assembling the top."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy Advent - They LEAK","review":"I have tried everything short of supper glue to keep them from leaking.

He slept like a charm in the hospital. We came home and used these bottles...he was up all night long! He had horrible gas. I switched to the Playtex Vent Aire bottles, and they are WONDERFUL!

With each new child, we bought a fresh supply of bottles, hoping Avent had fixed this problem. We really wanted these bottles to work, as they seem to be the most durable and stylish ones on the market, and our kids never had any problems with the nipples. However, each time, we ended up having to switch to another brand.The leak is not just a spot here or there. It is often a torrential downpour, leaking out the sides of the white cap. I know many people who have had the same problem.For as expensive as these bottles are, I would think Avent would take more pride in their product, fixing such simple things as a leak.Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the bottles","review":"I have been using these bottles since April 2004 and my baby is now 9 months old. I LOVE them! We have NOT had any problems using them - they work with the pump or just for formula feeding. We have not had problems with leaking at all. I now use the AVENT trainer cup and the nipple fits nicely with that cup as well. I would highly recommend these bottles to any new mom - they wash well and keep looking like new."},{"rating":"2","title":"SECRET TO NO LEAKS...READ ON!!!!!!!","review":"Like so many of the other people who wrote reviews, I also had leaks a lot. I was ready to go out and buy new bottles when I decided to go to Avent's website. It had instructions on how to properly put the bottles together so you don't get spills. I tried it...and it works! :) You have to pull the nipple through the white collar, put the plastic lid on, then screw it on the bottle. The directions actually came with the bottles, I just never read them. I figured I knew what to do and there wouldn't be anything different to do. Well, I'm happy I found the secret...and I hope everyone finds this note helpful!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Design","review":"We have twin girls and were excited about the avent bottles that we had registered for. We received 32 bottles and have regretted registering for them ever sense. After following the directions, we have complaints about the nipple being a challenge for babies to get a grip on. A lot of the formula leaks out the side of their mouths while feeding them. This hasn't changed in 9 weeks, I don't believe they will adapt to them. Gerber bottles have worked great"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Pleased...What a Mess!","review":"The Avent system was horrible for us. It claims that they are the best for \\"Less Gas\\". Not worth the cost. We experienced more of the formula leaking all over our child and us and we triple checked the setup but they all still leaked like crazy. The claim they help in the prevention of \\"Less Gas\\" is not true in our case. We tried the Playtex drop-in's and they worked good, but the Playtex VentAir system worked the BEST and for a colicie baby the results from the VentAir system were AWESOME! Some say the Avent system worked for them and didn't leak, but we find it hard to believe that the 5 packages we have ALL leaked around the nipple seals. Just our opinion we thought to share."},{"rating":"1","title":"The flow is too fast","review":"My newborn son is a very enthusiastic eater. With these bottles, however, he's a little too enthusiastic...the flow (even with a newborn nipple) is so fast, he can drink 4 ounces in less than 5 minutes! The result? A gassy, fussy baby who was projectile vomiting, and not at all satisfied with the need to suckle. I swithed to the wide Dr. Browns bottles and there has been a tremendous improvement. I think Avent bottles are WAY overrated."},{"rating":"1","title":"garbage","review":"These bottles are terrible! They leak allover the babies clothes. So bad that it seems like more gets on the baby than in their stomach. The Platex Ventaire bottles are much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"They Leak and take a loooong time to warm up","review":"If you are using these bottles to feed a baby breastmilk...they take a very long time to warm up. Remember that you can't microwave the milk so you have to place the bottle in warm water...it will take about 10-15 minutes before they are ready. Also, I found that these bottles leak. I read all the reviews and knew that it might be a problem, but decided to try them anyway...a mistake.Thinner bottles have worked best for me. I use the medela bottles (they come in a four pack and are sold as an accessory to the various breastpumps for storing the milk)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaky and loud","review":"I do not like these bottles at all! I registered for this set after hearing how great these bottles are. Like anotber poster said, they leak if you don't get the nipple and ring on JUST RIGHT and have soaked my son many times. I also find it frustrating to have to break the suction all the time because the bottle makes a loud squeaking noise. Totally annoying and not very soothing for those middle of the night feeds when you are trying to keep the baby as relaxed as possible. Get the playtex nurser system instead--they are 100% better!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Baby Shower Gift!","review":"This is an excellent gift for anyone who's expecting.

The bottles seal tightly and all that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy for baby!","review":"I bought this as a gift to my sister in-law who is having her first baby and has no clue about bottles. I have had two and used Avent but..... when she opened these as a gift they were yellow and 1 four ounce bottle and 2 of the big ones! I paid 30.00 dollars for a set that I was suppose to get 5 bottles! My Avent bottles from Babies R Us was never yellow. I was embarrassed and I would never let my soon to be niece use these!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible bottles, they leak","review":"The bottles leak! When I complained at Avent's website, the response was that I should use some water around the nipple ring so the seal is tight. What kind of design is that? I've had several occasions where the milk leaked as soon it was tilted to go into the baby's mouth. It is very frustrating when you have to open the bottle and try re-sealing it several times while the baby is screaming. Besides the fact, it is annoying when breastmilk goes waste because of the bottle design. For what you pay for the bottles, I had expected better quality. I would definitely not recommend these bottles to any of my friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"good bottles","review":"Like others have said, the bottles leak if you don't follow directions when putting the top on, but once you get that down it is not a problem. My baby has little spitting up and is not fussy or very gassy."},{"rating":"2","title":"They do not leak!","review":"I love these bottles, but not for the reason the company wants you to buy them for. I have not see any reduction in her gas, she still has plenty of it, but she does go from bottle to breast without any problems whatsoever. The rounded design of the nipple seems to make her think its me and not a bottle which is fantastic. I also have not had any problems with leaks and I didn't even read the instructions. As for the pacifiers, they are her favorite among several brands we've bought. They're perfect for those times when she's not hungry and just wants to suck to soothe herself. With the exception of reducing gas, these bottles are all that they say they are and worth every penny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flows too fast","review":"I bought a couple of Avent bottles because of their reputation, and because I was given an Avent breast pump. I tried a few times to feed my baby from the bottle, and she had to gulp to try keep up with the flow while it still ran down her cheeks. That was with the newborn nipple. When I complained about this to a friend, she said that she'd had the same experience with her baby. I found that the Playtex nursing system works much better. The hole is tiny, and the baby still has to work to get the milk out -- just like nursing. If you want to try them out, go buy one bottle at the store first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not too keen about Avent bottles","review":"I tried the Avent bottles and they were really awful. First thing is that they create a terrible negative suction pulling-pressure while the baby is drinking, which is frustrating for the baby as it does not allow the food to flow freely through the nipple. It also causes the baby to suck air, causing severe gas! The negative suction pressure also creates a terrible noise, which is oh-so-annoying to listen to!!!!! Also, the nipples are made of a hard plastic and it started to create blisters on my son's lips from all of the hard sucking!!!! I switched to the Dr. Brown's bottles and they are much, much better, eliminating all of these problems! I tossed these bottles straight into the garbage! Don't waste your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaking Bottles","review":"I bought the breast pump that came with extra bottles so I figured I would just use only these bottles and didn't bother to buy any others. The only time the bottle doesn't seem to leak is when I put the collar on with a storage cap instead of a nipple. That's rediculous that 95% of the time the bottle leaks all over my son. My husband and I are so fed up with these bottles that we continually throw them into the sink after they have leaked all over our hands when trying to mix powdered formula. It's also outrageous that people are saying that you need to tighten to a certain amount. I don't have time for that when my son is screaming for a bottle after waking up from a nap. We've gone on to finally use other brands of bottles after 3 months of this madness. I have no problem using the pump or storing the milk in these bottles for my next child, but will never use them with the nipples again. Very disappointed, especially when you even see celebs using this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy a starter set!!","review":"We got the whole set at our shower. Since had heard good things I just assumed they would work for our baby. I opened and washed the whole set only to discover that my son (who is breastfeeding) hated this bottle. The lactation consultant I spoke with said a lot of nursing babies dislike Advent because the nipples are too hard. She recommended the Evenflo Elite. Sure enough, he loved that bottle the first time. We ended giving the Advent bottles away. So the lesson here is just buy one to see if your baby likes it before you buy a set!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Avent is the worst","review":"While I'm a stubborn Anglophile, I'm very disappointed by Avent's products. The bottles are not comfortable for people with small hands (or stubby fingers) to hold, and the worst part is with the nipples, which are made of semi-hard plastic and too large for young babies. I think Dr. Brown's or the Playtex Ventaire is way better. Even Gerber's one-use disposable nipples are way better."},{"rating":"1","title":"BPA - Bad plastic","review":"Unfortunately, these bottles contain BPA that can leak into your baby's milk if you heat them. When I found out we immediately switched to Evenflo glass bottles.Otherwise I actually liked the bottles. I liked the wide opening that allows for easy cleaning. I hardly had any leaks, only sometimes when I didn't screw the lid on just right or when the nipple wasn't pulled all the way through.What I didn't like was that they are not compatible with any other breast pump except Avent breast pumps. However, Avent breast pumps never worked for me, so that was a major bummer. I think someone makes conversion kits for Avent bottles so they might fit onto a standard bottle sized breast pump.Why can't they make these in glass or at least in plastic without BPA?"},{"rating":"1","title":"BPA","review":"I tried these, however, after calling AVENT I was informed that the bottles contain BPA!

In other bottles (Evenflo, in particular) when I mix the formula not many bubbles form, and the ones that do will dissipate over a short time. In these ones, the bubbles do not go away and the baby ends up getting too much air with his feeding. Plus, you can hearthe air going in when he sucks. \\"Read the instruction book\\".

Therefore I had to switch very quickly to playtex standard bottles.I also don't recommend buying many 4oz bottles, my son drank less than four ounces for only about 6 weeks and he was up to 5 ounces, and it is a pain to have to fix two bottles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hate them!","review":"These bottles leak. I have tried everything including reading the instructions. Why are instructions needed anyway to screw on a nipple!?! It should seem simple enough.

I tried several other brands, but none worked as well as these did for her. I always found myself buying a few more of these. I have fed my child 6-8 bottles a day using Avent bottles since the day she came home from the hospital and only had 1 incident of leakage and I recognized what I had done wrong and was able to correct the problem w/o further error.

If, on the other hand, you actually expect your child to eat from the bottle, get something else. My daughter hated the nipple shape (it actually gagged her), and got incredibly frustrated with the newborn (1-hole) nipple. We tried the 2-hole, and could at least get some food down her with it, but she still gagged and fought. Then we tried a Dr. Brown's with a Level 1 nipple, and had a happy, full baby.

We switched to Dr Browns since my son has Reflux and have been so happy ever since. Of course after I asked around, everyone else had the same problems with the Advent- now they tell me!

We thought it might be lactose intolerance so we switched formula. This did no good, so after doing some research we ended up with Dr. Brown's wide neck bottles. This was the answer to our prayers. Within a day or so the spit up stopped and the crying after feeding subsided. Besides the normal newborn gas...our son is doing much better! My advice to parents is to not register for or buy this complete system...buy a few different types of bottles and see which one your little one takes to. This system is too expensive to buy, sterilize and then not use!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nipples Too Hard...horrible for a breastfed baby!","review":"My husband and I originally tried the Avent bottles after several recommendations from previous users and after doing some research on our own.

My son never did catch on to using these bottles. When he was a newborn, it took him forever to get anything because he struggled with the nipple. He also had a lot of problems with getting too much air, and I didn't find that these bottles helped with that in the least bit. We ended up switching to Dr. Browns bottles, which he never had any problems with and still uses now at 6 months of age.I do, however, use these as baby food containers and love them for that purpose. When I am not feeding my son an entire jar, I just spoon what I want into one of these. It fits in the Avent bottle warmer and this type of container is much easier to scoop baby food out of than a bowl where everything spreads out. Because of this, I gave these bottles 2 stars instead of only 1."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avent bottles leak","review":"These bottles leak terribly. Even on the newborn nipples, the milk pours out practically choking baby. Do not buy these bottles. I contacted the Avent directly and they were extremely unhelpful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best ever! My son is a whole new person!","review":"I started out using Playtex Premium Nursers with disposable liners, but switched to AVENT because I heard that they are so great and my Playtex bottles wouldn't heat in the car. Since then, my baby eats better, sleeps better, cries less. I didn't realize that the others were making him unhappy, but he is a different baby since switching to these. The only issue I have is that it is hard for me to get the nipple into the collar without pulling the nipple through with my fingers and, if you don't get the lid on just right, it will leak. Other than that, these are great!UPDATE: I guess I jumped the gun on this review. As we have used them more, we have discovered that these bottles leak about 30% of the time. If you do not tighten the ring perfectly, it will leak all over your hand and baby. I am over these bottles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very dissapointed!","review":"When using these bottles with my newborn, stage 1 flow was very fast for her. The nipples are very hard (not like the breast at all). She would get alot of gas when using these bottles. I switched to Platex Ventaire and we both loved them. Those bottles are a hundred times better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for gassy babies","review":"The tiny lip on the nipple does not count as breakthrough technology in preventing the baby from swallowing air. I recommend Dr. Brown's bottles. They cost more, but they're worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"You want these bottles!","review":"I love, love, love these bottles. They're incredibly easy to get powdered formula into -- the scoop is smaller than the top of the bottle.They have helped with my daughter's gas.They're very easy to handwash (I have put them in the dishwasher -- but we don't use it everyday.)When I was pumping, the catchbottle for the Medela breastpump easily poured into these.The nipples are easy to wash.You do have to ensure the nipples are snapped completely into the rings. And that the ring is tightened enough or it will leak.The caps are bigger than on other bottles and easier to deal with.Because they have a broader base than other bottles, they don't tip over in the fridge, on the table, on the couch, or on the changing table as easily.The pacifiers are great.However, the bottlebrush isn't anything special. Don't buy this set just to get the bottlebrush. I have an avent brush but use a regular bottlebrush."},{"rating":"1","title":"THESE BOTTLES ARE TERRIBLE!!!!

I bought them because I planned to breastfeed, but that did not work out. The only problem that I have is that they leek if they are not screwed on properly, and when your child is hungry, it becomes fustrating. Also, the stages of the nipples are not true to what they suggest. I started off with the stage 1 nipples and then completely skipped over the stage 2, which is susposed to be from 1-3 months, and bought stage 3 (3-6 months) because I felt that she was not getting enough with the stage 2. These nipples are also extremely expensive. A package of 2 is $4.00 and I feel that they thin out quickly and then she starts squirting milk everywhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved them!","review":"My husband and I purchased these bottles before we had my daughter....and now it has been over a year and they still are going strong.....have never had any problems with them at all!"},{"rating":"1","title":"These bottles leak whether you follow the instructions or not.","review":"These bottles leak around the nipple even when assembled correctly. This can be extremely frustrating when you can't even get through a feeding without getting breast milk all over your hands and everything else. I would give these bottles zero stars except for the fact that my baby accepted the Avent bottles and has been reluctant to drink from the other popular brands. If she would accept any of the other brands I wouldn't still be using these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"I purchased the starter set when my daughter was born and have nothing but trouble with them.

I WENT TO PLAYTEX AND I HAVE NOT HAD ONE LEAK."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaking problems - big time!","review":"I uses these bottles for my first two children - they were fine but with a few annoying leaks. Because they are so easy to wash, I was willing to overlook a few leaks when our twins were born, so I bought a few more. These are possibly the most \\"leaky\\" bottles I\`ve ever used. I have read the directions, checked and rechecked that the nipples are installed in the ring properly, tightened and retightened the rings but to no avail! For the price paid for them, they should be of much better quality. I am dissapointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating","review":"I chose these bottles admittedly because it's a well known brand. However upon using these bottles I became increasingly frustrated with leaking issues. The caps leak frequently and waste the formula that should be ingested by my baby. It also appeared to create gas which made her miserable. I would never buy Advent again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not User Friendly","review":"I also had trouble with the bottles leaking. It may just be a matter of not having the nipple perfectly centered or the threads on the cap perfectly aligned, but what new mom needs to be bothered with that in the middle of the night?This was my third child and the first time I've used Avent. My baby is 4 months old and I finally just gave up and bought a pack of cheap bottles. The Avent ones are just too much trouble and I didn't see any reduction in gas, etc. as advertised.On the plus side the wide mouth bottle is much easier to clean than the other brands."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for us!","review":"I registered for these bottles because they were \\"The\\" bottle to get at the time my son was born. However, after a few months of trial and error we switched to Dr. Brown's and have been extremely pleased. The milk either came out too fast or was too hard to get out. We tried every available nipple and could not find one to suit him. I threw them away and started over. My recommendation is that you buy only one bottle of several kinds and see which one works best with your child and then stick to that one. I wish I had not used so many of them and wasted them."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT for newborns","review":"These bottles may be great for older babies, but are not good for newborns. The nipples are far too large, letting in too much air causing spitting up and lots of burps. We do not have these problems with Nuk or Medela newborn bottles and nipples.Contrary to another reviewer, even if you do assemble these bottles perfectly correctly, the still leak from time to time.For these reasons, I cannot recommend them for other newborns."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Ok","review":"I am not impressed by these bottles. Yeah they work and I guess get the job done. However, they DO leak and are not breastfed baby compatible no moatter how they are advertised. My son will drink from them when he HAS too but never is happy afterwards due to the gas it causes in him. I am not looking for a better option. I am glad they were a gift and I did not spend any money on them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Contain BPA","review":"I'm a little concerned that this product showed up on a list on Amazon.com when I searched BPA-free bottles. I've used Avent bottles with both my kids, but now I am in the process of switching to something BPA-free. As I was looking for options, I searched Amazon.com and Avent came up as an option. These bottles contain BPA. I think this is misleading potential buyers!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"AVENT BOTTLES CONTAIN BPA BISPHENOL-A.","review":"I liked Avent Bottles, my daughter Liked them too! Then I found out about Bisphenol -A being used to make the Bottles. After re-searching Bisphenol -A, I discovered that exposing my baby to harmful chemicals with the potential for long term affects later in life, was definitely not for me!! There are other options out there, all glass bottles are safe, as well as Born Free, Mam by Sassy, Green to Grow and Adrini. Do your own research. I'm really surprised the non Bisphenol -A Free bottles haven't been recalled yet! I'm sure it's just a matter of time, before enough people are educated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaky Bottles","review":"I see where others have stated that if you read the directions these bottles will not leak. That is NOT so. I am an educated person and I have checked and re-checked the bottles, they are assembled correctly. These bottles are awful about leaking, and sometimes you can just turn the bottle a certain way to keep them from leaking, but it is very frustrating to leak your hard-earned breast milk from a poorly constructed bottle. The other reviews are correct unfortunately-the nipples are the best and that is why I continue to use them. My daughter will not take any other nipple even after trying other brands. She likes the advent ones. My recommendation to all moms would be to not even start with the advent ones. I have been told the vent aire from playtex are great and never leak. ???"},{"rating":"1","title":"GOOD QUALITY BUT ANNOYINGLY LEAKY!!!","review":"I feel like Avent makes good quality merchandise, but I really hate these bottles, namely the nipples. Not only do they leak if not pulled into the collar well enough, but also if the collar is not screwed onto the bottle just so. If you ever need to assemble them while half asleep, that can prove to be quite a mess. Also, as another reviewer stated, the nipples are quite hard and I have found that both my breastfed babies preferred softer nipples, such as Healthflow (disposable) and Playtex disposable wide. I also purchased a million of these bottles to store breast milk, but found it's so much easier to buy milk storage bags and use them with disposable liner-style bottle systems (specifically, Playtex). They thaw quicker when frozen, store in less space, and you don't have to transfer them to a bottle with an acceptable nipple! :o) All in all, if you want a good manual pump, buy the Avent Isis...but I would not recommend the bottles for feeding."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing but praise","review":"I've been using these bottles with my daughter since she was bron, 17 months ago. I have nothing but praise for them and haven't found a problem with them at all. I highly recommend these bottles especially if you are unable to breastfeed round the clock. They are very close to the nipple."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Bottles!","review":"We started using the avent bottles from when we first brought our daughter home from the hospital. We did try other bottles because our daughter was colic. We tried the ones with the drop in bags, but it was so hard to get all the air out of them. We also used the Dr. Browns but it did not help her colic at all and they were so hard to clean because of all the pieces you had to put back together. We went right back to the avent bottle. They did leak at first but 9 months later we are still using them with no problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the money!","review":"I have 6 children and this is the first time I had used these bottles, my 4 month old daughter loves them and will only drink out of these bottles. The only time I found it leak is when the nipple wasn't pulled up all the way or when I tightened to tight. They are awesome. I also like the fact you can upgrade the nipples as your child gets older. She's never had a belly ache either! Wish they were around when my first child was born. They are well worth the money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"advent bottles DO NOT LEAK","review":"i've heard from others that they leak but I can honestly tell you that i've been using them and they are WONDERFUL. especially when making the transition from breast to bottle. the only reason i've ever found that they leak is if you don't pull the nipple all the way into the cap, but that's going to happen with any bottle. i highly recommend the advent bottles"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many bubbles!","review":"I would never reccommend these bottles to anyone. I am a nursing Mother and thought these bottles we suppsose to mimic the breast. They do just the opposite. There were so many bubbles in the bottle that I could hear them...because of this it caused my 3 week old to become gassy and very cranky. I soon switched to playtex nursers and she is great with them. The nipples on the Playtex Nurser are much softer and mimic the breast much more closely than the Avent. Over all, the Avent bottles are a waste of money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"wrong shape nipple for my baby","review":"My son could not latch on to this bottle's nipple, not because I was using it incorrectly or using the wrong level nipple, but because of it's shape. The milk would run out of the sides of his mouth, and you could tell that he was having a hard time forming his mouth to the shape of the nipple. I switched to the Playtex bottle and their orthodontic nipple,which is designed to fit the shape of a baby's mouth, and you could almost see the relief on my baby's face as he latched onto it perfectly, and he is now able to drink his entire bottle without half of it running down his neck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!","review":"I have a 2 mo old son and was so excited when I saw these...no bags and a wide nipple. I am BF but have to supplement w/formula. These bottles leak everytime I have to use one! And It's not just me...my mom and my husband have made bottles and they leak for them also. I'm doing research on which bottles to try now but I will be so glad when I can throw these in the trash..they have been such a waste of money....and formula!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaky Bottles","review":"These bottles leak all the time. It seems like you need to put the lid on just perectly so that the milk doesn't come pouring out from the sides. I get terribly frustrated when using them and my son gets frustrated when I take the bottle from him so I can dry him and my carpet off. These bottles are horrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"misleading","review":"When I had Eli - everyone was recommending avent - avent - avent. So, that is what I registered for and was using, until... 2 1/2 months and Eli and I had to spend a week in the hospital. The nurses there told us that avent's nipple is the most difficult nipple to suck from - it was way too hard for Eli to suck from. We found evenflo worked best for us. So, I recommend before investing in a lot of one type of bottle, test out a few and find out what works best for your child."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid anger and frustration do not buy these bottles","review":"I have read a review (probably from the manufacturer) suggesting people are experiencing dripping because we don't follow directions. I have two kids, and believe that the problem is just that the bottles are poorly designed. I have had to change my kid's shirts at three in the morning because they get wet from the bottle. This is so frustrating that not only am I taking the time to tell anybody who is interested to not buy this product but I am also writing the manufacturer to complain and get my money back. Save your sanity, it really is that frustrating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless. They LEAK!","review":"I bought 36 Avent bottles before my twins were born because I read that they were the best. I ended up throwing them all out because they leaked. There's nothing worse than a bottle, that leaks during a 3 am feeding to the point that you need to change your newborn's clothes. Don't buy them. I now use Dr. Brown's bottles- which I love."},{"rating":"1","title":"THEY LEAK TOO MUCH","review":"I, just as the other new moms thought that the Avent bottles were suppose to be really good. Well, let me tell you that they are not. If you don't put the cover on \\"just right\\" they will leak. I can go just about a whole feeding without it leaking and then right at the end it will leak.

However, if you have a choice about which book to purchase to learn about the statistical techniques of analysis of variance, I would avoid this book! I had to use this book for my graduate ANOVA class, and it pretty much reads like a novel about stats, with very few practical examples. It complicates the explanations much more than necessary and is difficult to follow. Also, it covers WAY too many concepts in each chapter, so it's very overwhelming. It does include answers to some problems in the back, which is helpful, but that is the extent of the helpfulness of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low quality stats textbook","review":"If you are a professor looking at this, do your students a favor and don't use this book.

It's a must-read for those considering furnishing and decorating their homes in the Mexican style.It is also an important companion volume to Mexicolor; and to those years-ago titles published by Architectural Publishing.For the would-be the hunter of these pieces, however, this book makes one fact quite clear.

The 1997 edition differs most notably from the 1991 issue in that the pediatric chapter was omitted.

Unfortunately, the bag lasted one day before it deflated. The Century Kid Kick Wavemaster was purchased to take the place of the broken bag. He likes it because he can punch it and kick it. I like it because it has not broken."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent \\"YOUTH\\" punching bag","review":"Good solid punching bag. Most \\"youth\\" bags are junk at best but this one exceeds expectations. This brand was recommended to me as Wavemaster bags are in use at the local MMA training facility. Bag is adjustable for height to allow for various sized kids. The bag itself is basically Styrofoam blocks wrapped in a nylon material bag. We'll see how well it holds up over time but right now it seems to be ok. Using boxing gloves is recommended to protect the knuckles. It can be filled with either water or sand. Water is easier, but sand is much heavier by volume. The fill spout is at the top under the pad. It will take 200lbs of sand. Make sure you get playground sand as it has fewer rocks so it is easier to pour through a funnel. Putting it on a rubber mat is a good idea to keep it from sliding on carpet or scratching wood floors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for little ones like 5 and under","review":"If you have a little one who needs to practice this is the perfect size...we have the other one and it is to hard for little legs to get over the bottom base but this one is perfect height and is very stable anad made of good quality and is what our dojo Haleys Martial Arts uses..."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD TO GO","review":"ITEM WAS JUST AS LISTED AND SHIPMENT RECEIVED ON SCHEDULE.

I let some air in and it felt a lot more comfortable, but when I got home later I saw that I had a bloodly eye. First time I had ever had one and it was kind of shocking, but ultimately just cosmetic.

Granted, cramming a whole book into what amounts to merely 25 minutes is next to impossible, so that's pretty well what you got ... next to impossible.

High quality material used. Strong cards. Beautiful original artwork. It even comes with a booklet that gives the most-used meanings of each cards and explains how to give a Celtic Cross Divination reading.The only problem I had is that Tarot cards are longer than playing cards, so it's not as easy to shuffle them, especially for my younger querents with much smaller hands. But, of course it would be that way with any Tarot deck (unless the cards were specially down-sized).Also, on a product-unrelated note, the shipping was fast! It came a day before the delivery date.

It's probably -the- best deck for beginners to cut their teeth on due to its rich symbolism. Even without reading page one of any Tarot book on the market, most any intuitive person can form reasonably accurate interpretations of nearly all these cards. The illustrations are simple, yet powerful, drawing on universal archetypes that guide the reader to the wisdom that already lies in his/her subconscious.It isn't a perfect deck (though I believe the only \\"perfect\\" deck would be one that one designed for oneself), but of all the decks I own, it's one of the very few that almost always \\"speaks\\" to me.

Either a high resolution scan or a photographic copy would not have yielded such disasterous results. They really had to try. But it may be a copyright issue?I donated the deck to the library and just bought the Pamela Colman Smith Commemorative Deck. I know the quality MUST be better because anything would be. Hope they aren't so slick and that the cardstock is thicker. These were very thin, though I'm sure the crazy slick lamination gave them indestructible qualities."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing!","review":"About 10 years ago, I ordered this same deck, which I loved. Since then, I have lost 2 cards and decided to order a replacement. I am very disappointed in this reproduction. Take very seriously the comments about the poor printing quality of this deck. The faces are orange, the colors aren't printed within the lines of the drawings, and in positive cards (such as the Ace of Cups), the skies are gray. The back of these cards are blue plaid (now does that seem tarot-like?). The back of my old cards were navy with tiny stars. With my old deck, the colors were soft and pretty, while these colors are harsh and not realistic. I would send them back, but it just isn't worth it to repackage them and go to the post office.

Brinton","review":"Who was this mysterious Sybill G. Brinton? History records very little about her more than her dates of birth and death. She was childless and no known photograph of her exists! What a shame she never wrote anything else. I found her book to be delightful. All the major Jane Austen characters are back and no one, by the end of the book, remains single. Because this book was written in 1913 (says so on the cover), the turn of phrase and general style is much more like Jane's than anything these modern day Jane Wannabe's come up with. But being so much closer to our time, the prose is very comfortable for the modern reader. I found the book to be very pleasant and never ridiculous. I highly recommend this to any fan of Jane Austen. I thoroughly enjoyed it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful read","review":"After reading many follow-up Austen novels ... some good some not, I wasn't sure what to expect from a 1914 publication.

Highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trying too hard","review":"This book is only worth reading if you are a Jane Austen fanatic like myself. If you just have to get more of your favorite characters you might enjoy this. It has charcters from all of Jane Austen's completed novels except Lady Susan. It is primarily concerned with the love lives of Georgianna Darcy, Col. Fitzwilliam and Kitty Bennett so it is mainly a Pride and Predjudice sequel. What I did not like about the book was that it tried too hard to include too many characters from too many novels. There are so many characters in the book that many of them have become rather bland. If you love Jane Austen and can never get enough you may enjoy this book. If you're not a die hard fan this probably isn't for you. There are several better written sequels than this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for little kids","review":"My daughter loves the Amazing Planet videos. They are fun but still very educational.

Not only do I like Jack Lemmon, but I wanted to see if more of a modern twist had been placed on the story. I finally saw the movie, and I must say that the other reviewers are correct. This version, while somewhat interesting, doesn't hold a candle to the original. Jack Lemmon looks tired and sulks a lot, and he just doesn't have the energy that made Peter Fonda such a great fit for the role in the original. George C. Scott does a nice job in his angry role. The great Ossie Davis has his talents wasted in a minor role. Tony Danza and James Gandolfini perform nicely, but in the end the original beats this one hands-down. Modernizing it didn't do much for the dialogue, the story, or the performances.

It is very interesting to see the twelve different men's intents, interests and personalities. What seems to be an easy guilty vote in the beginning boils down into a long and heated argument between the men as some people just want to go home and some people want to serve justice.95% of the movie takes place in one place, which most times leads to a rather boring movie, but in this case really helps focus in on one main goal. I enjoyed this movie a lot, it allows you to see that people on a jury are of all types and can be just like you or I.

But it was very tedious, and boring. My mother got summoned to jury duty a few months later and she would come home pissed off that she had to do this boring civil duty. so one night she stopped by BLOCKBUSTER VIDEO and rented the new version of 12 Angry Men and it blew us away. We still watch this video at least two times a week, Because it's hilarious, and refreshing to see the diversity in the cast (mainly due to a 40 year time time difference in the two movies) . At the same time it makes you think. I love all the performances by these fantastic actors. Especially those of Mykelti Milliamson, and George C. Scott, potraying the angriest jurors of all.

Jack Lemon's talents are wasted in this film and he is actually a poor choice for the role. I would have preferred someone like Tom Hanks in Fonda's original role.In addition, the senseless foul language added to the original script does nothing for the film except \\"update\\" it a bit with how we speak today, but it still reeked as being unnecessary.

So it was with scepticism that I watched the remake to this wonderful film. Great cast, directing and production, but what about the end resuslt. Success! There is no comparing the two productions.

Even to think of remaking Sidney Lumet's 1957 version is sacrilege but to actually go ahead and do it is incomprehensible. Whatever the merits of this film -- irritatingly made to fit in with P.C. faddishness -- it will always be compared to the original and how anyone can make a favourable comparison again I find hard to understand. The 1957 version is one of the greatest feats in cinema history not because of the special effects but rather because of the lack of them. What a gamble to make a film entirely (barring two shots)set in one dull, stuffy room but it was a gamble that paid off. One of the truly great but criminally underrated films of all time.

But the bugs are a great size and fun shapes for little hands and mouths. I like that they all have different textures and sounds (rattles). The firefly is a nice addition, but it is sometimes difficult to get the light to come on (more strength needed than a baby has to whack it against something to trigger the light).Overall it was a decent purchase, but I think more toys should have just a half-step up in quality so that I wouldn't worry about the seams/rattly bits when washing them for baby."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to read and affordable to purchase...","review":"When reviewing different books on automotive detailing I found this to be the most logical choice.

However, I do agree that the book never does pick up the pace. Instead, we are treated to seemingly random vignettes of strange occurrences in and around the Fraser homestead in southern Ontario. There are certain gothic elements to this tale: family dysfuncion, madness, violence, and a perpetual feeling of uncertainty. That's what this book left me with: I was uncertain about where it would eventually lead. When it got to the end, the feeling persisted. A strange work, but not worth high praise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not read this book unless you have to!","review":"This book got off to a slow start and remained so throughout the book.

One of the worst aspects of some sci-fi is their justaposition of our value systems, wants and needs onto an entirely (forgive the word) alien culture.Lem seems to delight in writing about these encounters and all the misplaced hopes, dashed dreams, incorrect assumptions and not so surprising outcomes.

The enemy simply piles up around you waiting for their chance to get destroyed, occasionally using their guns. The space battles are grounded, but you hover instead of walking (star filled back-ground and floor included). This game isn't dynamic at all and lacks any challenge besides getting over a thousand enemy (metal tree) kills.\\"Send the Mobile Suits into battle! Be sure not to use any tactics!

Beautifully written, the characters are our own families; the heroine, Amanda, any woman at age 40 coming to crossroads in her life...empty nest syndrome, death of a parent, and the bittersweet realization that her life has not turned out exactly as planned; that everything, including her marriage, has fallen short of her expectations. But during a vacation in Long Island for one week with her siblings and their families, while exploring a separation from her husband, Amanda is lucky enough to rediscover passion and basically, her own identity. This is really a must read...one which will make you wish for both a prequel and a sequel. Amanda Kincaid is a character worthy of further exploration by the author."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK","review":"This product was okay, but not as interesting as I had hoped.

First, if you want instructions, you are out of luck. Next, the tutorials are meager to say the least. Throughout the game, the icons that drive everything you do are hard to decipher without using the help feature. To really start playing this game and to know what you are doing would take hours since the only way to learn it is through a great deal of trial and error (much more than any other games of this ilk).In a nutshell, this game disappoints."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Idea - poor execution","review":"The idea of creating and managing your own fast food chain, and then watching it function from a bird's eye view is a great one. Unfortunately, Activision failed at recreating this idea to your PC with Fast Food Tycoon. The main reason the game is a failure is because of it's confusing gameplay. It helps to use the tutorial but even after that you'll find yourself wondering, \\"How did I get to that certain screen that let me do that certain function.\\" Watching your pizza(only type of food)place function is pretty cheasy also. There are very few animations and there's not many ways to edit the looks of the place either. If your looking for a solid simulaion game that will keep you entertained for hours your better off with Theme Hospital, Roller Coaster Tycoon, or one of the sim-cities.

Still, Marc Platt paints his normal elegant landscapes and writes a very entertaining plot. The novel doesn't slow down in the middle as Time's Crucible did and the details were much clearer (except for the big flashback sequences which were vague and hard to follow by design). I found some of the revelations a little disappointing and the links to \\"Enemy Within\\" were very tacked on. Still, it was a fun read"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Heartwarming Sherlockian Jaunt","review":"I bought \\"The Secret of Sherlock Holmes\\" on a whim after watching a large portion of the Granada series, and I was not disappointed. The play retains the love for the material as well as a unique fondness for the characters that the show expresses. The text is a brilliant integration of quotes from Doyle as well as new material.

Credibility is lost when the author hasn't bothered to proofread the book. I noted numerous punctuation, grammar and other errors in just the first 15 pages. The foreword by the MD twice states that thimerosal has now been banned in children's immunizations. This is incorrect (although I wish it were true). This book turns out to be one long rant against the republicans. Believe me, it isn't just republican politicians who are taking the pharmaceutical company money. Both sides are to blame, although I will concede that republicans are probably more involved in this public health disaster than democrats.

For the most part I have been pleased with it, it has a decent firewall/IDS, VLAN routing, good DHCP configurability and purports to have VPN support. Unfortunately, I have found that with a VPN tunnel configured, there is a memory leak in the firmware vpn code that causes the router to reboot every 24 hours. This could be tolerable for me if I could time the reboot (or schedule one) but that is not supported and it only comes back from the reboot 80% of the time. After disabling the VPN tunnel it works fine. My hope is that they will get around to fixing it in a newer firmware version but I have stayed current and found the update frequency to be very slow.

Most of these packet types have similar QOS assignments. Using port specific QOS, we can prioritize bandwidth to allow our voip PCs priority over any other traffic. Plug our voip device into port one and give port one priority over all other ports and clipping, delay and jitter disappear. You have to upgrade firmware to get proper full cone NAT translation and address porting, but once done, this router works great! One more thing.

Then we tried an experiment where I connected my computer directly to the cable modem, bypassing the RVS4000 router. The speed went to 61Mbps! The router was not even close to being able to keep up.I just bought an Asus RT-n66u, and now every computer gets 50-60+Mbps, even over WiFi!

The first one worked great for 7-8 months, then suddenly stopped working, wouldn't reset back to factory defaults either. I purchased a second RVS4000 because my config file with all of my settings is compatible with it and had nothing but problems getting the device connected. I'm constantly having to go to my data center to reboot, and restore the device. It's a total pain and I highly recommend you stay away from this device. The only good thing about LinkSys that I can say is- when I called for support I wasnt routed to some International Help Desk...

LEAVE the router configured as a GATEWAY. Despite the naming, this is the PROPER configuration for a DHCP setup. If you are using STATIC IPs, then you can reconfigure the box as a ROUTER.When it comes to the VPN, if you're using this baby with a Mac, it's all IPSEC all the way. I was unable to use the in-built Lion VPN setup to connect, but was able to use IPSecuritas without much problem at all because of its ease of use. I would suggest the same to anyone else trying to do the same.I took off one star because all things equal, there's a bit of slowness in the interface and in the operation of the unit.

It supports VPN and 1GbE connections. However, the design is terribly flawed.Firstly, any significant changes to the router settings require a complete router reboot. The reboot takes forever and so if you are doing anything complicated, be prepared to spend a while waiting for the router to reboot after every change you make.Second, the router has horrible latency. If you ping this router, your latency should be <1ms. However, this router under that best circumstances requires up to 10ms to forward your packets. My router is currently about to die and will give bursts of latency as high as 900ms! This makes doing anything horribly painful.When I called Linksys technical support, they did not even know what latency was. Instead they forced me to go through a download and reinstall of the firmware before agreeing to RMA.Stay away from this POS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Router","review":"This cisco/Linksys router is overly complex in it's user interface. It does allow complete freedom for port-forwarding which is good. The VPN is almost impossible to set-up. The automatic DHCP does not seem to work well with other peoples gear (netgear and Dlink). Generally the router runs warm and in my case became intermittant failure after only one year in operation. I've owned several linksys/cisco routers over the years and this is the last one own.

This software worked, but doesn't handle DNS very well.Since I installed the RVS4000 two weeks ago, I have been having inbound email problems on my Exchange Server.

Unfortunately, we no longer have VCR's for the VHS tape, so I was glad that I was able to stream this from the computer to the screen (we have the Disney license to show their films). Granted, it's not 100% historically accurate, however, it gives us a conversation piece to compare and contrast history and how film changes our perceptions, as well as to learn a bit about what happened at the Alamo, and Davy Crockett's famous role. My favorite part of this movie is Davy's speech to Congress, and of course, the \\"Davy, Davy Crockett, King of the Wild Frontier\\" theme song.

I can hear the music, but there's static over the music. It's like listening to AM radio. I unscrew the antennae from my car (not all cars have these, I got lucky), and I get much better reception. . . . .but only for SOME music. God forbid the album you're listening to was recorded before 1987 or has a lot of cymbals. You'll just hear a bunch of noise.It's really a shame. It's possible to make a good FM Transmitter.

I tried the Belkin recommended stations as well as the other stations I sucessfully used in the past and use with my Sirius radio, but nothing would work. I emailed Belkin; I tried different lighter plugs. It didn't matter.I ended up buying a tape adapter to use with this. The nice thing is there's a plug on the bottom to use it.I live close to the middle of nowhere and that doesn't seem to matter with signal, so I would only recommend this product if you plan on buying a tape adapter or some other way of transmitting the signal manually and using this is a stand.

Another thing that bugged me about this was the rubber or flexible thing attached to the transmitter was not sturdy enough. every time i made a turn the transmitter would fall to the side which was really aggravating.

All of the highlights from his \\"Mountain\\" days are here...featuring West's signature song (and one of the greatest \\"riff\\" rockers of all time), \\"Mississippi Queen\\". There is also a generous helping of music from the underrated, largely forgotten \\"supergroup\\" West, Bruce & Laing, with West proving that Clapton wasn't the only guitarist who could hold his own against the formidible talent (and legendary ego) of Cream bassist Jack Bruce. The collection is rounded off with several cuts from the Leslie West Band, the highlight a dynamic version of the Animals' \\"We Gotta Get Outta This Place\\".

Most are obtuse and difficult to follow or rely on techniques that are specific to the author. This book presents Mr. Woods' knowledge on how he learned golf and how he played golf at the height of his career in clear, concise English.Everyone can benefit from his views on the short game, course management and escaping from trouble. Few people are capable of swinging a driver like Mr. Woods in his early 20's, so that part of the book is much less valuable to people over 40. The sections on diet and exercise are generalized and can be ignored by those who have some knowledge of physical fitness.

The sad fact remains that what works for Tiger might not work for you (even with equal ability).But Tiger's book is about as good as it gets. The fundamentals are all there and if you're going to get a golf instruction this would be the one to buy.

I'll admit the book starts off easy to follow. There are a lot of strong examples and points that help to illustrate just what Levitt is trying to get across. But, by the end of the first chapter, Levitt gets into this zone, where every word has to be four syllables. I spent more time grabbing my dictionary than reading his book. What a shame. I'm a graduate student, who has been assigned this text to read for class. It looks like it will be a long semester. If you are interested in maketing, PR or any other related field, save yourself a serious headache and choose another piece.

Those two authors, both of whom I recommend, are more oriented to high-tech. Don't limit your reading by ignoring one of their important influences.I strongly recommend supplementing industry- or market-specific books with Levitt's foundational classic.

Unfortunately, this time they failed me. The book is outdated (as it was published 20 years ago) and lacks substance. If you have little or no knowledge of marketing, this might be a decent intro for you. It is relatively easy to read and dwells on few main concepts. However, if you have taken a marketing course in college or have read much on marketing, you will likely find this book dull and uninformative, as I did. Many of the big revelations in the book seem to me to be common sense. Maybe 20 years ago it was revolutionary, but somehow I doubt it. Also, some of the arguments he makes early in the book have been proven wrong by history...All in all, I would probably avoid this book. I was hoping to get some new insights, but this book sure didn't help. If you must buy it, buy a used copy as it certainly isn't worth [the money]."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible purchase","review":"After a week or so of use, treadmill is pretty much dead in the water.

Not every odd, not every other, only every other odd (i.e. 1, 5, 9, etc.) I find the \\"hard\\" problems in the main text are frequently NOT the ones the solutions manual shows. The few problems from each section that are actually covered do show most of the intermediate steps between the original problem and the final solution in the scope of the section/chapter. Also, there is no explanation on what is being done in each step; the solution from each major step is shown with no information about how that step (or solution) was achieved.

The only caution is that the small size of the pounder head can make it easy to break apart the meat (especially true for chicken) if one is a bit too aggressive! And the supplier was great in getting the correct item shipped to my sister quickly after a different model meat pounder had been shipped to her by mistake.

Whether you're interested in the classic stars of yesteryear of today's hottest commodities like J.

From Bette Davis to Barbra Streisand, most of the difficult ones are here.The book is chockablock with quotations by and about this contingent of prima donnas.

To my ear, the older version (no longer available) is much more lively and sounds much more like Bach and the Beatles. This recording also has some production querks, such as overemphasis on the base from a modern piano that seems unlike Bach and low level garble in a few spots. I am not a trained musician, so others who are may have different opinions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worth a try, but don't expect much","review":"I like listening to experimental music, and thus I have a lot of respect for this album for what it attempts to accomplish.

This first was the DMR E75V, which I bought about 3 years ago. Both of these units had good quality in the 4 hour mode - when they worked. It crapped out after 3 years and hundreds of discs, but was never 100%. It occasionally failed when finalizing the disc - about 5% of the time. It ultimately would not recognize the disc as the proper format, even though it was the proper disc. On the E75V Many of the discs I recorded from the 75 hung up also, maybe another 3%.So, it's Deja VU all over again. I'd hoped they would have improved on the design over the past 3 years, and because of the good recording quality, I decided to try it again. I got burned. I guess I'll try another manufacturer this time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreliable","review":"I have had this for awhile. When it works, it works well, but they way they have the circuitry set up, it checks the disc before ejecting, which can make the player lockup and you can't get the disc out.I ended up throwing mine away and buying a different brand.Be forwarned, not a reliable product."},{"rating":"1","title":"DV input doesn't work with non-Panasonic camcorders","review":"I purchased this unit mainly to make DVDs from DV tapes from my Canon GL-1 camcorder.

There is no workaround, making this unit useless to me.DV inputs are supposed to be standard. Bad planning, Panasonic."},{"rating":"1","title":"AVOID THIS JUNK","review":"This thing stopped working right after the 1 year warranty expired. It doesn't recognize any discs anymore. The only discs it recognizes are the Panasonic DVD-RAM and its a 50/50 chance. If you try a different brand of DVD+RW, the formatting procedure will freeze up and destroy the discs and make them unusable. Looks like Panasonic fell into the junk category.

The chasing playback is terrific (you watch the earlier part of a program and skip commercials while recording the later part).But the one I bought in Nov.

I find that it will lock up in a heartbeat, even though it's powered by a UPS. When recording to DVD it's as user friendly as a Rubik's cube and the manual doesn't help much. I would never recommend this unit to a friend, maybe an enemy! I haven't tried using DVD RAMS. Maybe that's the only way it can work reliably. I miss more shows then I get to see when I try to record them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two tried and returned","review":"First one would work good until you turned it off. Whenever it was turned on again, it would have to go thru the entire set up again. Returned it to BB and gave another a try. This one didn't have to reset everytime, but using the tuner was a joke.I knew that the tuner is slow on this unit before I bought it, but this one would show on the channel display the new channel. The screen would go blank a couple of seconds, and then show the same picture it was on.Sometimes the Panny would do nothing at all, when wanting it to change channels.I didn't get to play with the recording at all, so I can't comment.DVD playback was good, but I couldn't find the button to make the DVD go to the main menu. It's probably there...just couldn't find it.I have always been a fan of Panasonic stuff and have had good service from them. This unit it not up to their standard, IMHO."},{"rating":"1","title":"Panasonic Recorder","review":"I purchases this recorder and had it for about 1 month before I had to return it.

Not only are they using PR tactics to promote the book, but writing the book in the first place is a PR tactic to draw attention to their cause. The underlying message is important -- be critical readers, viewers and listers. Get your news from a source you trust, and consider the sources they cite in their reporting (indeed, if they cite their sources, at all). However, to pin controversial media and PR techniques on industry is the very definition of hypocrisy. Or have you forgotton about Alar?

The only thing I dislike about the phantom is how skinny he is drawn , but from that I like it. Its good to have if you own the other two or like the other ones.I would love to see a animated movie done out of his books by him or see his telling of the Phantom of the opera.

A very thin story line is beautifully padded by the multiple personalities played out in the daydreams of our erstwhile anti-hero. A wonderful cameo from Boris Karloff adds to the comic excitement of a fast paced story, and Kaye delivers brilliantly with impeccable timing during each sub plot. Almost a multiple picture in picture movie, the ending really holds no suprises, but gently jogs the viewer along, without some of the kitch so prevalent in other movies of the era. Danny Kaye really was a comic genius, and in some ways the picture reflects his own life which was widely believed to be that of a painfully shy and reserved man. A great family film, my daughters aged 12 and 14 actually stayed glued to the film throughout, proving that \\"old fashioned\\" homely family films can stand the test of time with contemporary audiences.

But a Vet that treated one of the cases, says it was due to the product itself. They do not break down in the animal's digestive tract as easily as the package leads on. In some animals, it causes a blockage, which results in infection, sometimes leading to death.If you want to find out more about this consumer report, you can find it on http://www.kirotv.com/consumer/5325021/detail.html"},{"rating":"1","title":"BE VERY CAREFUL!!

This book is more fitting for very young paper pilots with its simple designs and colorful tearouts.

But he's also the main songwriter, so that's his perogative.The only gripe (and loss of a star) is the production. Mike Stone must have been, well, stoned, when the mixing took place.

The author/editors have tried to make the leap from traditional medical education to current thinking in modern medical education. It landed in the middle and from a practical learning standpoint is more useful as a paperweight than as a textbook. It also contains significant prejudical information which appears to have resulted from the author/editor's bias about who should be doing what to whom, rather than to base such decisions on education and training. I would strongly advise the medical student to consider Schartz which is lightyears ahead of Dr. Sabiston's text.I am used to seeing both poor work and bias as well as scientific worth and strength.

Only brief encounters with Aysgarths and Ashfords, even Venetia fades in and out of the sub plot without much impact. This is still a good novel, but with the others I carried them round the house reading at every opportunity, this one has stayed firmly beside my bed - not a good sign!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Tedious Installment in a Fascinating Series","review":"The literary problem with this novel, which so many readers find so riveting, is its construction. The book is broken into five parts narrated by four different interconnected persons. While it is interesting to view events as through a prism, this technique wears thin in page after page of rambling prose. This novel would have been much stronger if it had been edited down. Much too much verbiage! Much too much wandering over the same territory! At one point I wondered why I kept plodding on. The answer is, you get hooked on these characters due to this surplice-ripping series as a whole. Despite several melodramatic moments, nothing much happens in this novel-- it could have been condensed into a fine short story. For a budding Howatch fan, I recommend \\"Glittering Images\\" or particularly the incredible potboiler \\"The High Flyer\\" over this book any day."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Olympians as Gods, finally","review":"This book provides a bracing perspective of the Greek Gods, not as the worst of humanity, but as the best of the Cosmos. Prof. Lefkowitz's brief recaps of the ancient tales allow us to quickly see the roles the Gods play in human affairs. This is not a survey of the literature (nor is it intended to be) but rather a focus on the Gods on their own terms. They are more interested in Justice, Piety, and the performance of virtue, than they are about the petty squabbles of the short lived, self-involved and often treacherous beings under their care.This book is a must for students of ancient Greek religion, as it helps to prevent our anachronistic insertion of Christian characterizations of divinity, and of mis-judging the Gods by applying 21st century expectations of godhood."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing redeeming","review":"A drinking, smoking, swearing lady reverend who is separated from her husband and has a lousy relationship with her sister.

Too contrived! The symbolism is too blatant; the characters stereotypical. The only one to love in this novel is the nephew and he had a very forced, brief relationship with his aunt.The author used imagery, but nothing that was especially memorable.

I absolutely see the comparison of Glenn Richards to Bob Dylan...they have similar voices and phrasing. I thought the melodies were pretty good and especially liked the songs, One Crowded Hour and There is no such place.Can't say I loved it but after numerous plays there are definitely some good songs on here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland","review":"I like a lot of Australian bands: Midnight Oil, The Birthday Party (everything Nick Cave for that matter), Ghostwriters, AC/DC, Regurgitator, Dirty Three, Yothu Yindi, etc. So to hear a band described as, \\"...one of the most impassioned and poetic bands in Australia's rich musical history\\" sets expectations pretty high. Needless to say from the two star rating, I think a bit of hyperbole was employed in writing that bit of publicity about the band.They aren't terrible by any stretch of the imagination, but neither are they particularly remarkable. It kind of sounds like most bands heard on corporate radio, which is to say, competent performers that don't leave much of an impression on me. \\"One Crowded Hour\\" gave me high hopes for the record as it is a pretty solid song, but unfortunately, that was as good as it got for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mooooooo-d Music.","review":"After reading so many less than stellar recommendations, I feel compelled to jump to Augie March's defense. It's my first time with this band, and it was a pleasant, interesting sound. The kind of CD you play when the lights are dim, you're reading a book with a glass of good burgundy, and all you need to complete total sensory pleasure is the right music.\\"Moo\\" fills the bill admirably."},{"rating":"2","title":"The dialogue of a lifetime","review":"Augie March is one of those bands you are always in the mood for and will never get tired of. The lyrics are genius and will capture the attention of anyone! I loved the instrumental portion near the end of \`One Crowded Hour' with a dialogue between the keyboard and guitar as they feed off each other to produce a sound that is smooth and refreshing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not casual listening, but wonderful time investment","review":"Front man Glenn Richards is a poet first, and if you are a first-time Augie March listener, this music may not be immediately accessible. The lyrics are full of literary and musical references that take pondering, and the seamless musicianship of all of band members gives it all a real coherence without slickness. The music is beautiful, not because it is easy or clever or flashy, but because of the emotional punch it packs if you let it. Anything by Augie March is worth the small monetary investment and the larger time investment. Buy and listen and read the lyrics and google the references you can't figure out and listen and listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alt with a 60's feel","review":"I first heard Augie March on NPR a couple of weeks ago, and was quite taken with their nimble, Dylan-esque lyrics (everyone keeps saying it, but really, it's true) and dreamlike, 60s-psychadelic sound. The album is a terrific compilation of songs that stretch in many directions -- some emo, some jazz, even a little country -- without losing shape for the most part. (My one gripe is that the slightly punk \\"Just Passing Through\\", while a good listen, just really doesn't seem to fit with everything else on the disc. Perhaps that's intentional, in which case, the joke's on me.)Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"We Don't Get It","review":"This is my first time hearing Augie March (from what I've seen the Australians love this band). I was uninspired and unimpressed. The songs were over powered melodic type melodies that blend from one to the next. The lyrics are too soft and hard to hear. I can't tell you what most of the song are about. Some of the songs seem to be the group playing on top of one another. They don't even seem to be mixed well. There isn't one song on this album that you can sing or that sticks with you. Each 5-minute song is about 5 minutes too long for me. If you are already a fan of the band ... you may like this CD. But as far as the \\"pop\\" title they have given it, I've heard more pop in 50 Cent then in this CD. This is suicidal folk."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Don't Get It...","review":"at all. All music is subject to individual taste (perhaps more than any other art form) and this album did not suit mine. I actually liked the openning song \\"One Crowdwed Hour\\" and hoped it was the sign of more to come but the CD fizzled pretty fast from there. The songs were very non-descript and unremarkable. I kept waiting for that one song that would catch me and draw me in. It wasn't there."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Doleful Drones\\"","review":"Morose and monotonous. A change of volume did nothing to break the tediousness of unrelieved depression.Strange mixing destroys any chance of actually understanding the lyrics, but, since they appear in the accompanying folder, that's not necessarily a bad thing. They speak doom and gloom all the way. In fact, the title of this review is taken directly from the lyrics.I ordered this CD hoping for the vibrant liveliness of Australia. What I got was about an hour of unbroken angst. I find more than enough of that on the evening news."},{"rating":"1","title":"Throw these guys on the barbie....","review":"I'm not sure why this was a Vine offering, or frankly, why I was given one already released music CD and four books as options to review. I strickly do music reviews, but anyway, I was bored stiff with this band when I first heard them LAST YEAR!The song's all begin the same, a tired croon of a guitar and then his voice is more irritating than the worst of self-indulgent Wilco.There's oh, about 1200 bands in America doing ballad emo better than this Aussie import. And any song titled Victoria's Secret has two strikes against it to begin with, and then when it is basically a remix of the preceding song, well, stop telling this songwriter he's the next Bob Dylan.If you want to hear a brilliant Aussie band try the Lovetones. Their CD blew me away.A Bottle of RainNowhere Near the Sea of Cortez"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Pleasant Collection of Music","review":"This CD is pleasing enough in an acoustic/indie type of way. Reminds me of some of the innocent '60s bands, early Beatles, Simon & Garfunkel, that sort of thing. The lead singer's voice sounds A LOT like Tom Petty!It seems like it would be good background music at a cocktail party at low volume - not intrusive, but more interesting than instrumentals."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good, but not remarkable","review":"A finely produced Australian effort, \\"Moo, You Bloody Choir,\\" is a fair record, but ultimately unremarkable. If you already know the band, you may be pleased, but if, like me, this is your first introduction to Augie March, you won't find any stand out tracks or moments memorable enough to recommend the album to friends. You will have all already moved on."},{"rating":"2","title":"An intriguing mix, well worth a listen","review":"Okay, this certainly isn't the type of album I would typically pick up. But my music tastes certainly lean toward the eclectic and I'm always interested in listening to something different. However, after loading this album into my CD player and listening to the first song that it randomly loaded \\"Clockwork\\" I was thinking that this was a mistake. This fairly slow, repetitive song was not at all to my taste. As the album progressed though, I was pleasantly surprised. There is definitely a \\"Dylan-esk\\" tone to the lead singer's voice and the songs themselves are not at all repetitive, ranging from more soft, tender music, almost folksy in tone, to more of the type of hard songs that I would equate with typical alternative rock. Overall there are more enjoyable tunes on here than stinkers and it's definitely the type of album I will enjoy on additional listens."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Music, Good Listening","review":"Augie March's 3rd album is a great driving along the highway CD. With the first track, One Crowded Hour, I found myself tapping the steering wheel along to the music. (Yes, there was a leadfoot effect with this, as well.) The rest of the CD is a sound of dreamy rock...ballads and tunes sung passionately with a rock and roll twinge in the background.This album is worth adding to your collection. The lyrics will make you smile, the music will allow you to just hang out, and the songs will remind you that no matter what, it's all good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware!","review":"If You're planning on buying this DVD for *the* scene of Patrick Dempsey's private bits, don't waste Your money.I'd been waiting years for a DVD release of this great film, in the hopes that I'd get to see what was missing on the sides of my full-frame VHS copy. What I got instead was a \\"matted\\" widescreen, which is basically that full-frame version with the top & bottom lopped off (thus cropping out Patrick's flash).MGM really dropped the ball on this one. They should have included both the matted widescreen version AND the full-frame version like they did with the sci-fi flick \\"Supernova\\" (it'd easily fit - there are no extras on the 90 min. disc anyway)."},{"rating":"1","title":"SOME GIRLS","review":"SOME GIRLS is a real curio. The reason why I purchased it was for the talented Oscar-winners, Jennifer Connelly and Lila Kedrova. I remember when I first saw this film on cable. It wasn't a great film, but the cast (especially the wonderful Kedrova as Connelly's grandmother) kept it interesting. Connelly's family is definitely interesting all right. Only recommended for fans of Patrick Dempsey or the beautiful Connelly."},{"rating":"1","title":"a bad, disjointed movie","review":"Based on other reviews here on Amazon I took a chance on this movie. What a bad decision. They try to portray Jennifer Connelly's family as an ecentric bunch, and they succeed. But that aspect of the movie, as well as the overall plot, never leads me to care one bit about them and what is going on in this film. I had the VHS version and found myself fast scanning through portions after the first hour just to get to the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Badly lit stupid film","review":"This film looks like they forgot to turn the lights on when they were filming. Except for the hospital scenes, everything - even the outdoors scenes - are badly lit.The whole idea of the film is really unappealing. There is a lot of male nudity, with the private parts mostly covered, but one scene with Patrick Dempsey showing it all revealing his shortcomings (thank you David Neven).SPOILER: The ghost of the grandmother in the cemetary is really dumb."},{"rating":"2","title":"Visually stunning and sweet film about romantic love","review":"I first encountered this film late one night on a cable channel. I wish I could have experienced it in a theatre. I am not a big fan of Patrick Dempsey, but I found this to be the best film he has been a part of.Visually speaking, this is a unique movie to look at. Like most films by director Michael Hoffman, Some Girls utilizes unusual light and color design that permeate almost every frame of the picture. The unique locations, sets, a color further accentuate the eccentric characters featured in the story.The film is careful mixture of eroticism and romantic love. Most of the film seems to be a character study of an eccentric family mixed with elements of comic reflief. The end of the film takes the viewer on an unexpected romantic turn, which is certainly mystical and satisfying.The only big drawback about this movie is that it is available on VHS only. Someone please put this film on DVD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Holiday Favorite","review":"What a humorous love story.

This film borders on incestous behavior. It is not worth the time of day and has little, if any, redeeming value. As far as putting it on DVD....what a waste of energy. I rated this film \\"2 stars\\" because even though I very much did not like the film, the 1 star rating stipulation of \\"hatred\\" is too strong of a term. Why bother to invest the emotional & mental energy of hatred? I would rather stay healthy. Irresponsible behavior is quite a problem within our society today. We seem to CELEBRATE that which is tasteless, worthless, and degenerate behavior. Just wanted to weigh-in and represent another perspective :-) I do however very much appreciate Patrick Dempsey as an actor.

But I agree that it's a good movie, and because of the last 20 minutes, a very good movie. The voiceover detracts more than it helps the chemistry of the movie, but that's nit-picking. A DVD would be nice, and (I know the purists may lynch me) a remake might be a cool idea. I read that this wasn't released in the U.S. because producer Robert Redford wouldn't compromise the integrity of the film by cutting a frontal nude scene by the lead (male) character. If that's true, I don't see the big deal (pun not intended). Cut the scene and move on - it's not essential to the story one litte bit (pun intended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will not hold 100 cards...","review":"Great size and all, but it will not hold 100 cards, as it claims.

The movie makes no sense. It is a series of drawing room scenes interspersed with car chases and kidnappings that are incoherent. Colman is amusing, but everyone else is a disaster: Joan Bennett (an early film) is absurd, and the rest of the characters (and some of the scenery) are out of some German silent expressionist film (a bad one).The only interesting thing in the whole film is a few moments when they actually appear to have hired some traditional singers to do old a cappella pub songs from southern England.

Thus Paul's letter serves as a gentle attempt at reconciliation between relatives.Although some biblical scholars such as Douglas Moo and Marianne Thompson have discussed (briefly, in footnotes) some problems with Callahan's thesis, the idea that Onesimus was not Philemon's slave, or at least that Onesimus was not a runway, deserves more consideration than it has received.Some doctrinal questions are raised by this theory. First, how does the New Testament approach slavery, without relying on Philemon? Second, should spiritual leaders involve themselves in interpersonal disputes, and if they do, how should they go about it?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought-Provoking view of a largely ignored NT epistle","review":"Doctor Callahan has done New Testament studies a wonderful service with this thought-provoking, and stimulating exegesis of the largely ignored Epistle to Philemon. Challenging the historical view of Onesimus (from the time of Chrysostom-forward), Callahan brings a depth of historical analysis and greek exegesis that is scarcely found elsewhere. That a noted Harvard theologian could write so succinctly and clearly with such tremendous impact is in itself cause for rejoicing. This commentary will serve the Christian church well, for years to come, in how we view Pauline theology in light of Philemon.

Although this book contains more material then the UNIX man pages, this small book (<125 pages) really didn't expand my knowledge of make (I found the OpenVMS MMS user documentation more enlightening, although still lacking). This book tries to be all things to all people, and ends up being a few things to some.

Don't like the way her outfits look all wet and stained and can't tell how much she is getting cause she's wearing most of the milk on her clothes.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Comes with Wrong nipples","review":"I cannot find the larger bottles with the #1 nipples. I am breastfeeding and do not want to use the faster flow nipples. I bought this set specifically because it said it comes with the newborn nipples and it does not.These bottles are great, but it's impossible to find the larger bottles with the newborn nipples. I was able to find them when my son was born 3 months ago, but now no one carries them."},{"rating":"1","title":"The only thing I use them for....","review":"...is to store breastmilk in the fridge, and when it's time to feed my baby, I transfer the milk to a ventaire bottle. WHY? After many parents telling me to try the Avent bottles because they are the best, I decided to do a little research. I checked out the reviews, which were mixed, so I went out and bought the Dr Brown's bottles, and I already had the ventaire set in my baby's closet and the Avent (I also have Evenflo). The Avent bottles never leaked on me, but the nipple was just too hard and my baby was very gassy after every feeding! The Dr Brown bottles I thought would actually work, but more violent gas for my baby! I like the set Avent bottles come in, with the pacifier and the lids, and I've used them all! They are great for storing milk in, but I just don't use them to feed my baby! Ventaires are way better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy These Bottles !!!!","review":"All the hype and high price tag are not worth it for these bottles. The only way you can get the nipples on these bottles without leaking is to put them on soooo tight that you can't get it off to wash them. Everytime I put the lid on and started to give to my son, it leaked (not a small little drop, I mean like pouring out!!!) all over him and I had to change his outfit. I should have wrote to the company and ask them to reimburse me for all of the laundry detergent that I went through because of the leaking. Several reviews, state if you do this they wont leak or if you do that or dont screw it on too tight or put the cap on and twist at this angle. I am sorry, but when you have a newborn, the last thing that you want to do is have to refer to the directions on the box at 3 am feeding!!!! Its a bottle, not a NASA Rocket! I used the platex liner bottles with my daughter and if I have another child, I will use platex, never these bottles again"},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaky bottles","review":"These bottles leak everywhere. If you dont properly line up the ridges when you screw the nipple they will leak all over you and baby. Save your precious breastmilk and/or expensive formula and buy another brand. They stink!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"There Are Better Bottles","review":"Although they have a good reputation, they definately have a drawback. They are short and fat bottles, so you really have to lean your baby back to get all the liquid to the nipple. Now that my son is holding his own bottle, we don't use them for that fact-it's just too hard for him to get his formula to the nipple, he gets too frustrated. All in all I'd say buy a different bottle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spilled Milk!","review":"Spilled on the floor...Spilled in the car...Spilled on my clothes...bottom line...IT SPILLS!!! I would not recommend this product unless you like to clean up spills. It was frustrating as first time parents to start feeding the baby and find out it was spilling everywhere. The baby would cry and cry until we were able to change the bottle to another brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated these bottles","review":"I tried Avent bottles since they were so popular. I hated them! They leaked all over my daughter during feeding and made her bib and her soaked by the end. I wonder how much formula she really got. We used Dr. Brown's and they were so much better. Skip Avent and try others!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaky mess","review":"I was using the Playtex bottles with the drop ins and I had to start thickening my son's formula with cereal. I was so excited when I found that Avent made a variable flow nipple for thick feeds. These bottles leak around the ring no matter what I do. I have tried everything and can't seem to keep them from leaking. I have continued to use the Avent bottles even though we don't have to thicken his formula anymore, because of the large investment. My son is 9 months and as soon as he is weaned to a sippy cup, these are going in the trash. I will not use them for other children."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok bottle but leaks a lot","review":"I got a lot of avent bottles for my baby shower so I decided I would try using this brand over the rest of them. After a week of them leaking all over everything I gave up and switched to Playtex with drop-ins. My son hated the Avent ones, he was very gassy with them also. Once I switched to Playtex things improved right away.Some good points: they are easy to clean and you can use them in a bottle warmer but other than that I can't stand the leaking and the fact my baby was so gassy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avent bottles no good","review":"I am using Avent bottles for my second time with child number two. And the only reason why I am using these this time is, because of all the money we have invested in these bottles. When we registered with our first child everyone was talking about Avent bottles, so we registered for lots of the bottles, nipples, etc.They leak all the time. If you do not have the bottle completely dry and the outside ring just right it is a mess. And you do not know that there is a leak till you sit down with a starving baby. The baby begins sucking and tons of formula starts leaking down your hand.If you put the nipples in the dish washer (which it says you can do)they turn a filmy color. I was told that this is not harmful for the baby. But to me it just makes the nipples look not clean. And this causes me to wash them by hand. Which again is the last thing you want to do when you have a hungry baby."},{"rating":"2","title":"I agree with the others.............","review":"Yes, these bottles do leak if not put together properly and did cause one of my twins some gas but out of all the bottles I tied (and I tried alot) the flow of the stage 1 nipple suited both my children perfectly. I have twins and my daughter was born at 4lbs (considered preemie)and this is the only bottle that suited her and her brother perferctly in terms of flow, capacity and ease to clean. So the benefits greatly outweighed the few flaws this bottle has. In regard to the gas I found that if I held the bottle at a tilt towards the babies chest it solved the problem. Might not work for you but thats how I deal with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"So good I got it again!","review":"With my first child I got all Avent supplies, including the hand pump. I found that I love their stuff. Now that my second child has been born I found that I needed to \\"clean up\\" and add to my supplies so I went out and bought this product again. If you are breastfeeding primarily this is a great bottle because it helps to cut down on \\"nipple confusion\\". My daughter went from breast to bottle easily and my son seems to be doing the same. I noticed one person wrote that she had trouble with the bottles for her daughter. I have NEVER had a problem. I love this company and this is a great started set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaky, Leaky, Leaky","review":"I used these through out my daughter's infancy, largely because I bought a whole set of them, the milk storage contraptions, the breast pump, and the pacifiers. Plus once she was used to the pacifiers and nipples she wouldn't take any other kind.But the bottles routinely leaked, ruining several diaper bags, clothing, and nighttime feedings.Apparently you have to screw the cap on just right- which is really difficult at 3 AM!My daughter didn't seem to have the gas and colic that other reviews talk about, but we did use quite a bit of gas medicine between 3 and 6 months.All in All, I think the paci's are great, the rest of it I could do without."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ready to throw the bottles through the window!!!!","review":"Like many others, I registered for these bottles because they were supposed to be the best out there. After they started leaking, I just sucked it up for a while. Then I got aggravated enough to write to AVENT on their website. They wrote back to me that I was screwing them on too tight. So, i took their advice, and now, after washing the diaper bag for the umpteenth time because the contents of the bottles spilled out all over, I have written to them again. I don't think that I should have to worry about how tight I am screwing the tops on. I should be able to twist the top on and rest assured that my child won't go hungry and scream because his formula is all over the bottom of the diaper bag!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"I am so glad that I did not purchase these bottles for myself (they were a gift). Every single bottle leaks. It is very frustrating when you are up in the middle of the night trying to soothe your little one back to sleep & go to make a bottle just for it to leak all over. Not only is the leaking a problem the vacum it creates & the amount of air your baby drinks is horrible. I switched to Playtex Vent-Air which was better & then finally gave in & purchased the Dr. Browns. I used Avent for 1 month before switching & the day after noticed a huge difference. I thought Avent would be a good brand because of all the items & amount of space they give the Avent products in the baby store but take my advice & spend a few extra dollars to get a better bottle. I am sure your little one will appreciate it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Convenient but unreasonable","review":"The ideas for the bottles interchanging is great. But unfortunately the nipples cause too much gas. When they're using the bottle, you can hear constant air sucking in around their lips. Every time my little girl uses them, it seems as though she just can't get comfortable with them. I would recommend Dr.Brown's or Playtex VentAire bottles over any of these.Ultimately, the convenience and features aren't worth the massive amount of gas the avent bottles cause."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I am a first time mother, who bought these bottles because they were supposed to be the best. My child was really gassy. He also ended up wasting a lot of his food each time because the nipple is way too fast for a newborn. I was really disappointed with these bottles. I switched to the Playtex disposable bottles, and he has been much happier since I have. Also, he gets every bit of food I give him now."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE PRODUCTS","review":"While pregnant, all I heard was \\"Avent Avent Avent\\" I think I missed the rest of the conversation because they make horrible bottles, breast pumps, and sippy cups. Their products are terrible and I would never recommend them. They leak all over, at first I thought it was just one, but no all of them. They are garbage. Now that I am looking for bottles again for my second child, I will definately stay clear of Avent."},{"rating":"1","title":"One word sums up Avent bottles-- LEAK","review":"We have bought numerous bottles from Avent and a vast majority of them leak. Don't believe the \\"user-error\\" excuse as other bottles from other manufacturers are much, much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much dribbling","review":"We started giving one bottle a day to our daughter at 2 weeks of age, and are otherwise breastfeeding.The first bottle system we tried was the Avent since so many people rave about it.But, it seemed as though she was dribbling out more milk than she was swallowing. I have since heard the same complaint from other parents (with both formula and breastmilk).We had much more success with the Platex Natural Shape VentAire, and continue to use that system today.This is her favorite pacifier, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Bottles and System","review":"I used these bottles when my daughter was born in 97 and they were great. I have seen reviews that complained about nipple size, but Avent makes nipples in a numebr of different \\"flows\\". The newborn nipple is for newborns and you gradually progress as your child grows. I did have the nipples collapse, but it was only becuase I needed to switch to the next nipple stage. My daughter was sucking to hard for the newborn nipple. Other than that, I had no problems with the bottle at all. I found that my daughter was able to both breastfeed and drink from her Avent bottles with no problems at all. The nipples were not too hard and both my daughter and I were completly happy with them. As she got older I began using the traning spout and handles on the bottle which was definitely an added bonus. I would recommend this product to any mother looking to breastfeed thier child.Update: I'm using these bottles with my 2nd child and they are just as wonderful as I remember."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaky Bottles","review":"I bought the Avent bottles when I was pregnant because they were babiesrus's \\"Best Pick\\" Yeah right!

I was very disappointed with the Avent because it leaked and gave my daughter gas. No matter how I closed the bottle, and reopening and reclosing it, it always leaked. After being frustrated with it, I finally switched back to Dr. Brown's. At least my daughter's clothes (and mine) don't get wet from the leaks anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"very leaky!!!","review":"I have a four month old son and when registering for bottles I chose Avent.I work at a daycare and I noticed a lot of the infants had these bottles.I also liked their compact size and wide opening for cleaning.Avent bottles have one BIG problem, they leaked almost every time I used them-BADLY!!!When tilting the bottle to an upright position to burp my son, a good 1/2oz. to 1oz. would come streaming from the nipple ring.It did not matter how tight my husband or I would tighten the ring, the same thing would happen.So if you do not want to waste your formula or breastmilk,look for different bottles!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No Second Chance","review":"My husband and I purchased this set with my first son, but are going to choose another bottle manufacturer for our second son. The difficultly we experienced was securing the nipple ring onto the base - it had to be in perfect alignment or there were definately leaks, sometimes more than that.

She describes each of the men on the trip in enough detail for the reader to understand their subsequent behavior. She looks honestly at Shackleton's actions, his character, and his extraordinary courage. Shackleton was an astonishing leader who brought back every man under his command under circumstances so appalling that the reader struggles to believe.

Ernest Shackleton is a study in leadership, and it's abundantly evident here as to why. Replete with page-turning narration and beautiful photos reproduced from the original glass plate negatives, this is one book you won't want to put down. One of the greatest adventures of all time and this author will prove it to you. Very well done!!Post Script:I must add that what made this particular book stand out was the fantastic photographs.

Frank Hurley's photographs alone make the book a valuable addition to any afficianado's collection on the subject. They are awe-inspiring, and in turn both majestic and intimate in their portrayal of the fate of the Endurance and her crew. This book is released in conjunction with the exhibition to be mounted at the Museum of Natural History next spring; I only wish that some additional material, such as journal pages and related artifacts had been included to give the book a little more \\"warmth\\" since the subject matter is so undeniably \\"chilly\\"!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent account of an Imperialist Adventure","review":"The English explorers of the early 20th century were equivalent to the the American space programs astronauts of the 1960's.

Everyone who has read it has commented on not just the incredible adventure related, but on how interesting the writing and photos are. Sir Ernest Shackleton and the crew of the Endurance is one of the greatest stories of survival and perseverence in this century.

The unimaginable hardship and the cruel beauty of the south pole literally jumps off the page and transports the reader.In addition, the book is successful in presenting Shackleton's expedition as a triumph despite the fact that it did not achieve its scientific goals.

However, its use of Frank Hurley's photographs to enrich the telling of this compelling story makes Alexander's book essential to anyone at all interested in Shackleton's voyage. As a result of reading both this book and Alfred Lansing's \\"Endurance\\", we made the trip to New York to visit the American Museum of Natural History's Endurance exhibition. The exhibition, which includes the photographs in the book, some early color photographs and motion pictures from the expedition, and the James Caird itself, was well worth seeing, but a tribute to this book is that it captures the essence of the exhibition very well. If you can't go the exhibition, and even if you can, you should read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book with outstanding pictures","review":"In reading this book I am amazed at the needless hardships these men have endured and even thou they failed how much you can learn about leadership in this book. The lack of common since surely hurt them to no end.

It would be hard to believe such an ordeal occured, but that there is this book to document it. I loved it, and I am thrilled with Alexander's work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great intro book to a great story--photos alone worth it","review":"Authors who sometime's \\"popularize\\" an event sometimes are castigated for their efforts as has been done with Alexander's book \\"Endurance\\". Given the research on the subject over the years, it's no suprise that Alexander might be criticized for covering little new ground. But that should not prevent you from getting this book. She does an excellent job looking inside the men and not merely recounting events. Furthermore, Alexander's research on material held by the various families, and probably not available to Lansing, does add some detail to this story that is still suprisingly unknown to the world at large. She makes it accesible and enjoyable to readers of all ages.

No fears ordering from them."},{"rating":"2","title":"A clear view","review":"Ray Stricklyn was a master of stagecraft, and his one-man show on Williams was a work of great power and beauty. His book is a clear view of a life spent as an actor, offering his personal view of Hollywood long gone. It's a wonderful story, and simply told."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unrelentingly sad...","review":"This is not a very well written book. It's more like rambling memories. I never heard of Ray Stricklyn before reading this book. He was a want-a-be actor that didn't quite make it, disappated his time and energies and doesn't seem to have done very much at all except that he randomly came in contact with 'names' in show business. The dedication in the book is the best thing in it: 'For all the fine actors who didn't get the opportunities their talents deserved...' I guess Mr. Stricklyn included himself in that. Very sad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well written","review":"Nugent writes well,has a fun sense of humor,but was very little actual monster searching done, as most of his time was spent tied up in beauracratic red tape. Still I enjoyed the sense of adventure, the culture he spied and shared with us.Over all not a bad read,but not what i had hoped for, in that i wanted more monster action, although it did demonstrate the difficulties an expedition faces or in Mr.Nugent's case, a single man has in achieving the goals of their dreams ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring ......... Boring .................Boring","review":"I was really looking forward to this book, but oh what a disappointment. The title is completely misleading, there's very little 'on the trail' of anything. It just seems to me to be one of those pointless travelogues that a journalist wrote because his real purpose (finding a dinosaur) bore no fruition. Undoubtedly there were setbacks that hampered his search, but I don't think these warrant a book. My advice is to call it a day when you know you know you haven't got a story and leave the rest of us a few quid richer. On the plus side, I only have to read three pages every night before it sends me to sleep, so a pretty positive experience for anybody experiencing insomnia."},{"rating":"1","title":"flimsy rolodex cards","review":"Didn't realize that some cards didn't come with openings to secure business cards.

I read this book with my small women's group and we got a lot out of it. The best part is it not only talks about spiritual direction, but it also gives practical advice and examples. It is both theoretical AND practical in nature, which is sometimes hard to find. Highly recommend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Companionship on our journey","review":"I was asked to walk alongside a woman recently and at the same time, due to my profession, was advised to seek out a spiritual director. Isn't it amazing how God orchestrates these events? Of course, I do feel I would benefit greatly from a more spiritual person and friend in my life. But of course, I do not feel worthy to be a spiritual advisor to anyone else. But this book is revealing alot to me. \\"The task of spiritual friends is to help us discern the Presence, will and leading of the Spirit of God.\\" Together we will open ourselves and grow toward that intimate and closer walk with God. I haven't even finished this book, but already I am feeling a greater presence in my daily walk.

I am actually a German Christian who in my adolescent years became obsessed with learning about my history. I've read and own over 100 books on the Holocaust and can tell you that this piece by Jack Eisner is a true inspiration to humanity. His recollection on his past, and what he wanted in his future is so realistic you actually feel like you're there living these moments through him. You feel like you know his grandmother, mother, father, Halina and anyone introduced in the book. Its hard in the 21st century to be reminded that one time in history there were heros. There was more of a reason to live, to breathe, to love. I believe that this book could make anyone look at their life from a different aspect and appreciate what they have a lot more. If you can handle hard truths, graphic memories and feel like you're living them yourself... buy this book. Once you start there's no putting it down. I promise it will not disappoint you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible!","review":"At the end, the author wrote, \\"Everyone who had a chance to read the manuscript in progress expressed disbelief that all these experiences could have happened to one person and yet he survived.\\" This is how I felt reading this book. His will to live and his resourcefulness were amazing. What guts he had, for example, to plot and to rescue his mother from the Nazi hospital! He came so close to being killed by the Nazis so many times and managed to escape so many times. It's hard to imagine that there really are people in the world with such courage. I didn't want to read another WWII book, but I picked this one up (my wife had bought it)while waiting for my next book to arrive, and once I started it I couldn't put it down. If you can stand to hear the horrible realities, read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A testament to the resilience of teenagers","review":"As a high school drama teacher, I am always looking for edgy material that is age appropriate and can speak to my students. After reading the play adaptation of The Survivor (adapted by Susan Nanus) I was intrigued to read more. What the play covers (mainly the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising) is only a tenth of what this book manages to convey. I was entranced by the resilience of a teenager to cope through horrific times with great strength, intelligence, and courage. It reminded me of what my students are capable of when put to the test (very minor test compared to those of Jack Eisner). My students embraced this piece of literature both in the play format and the memoir. I can highly recommend both for anyone who is wanting to test their students to see of what they are truly made. It may surprise you how much more mature our teenagers are when dealing with important subject matter."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic album","review":"An amazing re-issue of this 1987 classic. Not only do the original tracks, expertly mixed by Bill Price, sound better than before, but Rick Brewster himself dug up, restored and mixed 10 unreleased recordings dating from between 1981 and 1983, including a version of \\"Gonna Leave You\\" that predates the studio version by three years. The booklet and new liner notes by Brent Eccles nicely complement this fine re-issue of a multi-platinum Australian rock music classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Angels Ever","review":"This is a great live album which you will have no problems listening to over and over again. It is chock full of Angel's classics and will not disappoint any fan of between the eyes rock and roll. The sound quality is very good and Doc Neesan is in fine form.

It is my favorite prenatal yoga video. It modifies the classic sun salute series of yoga poses for pregnancy. There is a 20-minute segment that teaches the routine, a 10-minute segment that leads you through the routine, pausing to breathe at each pose, and there is a 5-minute segment that goes through the routine without pausing to stay at each pose. There is also a 2-minute relaxation. Sometimes I do several or all of the segments for a complete practice, and sometimes I choose to do the 5 or 10-minute segment in addition to one of the segments on the Prenatal Yoga DVD that is also by rudra press."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Video!!!!!!!","review":"The DVD was delivered quickly, and is high quality.

It is great i but, and i recomend it to everybody."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was expecting something quite provocative when I purchased this DVD. I was VERY disappointed with this video. Sorry, but girl on girl doesn't do it for me. Overall, I give Wet and Wild IX a poor rating.

Vegan Dream jerky is very dry and tough with strong flavors. Cowgirl is my favorite, with a nice mix of sweet and spice but there are other flavors that have more heat and/or saltiness.Vegan Drean jerky is very different from Primal Strips mentioned in another review. Primal Strips are more of a typical \\"textured soy in sauce\\" treat but I also enjoy them.If you want to really CHEW the jerky and tear it apart (can you tell I USED to be a carnivore) - check out Vegan Dream."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Worthless","review":"Griswold's treatment of the books is disappointingly shallow. He makes a number of undeniably true observations about what children like, how they behave, what they seek out, etc - and then notes that various well-known books satisfy those desires. E.g., children like to feel snug, like to enclose themselves in small spaces - and guess what? that's exactly what you find in various children's books. Griswold doesn't devote much time to asking \\"why?\\" or to explaining the significance of any of these desires. The book is enjoyable but by the time you're done reading the author's very superficial discussion, your reaction is, \\"well, I could have told you all that off the top of my head.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Great clipper","review":"I'd previously used a Wahl rechargeable clipper, which was great for mobility but ran out of juice too fast to do my dog's entire coat completely.

If you are in the market for a good set of dog clippers this is the one for you. Dont waste time and money on the cheap ones they dont last. The best part about them is the removable blades.

I bought these to shave through the tough under-coat mats, but they don't even begin to cut through even the smallest of mats!

I never had any trouble with it and was always able to find a static free station. I loved the fact that I could put batteries in it and use it in my house without hooking into the surround sound system. So, after I broke the first one, I came back and ordered the same one. Plus, at this price --- it can't be beat! It really is a great little product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Value","review":"After reading about these transmitters, I made sure I purchased one I could program. I live in Los Angeles and some other reviewers had problems in large metropolitan areas. I can program 10 presets into this. I've programmed 2 and so far have only used one. I have a 2006 infiniti with a CD player and no line in. I have an aux power output for devices in the center armrest console. I've used this anticipating that the device \\"eats\\" batteries quickly. (Another common complaint with these units.) The reception is good and strong (maybe because my antenna is on the inside of the back windshield.)Anyway no major problems. The only reason I don't give this 5 stars is that it didn't come with instructions how to program and although the sound is clean and consistent, it seems to lack the crystal clear highs I get when I use the cassette adapter in my other vehicle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great until it died!","review":"I got the product from a friend who knows that our family takes a lot of long road trips. Hers was similar - not the same - and she loved it. We took it out of the box, and there were no instructions. Strike one. After fooling with it for a bit, we figured out how to get it to transmit. Never did figure out how to get the temp. gauge to go from Celcius to Fahrenheit...though why you'd need that on an mp3 transmitter I don't know. Got it working - sounded great! We were on a road trip, and all three of us had brought our portables! YAY! And then, 1/4 of the way through our trip, it just suddenly died. It wasn't the battery as we had it plugged into the charger. But we tried to get the battery section to work, too. Nothing. Strangely, it showed it was still transmitting, and the clock and temp. were still functioning, so it was getting power. Numerous tries over several days, to no avail.

The recording comprises of four songs that are a mismatch of a sad attempt of musical trends, past and present. The awful combination of ska guitar, slap bass, dinosaur drums and novice electronics reveals the untrained hands behind the compositions. Even Silverchair's latest effort is craftier than this. I know the rigors of Indie recording and try to keep up on the local scene. Which leads me to the conclusion of either this band has it together on stage or they don't have it together at all. When cruising the local band bin try going over a letter and picking up The Belvederes latest.

Over a year's use in a small office (7 users) with fairly simple print jobs, this Brother printer would regularly hang and require a power cycle and random opening and closing of doors to make it reset.I never saw this sort of behavior with HPsThe moral? Laser printers have a lot of moving parts in a harsh environment (high internal temperatures and toner dust). You can get away with cheap monitors, motherboards, and almost anything else electronic, but with printers a cheap design will cost you downtime and frustration.If you value your time and rely on your printer, look at something more solidly designed.

There are several heads and bases that can be interchanged for different needs. The rubber base holds very strongly and the manufacturer sells a spare rubber shoe and lever as a kit. As you can see in the pictures I took, the base can be fully disassembled.Mind you, this is not the kind of vise you'll find bolted to a metalworking bench, but it is a much stronger alternative to \\"helping hands\\". In all, it's superb for everything from soldering and small crafts to light drilling."},{"rating":"1","title":"A major disappointment","review":"I bought this book because I was hoping to pick up tons of practical tips that I could apply to my everyday life as a working mom, but I found that it merely rehashed things I've read in every woman's magazine time and time again: plan ahead, make casseroles for the freezer, delegate, etc. etc. I much preferred Working Mothers 101."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yes, disappointing.","review":"I too was disappointed with this book. I am a full-time mother, so I could not relate to her perspective as a \\"dual-career\\" mom. Much of what she wrote about was just not helpful, and I really can't imaging it being helpful for a \\"working\\" mom either. I cannot recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"High on entertainment value, low on culinary content.","review":"I am a new college grad trying to learn how to cook for myself. After picking up a copy of this book, I found that it did a better job of entertaining and glorifying his show than it did teaching people how to cook. The receipes are fine, but there is little explanation or technique involved. There are also many pictures of Emeril entertaining his TV audiences. If you are a die hard Emeril fan, you might like this book for its entertainment value. If you want to learn to cook for yourself, you might get frustrated with the lack of technical content. If the latter is true, order a cook book by someone who is also a master culinary educator as well as a master chef. Unfortuntately, all of Emeril's books seem to be like this one. I guess that it is safe to say that even though Emeril is popular on TV, his books may not be the best to learn from. He may be entertaining and hip, but he is definately NO Julia Child!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book - Great recipes!","review":"Having become an Emeril fan recently, I purchased the New New Orleans Cookbook and loved it. I purchased TV Dinners looking for the same level, and, for the most part, was satisfied. Emeril fans will love this book, not only for the recipes but for the inside looks at the show and its staff. However, those who are not familiar with Emeril and his slightly \\"offbeat\\" methods may not like TV Dinners. I have made about 10 of the recipes, and they have all turned out great. This is a treasure trove of good ideas and methods and should be a part of any good kitchen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not too exciting - just DELICIOUS food!","review":"Although the book has a few too many irrelevant pictures of his staff, rather than the dishes prepared, virtually every recipe in the book will have you drooling in anticipation. The recipes are easy enough to follow, and I've had nothing but incredible results. The recipe for his Essence was a bonus - I'm using it on everything now!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Does Not Kick It Up A Notch For Me","review":"I was frankly quite disappointed with this cookbook as it seemed moreabout Emeril than it was his food. I found the chapter breakdowndifficult to follow, and the few recipes I tried were adequate atbest. As [an] Italian Food Host.., I have over 300cookbooks in my collection, and this is one of the few I am sorry Ibought. Unless you are a huge fan of Emeril's, I'd advise you not towaste your money on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good ol Emeril","review":"I love cooking. It is a true hobby for me. Nothing is more fun than getting together a few friends and putting on a dinner party. As a result, I have bought a lot of cookbooks. Knowing this, some friends have given me some of Emerils books. I have seen him on TV, but never really caught on to what was so special about him. I have tried his recipes from his books. some have turned out okay, but none were 'out of this world'. What I have found is that Emeril does like to have fun with his cooking. That is great. But I have to disagree that his cooking 'aint rocket science here'. His recipes can be very time consuming and expensive. They are not for the average or novice cook. For people who love cooking, I would recommend other cookbooks that have easier to follow recipes, more pictures of the food itself, and far less self-promotion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing info","review":"Although I've only made one dinner from the book, the recipe I chose was inaccurate. There were steps missing in the directions and it forced me to guess. If I had followed the directions as printed, the dish would not have been fully cooked. This book needed to be proof-read a little better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too involved for home cooking","review":"This book is loaded with good photos of Emeril and his crew, but comes up short on practical dishes the average cook can prepare. Many recipes involve ingredients that are only found at specialty markets, which are few and far between outside of major cities.Also, many dishes require extensive preparation of, for lack of a better word, \\"sub-dishes\\". For example, making the empanadas requires the cook to make the dough, prepare the fillings, and prepare two types of toppings; each step is a difficult recipe in and of itself.If you like Emeril and enjoy the challenge of restaurant cooking, this book might be good for you. If you'd rather leave the fancy fare to the pros who do it best, then skip the book and spend the money at the restaurant instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better Luck Next Time, Emeril!","review":"What a disappointment! I've enjoyed his show and thought this would be a great first cookbook (of his) to add to my extensive collection. Not to Be! Recipies just didn't work and I'm an experienced cook! I actually tore out the pages with his spice blends to save, and tossed the rest. No point in taking up shelf space! The three recipies I tried failed to pass my taste test and the others didn't even sound good. Just because a dish has weird proportions or exotic ingredients doesn't make it innovative or unique from a culinary standpoint!! After all the purpose of cooking is to make something that TASTES good!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Turn off the TV","review":"I am not impressed with Emeril's book TV Dinners. I like his show okay, but there are too many pictures and not enough recipes. Also, the recipes are just updates to others he has put in older books. Personally, I think this is just Emeril overkill. A tribute book to Emeril is just a sign that he is getting overexposed. It's time that we turn off the TV and Emeril gets back to basics of doing what he does best, cook!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining as well as delicious!","review":"This book is filled with truly delicious recipes that are easy enough for even a beginner to follow. It also includes a lot of photographs from his TV show Emeril Live (hence the name of the book, TV Dinners) and dedications to his many friends and family. He is a certified Master Chef (one of two on the Food Network) and Julia Childs describes him as an outstanding, talented chef. He also holds a Doctorate degree from Johnson and Wales (trains the top chefs).....his vast knowledge and experience definitely shine through with these mouth-watering recipes. You won't be disappointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very dissapointing.","review":"I can't agree more with the other evaluations giving this book one star. I have been cooking professionally for three years now, and can't imagine anyone who is a serious cook enjoying Emeril or any of his books. His books and his shows are pretty much designed for thoes who want to be entertained, but who are clueless when it comes to real cooking. These recipies in this book are all pretty much the same----full of fat, excess salt, and that horrible \\"essence\\" of his. Everything has \\"essence\\", which sounds trendy but seems to be overused. If you want to be a serious cook, invest in The Joy of Cooking, or a James Beard book, or certainly anything by Julia Child. However, this book and anything else by Emeril Lagosse is a waste of time, trees, and money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Emeril makes cooking fun and happy, happy, happy.","review":"This cookbook lays everything out for you, from the basics of making stock and the ingredients in Essence all the way to the Truffle stuffed chicken legs!BAM! This is a great book, full of fun facts, photos and great recipes! Happy, happy, happy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I thought it would be","review":"I didn't like this book at all. Emeril is not a genius. He might be a fair cook, but he isn't a genius. This book was nothing but a bunch of pictures of him. The recipes were less than average. I may try to return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"I have followed Emeril for quite awhile now. A couple of years ago I bought Real and Rustic to try out his recipes, becuse they all looked so good. There were some accuracy problems with the quantities, but by and large the recipes turned out okay. I bought this book thinking it would provide newer recipes. Instead, a lot of them are just updated reprints of recipes that he has been using for years. The book also is like a coffe table book, because it is mainly pictures of him on his set. Save your money. If you want to see Emeril, turn on the TV. If you want the recipes, by one of his older books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Impressed","review":"I purchased this book because I love to cook Emeril's recipes...but was very disappointed. I love to see photos of the food I am going to make, rather than photos of the chef and people I do not know. I also did not like the layout of the book, for example he would put a title of a dish and talk about it on one page, and have the recipe on the next page. I think out of the entire book I will probably make 4 dishes. I would not spend my money on it, but would download his recipes from the Food TV website instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"An absolute riot!","review":"This episode was a riot from beginning to end.

The review is both well-written and encouraging. Unfortunately the same can't be said for Ms. Berzon's book. It's full of relationship clich��s familiar to anyone who has watched daytime TV in the past 15 years, \\"alcohol can affect your sex life,\\" \\"self-esteem issues can lead to infidelity.\\" There are a few gay cliches to distinguish this from the trite of the self-help books available for straights, \\"gay men are less likely to assume that monogamy is an integral part of committed relationship\\" etc. These are not exact quotes, but they're accurate enough. Read the sample pages available here. The book doesn't get any more insightful. I'm sure we're all intrigued by the possibility that we may only be touching the surface of our relationship potential, but this book isn't going to help you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disappointment","review":"A BIG disappointment. Hokey writing style, trite and shallow. A little like \\"reading\\" a TV program. It does not delve very deeply into the topic at all. Repetitive, oversold for its theme and nothing terribly actionable comes of it. Clever title, but certainly there are better books on the subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"Progress is not a bad thing.","review":"With all the pining for the limited technology/luxuries of past eras in this book, i suspect there might be a general issue with progress as well as the overconsumption of expensive gew-gaws. So i have mixed feelings...this book echos some of my already set sentiments about modern spending habits and classism. Overall, the book has a good message that could really do people some good. It comes from a good place and i see what the authors are trying to accomplish.... but i found the tone, slight paranoia and misplaced nostalgia to be a bit of a turn off. I was hoping to come away with a renewed, positive urge to carefully choose what i buy but instead began to resent being painted as a stupid, miserable, empty, American cubicle slave that hates their job and exists only to consume and defecate plastic flotsam all over my environment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good condition","review":"The book is used and obviously has some wear and tear. Despite that, the condition of the book is pretty good! I was satisfied with this purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"So much potential...and then the socialism creeps in","review":"The premise of this book is great; discussing the over-consumption by many Americans. It really does a good job of making you think about all of the junk that you have accumulated during your life, and asking yourself \\"Why?\\" It really makes you want to simplify your life. Unfortunately, the book is ruined by all of the liberalism it promotes. At one point, there is discussion of Marxism in a positive light. It is hard for me to wrap my arms around a book that would promote such a thing. The book seems to suggest that the government should be involved in reducing Americans consumption. I am in agreement that we must reduce our waste and over-consumption, but it must be a personal choice. That is what is known as freedom. The book loses me as I am sure that it will other readers when it encourages socialist, or even communist views."},{"rating":"1","title":"Luddite socialist pining for a happy past that never existed","review":"Let free people in a free market work as hard as they want, and chose the rewards they want. If you want to \\"recommend\\" they work less and consume less, fine. But lots of totalitarian nanny state implications in this book. Leave us alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"Although this book makes many good points, the basic premise being that Americans have too much stuff and too little time, it is fatally flawed by the religious content. The authors repeatedly make references to religious figures such as Mother Theresa and Ted Haggard. Although Mother Theresa is something of a sacred cow, anyone who has done some research into her financial practices will find her less than admirable. (Missionary Position is one good book to read, if interested in learning more) She may not have accumulated \\"stuff\\", but she didn't mind accumulating money--nor did she mind if it was from stolen pensions. And Ted Haggard? All of these mega churches suck money out of people unable to think critically, pay no taxes, and the snake oil preacher men like Haggard live extravagant lifestyles. I quit reading about a quarter of the way through. The credibility crumbled."},{"rating":"2","title":"My opinion about the Affluenza","review":"I think it is a very interesting and well written book about important issues of the life in America.

And, admittedly, I did like the first few chapters; however, the tone and style of presentation changed very quickly, and became almost smug and self-aggrandizing. The authors seemed far too pleased with themselves, and, by approximately the halfway point I felt as if I were reading some kind of bizzare Conservationist Manifesto. I like to think - as a self-appointed conservationist and vegan - that I try to mind Mother Nature and all living creatures, but after I finished reading this repetitive, pedantic bore, I lost the will to care. Maybe I am being too harsh, but this book seemed to peak in the first chapter; then, it became exasperatingly preachy and redundant. Others liked the book, and that's fine; But I was disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"California Girl","review":"Skip the first story by Jane Feather which is awful.

Guess when it comes to this book, my heart was just two sizes too small."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Ideas but....","review":"This cookbook has some great ideas and I will probably try making one or two recipes in it. It is not an traditional Japanese cuisine cookbook. Its like saying that all of Martha Stewart's recipes are traditional American cuisine. All of Harumi's recipes have quality ingredients and the book explains any new or different cooking techniques quite well, but most of the recipes are not something I really want to eat. It is a good book and its not Harumi's fault that I dont like a lot of ingredients she uses. I do think it was worth the price since I love looking at cookbooks to get new ideas for cooking. I may not use very many recipes from her book, but it does give me good ideas for influencing my home cooking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Japanse Cooking","review":"Its hard to follow up with this book, I don't know where to get ingredients, I prefer to buy a video next time, despite that there are many recopies in the book, but its not will organized too much text, I want something to go straight and show mew how, when I ma hungry I don't have time to read a novel"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful cookbook; cd we pls have a metric version?","review":"I agree with all the reviewers who gave this wonderful book five stars. I am already familiar with Japanese cooking techniques, but still found myself silently thanking Ms Harumi (and her editor?) for the wonderful job they did giving really clear and well thought-out instructions, which ought to help even a rookie to turn out the dishes in the way the author intended.In fact, the only reason why I am giving this 4 stars, instead of 5, is that I do think -- and cook -- in metric, and this cookbook (well, at least the copy I bought in Singapore), uses American/ Imperial measures such as cups and ounces. But these recipes are well worth the effort of converting the measures... so do swing over to buying this book if you think it sounds appealing! If you are used to eating Japanese food cooked by Japanese people, the conversions shouldn't be a problem at all as you will be able to \\"guesstimate\\" the right measurements with just a bit of practice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hmm, ney bad","review":"I\`d recommend this album, as Glay do indeed rock, but I think if you\`re interested you should try getting hold of \`Review-Best of Glay\` first.

I think this is just normal and our cats get distracted by the numerous other things in our home (crumbs on the floor, soft blankets, a visitor's shoes, etc). But we catch them alternately loving on and fighting with the catnip after we've given them their toy. Plus, our boy kitty knows where we keep the bag in the pantry, so whenever I open that door he races in and leaps onto the shelf to try and grab it. What an addict! I would recommend this to others. It's definitely nice to be able to portion out their catnip and know they enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The kitties love it!","review":"My cats have always been ambivalent about catnip. Sometimes they'll roll around in it a little, but they've never been crazy about it. I was given a packet of Yeoww! Catnip, and both cats nearly tackled me when I walked through the door.

But she definitely knew it was in there!Once I open the box, I was surprised at how much there is in 1 ounce of catnip. The bag was a lot bigger than I expected. And this stuff must be pretty fresh because it makes my cat absolutely loony.

It focuses faster and more reliably than either of the other P&S; cameras and the color reproduction is stellar. Controls are easy to use if a little tiny, but quite intuitive once you've spent some time with them. Bulkier than the NV3 because of the excellent opitcal package, which probably accounts for the high quality images.

I'd highly recommend this camera to anyone looking for a full-featured digital camera.

Both are excellent martial artists and both have trained with Buck Sam Kong who is a master in Hung Gar Kung Fu. Hung Gar, in my opinion, is perhaps the best overall art available."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Essence Of Traditional Shaolin","review":"This video captures the essence of traditional Shaolin Exercises, which were based on the movements of the animals. Originally, imitating animal movements were Taoist, but made their way into the Northern and Southern temples. The exercises are isotonic in nature and emphasize muscular tension and proper breathing to be effective. The DVD gives you a variety of exercises to build leg strength as well as arm and upper body strength. Beware of other DVD's or books by the so called modern Shaolin monks. Modern Shaolin is an invention of Communist China and although impressive to watch, the routines are aerobic and not based upon traditional Shaolin concepts that build the body by manipulating Chi energy."},{"rating":"1","title":"I returned it","review":"My old rolodex autodex finder I loved.

Shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice try, but no cookie","review":"I bought this as a replacement for a vintage rolodex. I was disppointed when I received this one because it was fairly small and did not have enough room to put a person's name, address, phone numbers, etc. The vintage one was much more useful, just falling apart.

I read in 1984 when it came out and I must have read it 10 times since then. I love the banter between Aimee & St. Briac and how she drives him to distraction with her crazy schemes. I like to think of this book as a historical romance with a comedy of errors on the side. St. Briac is one of my favorite romantic heroes. I even copied their wedding bands for my wedding. \\"Tu et nul autre, pour jamais\\". I just can't say enough good things about this book! Can't wait to re-read it again next year."},{"rating":"1","title":"You and No Other","review":"I've never written a review, but after trying to read this book based on it's high rating, felt like I should give a heads up to those who prefer a heroine with some depth. This one has absolutely no common sense, is quick to anger (when she is in the wrong) and seems basically idiotic. She and the hero exchange deep kisses just about each brief encounter including their first. By about the fifth meeting, she quickly and unromanticaly loses her virginity in the bushes of a garden in a chateau. My waning interest in the book was completely gone at this point and I will not finish the book.I read another book by the author which I would have rated a two star because I did manage to read it. Her historical backdrops are interesting and she writes well. However, her heroines tend to be knot heads!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down!","review":"This book was well written and researched. I love the main characters they were so lovable.

I really liked her writing style."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like to look at Morrissey---you'll love this book.","review":"I would give the book a higher rating, but some of the information is very U.K. oriented and so I felt lost when it talked about certain artistic influences Morrissey had. Great layout and idea behind the book---it looks at Morrissey's choices in art direction throughout his music career (how he picked LP photos, EP photos, merchandise photos, etc.). Nice irony in calling it \\"the art of Morrissey\\" because most people might take that to mean his music...not actually \\"art\\" Nice big color phots make it a cool \\"loohthrough\\" book"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good as long as you are not doing curves","review":"We bought this to re-pinstripe our boat, and found it was difficult to get this to \\"curve\\" along the line we wanted. This was because it is so thick (6\\") but while doing a straight line it was good. Just make sure that you have someone to help you with the application. I started the line in the back and smoothed out the air bubbles, while someone else held the roll at the same level where the stripe was going to be placed, and they also pulled back the white backing. It was helpful to have him a few feet down from where I was working to avoid having to re-lift the stripe and risk stretching and ruining it. (That did happen once, luckily we had enough tape ordered.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good gift for budding cross stitcher","review":"The designs in this very slim book are very basic and few; more suitable for a beginner,since they are not overwhelming in the least.

The handle is large and difficult for my hands to get good leverage for ricing.The main problem is the fit of the press into the sieve.

It works but not well."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY","review":"Well I didn't buy it from amazon, and actually I didn't even buy it, my mother did, and this thing still sucks. We got it to primarily use it to strain the water out from potato shreds for hash browns. The handle bent after the second try and on top of that leaves a big gap that makes it harder to remove the excess water/starch. I wasn't even applying much force when the handle completely bent/broke on me.For making mashed potatoes this ricer should work but I would go ahead and buy a higher quality item, one that will actually last.Overall, DON'T BUY!!! There are better ricers out there, go ahead and spend the extra few bucks, you will not regret it, but you will if you purchase this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Design","review":"I bought one at the local Shopko and am here looking for a better one.

I just had to have that song right away, no delay. Well, I picked up 'It's Time For A Change' by mistake and I can't wait until it's time to make the exchange. But, I'm glad it did get good reviews from others who bought it. Actually, this is the first time I'd heard Youthful Praise and I wish them all the best, but I can truthfully say that I've never had a CD that I liked less than this one. Not one cut inspired me to keep it, as it got toward the end the vocals became so grating and harsh that screaming along with them was all I wanted to do. I'm so thankful that the owner of the store is gracious enough to replace it with the other one, at least I know that I'll absolutely love 'Incredible God'."},{"rating":"2","title":"In a Different Place","review":"I enjoyed this album as well as I enjoyed the first project. In the song selection- in the lyrics- in the chords and harmonies, I know that they are in a different place spiritually than the previous album and, therefore, the songs will reflect that change, development, and MATURITY. By nature of this group being as one creative artist, their product will be unpredicatble. Art is unpredictable and cannot be precscribed. It flows...or it SHOULD flow as the creator gives them. We as patrons of the arts should not pigeon hole them- block them off and hold them in a corner with our groupy-like expectations. Pray for discernment that God will help us receive what they are ministering and encourage them to continue being obedient servants to their muse-God Almighty."},{"rating":"2","title":"-","review":"Although it's been recounted in books and films many times, I've never heard the story of the famous Mutiny on the Bounty. Don't know how this fares next to the classic films, but I loved this telling. Lush, fascinating, and moody, it features terrific performances by Anthony Hopkins as Lt. Bligh, and a young, fiery Mel Gibson as Fletcher Christian. Although only 2 hours, I could have easily watched another hour - most of all, I wanted to see what happened to the mutineers and Tahitians who settled on Pitcairn Island. Lucky for me, the history books are full of accounts. I've been a huge fan of Vangelis' score for years (the main theme/ending credits are gorgeous, ethereal and haunting), and the movie did not disappoint."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as the UK Special Edition","review":"Despite the excellent transfer on MGM's version, the UK release is miles better and includes 2 audio commentaries (from director and production team; and historical consultant Stephen Walters; PLUS a 50 minute \\"making of\\" documentary.) It's been released in England by a company called Sanctuary (???)and although amazon.co.uk says it's PAL it's actually NTSC multi-region. I ordered one from amazon in England and the disc plays perfectly on my U.S. Sony player. If you're a fan of this movie (as I am) then this is the version for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Bounty - OK, But!","review":"The movie had a lot of stars in it. Liam Neeson, who's acting ability really showed thru. Daniel Day-Lewis, who I thought was a little stiff in this roll. He didn't seem to fit in. Mel Gibson was really good in this movie. His character had to go thru alot of changes and he seemed to be able to do that smoothly. Anthony Hopkins was great as always. He acted out the nice guy part and the bad guy part seemlessly. I love the music in this film, especially the music over the ending credits. I was greatly dissapointed when I found out that the music faded out at the end of the credits. On the VHS version not only does it go thru the entire song, it also has an extension on the end of the song. I expected the DVD to have the same. However I recommend the movie to anyone who is a Anthony Hopkins fan, like me.(...)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite a great tale!","review":"The story is a grand one and it is well done in this movie. With a very talented cast it's hard to go wrong here. The cinematography is very awe-inspiring. I just loved this movie and another not-so-well-known \\"Rapa Nui\\". I think it should be rated PG-13, however, for it's topless nudity scenes, done National Geographic style...in other words, not in bad taste. It adds to the realism, if you ask me.I just can't understand why amazon.com will not make available the HiFi version of \\"The Bounty\\" on VHS and it just floors me that of all the \\"junk\\" out on DVD, that a title such as this with it's awesome cast isn't yet available on DVD! I will wait till the cows come home for the DVD version. Amazon, do you hear me?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm Still Owed A Refund","review":"I bought this video from Amazon but on receiving the film found the picture to be black & white. So I took advantage of Amazon's 'returns policy'. This was back in July 2003, but I still have not been refunded. Amazon did tell me I had been credited with the amount owed & could access this by buying another product (even although by British law they legally had to reimburse me in the way I originally payed for the product (by cheque)). When I tried to use said credit I found Amazon would not release it as they seemed to have no knowledge of the credit. What is happening Amazon?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mutiny on this Movie! - [ 1 star is too many]","review":"I was very disappointed after watching this sad, sad, sad interpretation of the glorious Mutiny on the Bounty and find it difficult to believe that so many people gave this movie 4 plus stars. Given the actors and the storyline, I had much higher expectations and was genuinely let down by this shallow rendition. After sitting through all the bad screenwriting, over dramatic acting by Anthony Hopkins, Mel Gibson and Liam Neeson, and all the long drawn out/miscued pauses, not to mention the psychopathic music accompanying each badly acted, over dramatic scene, I wanted to toss the DVD, DVD player, and television overboard - actually off my balcony."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very young Mel Gibson","review":"Daniel Day Lewis, Mel Gibson, Laurence Olivier....

(This film, set in the past as it was, featured no scenes of another of Melvin's specialities, operating motor vehicles. Some would insist it's just not a Melvin Gibson movie if we don't seem him driving a vehicle in a car chase.)A great alternative title for this film, given the magnificent scenes featuring the robust Tahiti female characters, would have been \\"The Bouncy.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Newer Bounty","review":"Part of dumbing down of film watchers -- the original had a deeper story line but the newer one was more what we've become accostomed to -- loved the photography.

That's my review.Thank you.Dave Segadelli"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a beautiful film","review":"Finally a film that does justice to this compelling story. One could not ask for more talent with a cast that includes Sir Laurence Olivier, Sir Anthony Hopkins, Mel Gibson, Liam Neeson, and Daniel Day-Lewis. The characters are fleshed out in a believable way. Gone are the prissy affectations of Brando's Fletcher Christian and the cartoonish buffoonery of Charles Laughton's Captain Bligh. Anthony Hopkins makes the character of Captain Bligh much more human. He is actually a regular person, if a little misguided, who watches his crew become intoxicated by the beauties of Tahiti. Vangelis' soundtrack is marvelous, he really creates his own atmosphere that totally complements the film. This is the definitive version of this saga, don't miss it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"not bad at all...","review":"This is actually surprisingly good. Not all of it is great but it is a pleasant change."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This CD is very disappointing. I liked Isobel's first solo albumn. It was fun. But she is not exactly known for her vocals, so I thought the addition of The Screaming Trees Mark Lanegan would make for a kicking mix. But he just sort of follows her lead and sings along with no energy. She is doing her usual whispering. The songs aren't very interesting. It gets old real fast. This albumn seems very self-indulgent and was a waste of my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"I agree","review":"This CD is a horrible waste of time. The Cd sounds like it is playing over and over again the same song. A \\"single\\" release would have been sufficient. Lanegan needs to take his rough voice and join a hard rock band, not QOTSA, but something a bit more solid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well","review":"This item works well for my purposes. It sits solidly, is well balanced, holds the card in place so that you can read it easily, and has a small foot print. The only downside so far is what others have mentioned, the cards are very thin, more like paper than cards. If you use this product for addresses etc., be aware that there are no lines on the cards, so if you have trouble writing in a straight line, then this is not for you, unless you purchase different cards separately."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's ok","review":"It's not the best quality, back in the days they were better quality.

I must say it surprised me, it's better that I had hoped. It's very bright, delivering clear and sharp pictures with great colors. I must say that compared to the Canon lenses of similar class, the Sony lens comes out victorious. I really think that the guys at Sony are doing a great job with their SLR camera.(P.s.

Sony is the worst of them. Sony is trying to get into the pro market but will need to do a much better job. This lens is way to soft in the corners, the focusing ring is not very comfortable to work with and and it is slow to AF on the A350 and 7xi bodies I tried it on. I know Sony can make some decent lenses but this is far from it. Sony users would be much better off with the Sigma 50/1.4 it is a excellent lens that far surpasses this or even try picking up the old Minolta one if you can find it.

The entire unit becomes very hot to the touch just making light toast and then requires a long period of time to cool down. The extremely long period of time required for the heating elements to heat up causes the bread to completely dry out and you wind up with a Melba toast effect. I did not test the unit any further than toast as the unit became so hot just making light toast I could not imagine how hot it could have gotten trying to bake or broil something. I am sure that this unit will be working 40 years from now like so many of the KitchenAid products do, but who needs it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst I've ever owned","review":"Ever feel like you've been totally ripped off?

Get a \\"stay on\\" feature if you plan on doing serious baking or roasting. 5.

Besides minor inconveniences like not heating up very quickly, it didn't last long - no light, no heat. After troubleshooting it, I found a faulty overtemp thermostat which is not available from Kitchen Aid or anyone else on the internet.

After burning a few things, I put my oven thermometer in there and found that it heats more than 100 degrees above the set temp. Makes me wonder what would happen if I broiled something. I don't think I'd be happy having to always adjust cooking temps that much, nor having to remind everyone else using the oven to do the same. So, back to the drawing board.

The author was very adamant with this view and stated variations thereof throughout the book. One cannot denounce the gamblers fallacy and still go on to say that past trends influence the future, as his sermon on \\"trends\\" says.Casinos need these books in the market.*Also, the probability of flipping 500 heads out of 500 trials is the same probability as flipping any specific sequence of heads and tails. Without attention to ordering of the heads and tails, then 500 heads would be improbable, but still not impossible. With a long string of black turning up on the roulette wheel, only the sucker and the degenerate believe that red is \\"overdue.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"The Better Masquerade!","review":"I was an original treasure hunter of the story of Masquerade. I started the game about a year after it was determined that there was an actual treasure hidden. I remember thinking that I had all the information that I needed to find the golden hare. I spent dozens of hours researching and trying to break codes. To tell you the truth, Masquerade was beautifully crafted but when it came down to it, it was both difficult and confusing. This new Buried Treasure Game is hands-down 100 times better. The cool thing is that you don't need to understand elusive cryptograms as in most of the treasure hunts. The questions and clues are very straight forward and the author is right on target when he states that anyone can solve this puzzle. If you like games, puzzles or mysteries, you need to get this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Family Game!","review":"As a dad of three sons, and as a practical, financially conservative adult, I took a chance on this book.

It's like a reality show where you are the main character and all you have to do is follow the rules. But, in this show, you can play in your pajamas, not embarrass your family, and still reach your goals. This is a neat book, it's easy to understand and simple to play. With almost 3 million books on Amazon, there is no other book that comes close to pure adventure. Just think of what you can do with $50,000! Stop playing the lottery. Stop going to the casinos. If you really want to make money and have a blast doing it, put in some research and have your family, your school, your work or your community get involved.

That was huge news and for the next few years you better believe that my friends and I looked everywhere for hidden treasures. Of course we did find our share of interesting things. I can still remember finding a gold coin in between the cracks of my front porch steps and I carried it with me for all these years until I recently gave to my grandson. I have also been very interested in the life and times of Captain Kidd. He led an amazing life and there is a lot of facts about his burying many treasures over many years. Although the author doesn't give much detail at this point in time, the entire Kidd adventure over many generations must have been very exciting. I am looking forward to playing and winning the treasure."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"Being a Lene Lovich fan, I was very disappointed in this release. I've listened to it several times, and it just doesn't come together for me. It starts with a decent drum beat, but at it's best (I could be you mix), it sounds more like someone turned the recorder on and everyone just goofed around in the studio. While there has always been a quirky quality to her work, there has also been a strong song structure and pop sensibility mixed with her eccentricity. I'm hoping we won't have to wait another 10 years + for a new release, but on the next one I'm hoping for something as strong as her last album, March. There just didn't seem to be enough Lene on this release."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terje can do more than atmospheric jazz!","review":"This isn't a \\"typical\\" Rypdal CD, so I can see how some of his fans could be disappointed as the reviewer below.

This is some of biggest bunch of nothing I've ever heard. Terje Rypdal may be a great composer, but he's in no way a good classical composer. This album is evident of that.

I find it hard to believe that such a piece of garbage could be thought of so highly. First off, you must hold the top down to get the item being laminated through the machine. This would be a minor inconvenience if this was the only problem. The really bad news is that the laminate bubbles horribly, and it is hazy rather than clear. How anyone would use this for photos is beyond me. Next, the magnetic backing doesn't stick at all to whatever your laminating. It just falls right off. There is absolutely nothing worthwhile about this piece of junk. I bought this based on the reviews of the others here. Shame on them for misleading people in this way. If you want to use this as an arts and crafts type of toy for pre-kindergarteners, maybe. For serious use, never.

Black Thought compliments the song with his usual tight verses.Every Part Of Me - Like whip silk, she glides over the notes and harmonies with ease. This track is already a favorite of mine and should get massive radio spins.All By Myself - This is a cover of an Eric Carmen song that I grew up listening to. One of my favorite Easy Listening songs of all times. La Toya's version is spectacular. Her voice is confident and controlled.

If you want ot instill your kids with the fact that poetry doesent have to be dry, incomprenensible blather, you could do much worse than handing them this book, sitting back, and watching their eyes light up with glee.Warning: This book is NOT for easily offended parents.

There are some new takes on classic stories that will draw any reader in!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Quick and Entertaining Read","review":"A very quick read. Roald Dahl gives us his own twisted and very entertaining view of several of the classic children's fairy tales, including Cinderella, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Jack and the Bean Stock, Goldilocks and the Three Bears, Little Red Riding Hood, and The Three Little Pigs. The rhymes, although they are a little violent at times, are indeed very funny. There isn't anything however that most children shouldn't be able to handle without getting scared. My six and eight year old daughters loved it. The illustrations by Quentin Blake were also wonderful as usual. The only downfall is that I wish it was longer."},{"rating":"2","title":"fantastic","review":"Roald dahl is a genius.

(for readers about 13+ y.o.)","review":"My dad used to read Roald Dahl books with me when I was a little tyke, and this particular little devil DEFINITELY lives up to its title, so if you're one of those parents who wraps their kid in cottonwool you'll want to pass it up. That being said, I am excessively fond of this book as it gives several traditional fairy tales a deliciously nasty twist that are unforgettable. Language use is about PG-13. If you and your kid are sensible/mature enough to have a sense of humor, you'll enjoy it immensely. My dad has since passed away but one of my many fond memories is that we both got a kick out of this clever little book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not For Children","review":"I bought this book because I love Roald Dahl and I thought it looked like such a fun little book. I would consider it good, creative writing if it were written for older teens or adults. But the fact that it is for 4-8 year olds, really??? I read another review that said children are more intelligent than we give them credit. This has nothing to do with the intelligence of the child. In my opinion, the violent nature of the stories and also the use of the word \\"slut\\" is inappropriate for children that young. I find it hard to give this book a rating. If it were for an older crowd I'd give it 4 stars. Since it is recommended to 4-8 year olds I'm going to have to give it 1 star because it is so inapproriate for such a young crowd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Dastardly","review":"Nursery Rhymes with a sadists twist?

After reading the positive reviews posted above I bought a copy of \\"Revolting Rhymes\\" for my 9 year old granddaughter. I could not be more disappointed! This book goes beyond gruesome, beyond revolting and in this reviewers eye is nothing more than an unscrupulous volume designed to debase the morals and integrity of our youth. (this from a liberal!) Fairy tales have been gruesome from their inception in the 19th century, Strewwelpeter by Heinrich Hoffmann being among my favorites. For those with a taste for the humorously frightful, check out Strewwelpeter. Responsible parents will pass on Revolting Rhymes."},{"rating":"1","title":"No redeeming features.","review":"I am normally a huge Roald Dahl fan, and made the mistake of popping this one on for my kids without listening to it first. It is crass and gory with no redeeming cleverness or insight. It uses the word \\"[...]\\" once and \\"hell\\" twice. Cinderella's prince lops off the heads of the ungly stepsisters and we get a nice description of them bouncing and rolling around on the floor. In Jack and the Beanstalk, Jack's mother is crunched up and eaten by the giant. The moral of Snow White is \\"gambling isn't a sin, providing that you always win\\". Red Riding Hood packs a pistol, shooting the Big Bad Wolf. She also shoots the wolf lurking around the third Little Pig's house, and goes on to kill the pig as well.

The story is thoughtful and the characters well developed. But what makes the book so magnetic is how well this is accomplished through its string of expertly crafted action sequences.

I've never forgotten the tale. It's a wonderful rendition of the classic Cinderella story, but, in my opinion, far superior. The girl is strong and takes matters into her own hands, versus waiting to be rescued by a prince. She doesn't need a disguise or ambiguity and there are no fairy-godmothers. I think this creates a powerful lesson in action and independence, versus the one of inaction and dependence that can be found in Cinderella."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Rough Face Girl","review":"This is a classic tale that is beautifully narrated. This story has awesome pictures in the book that capture the attention of young children."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fairy Tale Princess Stories Cripple Kids, Psychologically","review":"Had a chance to peruse this, but my comments are mainly general and apply to many other stories with similar qualities.While I think this story portrays many admirable qualities, particularly within its context, it is not one I would share with my young daughter at a young age.As much as I loved fairy tales as a kid, I won't be one to expose my daughter to them at a young age. The issue I have is with the idea of waiting for someone else to make everything better, that one should be long-suffering and meek, quietly persevering with unseen fortitude, in the meantime, etc., is an idea that creates unrealistic hopes that I feel often cripple people psychologically.This particular trap is more damaging to females than to males, in our almost uniformly misogynistic world, for the males are at least put in a position of action, but it harms the males too."},{"rating":"2","title":"My daughters love this book.","review":"I love the illustrations and the different cultural perspective. My daughters like the story and choose it more frequently than the \\"usual\\" version. I don't know if this is an \\"accurate cultural representation\\" or not, but I find that the things adults find important are transparent to most children. This allows me to expose them to the idea that different people see the world in different ways without being heavy handed. My review is based on how much the book is enjoyed by my girls and has no pretention to politics."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book on earth","review":"I thought the book was very interesting.

On the positive side, it offers seemingly reasonable investment strategies for inexperienced investors. At worst, the strategies are thought provoking. At best, they may be providing strategies that will make alot of people retire rich. On the negative side, I am skeptical of the author's intentions of writing this book. He sells mutual funds that implement the strategies (which is not necessarily a bad thing), but the funds have yearly fees of 1.5% each! That is very high for a passive fund. Why so high? All of a sudden, I want to stop reading. Finally, the book didn't teach me 250+ pages of info. It may be good for the new investor, but for one like me that has read a few books (but not done alot yet), it didn't offer alot of new insight.

For contrast, consider the gradual unveilling of the history of the world in \\"Ash: The Secret History\\". There is nothing of the sort going on in this book.Furthermore, if I hadn't already read some of Frances Yates' studies of the influence of magical philosophy on history and science, I'd have been completely lost. As it stands, I was only almost completely lost.

Seems like a good idea for a book; however, I'm not exactly sure what the author was trying to convey with this story or even what that idea may be. Apologies for lack of detail, but I just don't know how to describe this book except that it was bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad read...","review":"I remember trying to read this book in high school for a book report. I knew I liked fantasy games and that type of thing, but I hadn't ever tried to read a fantasy book before. This was my first and it almost ruined me for good on fantasy. \\"Rats and Gargoyles\\" was one of the few books I never finished. It is a confusing read and halfway through the book I still didn't understand it. Meanwhile, 2 days before the book report was due my friend lent me \\"Darkwalker on Moonshae\\" in the Forgotten Realms series by Douglas Niles to read in place of it. I finished that book in 2 days and enjoyed it immensely.Now, 6 years later I'm still reading fantasy. I say skip this book, and check out Forgotten Realms or books by R.A. Salvatore, George R.R. Martin, and the Lord of the Rings books. You'll be much more interested in fantasy and continue discovering new writers."},{"rating":"1","title":"A difficult, uninvolving book","review":"This book is, first and foremost, a difficult read. That's not necessarily a bad. It's sometimes nice to sit back with a book where language and imagery are just as important as plot. Michael Williams' _Arcady_ and most of Patricia McKillip's works spring to mind as similarly \\"difficult\\" reads (that I have enjoyed), for comparison.However, where those other works reward the reader's efforts with intriguing characters or classic story, Rats&Gargoyles failed to catch my interest at just about every turn. Too many characters, too much peripheral action, too little time spent on important elements left me feeling \\"at sea\\" throughout the book, wallowing through page after page of pretty language without any stable character or plot thread for me to latch onto as the \\"important\\" stuff. In the end, I finished the book more because I had paid for it and felt obligated to finish rather than out of any real enjoyment gained."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful to read and read again!","review":"This is a wonderful, comprehensive book about Jesus, the Christ, analyzing His impact on the church, the world in general, and some very famous people in specific."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not Preacher","review":"It is worse. It tries to be Preacher, it tries to be Hellblazer... it is naught. Constantine is one of the coolest and most awful characters ever created. When the torch passed to Delano from Moore, there was no loss. Delano's run was just great very intelligent, and the violence vas never to show off or to be a bad boy, it was used when necessary, as a part of the story. But here we have vomit, urination, gore etc. Things a b movie or gore movie fan might find exciting, but which an intelligent reader finds boring. Yes, not a scandal or rebeliuos, just plain boring.

This is the complete theatrical version as released at 238 minutes. There WERE various cut versions that the producers released without the director's approval, but this is not one of them. It's the version Visconti sanctioned to be released at the time. To speak of the only version worthy of release as being a 6 hour version is certainly a bit extreme.

After havng seen the original years ago and being led to beleive that this new realese was a restored version, I would not recommend the movie and advise Amazon to mention that it is a seriously cut version of the original Visconti masterpiece which I have awaited with great anticipation.

Stomach-turning posturing by Berger, superfluous celebration of full frontal nudity, pointless smiles by Schneider, unnecessary elaboration of fatuous court politics, embarrassing evidence that Wagner was a fraud."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally disappointing","review":"I used to be crazy about Visconti's turgid movie concoctions, which I must report sadly do not stand the test of time. Helmut Berger in overdrive as the mad king, and Helmut Griem as his loyal pretty face. Romy Schneider and Silvana Mangano as moving decorative objects (count the number of times Romy steps out of coaches). Tedious tirades from irrelevant characters. But worse, a very coyapproach to the whole subject of the king's attraction to males, which in Viscontis' view serves as compensation for his two great unrequited loves: his cousin the Empress and Wagner.

By now, a historical curiosity."},{"rating":"1","title":"English version of Ludwig","review":"I saw LUDWIG with English Dialog in the 1973 MGM domestic release.The NYC premiere was reported to be in English.

If you are a true fan of her work you would appreiate that she relaeses singles every now and then but dosen't wait for years before you hear something. I'd much rather get the music fresh. As a singer I know I my hold the minority vote. I've been a fan ever since I could walk. I think Barbara is worth it. I think Barbara Deservse it. Many of you are right Barbara does have two faces.

He makes one hell of an understatement when he says the challenges of socialist systems (including communism, one presumes) is how to keep the bureaucracy in check.

Anyway, look at this disc as a sampling of the band, and then get the album that would then be most to your liking. \\"I See Good Spirits and I See Bad Spirits\\" is the most evil, \\"Confessions Of A Knife\\" is the most industrial sounding, \\"Sexplosion\\" is the sexiest (duh), \\"13 Above The Night\\" is a good mix, and \\"Hit and Run Holiday\\" is just fun.

The corners of the stairs seem to be magnets for cat hair and sweeping is not particularly effective because the hair clings to the non-slip emery strips on each on the stairs (I know the stairs sound hideous, but they have a kind of retro-50's post-industrial look... really.) I was getting really tired of picking up each hair individually by hand when I saw this on Amazon - I decided to take the risk and I'm so glad I did... this thing rocks!Because the bristles are rubber, this broom seems to suck all of the static-electricity out of the hair and causes them to clump together into tight little ropes. It used to take me from 15-20 minutes to get the stairs really clean, now I can do it in five minutes flat! Who'd have thought that they could build a better broom?

There's a plastic cap at the end of the handle designed to allow for hanging the broom, but it's badly designed and won't stay on the broom.

But the product suffers from two serious problems:1. The head falls off when brushing with too much friction. Cleaning thicker carpet, for example, will cause the head to get pried off. This is because it is only secured by bendable rubber.2. When extended, the handle bends and eventually cracks, leaving metal splinters. The handle is only sturdy when unextended, which would be too short to use.In short, I am trying to return this defective product, but will keep a look out for a better made version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the Sweepa!!","review":"I'm a hair stylist and have 2 cats, so I'm constantly surrounded by hair.

I wanted something to pick the hair up, so I can pull it out and throw it away. I wanted it for quick use between vacuuming because my dog sheds constantly. All it does is move it around and does not even do that very well. To work with hair on a rug, I had to keep pulling the device over the same area several times to get a clump of hair piled up that I could then pick up.

That said, the nubby rubber bristles do feel good on a human being's back, if you can get someone to rub your back with it.

I am not impressed. The handle isn't a problem for me as it is for so many others, but it's the most inefficient cleaning tool I've ever encountered! I used it on one large living room and it took me an hour to get most of the fur out of the carpet. It literally would have been faster for me to just walk around and pick it out of the floor. The rake head is so small that you have to pull the fur off and throw it in the trash after every couple strokes. The one good thing? It's a work-out for the arms. Good thing it's cheap, because it's very close to worthless."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is great on hardwood or tile floors. No complaints.

I also tried this product on the bare floors. No luck. I had to go back over both the carpet and the floor with a vacuum/broom to get up all the hair and dirt. Very disappointing! And I'm out $20 (the cost of the product plus shipping). :\\\\"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Rubber Fur Rake","review":"You cannot beat this price. The Furemover Broom does what it is supposed to, removes fur from rugs with very little effort. It seems to work better on longer fur, but it still does the trick with short hair. I find it invaluable when I want to pick up hair prior to running the vacuum. It is amazing how much fur you can rake up with this broom with just a few strokes. The fur this broom loosens up can then be picked up by hand and you can proceed to vacuum - all-in-all, it saves wear and tear on the vacuum and you don't have to replace vacuum bags as often. This, to me, is an invaluable tool and I recommend it to anyone who has a furry family member."},{"rating":"1","title":"1/2 a star is too much-useless","review":"If you have a vacum cleaner this is a waste. If you have a swifer this is a waste. As a matter of fact, a broom works better. This did not pick up any fur, and on the first attempt to extend the handle I discovered it was terribly hard to loosen and then never locked again. You can have the original less than a broom length or two seperate pieces. Had I not used an amazon gift card and free shipping I would have bothered to send it back, but it wasn't even worth the shipping.Please don't missunderstand that I do like this line of products. I may have gotten a dud. The other FURemover products require quite a bit of elbow grease but turned a cat bed that had never been cleaned in over a year to brand new shape. The gloves are also excellent. This particular product just does not serve a purpose. Because I am tall I plan on using it as an extra 18 inches to knock down spider webs and such on our deck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"My first complaint is that the telescoping handle doesn't lock when extended. It stays put by pressure against the floor. That works until you lift it up and the bottom half slides out onto the floor. Maybe mine is broken? Not sure. Secondly, I haven't had great success with it picking up dog hair. Maybe my floors are cleaner than I think. Lastly, I read somewhere that it can be used as a pile rake for carpet. I found this to be far from the truth. It just bounces along the top of the carpet doing nothing to the pile."},{"rating":"2","title":"finally - a clean carpet","review":"I bought this product after getting our second dog.

I can make it short to clean stairs and long to clean the floor. Does great on the wood floor.I have a dog that sheds and shreds; fur and paper shreds are everywhere! This broom sweeps the dog fur out of the carpet and collects small debris between the bristles -- it's as good as a vacuum! I think if it had longer bristles, it would pick up larger pieces of debris, like paper shreds.I also got the small hand-brush version; does fantastic on the carpeted stairs and baseboards.Be warned though, that although this brush/broom is easier on the allergies than a vacuum, you may need an open trash receptacle nearby to frequently empty the bristles because they pick up so much!"},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE the broom","review":"LOVE this broom,,,, It will last forever,,, you can use it outside wash it up and use it inside.

I think it is a moving personal narrative of the growth of a man but it also sheds light on the problems and horrors of the late Qing dynasty which facilitated the rise in Communism in China. One of the things I found fascinating was he personal acknowledgement of his faults and a deep introspective. I was left to wonder about what might have been if this man had been caught by the Russians or the Europeans. His Chinese war criminal trial was a joke by the standard of those for the Nazis.

This base plate makes it easy to build buildings and tall structures. IT gives the structures a great base that is very sturdy.Unless you want to buy a special table, these base plates are very good. I bought a few and we can build up and out more than ever.I look for toys that are sturdy and fun and easy to use. I look for toys that have more than a button to push.

This mat did the trick! Now we spend a lot of time making \\"towers\\" together. When I ask him if he wants to build something, he immediately runs to get his bag of blocks and this mat. I highly recommend it. And, even though it's made by Lego, it does fit the Mega Blocks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seems expensive, but ultimately worth it.","review":"When I realized that I had spent $15 on a plastic plate...I was a little put-off.

However it is difficult to use on carpet as the plate is somewhat thin and floppy. The little one gets frustrated trying to press pieces down on the plate as it flexes on the carpet, and I'm sorry but my 41 year old rear (and even his diapered toddler rear) doesn't feel like sitting on the hardwood floor nearby. This would work much better on an activity table, which alas we do not have. The price for this thing is also beyond outrageous. However you've got to have it to build sets on, so we what can you do but pay what they ask for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wish I would have gotten this sooner...","review":"We have owned Duplos for over a year now, and just bought the building plate.

Big mistake, the sound of this cd is the worst sounding I have ever heard. It sounds like a home made tape at times. First disc is a curious blend of very mid sixties style rock and roll kind of like beatles or beach boys music not blues. Most of it is forgettable. The second cd is live and mostly blues. The sound is awful but it contains the sets only redeeming value. Some of Johnnys true briliance shines through, it sounds mesmorizing at times.

As the story progressed and was on it's 10 or so last episodes I found myself getting farther and farther on the edge of my seat, wanting to watch episode after episode. The ending was amazing and I was very happy with the way it turned out, it didn't let me down one bit.To sum it up in my opinion it took alittle while to get going, but when it did, it didn't disapoint at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Anime!","review":"I originally watched this on Netflix on my Xbox 360 and I didn't want it to end.

Cute aliens, but pointy eared aliens nonetheless.What made this show interesting to me is we start to see reality rear it's ugly head & throw a wrench in the perfect harem situation for our male protaganist. Would a bunch of girls who were all in love with the same guy all get along & remain friends like we see in many harem comedies? Of course not. Is every cute girl just as perfect on the inside without any baggage or issues? Of course not. Does a guy eventually have to choose one girl over the others, otherwise face losing everyone? Yes he must. Will that choice be devastating to others, and be a painful situation? Yes it will.Ah, reality. Screwing up a superficial harem comedy and elevating it into something more dramatic. I like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"How disappointing!","review":"I can't believe how poorly written these three stories were. The first, Night Ecstasy had no character depth at all.

And then the girl falls in love with this perv? I liked how he never lied to her and told her he was a vampire.Midnight Court:The twist at the end was really good but the whole story was a little too vague for me.This book can be a good beginning for someone just starting to read Vampire novels.

These stories all lacked spark, sizzle and depth. Rosemary Laurey's story was especially awful - I think I counted over 100 exclamation points before it was over (my brain was so tired! from all! the excitement!).If it wasn't for the subject matter and the occasional \\"dirty\\" word, I would have thought this a collection for children - simplistic and overly melodramatic.

This one in no way compared to the others. Night Extasy and Velvet Night were good but not great, and I love paranormal romances. I have read better and frankly expected much more from a \\"Bad Boys\\" collection. The last story was awful. I completely agree with Traci King. The story was hard to read, I often found myself going \\"What?\\". And to top all of that off, there was no romance! I would suggest readers skip this book or at least the last story, save their $14.00 and go with a Christine Feehan, Angela Knight, Sherrilyn Kenyon, Christine Warren or Karen Marie Moning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better books available","review":"I was quite disappointed when I got the book and read it. The book focuses mainly on growing grapes in England, and some of the information in the book is not all that accurate. For example, when the author talks about pruning, he only mentions spur pruning. There are grape varieties out there whose basal buds are not fruitful where cane pruning is required.The only satisfaction that I got from the book was that someone was successfully growing grapes and making wine in less space and in a less favorable climate than I am."},{"rating":"1","title":"Product Sucks","review":"I purchased this item from Wizard of Math and it sucks so hard! First off they \\"jipped\\" me on the shipping and the cost of the product. I paid 8.29 plus 6.25 for shipping. The pieces are super tiny and they gouged me on the shipping. The package is like super light so I know that it didn't cost 6.25 to ship. I would send the product back for a full refund, but they will take 15% from the amount I paid and then I won't get my shipping back.

Volumn varies to it's very hard to hear the music, most times not at all, like you are supposed to on a CD. It should not be recommended to buy with the \\"Twilight\\" soundtrack.

I fell in love with the story and the drawings the very first time I read it and I've bought several copies for all the little girls I know. Arianna's thoughtful delight in being a little girl and exploring grown up places makes her worthy of occupying the same shelves as Madeline and Eloise.If you're looking for a children's book that hasn't been overmarketed yet and will warm the hearts of people of any age, I highly recommend ARIANNA AND THE STRAWBERRY TEA."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tons of useful information in this book","review":"As an old DOS programmer who is finally getting into Windows programming, I found John Mueller's book to be indispensible. Although the book covers a wide range of topics, it is easy to hone in on a specific topic that you are having trouble grasping.The explanations of background concepts are just enough to bring you up to speed and make the source code examples clear enough to follow easily. The chapter on Active Directory services is worth the price of the book all by itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Generally not worth reading.","review":"This book tries to cover a great deal but falls very short in all areas. It's almost an \\"unleashed\\" title, if you know what I mean. For example, there's a weak section on IE5 and HTML, a weak section on ASP, and a weak section on MTS, none of which give you more than the most basic background on any subject. Admitedly, I got some good information on COM+ out of the book, but otherwise it was a worthless purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is unfortunately out of date with incorrect facts.","review":"John Coborn has written some very good books but this one gets the two stars from the brilliant photos.

Too many characters, too much plot, too little action. I didn't care if he found the girl or not,if he found his fathers killers or not. I just finished the thing and I still don't understand why these people did half the things they did. If the ending was suppossed to make me gasp, it made me yawn instead.

Sure.Then she gets kidnapped by the bad guys and lives. Sure again.Oh yeah. The part about the showdown in the outdoor cantina. I just didn't believe it. There isn't a barrio in the country where this would have happened without about a legion of cops there on-the-double. Believe me. I have been there.A real waste of time.

In the process we get a great tour of San Antonio, lots of action and a pretty good story that keeps you guessing to the end. As a master of tai chi, fluent in spanish and with a PHD in English lit, Tres is a great new character. Riordan's writing, especially the dialogue, is crisp and clean.

The production gets about a 3 and a half to 4 simply because most christian rap has poor production and beats(KJ-52). As for John's rapping? Honestly is wasn't even mediocre. The way things are with hip-hop these days, the focus is on the lyrics. Everything is like a freestyle battle, and though he's not going to be abel to sit there and diss everybody, he has to be able to put words together cleverly. This isn't the eighties where pretty much anything that rhymned and had a decent hook got in. To call him the christian eminem would be so gross an understatement it would be criminal. Go out and by a Jay-z album if you want quality hip-hop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Negative captain, no sounds of intelligent life...","review":"The only somewhat interesting tracks on this album are the first and last, which are only there to set the mood. The awful music they're setting the mood for is the problem. Ever since Crime for All Seasons, TKK has been making AWFUL remixes.

This release begins mellow (first three tracks) but then progressively, hypnotically grows harder and edgier. This is the result of one genius producer/musician Buzz McCoy - instead of Pillz's hodgepodge mix of remixers. Buzz really struts his stuff on this release and shows his mastery of industrial glam rock. Any TKK fan needs to have this in his collection. Any fan of industrial glam needs to, too. This is the first TKK CD since 13 Above the Night that I've been excited about - and its Ipod playlist has been stuck on \\"repeat\\" for a week now. I don't understand the negative reveiws because a true fan of this genre would kill for this long overdue comeback. It's brilliant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ignorance is not bliss","review":"There are two parts of this book. In the first part, our heroine, Olivia, is so ignorant that she makes herself miserable. In the second part, she's so dumb and angry that she makes herself miserable. I spent the better part of the book wanting to do something that would make her wake up - figuratively. It doesn't help that I found Spencer to be a self-centered unsympathetic character. Somehow, his noble misery just annoyed me.I'm bummed I didn't like this book. The Door County setting held a great deal of promise.In fairness, someone out there liked this book. It won a Reviewer's Choice award from Romantic Times.

But even Spencer can learn before all is really too late and Olivia, with the generous and ever loving heart she has, will receive the love she's waited for and deserves!

The book has very funny, laugh out loud moments as well as times where your heart goes out to the characters. Others reviews said that the h was nave and the H was selfish, both comments completely true. However, what I felt was endearing about the story was that we see the characters grow and loose these faults and become characters that the readers can cheer for. In the end, the h stands up for herself and the H actions are become altruistic. The reader suffers through the heartache of the characters but also enjoys the HEA.

I find having the etymology of a word in any language very useful in understanding its meaning. This dictionary provides this. It does not provide any sense of the history of the word and the changes in useage through time, which is a pity, but understandable in a book of this length. Compared to the Concise Oxford Dictionary in English, for example it is very thin in its exploration of the meanings of the word, but often much deeper on the etymology."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Nat Geo Film","review":"This National Geographic film is wonderful! I teach high school science and the kids love this video! Integrating Nat Geo films in our curriculum has been great for the students. They appeal to audio and visual learners!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite","review":"Out of all the National Geographic documentaries I have seen in my life, Eternal Enemies: Lions and Hyenas is my favorite of all time. The reasons are because it introduced me to Dereck and Beverly Joubert's documentary films, this film is the archetypal National Geographic documentary, and the my favorite animal of all is the lion. My favorite part was at the end when we see Ntchwaidumela, \\"He Who Greets with Fire,\\" kill a hyena matriarch that was harassing his brother over the territory. I was blown away by the slow-motion scene of him running and chasing the hyena and hearing Powers Boothe say \\"He is the hyena killer.\\" I highly recommend this film for anyone who loves National Geographic, lions, and the Jouberts' films."},{"rating":"2","title":"Savage Beauty","review":"I remember seeing this show for the first time when I was maybe 14 or 15. I remember being quite disturbed by the deaths of Masumi's cubs and of the Southern Clan's first matriarch. I felt quite sorry for the Princess, who lost everything in that one second that it took Entwaidumeyla (sp?) to bite through her spine. I don't take one group's side over the other. After all, they are animals, fighting for survival, and our morality is misplaced upon them.As with everyone else, I was riveted by the scene where Masumi and Entwaidumeyla chased down the Southern Clan's second matriarch and did her in as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best nature video I ever saw","review":"I got this on VHS tape many years ago and was so disappointed when the wear and tear over the years had made the tape unplayable.The DVD is just as good as i remembered it and the quality of the transfer onto DVD was quite good considering how many years ago this footage was shot.To this day its still probably the best, most graphic nature video out there when it comes to predators battling other predators.I got Predators at war with this one and this one is better.Predators at War is decent to but it doesn't capture as many actual encouters,alot of it is after the fact showing a dead animal and telling you later what happened to it.Lions and Hyenas actually shows alot of battles as they are taking place.I would highly recommend this video to nature buffs who can handle graphic and violent content of hyenas and lions doing battle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dramatic","review":"What an amazing amount of drama and action for a documentary!This movie is so brilliantly done, it transcends the genre of documentary in my view.Watching the lioness with her cubs, you would think the lioness would be safe, yet danger comes from unsuspecting sources. The narration is brilliant throughout, with the narrators torn by what happens with these animals they observe for some time."},{"rating":"2","title":"classic Joubert","review":"The title sums it all up. The Joubert's(pronounced jou-ber) are great makers of wild life drama(and i mean DRAMA). The tale(i call it tale-mentary) is gripping and concentrates on a clan of Hyenas and a pride of Lions. The photography is excellent and \\"Savuti's\\" most feared denizens come to light in this documentary. The Hyena's uniqueness is potrayed well and so is their societal order. There are some moments frozen indelible on a viewers mind. -the king of the beasts clamping on the hyena matriarch. -a mother's(lioness) disastrous encounter with an Egyptian cobra.After having watched this you come away knowing that all animals are the same yet unique and individual.This is a great video , one not to be missed.I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazingly Awesome!","review":"Lions and Hyenas is one of the best movies I have ever seen. Its drama and excitement make for a movie that is exciting from start to finish. Powers Boothe's narration adds to the intrigue of Motsumi, Mondavu, and Antwondamala the lion stars of the film. Amazing footage of three lion cubs being born and the love of a young mother. You'll watch the hyena's torment the lions all day and night. The matriarch and the downfall of her princess. This movie is the best!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My Little Pony and Friends","review":"I love this book, not only cause i love My Little POny, but the pictures are great and I grew up loving them.

Such beautifully elegant, yet dramatic music! Brahem's playing in particular is sensational (for those who have not heard the oud played, this is a stringed instrument with a sound something like a dulled lute). The music itself is rather serious, even sombre-sounding at times, but out of this rather dark North African ambience regularly emerge flashes of focussed energy that will, as they say, knock your socks off. A strangely ignored album that deserves much more attention than it has received."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stretched thin","review":"2 1/2Garbarek's mid-east foray accounts for some interesting background, but feels over-indulgent and underwhelming when agreeable airiness gives way to repetitious bi-cultural bloat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oddly balanced, like that fork and cork on a glass trick","review":"I needed a book to read on a long train ride, and -Kate Vaiden- was given to me. I had no idea who Reynolds Price was, or what kind of book I would be reading. Willing to try something new, I dove into Kate's Depression-Era world and found myself alternately enthralled and confused. Price has a gift for writing a woman's voice, but not a woman's character. Granted, this is the '90s, and women are not only more outspoken and emotional, but people in general are more passionate. I found Kate very hard to believe in her disregard for other people and her deadpan stoicism through her life's many tragedies. Still, this was a book I found hard to put down. Price's language is descriptive, and I love his use of colloquialisms and imagery. If Kate herself had a little more feeling, I would have found the story more believable, but all in all, -Kate Vaiden- was an enjoyable book, and I intend to read more of Reynolds Price."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read, a great writer...","review":"This was my introduction to Reynolds Price, and I am most glad to make the acquaintance. Kate Vaiden is on the receiving end of uncommonly tragic circumstances in early life, and her reactions and choices springing from these events are one part exhasperating, one part predictable, often dreamlike - we can't be meant to like her. Watching Kate's inner character warp over time as a result of these events is a box seat to a slow train wreck, but the machinations of plot are mainly just an excuse to read Price's wonderful prose. Is the female voice of the main character believable? Is Kate knowing, or a victim of her Southern life and times? There is much to ponder, but the ending, replete with hopeful likelihoods, makes you wish Price had simply continued unfurling the story so as to enjoy more of his dense, beautiful writing about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh Kate","review":"Kate Vaiden is a girl you want to just shake. Sure she's had it rough- orphaned at age 11 in rural North Carolina in the 1940's after her parents murder suicide. Raised by an aging aunt and uncle who are not exactly Ozzie and Harriet, she makes one disastrous decision after another. So why read it? The beautiful writing of Reynolds Price, that's why. His southern style colloquialisms, dialog and descriptions make this frustrating, depressing train wreck of a life-story a beautiful thing. Some of the things Kate does make no sense, she doesn't stay with who you want her to or do the things you want her to but I could not stop turning the pages to see what would happen next. This is a Southern Literary gem. I would suggest The Good Priest's Son also by Reynolds Price which is one of my favorites."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kate Vaiden: Drag Queen","review":"While I would never assume that a man couldn't write in a woman's voice, Kate Vaiden sorely tempts my judgment. Reynolds Price tries to capture the female voice and consciousness of his narrator Kate and fails wildly. Kate is so laughably unconvincing that I thought perhaps I had misread it. However, when I showed the book to several other women, they all agreed. Kate is so clearly what a man envisions a woman to be (and so clearly NOT a woman), that I'm tempted to call the book a post-modern attempt at drag, and badly done at that. While there is some nicely honed prose, the story itself relies too much on contrived plot twists and thoroughly sentimental epiphanies. The dull story aside, the real interest lies in Kate's voice. Like a poorly rehearsed ventriloquist act, Kate Vaiden betrays its author's voice and bizarre conceptions of feminity again and again, transforming the novel from unintentional parody into high comedy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh.","review":"If you like reading about women who continually make decisions to royally mess up their lives, and about people who like to ruin others', this is for you. I'm sick of this genre of writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Off The Shelf: Cooking From the Pantry","review":"Most of the recipes don't have more than 5-7 ingredients, mostly items from the pantry but there are always 2-3 fresh items that really make the difference. There are pictures for every single recipe, very useful for when you want to know what the dish should really look like. The gorgeous pictures alone are worth the price of the cookbook, wonderful to browse when you are trying to figure out what to cook. The only negative is that the recipes are not inherently low fat, but it's easy to substitute high fat cheeses etc with the low fat version. The interesting food combinations and easy easy preparations make this an awesome everyday cookbook."},{"rating":"2","title":"A GOOD, BASIC BOOK FOR THE NOVICE","review":"If you are a basic sort of person who enjoys plain, down-to-Earth meals, and do not like to spend a lot of time in the kitchen, this book is for you. Not only does it suggest what basics to stock on your shelves, but the recipes turn out very well if fresh ingredients are used. One will not be caught off guard when unexpected guests arrive, if you follow the suggestions offered by Hay. I did, however, find the recipes were not quite as original as anticipated. Many are variations of recipes found in other similar cookbooks, particularly the Asian noodles; however, the recipes are still tasty and the book will be particularly valuable to those inexperienced in the kitchen."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good reason that these weren't released","review":"I am one of the biggest \\"Dan\\" fans on the planet from way way back.

Retelling physical, emotional, and spiritual stresses and trials with a twist of humor and the candor that comes from enduring sustained tribulation, Thank You: Your Opinion Means Nothing To Me is a sober and insightful reflection upon what it truly means to grow old, accept oneself, and find one's voice. From adjusting to her elderly mother moving back in, to the miffed realization that her sex drive is in neutral, to exploring revelations of mortality in flesh and spirit step by step, Thank You: Your Opinion Means Nothing To Me involves the reader by virtue of its very nonchalance in addressing everyday concerns as well as larger than life issues."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a load of garbage.","review":"I bought this as it was a recommended companion to Tim Hawkinson's book...

It is not a typical taste. It is dark and, literally the feeling tones of a dark wood instrument come to life. It is the feeling of moving through a beautiful night in a dark forest.

If you are looking for American made products and are looking to purchase this wok based on this, then look elsewhere. I'm not sure if the sellers are intentionally falsely advertising their products but when I pay for something that says USA made, I intend to get something as such.

It arrived in just a couple of days and I am very pleased with this new roaster pan. It is just like my old one, except this one has extra grooves to either side, along with the ones always in the center, for the drippings. I had read the review saying it had sharp edges, but I looked mine over well(I used to run a restaurant) and I have NO problem with this pan at all and am looking forward to being able to make use of it for many years to come.

The ridiculous election of 2000 filled many of we foreigners with confusion of how the self-appointed 'World's Greatest Democracy' could have such a baffling 'system' of electing the president and vice-president, and this book helped me so much understanding the complexities of what was going on. I commend the authors heartily for conceiving of such a book and filling it with so much information...the Supreme Court cases are marvels of conciseness.

This movie is one of the gems of silent cinema, and for American audiences it's still mainly an unseen gem. I hope this Criterion release will change that. The print quality is superb; even with higher-contrast orthochromatic film there is good tonal range in this restoration. This is a boon because the lighting is often subtle. I'm not familiar with the source material, but the way Sjostrom directs his actors makes me wish he'd done a silent adaptation of Crime and Punishment; The Silent Carriage is a Dostoevskyan drama that turns the protagonist's soul inside out. It's a masterpiece of direction and restrained acting, and makes me appreciate again the sophistication Scandinavian film-makers brought to the early development of the motion picture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth a look...","review":"I would only recommend this film for lovers of silent cinema, quite groundbreaking in it's day the film still holds up especially with the addition of the experimental soundtrack which I found to suit the film a bit more than it's original orchestrated score.I really enjoyed it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"1080i instead of 1080p","review":"this film on blu ray was mastered in 1080i resolution instead of 1080p resolution INTENTIONALLY. it was done to compensate for the framerate of this film and had it been mastered in 1080p it wouldn't have been compatible with north american television's frame-rate capabilities! amazon, PLEASE BRING THIS ITEM BACK! the one star review is just to get this review noticed so more people speak up, and it in no way reflects my opinion of the title itself***EDIT 10/21/11***hey! someone listened! amazon brought the item back!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good light but large and HEAVY!","review":"Sadly, I'm sending mine back.I was very hopeful.

However, take heed of the directions very carefully! This thermos is only good for water, or at the most fluids that can be READILY RINSED out. So, that pretty much excludes most of the things you might wish to put in there, such as coffee, tea, milk, sugary drinks. The reason? The pouring mechanism, while space-age and cool, cannot be dissembled for cleaning, nor can the inside of the thermos be easily accessed. Brushes and other cleaning devices just don't cut it, so the inside ends up getting very stained. Eventually the seal on the pouring mechanism fails after a few months of drinking your favorite drink percolated through whatever old dried up drink/food that has gotten trapped in the pouring mechanism. Mine lasted about three months and is now pretty much useless. So, do yourself a favor, forgo style over function, and find a thermos with the tried and tested simple screw cap design."},{"rating":"1","title":"Teflon lining unecessary and possibly toxic","review":"Although this manufacturer has a reputation for vacuum bottles' retaining their temperatures for a long time, I returned this bottle when I realized the interior was completely lined with Teflon! Why?? Teflon is not a clean substance, and is a carcinogen at high temperatures. For sustained very hot temperatures, as in storing hot coffee, there is no advantage for the consumer. As far as cleaning, Teflon would stain more than a stainless steel interior, and would probably affect the taste of the coffee.

Other than a burned tongue, I'm very happy with the performance of this thermos.

The person who responded told me to keep the thermos in upright position. ?-it's a thermos for travel. It offers me the directions to 'correctly' clean the button because that is the reason it leaks;I didn't take the assembly apart prior to using so it came defective and will be thrown away defective.

You either beat it all in one go or you start all over. So I stuck around the house for half a day and you know what happened?

Pass by flowers and they bloom, jump on baskets to collect extra points, again, all this for no reason. Points don't matter, they're not saved, it doesn't add up to anything.

Composer Jon Balke mans the keyboards, and the instruments used by the Magnetic North Orchestra include trumpets, saxophones, violin, viola, cello, bass, percussion, and drums.

It was cooking on low, and it was literally done in a half hour's time. So, keep in mind, if you are camping and you haven't tried using this product yet, it won't take long before your meal is done.Sadly, my crock pot recipes were put away for the rest of that trip- the campground we were at didn't have electricity, hence why I wanted a propane crock pot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Camping Tool - But Hotter Than a Traditional Slow Cooker","review":"This is an excellent idea and greatly expands menu options while camping.

Yes there is fan noise but what do you expect it is a RAID. You are writing and reading data at a very fast rate would you rather fry the drives? The drive does not need to sit right next to you. Set it farther back if it bothers you. If you want to hear what real fan noise is sit in a server room for a few hours configuring multiple drive RAIDS and have a few dozen servers around you. That is what I call fan noise. This thing is nothing. It provides redundancy (Raid 1) at a very good cost point. Personally I would only recommend RAID 1. If you run at Raid 0 and loose one drive you loose all your data. This is not Raid 5 which will allow you to loose one drive and keep on going.

The wolves had almost no identity, and I learned almost nothing about ranching from the story.Too bad, because the story idea is a good one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lazy plot and sterotypes make for unfun reading","review":"If you can handle the slow plot and the amount of character-backfilling that slows it even more, and the lame evocations of TV soap characters (Buck=J.R.) you are rewarded with a ridiculous ending. I couldn't stand reading past page 140 so I peeked at the end. There is some passable passages about the wolves and nature but not enough to compensate. How does an author like this get published anyway?"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Loop would make a so-so TV movie of the week.","review":"It's too bad that Nicolas Evans can't carry off an entire novel. The first couple of chapters always get your interest and you want to keep reading, but fairly soon the characters seem dull and the story doesn't develop. After the first few chapters I was able to scan through the rest of the book just so I could get it over with, and return it to the person that loaned it to me. We wern't able to have a discussion about the book because there was nothing to discuss. A waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"The vivid, detailed descriptions draw the reader right into the story. Evans' quirky but believable characters are compelling and fascinating. I had trouble putting this book down."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is another Romance by Nicholas Evans.","review":"This book was, like The Horse Whisperer, a great disappointment. It is basically a Romance, with stereotyped, two dimensional characters. As in the Horse Whisperer, the parts about animals are true only in general, and that information is neither new nor original. I don't know a single horse person who liked the Horse Whisperer, and I suspect few wolf afficionados will like The Loop. It's insultingly shallow about both environmentalists and ranchers, not to mention wolves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gave me a good perspective of wolve reentry program.","review":"Got my interest right away. I enjoy books on animals and the outdoors. The characters were interesting and believable. Had a hard time putting the book down.

If you like a book about wolves and romance, this is one of them I would recommend you to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The next Jack London?","review":"After finishing THE LOOP this past weekend, I am at a loss of words to describe how wonderful this novel is. Nicholas Evans' storytelling has truly blossomed since THE HORSE WHISPERER and I can't wait for his next story.THE LOOP, the story of a band of wolves that attack the livestock of the fictional town of Hope, Montana, is filled with pure emotion, rich characters and beautiful descriptions. Not many authors can pull all three of these things together with as much ease as Evans has. Even the shocking (if somewhat unbelievable) love-interest between 29-year old Helen and 18-year old Luke is carried out with such craft that you often wonder why such a relationship is frowned upon by society. The only problem I found was with the author's antagonist, Buck, who is stylized after any number of Larry McMurtry characters, which isn't all that bad in my eyes."},{"rating":"2","title":"WILL HAVE YOU ROOTING FOR THE WOLVES ALL THE WAY","review":"I was one of those readers who thoroughly enjoyed The Horse Whisperer so I anxiously awaited Evan's next book. I was not disappointed. It's nice for a change to be reading about nature and its elements and different parts of the animal kingdom.....in this book the dreaded wolf. I found out that the wolf is now an endangered species and it is against the law to kill. The setting for this book takes place in a town called \\"Hope\\"; unfortunately there's no hope for the wolves until Helen Ross arrives to try to fix the wolf situation as it pertains to the cattle being killed. It's more than midway through the book before you learn what a loop is. This is when you will cheer for the wolves to get away. Some readers might even enjoy this one more than Horse Whisperer. In my estimation, they are both great reads."},{"rating":"1","title":"Softies Only!","review":"I originally had good expectations for this book, it being critically acclaimed and all. But when I picked it up and began to read, it struck me that although the first few chapters were good, it rapidly became a tired good-guy, bad-guy issue. And, surprisingly, I actually found myself rooting for the bad guys! The two protagonists, Helen and Luke, were a couple of lovey-dovey softies, while the antagonists, Buck Calder and Joshua Lovelace, were intelligent and had real inner strength. I was disappionted at the ending, not only because the \\"good guys\\" won, but also because the \\"bad guys\\" were turned into softies like them too! Not a very enjoyable read.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loved the first chapter, then I was bored","review":"the book fit most of small town Montana, applies exactly where I live"},{"rating":"1","title":"Spare Me","review":"If you want to read about wolves and the wolf recovery effort, read Barry Lopez or one of the other experts Evans credits. If you want to read about real evil and human/wildlife conflict with all of the complexities, heartbreak, and enigma this presents, read Cormac McCarthy. If you want to read something by a good writer who just wants to sell books, read this. Soap Opera. Very disappointing. Couldn't even finish it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book...","review":"I enjoyed this book and may read other novels by Nicholas Evans in the future. It can be a little disturbing in places, especially if your an animal lover, but the characters and plot are well developed. Towards the end I didn't want to put it down. It's nothing like the \\"Horse Whisperer\\", which I didn't particularly care for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good environmentalism - indifferent writing","review":"I liked the movie \\"The Horse Whisperer\\" and this was my first Nicholas Evans book. The writing is terribly patchy. Evans is at his best when writing about wolves, when he is able to engage the reader with some semblance of expression - but just about. The rest of the time, his writing is turgid at worst and passable at best. The love story, its development is really infantile. In his defence, he writes better than Nicholas Sparks though that is not saying much. I anticipate that the movie version (if it gets made) will be watchable as it will allow the wide sweep of Montana and the main protoganists (the wolves) to appear to better effect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing people","review":"I read \\"The Loop\\" after the well-minded suggestion of a friend. It seemed to me that everybody in The Loop scenery is divorced or absolutely worried about their own egos. From the spiritual point of view, I found it depressing: no normal people and no valuable spiritual growing up to the end.\\"The selfish gene theory\\" in the first chapters and the insistent description of Mr. Buck Calder as a sexual glutton were EVERYTHING I needed to have a nice reading ;-(Unfortunately we can not put a \\"zero\\" star in the score. If you really like people and wolves, I believe you'll not like this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable","review":"I was very disappointed with this book for many reasons. It was as predictable as a Jesse Jackson speech and about as entertaining. The characters were shallow and so predictable I kept reading in the hope that it would get better- it didn't. The view is typically New Yorker---everyone else is a country bumpkin... ( Some of the main characters are literally named the Hicks! ). And the obsession with tobacco is almost scary. I personally would like to see a book about Montana ranchers releasing poisonous vipers back into their natural habitat of Manhattan ! And why the obsession with German tourists ? Why not French, Japanese, etc...? I personally couldn't make much sense out of this book- it wandered aimlessly and the plot was very weak. I read it only since it was a gift.Dallas"},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful read!","review":"If you enjoy character development and a sliver of romance thenThe Loop is for you.

Heart-Wrenching and visually beautiful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"As Good As watching an excellent film","review":"What can I say? the characters are well described. I think Helen is stunningly beautiful. Luke, exploding with innocence. I feel pain for the poor wolves. Heart-stopping ending which calms you down right before you close the book to think about what you just read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"can't get it out of my head.....","review":"I liked the Horse Whisperer (liked movie even better than book) but I found The Loop to be even more moving (not that any comparisions are necessary). Have been to Montana and Yellowstone twice, already somewhat interested in wolves. Now, I feel an obsession coming on. I would caution hard-core animal-lovers against the book, because the account of the mistreatment of wolves, then and now, is beyond heartbreaking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captured my heart and made me cry for the wolves","review":"Nicholas Evans write with such true flavor of the American West and yet he is a Brit. I feel very sad about the inhumanity of some humans towards beautiful creatures that they do not understand. The Loop is a wonderful story that kept me involved from cover to cover."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nicholas Evans will not let you put his book down!","review":"This book had me attached from the get-go, once I started I couldn't put it down. Nicholas Evans does a great job of pulling the reader in, even if there is a rough spot of some information not relevant to the plot that you have to muddle through, you want to keep reading because the descriptions he gives are so compelling, and you know there is something completely exciting once you get there. There is always something to look forward to and I was wishing at the end that I could continue on reading about these characters that had so much to say and so much to offer. They were real troopers when the going got tough, on both sides of the wolf debate, but they were easy to relate to because at times you thought they would give up just like all of us want to. They all kept me on the edge of my seat wondering what each would do next and to see how much they had grown by the end of the book. It was like seeing real lives in action."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not As Good As \\"The Horse Whisperer\\"","review":"I'm disappointed to say that \\"The Loop\\" is not as good as Evans' first book. The events are slow and it took me a long time to finish this book, because it didn't pull me very much. I have to admit though, that the last 100 pages were very good, the events were faster and more exciting. Evans does know a lot about animals and makes the reader want to know more and more himself. I wonder when his next book is coming out 'cause I'm really anxious to read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wonderful Story that went no where","review":"I wanted to like this book but it drug on and on saying nothing.

It was not there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn","review":"It is obvious Mr. Evans did most of the research for The Loop from his home in England. Cliche after cliche Mr. Evans leads us through a \\"Spaghetti Western\\" of a novel.None of his characters are allowed to grow or fully develop. The drama is as predictable as a \\"Made for TV Movie.\\" Spend your money on something much more fulfilling, like an ice cream cone."},{"rating":"2","title":"A page-turner!!!!!","review":"This book is extremely good. As my summaryt says it was a page turner just like the Horse Whisperer. He certainly has a talent and I will deffinately be buying his next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect summer fare","review":"Mr. Evans has proven that he is a top-flight story teller. \\"The Loop\\" ranks along with the \\"Horse Whisperer\\" as a superb novel. His characters seem to come alive and I couldn't help but cast the movie as I read the book. He has shown a knowledge of his subjects that would indicate long study. I had a little difficulty with the autumn/spring romance but this did not detract from the suspense created as the story moved along. Easily a five-star read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacking in depth","review":"This book is rather uninspired, with a weak story line. Very cliche. In one instance, Helen is awaiting a letter from her boyfriend in Africa, which conveniently arrives on the same day that someone decides to trample her mailbox and we are told how her letter floats away in the breeze - COME ON! I've seen better writing from high school students... I expected more from Nicholas Evans after the acclaim he received for The Horse Whisperer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Author does NO research","review":"I was going to read this book but leafing through it and come across a sentence saying Old RED John Deere........now come on, that done it, I'm not reading a book that the author doesn't bother with any research."},{"rating":"1","title":"A flawed book.","review":"The Loop is a book that would have been so much more relevant if it wasn't so political in its hatred for and steroetypical depictions of ranchers. They are important, also. The book made them seem like uneducated savages. That is a crime that the rest of the book is not quite capable of redeeming."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a real picture of Montana!","review":"The author needs to stick to places/subjects on which he has more experience/familiarity.

I too saw the Horse Whisperer and then read it and liked the book better than the movie so I eagerly awaited The Loop. It is a page turner and kept me interested. I enjoyed most of the stories of the wolves' family life and found it fits with most of what I've learned about wolf family life. I also found it fits with small town life in rural America. I did enjoy it and recommend it to others - perhaps a library copy or the paperback when it comes out. I will take a chance on the next Nicholas Evans when it comes out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfulfilled promise.","review":"I wanted to love this book, but it never grabbed me, spiritually or emotionally. Very little character development, either in the people or the wolves. Nothing in the book made me care much about the people or wolves and what happened to them, and I am an animal lover! Strangely, I kept waiting for a physical description of the heroine so I could \\"picture her\\" in my mind, but it never came! Overall, I did not find much to recommend in this story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just boring","review":"The books according to my personal taste could be divided into several categories it could be soul opening of Fedor Dostoevsky (Brother Karamazov), it could be terror by Stephen King (The Stand), entartainment-adventure by Tom Clancy (Clear and Present Danger) or it simply could be a good book by Ray Bradbury. Now, there are probably thousand books that won't be put at any category for only and only one reason-they (books) are written by talentless writers. The Loop is a such book. Plot is weak, characters lack good description and so on and so on. The book is plain boring. I barely read it to the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"beautiful!","review":"I loved this book.

Thing is, I did find a bug in their software (this is what I do for a living), but I spent most of my time arguing with the support rep that a corrupted datafile is most likely a bug in Quicken and not something I could cause as a user.

The 2003 release transforms the transaction database making compatibility with a prior release virtually impossible. Under 2003, Intuit has chosen to make the desktop interface excessively busy and eliminated the default snapshot view of many usable resources (i.e. watchlist view, etc). Performance-wise, the 2003 package is quite demanding of system resources and will introduce delay into transition among the various information management functions.

I have turned it in for service, only to be told that the repair costs are greater than the cost of a replacement (thanks for the 90 day warranty, Sony).This is my second Sony VCR.

The animation and art in this series is good. The Female lead is a pretty lady. That is the only thing that made keep watching it.

They are probably related since all of their noses looked like wieners hanging on the middle of their faces. They also have really stupid sounding voices. The series is kinda like James Bond, if he were a cyborg chick with mentally handicapped enemies. I found it impossible to care about this series at all.

They should have started with the main story from the begining and built from there. They did not do that so you will have to go through 7 out of 12 \\"official\\" episodes before things get even mildly interesting.I can go on but that would just be nit-picking. \\"009-1\\" was intended for adults but has a child like appeal when it comes to story telling.

The print quality is good. I do use very good paper for my cards and creations. I also use Canon photo paper when I print pictures. This was an excellent purchase for me. I would recommend it to others.Canon PIXMA Pro9000 Mark II Inkjet Photo Printer (3295B002)"},{"rating":"2","title":"pro9000","review":"this is a great printer. it is fast, and not too expensive to run. people are always impressed by the output. keep in mind though that is is BIG. really big, so if you think thie will fit on your desktop, you must have a really big desk. it needs its own table, and a lot of room in front and back"},{"rating":"2","title":"My son loves it","review":"I just opened the box 10 min ago and my son started playing with them already. The only complaint i have is that there is no storage bin included as mentioned in the product description, so will have to return it as this was one of the main reasons i chose it over the 100-pc set."},{"rating":"2","title":"None stop action and romance!","review":"I am not an avid reader, but this book somehow caught my eye when I read what it was about. I read the whole book in two days, and I was enthralled from beginning to end. The love story that unfolded between the two main characters was fantastic, and the action was outragous. Nancy Allen Campbell is a fantastic author, and I cannot wait to read the rest of the books that she has to offer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle transcription errors?","review":"My comments are entirely restricted to the Kindle edition of this very useful book.The transcription of mathematics into an electronically typeset form is significantly defective here. While it is correct most of the time, there are incomprehensible lapses in critical formulas (e.g., between eqns. 1.92 & 1.93) that significantly affect readability.Buy the printed version until these cases of carelessness are repaired."},{"rating":"1","title":"EDIT: 4 STAR not 1","review":"EDIT:AS of 4-20-09 after having reread this book I'm bumping it up to 4 stars.Amazon btw will not let you for some unknown reason change your star ratings.All I can figure, back in 2000, I must of been having a bad day, it must of been that time of month..... something, I don't know but this is a great book.One of the better myst of read in fact. The writing is solid and the story has depth.I just wonder now how many books I've done this too. Sorry Mr. Holden."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT TOO GREAT!","review":"The book was just OK! I mean the author kept going back and forth from present to past and it got very confusing. Also there was a lot of unnecessary nonsense in it too! Hope Mr. Craig gets better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow, I must have missed something.","review":"For the life of me I can't understand how so many people liked this book. Far from being \\"on the edge of your seat\\" come the end, I thought the ending was pretty much a \\"who cares\\" as it involves characters that had little role throughout the previous 350 pages. Perhaps if you like lame mysteries, you'll like this too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Four Corners Of Boredom","review":"If you want a taut, suspensful thriller with interesting characters, zippy dialogue, and a twist ending, do not read this book. Its a plodding story about a missing girl in, of all places, Toledo, Ohio. One of the reviewers above put it best when he said he had to force himself to finish the book. Stay away!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Book","review":"I have read all of Craig Holden's books and, while I loved all of them, I believe this was his best. It is well written and held my interest from beginning to end. What sets this apart from many suspense novels are the insights of the main character into his own behavior and their effect on the people and events in his life. I cared about all the characters and enjoyed the surprises that I didn't see coming. I think Holden is a wonderful author, especially since none of his novels resemble each other. With this one, the last couple of paragraphs were particularly touching and meaningful showing great depth of understanding of human interaction."},{"rating":"2","title":"DARK CORNERS","review":"After the less than compelling LAST SANCTUARY, Holden returns to the territory he did so well in THE RIVER SORROW. The relationship between our two protagonists here is painstakingly drawn, and evokes feelings of anger, sorrow, and love. The parallelisms between the disappearance of Bank's daughter and the apparent abduction of Tamara are fascinating to unfold. The use of the time shifts is intriguing, although at times a little confusing. But the story is so captivating, you find yourself spellbound by Holden's web. While I can't agree with Sarah's actions, I can understand her motivation. There's always an underlying feeling of what's really going on here that helps the novel move toward it's inevitable climax. A very good psychological thriller."},{"rating":"2","title":"INTERESTING PLOT AND TWIST","review":"When I got this book I was ambivalent about reading it b/c i dind't think it would be good, but I had heard that it was pretty swell. So I bought it and I procrastinated even though I didn't have to read this for school or anything. But after the first few chapters it started developing more and i became entrapped in it. The two policemen that are friends reminds me of my relationship with my friends. This book excavates many disturbing issues but that's what kept my attention. I love how Holden made the policeman completely different but close enough to be brothers. He adds the love and emotion to this story while the rest has to move you on. It's like as the one policeman deals with his family and daughter; he still has to go out on the streets and catch criminals. This story involves a revealing twist at the end but i'm not going to ramble anymore about this book. Just go cop it.~~Special K"},{"rating":"2","title":"parallel story line tied together in the last few pages","review":"believable deeply complex characters interwoven into a parallel story line spanning over a decade of friendships. Great ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Instant Classic","review":"Craig Holden is one of the most talented writers around. His new book, \\"Four Corners of Night' dares to go where no other mystery has gone. Intense. Heartbreaking. Suspenseful. Literary. This new book is his best yet. The ending blew me away. He's a great, great writer. I can't wait for the next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so tense thriller","review":"This book starts off promising much, delivering a story that has elements of intrigue and suspense. However the writing style (first person) and the insistence of the author to try and add twists wherever possible leaves you reading something that has worn thin by the time the twist arrives. Its almost as if you'd rather read about the secondary character Banks, rather than the main character. The two share a past, and now the same fate, both have had their daughters go missing. Its a good book, but there are better thrillers out there that can keep you page-turning. I recommend reading the other books by Craig Holden, as these are more tense."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent as an abridged book on tape!","review":"There are many complaints by fellow reviewers about the slow pace that the book unfolded. It sounds like the abridged book on tape was just the ticket. Usually, I hate abridgements because so much is cut out and the story gets confusing. In this case, the story flowed well and it was quite compelling.The reader, Terrence Mann, did a great job of creating different characters with his voice and with helping the tension level to spike and release.I give this audio version an A."},{"rating":"1","title":"Agrre With Suzzinclaremont","review":"I'll chime in and agree with Suzzinclaremont's review. However, I could only make it through about the 1st 120 or so pages. I found the narrator's first person style boring, as well as his descriptions of Bank, who really seems to be the main character. Of course, this is a matter of taste. I generally don't like books written in this style, which are short on dialogue and long on narrative descriptions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful writing makes this thriller something special","review":"Within the the first pages, reading a fairly standard scene about two cops having their breakfast interrupted by a call to a crime scene, I could tell that this book would be distinguished by the quality of the writing. Holden takes a gripping, but fairly standard plot, and wraps it with a meditation on family and friendship, cowardice and courage. He gives his character an extraordinary voice, and uses nuances of language and style to give the story a depth and subtlety rarely seen in thrillers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Completely absorbing","review":"I picked this up at random, mainly because I liked the title, but I was completely mesmerized by its narrative, and most importantly the two main characters. This is a marvelous read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nightmare Program","review":"This is the worst program I have ever had the displeasure to use. Intuit has sucked in longtime customers who must continue to use its terrible products because of months of entering transaction data. Even after 4 released updates,the program crashes constantly, can't do any of the basic reporting and graphing the PC version does without wildly inaccurate results or crashing. An absolutely terrible product. Avoid at all costs. I may even succomb to going over the Microsoft Money darkside after my experience with this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looks nicer than Windows version EASY and FAST!","review":"i just \\"switched\\" to Mac from Wintel/Linux and I am getting some programs converted.YOU MUST INSTALL THE UPDATES! I went into Quicken 2003 and went to File and clicked on Check for updates this brought down Patch R4 - EASY install.After that I opened help and learned how to convert my Wintel Quicken to Mac Quicken by exporting the QIF file (emailed it to the Mac - no floppy) - EASY import into Quicken for Mac.Then I setup my online accounts and starting using it.All in all I am happy with Mac Quicken coming from Win Quicken. It like everything else on a Mac looks cleaner but you'll find somethings they left out on the Mac version like the main screen that gives you a synopsis of everything and a overall chart. Oh yeah don't believe everything people are saying on these reviews Mac downloads at the same rate the Windows version does - I tested this!Good product! Macs and Unix rule!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bugs galore","review":"You just cannot trust your finances to this program. Bugs pop up everywhere, for example transactions get randomly deleted. Intuit has no competition for the Mac and thus they put absolutely no effort into developing a decent program. Sure there are other basic money management programs out there but nothing with the features of Quicken (at least the ones that work) that anyone with loans, investments etc... need. I was a beta tester for them in the past but would not waste my time doing it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't do it.","review":"Nothing has been as frustrating as Quicken for Mac. Since switching to the MAC from a PC I have copied all of my mail, documents, and a multitude of other critical pieces with no trouble. But Quicken is a different story. Obscure error messages importing OFX format files from Citibank. Freezing, requiring a Force Quit. No response at all to imports of QIF files. Some worked and some did not. There was no clear pattern. One of the error messages I did get was not documented on Intuit's support pages despite being reported by many people on Google and other places over a year ago. And of course those people never received a response from Intuit on the Google Groups. I know you might be desperate but believe me the answer is not in Quicken for the Mac. I never thought I would cheering the day that Microsoft would write an application for the Mac OS, but come on Bill give us Money."},{"rating":"1","title":"A downgrade from 2002","review":"The new 2003 interface may be \\"better\\" but it definitely has more bugs than the 2002 version. Many more crashes, entries disappear after acceptance, scroll bars jump all over the place when switching between accounts. I'm going back to 2002 until a service pack is released."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is there an alternative?","review":"I've been using Quicken for Mac since it's first version many years ago thinking that with each upgrade the bugs would be fixed, I can't do it any longer, I've lost too many recorded transactions especially in split transactions. I've complained to Intuit about this for years, but can't get past the untrained phone support. Does anyone know of an alternative? I'd be willing to pay 4 times more just for the satisfaction of knowing my banking data is safely recorded. What good is a banking program that loses transactions, what do I tell the IRS?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why monopolies are bad","review":"I switched from Windows (XP) to Mac OS X. Everything is better on the Mac, save Quicken. I used Quicken 2001 on my PC, so I expected Quicken 2003 for Macs to be an improvement. Wrong.Quicken 2003 doesn't allow for as much customization of views as the PC version of two years earlier. Also, there's no home inventory, which Quicken 2001 for my PC had. Most importantly, I am can't upload my portfolio and balances to Quicken's website, which is one of the features I used to use the most. I had been in contact with a tech at Intuit's support group, but he eventually stopped responding to my e-mails. It doesn't crash on me regularly, but it does occur more often than with any of my other programs.Two years down the road and the software is worse. Unfortunately, everything I've read about 2004 actually makes it sound worse! Too bad there are no other options - a little compeition might force Intuit to actually improve its product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this until it's fixed!","review":"I've been using Quicken since it was invented (cir. 1988) - and version 1.0 that ran on my 8088 PC was better than this one. Not only were my files scrambled beyond repair when converting from Q-99, but electronic bill pay was totally scrambled. Intuit's help line was a little use - though they didn't charge me their hourly rate.To make matters worse, once you start using '03, with Wells Fargo bank, I was *unable* to revert back to the old version. You're stuck!Intuit came out with a patch, but it still doesn't fix irritating bugs like windows being resized and moved on each startup, and the \\"customize reports\\" pane is chopped off halfway (I'm serious - this is a glaring bug!).I'm w-a-y dissapointed in Intuit that they'd release such a buggy piece of software."},{"rating":"1","title":"Switching Back to Windows","review":"My wife and I have used Quicken for Windows for the past 7 years. We recently switched to Mac OS X, and we were thrilled that Quicken 2003 was pre-installed. Mac OS X is fabulous, but this program has been a nightmare. It is slow, locks up the entire system (which is hard to do with Mac OS X) and VERY buggy. The interface is much less intuitive (pardon the pun) than Quicken for Windows. It also lacks some of the features that we took for granted because they had been in Quicken for Windows for years. Avoid this program at all costs--we're plugging our PC back in so we can start using Quicken for Windows again."},{"rating":"1","title":"HEY, BEWARE OF IRREVERSIBLE ABRACADABRA!","review":"Intuit claimed that her \\"Quicken 2003 for Mac\\" can serve as my financial organizer. I believed and acquired it. But what happened was the unexpected. The software worked fine for a couple of months and then went haywire! It is disorganizing my data now. My figures joggle up and down, day and night. I have made all sorts of adjustments without any relief. All other software (and hardware) on my system have no problems. I haven't seen anything like this!Had it been that I didn't keep my data protecting passwords secret, I would have suspected people of messing around with my stuff. I'm just tired of correcting all my old data each time I add a new one. Intuit has not been of great help.

Rating: MINUS 5 stars!","review":"I've been using 2000 for Mac since it came out and was very happy with it. Since upgrading to 2003, I've had nothing but trouble. Downloading transactions is a nightmare with constant freezes. There are phantom transactions that don't match anything and then disappear. Select one transaction and you can't unselect it. Select one transaction and you frequently have only the option of accepting all not just the one highlighted. Matches that read exactly the same in the downloads and register are not marked as matches so if you accept, you have a double entry. Opening and closing the window doesn't help. Restart the program and your downloaded transactions look the same but the balance in your register is suddenly doubled! I want to go back to 2000, but now that won't version connect to my bank.

Its a high quality product but I returned it because I found it impractical to use. Ultimately a traditional bunting and blanket is the better way to go because an additional blanket can be added or removed as needed to control his temperature . The nanobag caused my little guy to sweat even when used in 30 degree weather ,with light clothes on underneath , and its zippered closures on the back uncomfortably pressed into my baby's back. I also tried leaving the carseat in the car and just taking him in the nanobag but that also didn't work well because you must then open the bag in the cold to put the carseat restraints on and off. All the rave reveiws seem rather suspect after experiencing this product firsthand."},{"rating":"2","title":"No more bulky clothing","review":"I am a new mom again after 21 yrs, it amazed me all the new things that are out here. I ordered the nano bag after seeing simular products out there. I LOVE IT . I can say that its a little difficult to latch a 3 point harness into the slot between the babys legs of the new born car seats. I love the fact all I have to do is dress my baby normally for indoors and put her in her seat, no bulky snow suits, or clothing that cant be removed during a car ride, all i have to do is unzip if shes to warm. I returned all the winter clothing I had received or purchased after using the bag........I love it !!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Elijah Great Lives, Volume 5 by Charles R. Swindoll","review":"So far I have read Elijah, David, and Moses. All three are excellent, but Elijah has been my favorite. If you are a Christian looking for a way to have more of God and draw closer to Him. Elijah will be of great benefit to you. Elijah was a man with a great annointing on His life and was selfless and dedicated to obedience. Charles Swindoll does show a balanced view of Elijah's weaknesses and strengths. Swindoll has a way of getting into the skin of each person he is studying. It was easy for me to relate to Elijah on a personal level because Charles Swindoll has a way of reflecting the human qualities of this giant for God along with the supernatural nature of God that lives within each of us. I enjoyed reading this book slowly so as not to miss one drop. :}"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!!","review":"Elijah is one of my favorite characters in the Bible. One minute he's a great warrior beating out hundreds of other fake prophets, the next minute he's running from a woman, Jezebel,!!

She's 18 months old now and I recently bought another pair so I have one for the diaper bag and one for home. I've tried EVERY other clipper and these clippers give me enough to hold onto without being too bulky and NEVER slip in my hand.

I should add my daughter is always patient and sits very still when I need to clip her nails so I don't worry about pinching or cutting her skin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally worthless large clipper","review":"I would give no stars if it were possible. The larger clipper is totally worthless. First, it's hard to get to work at all, and second, when it does, it leaves the nails rough, ragged that makes nails catch on everything.

The movie is about the pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman's will to survive against the evil of holocaust through his music.Whilst the music of Chopin and others makes an excellent score for the mood of the movie (Janusz Olejniczak plays superbly on the piano), one is left in stunned silence throughout at the injustice and horror that could ever have happened to humankind and tears will only start rolling when the movie ends on the triumphant note of Grand Polonaise brillante preceded by an Andante spianato Op.22 jolting you out of your helpless anguish to applaud in standing ovation with the audience on screen.

It is amusing and a few parts are even memorable, but it is far from flawless. The beginning is very choppy, and it only gets more interesting after the tragedy happens. There is not much character development, especially considering the minor ones. The emotions of the two main characters are flatly laid out, not with much sublety. It is highly predictable, aside from the very last scene, which, by the way, was very tacky. Nonetheless, after a long day, it can be distracting enough.

I couldn't bear the hostile way these two protagonists interacted with each other. They couldn't seem to get along except while having sex.

The ending of this book was one of the most moronic things I've ever read in my life. I won't spoil it for anyone who wants to read it, but believe me, it's not worth the time.

When tragedy strikes, can Ria count on Taylor to help her through their darkest days and not concentrate on his political career?An early effort by Brown, it's schmaltzy, trite, and though it has some unpredictability in the plot, it just isn't well executed. The dialogue is also a little on the vapid side. The best thing about it - the length - you can easily finish it in a couple hours. Thank goodness she switched gears and concentrates on romantic suspense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth Reading","review":"This book was not worth the time it took to read it.

This is essentially the story of this movie. Unfortunately, it is also the basic story of hundreds of other movies, with recent ones being the Species franchise, Invasion of the Body Snatchers, and various X-files episodes. So does any part of this movie make it noticeably better than any of the other movies in the same genre? No. Yes there is the attractive Nicole Kidman, but her role in this movie could have been filled by dozens of other actresses. Overall, an OK movie that is good space filler for a lazy night."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the original","review":"The Invasion, starring the beautiful and talented Nicole Kidman and Daniel Craig (the latest James Bond),is a remake of \\"The Body Snatchers\\" made back in the late 50s or early 60s. It has been updated for 21st century viewers, the story is more believable (albeit the viewer still needs to suspend disbelief), and the acting is superb. The Invasion has a different ending than the original version, and it may disappoint some viewers. The original ending was a bit more shocking, although depressing, and left viewers with a sense of hopelessness. If you, however, enjoy Coleman, Craig, a good story, fast-paced films, and science fiction, you'll enjoy The Invasion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tepid","review":"Nicole Kidman stars as a psychiatrist who notices her patients, her secretary and the rest of the town seems to be acting like emotionless zombies. Together with her doctor boyfriend, they discover an alien lifeform is altering humanity making us more like them. Can she rescue her son, who seems to have a strange immunity to the sickness, or is she destined to join the legion of infected?I was disappointed in this film. I liked the original novel, and this just seemed sort of blah. I never really felt Nicole's character was in jeopardy and I felt she made an unconvincing parent. She seemed physically wrong for the role. She is way overly botoxed/plastic surgered so that her face is like a stretched plastic balloon. Yek. The alien method of contaminating other victims (via projectile vomiting) seemed kind of juvenile. Meh. Overall, this was a limp, lame film, worthy of the sci-fi channel.

I'm okay with remakes that are well done. But this remake of \\"Invasion of the Bodysnatchers\\" is terrible! Kidman's prescription-happy psychiatrist who is inexplicably linked to the high-powered Washington elite makes no sense, the child is pretty well annoying, and her emotions for the cardboard \\"not-a-boyfriend\\" boyfriend played by Daniel Craig are unclear through most of the film. Not to pick on Kidman specifically, since the other characters in the film were equally wooden, but her haircut made more of an impression on me than the plot. Really, given the quality of actors assembled for the cast, I have to wonder whether to blame the script or the director. Skip it and watch the original - some remakes should have stayed in the dream vault, and this is one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tenth remake of Invasion of the you know what.....","review":"This is a terrible movie.

Incredibly, the footage is used in a fictional context, like showing scenes from 9/11 in a James Bond film. Such was the intellectual maturity of the makers of this film, which belongs (if it belongs anywhere) in a late-night trash marathon on the Sci-Fi channel. This is a paint-by-numbers geek show, with all the standard gross-outs, implausible scenes, bad dialogue and horror movie rip-offs.

Soon, most of the populace is walking around like mindless cultists from Saturn! Nicole Kidman is one of only a few people who realize that things just aren't right. With the help of Daniel Craig, Ms. Kidman attempts to rid the world of the spreading zombification plague. THE INVASION has plenty of suspense, even though it seems like the heroes figure things out a bit too early and easily. Nicole Kidman is wonderful as usual. The only real gripe I have is the speedy, rather contrived resolution. It felt tacked-on and cheap. However, I watched this movie immediately after watching M.

I usually do not like Sci-Fi for aliens just isn't my favorite thing to watch. But this one, well it was really good. Nichole's character was everything you would expect it to be. Classy, Beautiful, and as a mom she had the right feelings, protectiveness. An Ex well I believed it, and the boyfriend they had chemistry. The movie started with creepiness that is made for a good thriller but just not sure what to expect and left you filling in some of the blanks which gets an A for letting us use our imagination. The plot is a takeover used in form of a virus which fits in the 21st century. At least when people started to change it didn't make you have to believe aliens as little green creatures (even though there was green soup :)). To live you have to act like one of them, which to me wouldn't be that easy.

The movie is similiar at first to the other versions and the premise remains excellent only this time there's no pods which also lessons the sense of alienation and change.

If you get these cables, you won't really notice a significant difference in picture quality, (especially if your RCA cables are gold plated and top of the line). I have a Sony 27in Trinitron Television. Connecting my Xbox directly into the Svideo jack didn't do what I thought it would. I was looking for Computer like clarity, and didn't get it. Neither will you. If you ever purchase an HDTV with component inputs, the difference will be there. Until then, don't waste your money.

No amount of fiddling has made a difference. On top of this, Monster's customer support was almost nonexistent. Xbox's support was helpful, but they confirmed what I suspected from the process of elimination. This cable is the problem.

I had the window and door both open for ventilation (screens in place of course) and rain dripped right in and I ended up with damp bedding.The next evening was dry and the tent was fine. The tent packs small and light and I appreciated the two removable mesh storage bags on the walls along with the mesh shelf in the ceiling - which is where I kept my phone and wallet so they would be sure to stay dry.I'd skip this tent if you camp in wet conditions. There are certainly other comparable tents out there with better rain protection...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacks the craftsmanship and durability of my old Eureka tent","review":"While searching online to replace a broken support pole for my Eureka Tetragon 7 tent, I read several disappointing reviews for this product with which I must concur. When putting this tent into use (it serving as a replacement for my old but missing Eureka tent), my first observation was that this tent lacks the sturdiness and apparent quality of my old Eureka tent - which saw many years of active use. This newer Eureka tent, in contrast with my old Eureka, has a flimsy and loose feel. After relatively brief and careful use, a supporting pole of my Tetragon 7 tent cracked and splintered. To me it does appear that this tent does not possess the craftsmanship and durable construction of the old Eureka tent.

I was sooooo hopeful that this tent would \\"do\\", but it really didn't.On a HUGE plus side, Amazon did take it back and refund.Tent leaks in multiple places; including door seam, back panel, and through seams on Rainfly! This is NOT normal condensation (I promise), but leaks that resulted in two bath towels and one sleeping bag getting soaked.

We had steady rain for two nights, and on those nights we had steady leaking in the tent from the window zipper. This area is not covered by the rainfly & is not sealable.

The Rainfly actually channels water onto the lower sections of the door and rear window.This creates two problems;1.) You cannot enter the tent while it is raining without getting quite a bit of water in the tent with you (remember the channeling effect?)2.) The constant stream of water on the zipper causes a steady leak inside the tent.If the Rainfly was \\"A-framed\\" instead of \\"Arched\\" I don't believe it would be a problem.Drives me nuts that someone who doesn't even own the product would post a 5-star review"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tetragon 7","review":"Very please.

The scenes with puppies and dogs are completely real and appliable to everyone's home. The trainer, Jeanne, has an amazing understanding of how dogs think and how to communicate with them through their canine behavior. I've seen her train, and it's incredible how she can get any dog to happily adjust to acceptable behavior, quickly and lovingly. If you have a new pup, and follow the video's suggestions, you'll have a well-behaved happy dog, as I do, having followed her advice all the time. As the pup grows, read her book, \\"Good Dogs, Bad Habits\\". It's full of easy to find solutions to dog problems, and funny too. Her training dog phone number is: 206-547-7877. ENJOY!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm no shrinking violet... but this video concerned me...","review":"I have raised terriers all my life, so I'm no stranger to the need for dominance training, but this video demonstrated what I consider to be my past mistakes as the right way to train a young puppy. For example, slamming a hand sharply on a kennel door and yelling at a puppy to be quiet, or lecturing at length to a dog who clearly doesn't understand english--\\"What do you have? That is not a toy! Shame on you! Give me that! That is not yours. Don't you chew on that!\\" I would recommend the Monks of New Skete 3-video set instead. Their methods also include dominance training and ways to become the pack leader with your puppy, but their methods follow more closely standard behavioral techniques that seem more clear to the dog and more \\"centered\\" for the owner. Other people liked this video. Mine went in the garbage. I didn't even feel comfortable donating it to our local library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glacial Pace","review":"This book opens with a fast-paced series of scenes involving a promising hero and his partner, who, alas, are quickly killed off. Then the REAL story begins, rather like a locomotive pulling too much freight: very s-l-o-w-l-y. The freight is a ton of background information about the miseries of modern Russia, and the author wants us to have it all. After 60 pages, the train hadn't even left the station, and I gave up. There may be a great story there somewhere in the next 380 pages, but the author didn't make it worth my while to find out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast paced, but slow enough to develop the Siberian atmosphere well.","review":"\\"Siberian Light\\" (light as in light crude) is a fast-paced book that goes slow enough to build an entertaining and seemingly genuine picture of a Siberian town. For those fascinated by Siberia, like myself, it is the perfect treat for, say, in-flight reading. I'd equate the ease of reading to one of Lee Child's Reacher novels. The characters are like-able, not superhuman, but w/o pathetic flaws and the plot has all the straight-line simplicity and redundancy that makes such books good entertainment. Some of the dialog between Chuchin and Novek stands out as pretty snappy. I'll certainly be reading another one of White's novels as a result of having enjoyed this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Started off intriguing, but became utterly ridiculous.","review":"This book began with intriguing characters and plots, especially the look at the New Russia, but quickly became absolutely ridiculous. The author (was it his/her first book??) tried to cram everything into the plot...prisons, greed, sex, animal rights, smuggling,politics, racial politics and on and on for a mish mash of not really much of anything...I couldn't finish it and I was on a delayed airplane!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This is a very original,very exciting fictional tale that brings into play some interesting insight into possibilities for penal reform.What is happening in this story apparently is happening right under our noses here in the good old democratic USA.I will not go any further so as to not spoil it for those of you that have not yet read this book .Suffice it to say that you should do so as soon as possible.It is fast moving intrigue that is hard to put down.When you are finished you will feel like you just finished an exciting journey through Siberian taiga."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific suspense novel set in Siberia","review":"I gather that this is a first novel, and if so, it's an incredible debut. One of the best suspense/mystery novels I've read in 1998 -- and I read a lot! Protagonist is engaging, the setting is fascinating and well-drawn, and the story unfolds with lots of action and suspense. I was initially a little dubious, figuring it was another Gorky Park clone, but within a couple of pages I was completely hooked."},{"rating":"1","title":"As good as Gorky Park -- NOT!","review":"Started strong, then lost its way. The relationships between the main characters goes from interesting to tedious. I quit about three fourths of the way through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Siberian Light","review":"The book lacks the luster of Robyn White's Typhoon -- so much so that you wonder of this author is another Robin White. The read begins with a slow start -- the introduction of numerous Russian characters, place locations, and Russian politics that it is easy to get lost in the names and have trouble following the plot. However, after a slow start, the books picks up and becomes more fascinating. The Russian political corruption and general lifestyle described makes you think he is describing some backwards third-world country. It makes one wonder why we ever thought the Russians were a threat to our Western life-style."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome","review":"Awesome punk rock for fans of AFI, Misfits, Thought Riot etc. Catchy as hell with plenty of big singalong choruses & whoa-whoa-whoa's, this e.p. contains their best work in my opinion.

Coz this book is a big disappointment coming from an author that had wrote The Ugly Darkling and the Golden Barbarian. They should not have classified this as a romance novel coz I can hardly find any romance element in this book! except a few pages with a hint of anything going on between the lead characters. what a big letdown! Even the supposed suspense in this novel did not keep me riveted as promised. And she really knows how to write big house cliches. I just hope most of her fans would skip this or else they will think that their favorite author had some sort of writer's block or something."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this one.","review":"I waited eagerly for the next Johansen novel after Ugly Duckling and A Long Dark Night, but was very disappointed in this one. The storyline was silly; don't bother. She is capable of much better than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"First of many Iris Johansen books for me to read.","review":"This book grabbed me from the very beginning. I didn't want to put it down. The fact that this could happen in the world today really kept me involved."},{"rating":"1","title":"This rates a minus star.","review":"What a waste of time! I got this on audio for a long trip and had to stop and rent a replacement. Bess is so annoying you want to slap her (she's reminds me of Kate Scarlatta's obnoxious niece), Kaldalk is one-dimensional and unrealistic, the author's research is sloppy, the plot is trite, etc, etc. Thank goodness it was from the library and I didn't spend any money on this pitiful effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying, Horrible Book","review":"This book should have never been printed. Very poor characters and plot, annoyingly unbelievable. Oh sure, the CIA would let Bess direct the action and dictate their behavior. I wanted to slap some sense into her. She was obnoxious, stupid and reckless. Bodies fall all around her because of her self-centered obsession. She stupidly minimizes her importance as a walking antidote for a deadly biological agent and jeopardizes her own life and that of many others for an infant of three days acquaintance. I've never before encountered a character, the heroine, who I wanted to see killed because she was so bad. I wanted to scream several times at the stupid plotting, characters and dialogue and regret spending money on this nonsense. I won't be reading another Iris book."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"If youv'e ever read Iris Johansen before, you should just skip this one. I thought it started off great, but then it just died. We're asked to believe that a hard CIA agent, who would sock a woman in the jaw to get the bad guy, would then become a virtual slave to her every whim.In spite of the fact that the whole second half of the book, she is a target of a mad man,she's calling all the shots and he's obeying! Give me a break!Though this is a poor showing, I am still a fan of Ms. Johansens suspense novels.Want to read a good suspense novel by her, get \\"Ugly Duckling\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining read","review":"I was in the mood for an fast entertaining read, and this book filled the bill. Actually, I read it years ago, and recently re-read it. It's suspenseful with a nice touch of romance. I am not going to argue with other posters who say the characters were not fleshed out or the plot was unbelievable. I enjoyed the story and the resourcefulness of the characters, and the constant sense of impending danger. I wasn't looking for a literary exploration of the human condition, just a fun read with likable characters and a fast-paced plot, and this is it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Main character is obnoxious!","review":"I have read hundreds of mystery/thriller books and rarely have given up on a book half-way through - which I did with this one. I could not stand the self-centered, argumentative main character, Bess Grady. Neither she or the plot were believable - even for a work of fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"An annoying read...","review":"I read romances because, well, because I find them relaxing and they bring a smile to my face. This book totally failed to do that, and I swear my blood pressure rose to danger levels while I read it. I absolutely detested the 'heroine'. I presume that her actions were supposed to be self-sacrificing and noble, but in truth they were the ultimate height of selfiness (willing to sacrifice whomever it takes if need be to get her way). I thought she was one-dimensional, unkind, disagreeable, unsympathetic, and totally self absorbed...kinda what you'd expect in the antagonist of a novel, not the protagonist. I couldn't get past my dislike of the main character to determine whether I found the rest of the story engrossing or not..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!","review":"I loved her other books, so I bought the hardcover when it came out. It was so bad that I actually wrote a letter to the publisher. I'm convinced they hired a ghost writer - this can't be the same author -- there is no convincing plot, the dialogue is laughable, the characters are unbelievable. And I'm really wondering about the people who thought this was a good book..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Iris Johansen book I've ever read","review":"Absolutely LOATHED this book. The only redeeming quality was the fact that -for once- the male lead wasn't a gorgeous sex god. Other than that... The whole thing was unbelievable, the characters predictably idiotic, and boring, and the whole thing just fizzles along to the end, which leaves the reader disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This is my wife's favorite book so I tried it out. Very suspenseful and kept me hooked throughout. Will read more from her."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe I read the whole thing.","review":"Improbable, implausible, impossible, irredeemable dreck. Kaldak the guy whose job requires the occasional murder is putty in the hands of unlikeable annoying Bess. It took a lot of effort to plow through the pages of this pathetic thriller. Only recommended for people I heartily dislike."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievable (In a bad way)","review":"I had hoped to find a book something along the lines of a Vince Flynn, Brad Thor, or Alex Berenson novel. Boy, was I wrong. In Bess Grady, we have a protagonist that is completely bratty, self absorbed, and unlikable. Compounding my frustration, this young photographer is allowed to call the shots and make demands of a strong CIA agent (and the whole agency) when millions of American lives would be at stake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money, save your time","review":"This is the first book by this author that I have read, and I bought it because the blurb looked interesting.Now I know why they say: \\"Don't believe everything you read.\\"This book is terrible. The characters have no depth, the plot has holes you could pilot the \\"Titanic\\" through, and the situations are entirely unbelievable.If I hadn't paid as much as I did for the book, I would throw it away before finishing it. As it is, I'll finish it, then wash my hands."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a waste of time","review":"The title and jacket cover were totally misleading. I thought the plot would entail a mystery, perhaps intertwining with the supernatural or something just as interesting. What a let down!! I couldn't even get pass chapter 3!! And I'm ususally the first person to give a novel the benefit of the doubt. But this one?? it was awful. It felt like sheer torture trying to get through it. Unless you're an incredibly boring person who likes a read that will either put you to sleep or highly confuse you or both, I would not suggest reading it. As a matter of fact, if this is the first novel by Johansen that you pick up, it just might very well be your last."},{"rating":"2","title":"As ALL of her books are it was wonderful.","review":"I have read all of Johansen's books including her newest The Killing Game and I am never able to put them down, usually read them in one night. She is wonderful, keeps you interested from beginning to end. I can't wait to read another!!!! Keep them coming."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kaldak, take me away!","review":"I was not able to finish And Then You Die. I had high, or at least, optimistic hopes for this book. It begins promisingly enough with the Bess character and her sister stumbling upon the scene of an mysterious mass epidemic in a small Mexican village. The level of suspense remained high when Bess was captured by a seemingly malevolent Mexican colonel, and aided in her escape by a brutal killer.The book gets steadily less interesting as Bess bonds with her protector. Part of the problem is that Bess is essentially an idiot with kneejerk impulses. Any sympathy I had for her was undermined by her sequence of stupid decisions and comments. In a rather implausible series of events, she effectively makes herself the head of the CIA, able to order everyone around her.I quit the book during an appallingly bad sex scene between Bess and her protector. I just couldn't take it anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book I've ever read!","review":"This book was so horrible I can't even say! I had to end it early to put myself out of my misery!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The most dislikeable main character I've come across.","review":"I listened to about 3 of the 5 cassettes and grew to loath the main character. At every sensible suggestion, this woman said no, or disagreed or something. Rarely have I had a more negative reaction to a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crazy","review":"I have a problem with all Iris Johansen books. It's the same with this one. The story may create an interest, but the writing is so bad that at times I cringe. What is awful is that I will look at and buy another one of her books hoping that it will be worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"And Then You Die","review":"I did not like this novel at all. The characters were annoying and not very believable. I had to force myself to finish the book. Definetly not one of Iris' better novels! I would skip over this one if I had a choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm 125 pages in, asking the same question I asked on p. 15","review":"Why am I READING this???This book was tersely-written & emotionless. It was a very heavy-handed attempt at drawing in mainstream readership. I read a C. Coulter work (The Cove) that I disliked almost as much as I dislike this book. It had that same dialogue-heavy style, along with annoying, illogical characters, and lack of sexual tension between H&H. If you're into poorly crafted books and you've got money to burn, by all means, buy this complete waste of paper. But don't say I didn't warn ya..."},{"rating":"2","title":"1st Novel Read By This Author...Loved It And I Am HOOKED!","review":"I have read mysteries for over 20 years and I really liked this book. Read it in one night...went back to the library for more. The plot, the characters, very believeable. Quick read."},{"rating":"2","title":"enjoyable book","review":"Maybe not the best mystery I've ever read, but it's a good book. The story was good, the characters could have been a little more interesting, but the book was worth reading.......not a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful to finish","review":"Unfortunately, I was brought up to finish the books I started and in this case, it is very painful. In her first draft for the book, Ms Johansen probably had a 13 year old girl in puberty cast as the herione, who always just says \\"no\\", \\"I do not want to eat\\", \\"I do not want to sleep\\", etc. The herione in this book is so stupid but she always knows better, telling the entire CIA what to do next, although she has no idea what is going on, yes, very probable plot indeed. Well, I have about 100 pages to go, wish me luck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Read And Die of Boredom","review":"This is without a doubt the most insipid book I've read in a long time. I found the characters unbelievable and the plot unrealistic. Bess, the main character was a real witch. This was \\"formula\\" writing at its worst. I wouldn't waste my money on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacking in Substance","review":"I was extremely disappointed in this book. At first it grabbed me then it drabbed me. As stated in previous reviews the dialog was mundane and child like. The plot was thin and the characters were not believable. The CIA would never had given in to such flimsy demands. I noticed the dialog repeating itself constantly, making it easy to skip some pages, without missing any new developments. I read an average of 15 to 20 novels a year and I can't imagine an average of 3 stars for this book. I can not recommend this book. As Ms. Johansens book writing matures, perhaps I will try her again, doubtfully though."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"Save your hard earned cash. This book was a disappointment from page one. I admit, I did find the story line to be intriguing, but the characters were poorly written. Bess was uninteresting, and time and time again I thought if I were there, I'd wring her neck. The only reason I didn't give this one star is that I did become a little interested in the end and actually finished the bok. I can't tell how many times I put it down with no intention of finishing it. I'm glad I waited for the paperback."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievable plot, unlikable characters","review":"I just want to say, do not judge the author by this book. I loved Ugly Duckling and many of her romance novels, but this one was terrible. The hero of the novel starts out being strong and interesting, but for no aparent reason turns into a spineless idiot. Bess, the heroine, acted like a selfish, hypocritical child and was never once brought to task for her stupidity. She spends half of the novel blaming Kaldack for risking her life for the good of many, but spends the entire novel risking not only herself but everyone else for more selfish motives. As the bodies pile up as a result of her actions, she never acknowledges any culpability. I completely agree with every bad review that has been written."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time and money","review":"\\"And Then You Die\\" is the second book I have read by Iris Johansen. My first was \\"The Ugly Duckling\\" which I thoroughly enjoyed, so I bought \\"And Then You Die\\", which is TERRIBLE! Like some of the previous people have said, the CIA would never have done all that for Bess, and if Esteban really wanted Bess dead, he could have easily of done it, by exploding her house, sending a sniper, etc, etc; it's not like he couldnt afford it. Another thing is that Iris Johansen overly uses the phrase \\"Damn you\\". It seems like throughout the entire novel someone is damning someone else. There really were no twists in this book,it was entirely predictable, and the book just died after Bess got away from Esteban on about page 50."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying, Annoying, Annoying!","review":"Although, the plot was very good and well thought out. The characters were extremely annoying! Especially Bess! I found her to be extremely stubborn! It seemed like the author was trying to make her appear to be independent and strong, but she didn't come off like that. I found myself wishing that she would die, and the person to do it would be Kaldak! I also found the love scene between them to be really brief and not well thought out at all! It seemed sloppy and it seemed like the author just threw it in there after the final revision. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Change your books, PLEASE!!!","review":"I thought this book was good, but I had already read Long After Midnight before I read this book, and they are EXACTLY the same.I wish Johansen would change the story line. I just bought The Ugly Duckling and I'm hoping that book takes a different road. I read one of the reviews on it and the guy said it's the same too.She needs to change it up. Every book has a woman who needs to go into hiding because someone's trying to kill her; they have a man to protect them, they fall in love, have sex, stay together at the end.CHANGE THE STORY A LITTLE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"So incredibly disappointed...........","review":"I picked up this book because I've loved Iris Johansen ever since she was first published. I can't believe the same person has written this book. Okay, I thought The Ugly Duckling was an attempt to leap into \\"hardcover respect\\", therefore that was why there was so little romance or even any kind of sexual tension, but this book is even worse.I spent half of the book wanting to throttle Bess and the other wanting to backhand Kaldak. God, another one of those heroes who drag the heroine around, abuse her and then announce \\"But of course I love you.\\" Spare me!Where is the good Iris Johansen - the one you swore could ignite the pages of a book because her characters' words and actions were so hot? Please, bring her back!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing read - I want my money back!","review":"This is a far cry -VERY FAR CRY- from \\"Ugly Duckling,\\" (which got me hooked on to Iris Johansen). Unbelievable plot, unrealistic characters, feeble storyline (I thought the CIA does not operate in the U.S.?). To think that I rushed to the store to get my hands on this book as soon as I found out it was out! END"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a very suspenseful or gripping novel","review":"The plot was pretty believable but the main character Bess Grady was so annoying you just wanted to smack her. Story lacks depth and suspense not really a page turner. Don't know if I would read another of her books even though they were loaned to me by someone who raved about them. I don't share their opinion about them being so good you can't put them down."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is not worth reading--a big disappointment.","review":"This is an unfortunate book which never should have been published in it's current form. The dialogue is stilted and foolish. A child in fifth grade may write more believable conversations. The plot and character motivation is just plain silly. The author has created stereotyped characters who do what the author tells them to do. Ms. Johansen obviously has an idea in mind for how to get from the beginning to the end but people would never be so stupidly motivated. The plot is totally unbelievable. There is no logic to any of it. This book is completely terrible and I hope the author will not allow anything this bad to be published again."},{"rating":"1","title":"this book is horrible","review":"And then you get very irritated and angry that you wasted your time on such an ill conceived, poorly written piece of junk."},{"rating":"2","title":"I.J.'s thrilling and enchanting style","review":"I really enjoy IJ's work and how she keeps me on the edge of my seat. I listened to the unabridged version while doing housework and found myself listening in the car as well. I would recommend it. Bess can be a little pain at times, but I got over that. Kaldak was actually not a gorgeous stud, but that made it all the more believable. Check it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite by Johansen","review":"And Then You Die has easily been placed at the top of my favorite book list. Some of the reviews complain that some of the events in the book aren't quite believable. Well I don't think they are meant to be. We all watch James Bond and and love every second even though it goes outside the bounds of plausibility. Bess makes a great heroine and Kaldak is a great combination of nail hard toughness and some well disguised compassion. The plot takes off at lightning speed from the second you open the book and you turn the last page with a definite groan of disappointment. If you are a Mary Higgins Clark fan this is the best treat you could give yourself. Iris Johansen takes the suspense/romance genre to a new level."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites!!!!","review":"I got the book on tape version because I love the TV series. Not only is the text interesting, but Reed Diamond's narration of it makes it the best book on tape I have ever listened to. The way he uses language to bring the book alive, it even beats the television series!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Murder on the gritty streets of Baltimore, narrated without adornment.","review":"This excellent book is the real thing: descriptions of vicious, nasty, meaningless killings on the streets and in the slums of Baltimore, as seen through the eyes of the homicide detectives who have to clean up the mess. The writing is of a high order, though the language is not appropriate for the impressionable or the prude. One finishes this book with a feeling of deep sorrow for the unfortunate people whose lives have been wrecked, or even touched, by this violence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read, just a minor issue with the Kindle version","review":"Read the other reviews about this book - I agree with most of them. The writing is very good, stories are gripping, maddening and heart breaking. Having lived in Baltimore a few years in the late 90's (after the events in the book) some parts really felt familiar - like I knew it before I read it.One minor complaint about the Kindle version - it lacks a detailed table of contents. So if you plan on going back to parts of the book for whatever reason it will be more difficult as an eBook. It's a complaint about the format, not the contents."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hpmicide","review":"A look inside a homicide unit. The dedicated.

A great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best true crime books ever","review":"I started watching the TV program \\"Homicide: Life on the Street\\" before I heard about the book on which it was based. A fellow fan recommened the book highly, and I can say that the praise was spot on. David Simon's prose is perfect for the subject matter, the way he paints the background of what it is REALLY like to be a \\"murder police\\" in a major US city, the description of the relationships between the detectives and their work environment, etc. There is an updated version which includes photos of some of the true life cops profiled in the book: To the fan of the series it is a treat to put faces to the names, as well as updates on what the detectives are doing now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"If you like the show you will love the book! It follows Baltimore detectives as they solve crimes and what they go through in their daily lives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the show... love the book","review":"My husband is a BIG fan of the TV show. We have every episode on DVD. This book was a great addition to his collection. He loved the book and could see how the award winning TV was based on it. It is different enough that he throughly enjoyed it. I am now reading it and am enjoying it too! It is not the same as the show, and is a great book on it's own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Monotonous -- if you've seen the TV show","review":"The first season is a near-perfect translation of the events in the book. I have the first season DVD set and I didn't get anything out of the book that I didn't get out of the show. I found the book to be incredibly boring; I only read 2/3 of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"An incredible book by an accomplished writer.","review":"David Simon's Homicide:A year on the killing streets is a glimpse inside a year he spent with the homicide division of Baltimore's police department. This jouralism is second to none. He has also created and written for The Wire an HBO show dubbed \\"The best show ever made\\" and Homicide on NBC in the 1990s based on this book he wrote. David Simon is responsible personally for choosing my career path today and his work is moving. If you haven't seen The wire or Homicide I would suggest this book first to get you started."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting day-to-day breakdown of the life of a Homicide Detective","review":"This is a pretty interesting book, especially the detailed sections on crime scene analysis and suspect interrogation, etc. Fascinating to learn that forensic evidence didn't really come into play much of the time (at least in the late 80's/early 90's). Good old-fashioned police work (i.e. interviewing/interrogation) was critical to most of the successful convictions during this time frame. The detectives have a great sense of humor about the horrific aspects of their jobs, but I suppose you'd have to. Great book for people who like true crime novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reality beats fiction all to hell.","review":"Simon's Homicide takes the reader where few would dare to tread on a daily basis--into the bleak reality of murder and moral mayhem. Here is a panoramic view of the dark side of human nature and it delivers in ways that fiction could never aspire. There are sterling moments of insight, pathos, black comedy, and outrage in this volume written by a man who decided it was time to \\"stop\\" his investigation when his own objectivity became at risk; it's one thing to record and observe what's going on and quite another to become even marginally involved. After reading this you'll never think the same about walking down a street at night, missing people, or the workings of the human mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"an absolute masterpiece","review":"This is one of the most engrossing books I've ever read, more exciting and interesting than most novels. Also greatly enhances one's understanding of the fantastic TV series that grew out of this book. (I read the book after becoming a fan of the show). At the same time, it is somewhat depressing to have many illusions about the criminal justice system shattered. Specifically, it is scary to be told just how erraticaly juries can behave, and to learn how few murderers are actually caught and brought to justice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the Color","review":"As a long fan of Mister Miracle comics and a fellow artist who loves the work of Jack Kirby, I find this book as an insult to a great legacy. I didn't know how important color would of meant to keeping the feel and creative mastery that only a Kirby superhero was capable of.I don't buy the idea that the publisher of this book found it a problem to reproduce the original color. Even I have some of the original Mister Miracle comics and have created PDF files creating several of them and the color is just fine.If you are a true Mister Miracle fan or comic book collector of any sort please be advised to skip this one and wait for a color version. Black and white takes away the true feel and excitement that I remember while reading a Mister Miracle comic at an early age.Stay away."},{"rating":"2","title":"What can I say?","review":"This is classic Kirby. No one else creates mythology like he does. His New Gods / Fourth World books were some of the best comics ever done -- a nice blending of world mythologies with the American comic-book mythos. Mr. Miracle is his Heracles, Horace, Heru, etc., and is just as entertaining today as it was when it was first written. The black and white art may put off some potential readers, but Kirby's art sans the color really brings out the weight and depth of his lines."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kirby's Fourth World","review":"This was the King at his finest and most creative. Taken together with New Gods and Forever People, this was a pulse pounding and exciting series, far ahead of its time. Too bad DC curtailed this in the 70s.

Filmed in the studio with a live audience, Hope Radio, captures the passion and soul of Ronnie Earl upclose and personal. If you have listened to the Hope Radio CD, this DVD is a must for your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderfully scary, but not too much","review":"I just discovered this book and took it home to my two year old and he loved it.The writing style is simple and straight forward, and has just the right amount of spookiness- it was neither too scary, nor too mundane. The illustrations are clear and attractive, and fun for a small child. My son enjoyed pointing out the different monsters as we flipped the pages.As soon as I was finished reading it my son asked me to read it again, and for a children's book, I cannot think of higher praise."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful and imaginative for the very-young","review":"I read this book to my daughter when she was 2. At 6, she still loves it, as it doesn't \\"scare\\" her anymore.

It perfectly encapsulates our attitude - things might seem scary but really they're silly. The bright beautiful bold pictures make this book a big hit with my 2 year old and 4 year old. In fact, they like to discuss which picture they like best. I know this will be a seasonal favorite for years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Children to learn that things are not always that scary","review":"I liked this book very much for the lesson it teaches you. My daughter who is 7 told me after reading this book to me, that things are not always as scary as they first seem to be. The monsters were just people, but seemed scary to the kittens because the kittens are so much smaller than the people, and the people had costumes on, which made them seem even scarier to the kittens.Very easy book to read, and because it kind of reads like a song or poem, it made it fun for my daughter to make her own tune to read it to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Halloween Chills","review":"I love the beautiful illustrations in this book and the rhyming is perfect for phonemic awareness for preschoolers. It is the perfect amount of scary for 4 and 5 year olds. It is a short, spooky, read with gorgeous pictures."},{"rating":"2","title":"In The Moment","review":"If you are familiar with this trio, known as \\"Gateway\\" then this will be a bit different than anything else they have released. These three could be part of the Psychic Network if they wanted,wow! what telepathy,passion and the ability to listen and respond is utilized by these extraordinary gentlemen. Those of us who have seen and followed these master musicians throughout their respective careers are always encouraged when they are featured on a new release. This will not disappoint,though it is more contemplative than their previous outings.

Sometimes at this song Sandra's voice sounds with very strong germanish articulation but this is a compliment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great First course in Problem Solving","review":"This is a great book for high school students and undergrads who don't have much experience with solving problems. Sums, inequalities, systems of equations, and number theory are the core of the book. The author provides worked examples and then a set of exercises and some challenging problems are included at the end of each chapter(almost all of the solutions are given). Very readable and a great addition to any mathematics library. Highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best cables for the original XBox","review":"The image quality you get with these cables is fantastic and a huge step up from the factory composite cables. Just make sure you don't need to plug and unplug them too often. Like almost all Monster cables I own, these plug in VERY tightly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hooking up your X-box using component cables is the ultimate","review":"Plain and simple, if you had to choose between composite, which is the 3 color(red, white, yellow) RCA connection, the S-Video connection, or Component connections, Component blows them out of the water. If you just want the best possible video connection, period, this is it. This cable is made by monster cable so you know it's quality. The wire is very strong and bend resistant. This also has an optical out so you can hook it up to a reciever to get dolby surround but it has to be bought separately. Only downside is that you need a TV that has component inputs or even a reciever that has component inputs. I have a Sony Wega and they come with component inputs, if you don't have a TV that comes with component inputs, this is not for you. Remember it has to have component inputs, 5 input jacks. I tested it out on my TV using the standard RCA and the component, the component is noticeably clearer and sharper so I can testify that it works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overpriced","review":"I have a friend that uses these cables with his X-Box and HDTV.

We saw very little difference with the two sets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Damaged our receiver, then fell apart. Get the Psyclone Cable.","review":"I foolishly bought the Monster Cable Xbox Component Video Cable for $25 during my local Circuit City's store closing. I thought the cable would be better than the PsycloneXbox Video Cable w/Digital Port, because I had actually heard of Monster before, plus I didn't want to wait for the Psyclone cable to arrive in the mail. Big mistake. The Monster cable actually did damage to our receiver, because the plugs were too snug-fitting, and now we have to run component video through the TV. Anyway, after damaging my receiver, the cable promptly fell apart. So I came to Amazon, ordered the Psyclone, and was very pleased with the quality.I will now trust Psyclone over Monster any day. And the Psyclone is $10!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Expensive Cable Garbage Quality *Beware*","review":"This Cable I thought would be of Excellent make and performance but No I was mistaken. I went to plug this onto my Brand New TV's Component Jacks and the A/V Plug ends kept snapping off(The outer ring that goes around the jack)!! They are supposed to bend to keep a tight connection but instead I would say about 15 pieces of the little circular ends snapped off and now they are only connected by a few that didn't break. 24K Gold my ass. I now know and will say without second thought that MONSTER Cables are Overrated and we are being overcharged for something that is not up to Par with something half as cheap. Do yourself a favor and find another cable, don't waste time or money like I did and wind up regretting it."},{"rating":"1","title":"So close, but yet so far.","review":"This cable set is nearly perfect. The cable quality is fantastic and the actual jacket for the cable has a nylon net that keeps it from snagging and tangling. This cable also includes the connection for the optical cable accessory. The one, unforgivable problem is the connectors. They are so ridiculously tight, that you run the risk of breaking off the rca connectors on your TV or receiver. I have tried two of these units, and both were the same. Do not purchase this!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible","review":"I don't normally write reviews, but this product is terrible.

Please?","review":"I wasnt impressed by Enemy Within. And it got worse with Day of Wrath - good thing I got a library copy.There's just too many lucky escapes and its so unbelievable that the 2 protagonists could for the 50,000th time outwit ex-Stasi agents and very well paid mercenaries. And the usual convenient bad guy - an arab. What's this preoccupation with Arabs anyway? Can't someone pick a different villian for once? A chinese dictator, an evil Swedish billionaire, a mad Burmese ?Anyway Larry should stick to his awesome war epics - Cauldron, Vortex and Red Phoenix - I remembered how much I DROOLED over every page and didnt sleep for 48 hours finishing red Phoenix. But I digress.If you enjoy b-grade unbelievable escapades get Day of Wrath, else get/re-read Larry's previous works which are heaps better than Enemy Within and DOW."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good spy novel","review":"My first Bond book, I was pretty impressed. Seems to be on par with Stephen Coonts, another specialist in the military/cloak'n'dagger genre. Should a movie come out: Peter Thorn: Tom Berenger; Helen Gray: Sela Ward (too dainty?)

Not as technical as some of his past work, but still very entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting action thriller!","review":"I enjoyed this book! Sure the heros were super-heros to the max but what the heck, don't we all yearn to be super? The plot seemed well-researched. The premise was VERY scary. What if nuclear bombs were smuggled into the US by such an intelligent, wealthy, American-hating bad guy? A man who had the power to do whatever his twisted, evil heart wanted him to do. A man, too, who in his youth was given plausible reasons for his intense hatred of the West.Thorn and Gray had to rely on themselves and just a few trusted friends to save America, possibly the world, from certain disaster. The moral and professional dilemmas they had to face seemed all too real at times. Overcoming stupendous odds, they finally succeeded in saving themselves and the country. Good for them that in the process of doing so they were able to discover a deep love for each other.

Reviving Colonel Thorn and Agent Gray from \\"The Enemy Within,\\" Bond puts them on the trail of a Saudi prince with a grand scheme to cripple the U.S. Circumstances force Them to operate outside the law to thwart the operation. An excellent job showing the dangers of operating rogue. Loved some of the moral and legal dilemmas Thorn and Gray had to face. The bad guys are smart and sophisticated, covering their tracks masterfully and taxing all of Thorn and Gray's abilities to the limit. Not as many action scenes as in previous Bond novels, but the drama and intigue do hold you. The final battle is awesome! Great supporting characters as well, from Thorn's old C.O. General Farrell to slimey FBI Assistant Director McDowell, who's got his own agenda and a hatred toward Agent Gary. Great story! A real winner!"},{"rating":"1","title":"An awful book from a great author.","review":"The book just rambled on and on. The story is so unbelieveable I guess he had to.

Totally unbelieveable cardboard characters - and that's the two heroes. If Bond's next book has these two characters (Thorn and Gray) in it, I'm not going to bother to read it. Like I'm going to believe those two can off scores of highly trained killers with every time of gun and hand to hand combat on three continents and save the USA from nuclear annihilation.

Thanks George."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Book","review":"...especially compared to Timothy Zahn's work. I'm a big Star Wars fan and a big Salvatore fan, and I thought it would be a perfect match. But this is just a very flat story with boring villans, weak dialogue and a ho hum story. Big disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for first book","review":"I got this book from a book store because I like star wars. This was my first book that I read from their series. I would deffinatly reccomend this book to others."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Refreshing Change of Pace","review":"Though I will miss Chewie in the future, this book adds a touch of realism to the Star Wars saga. No one has as many lives as the core characters, not even Morris the Cat! This book also introduces a terrifying new foe to our heroes and the New Republic. I highly recommend this book to any Star Wars fan who can cope with the loss of a beloved character. For all of you who complain about this book, get a grip! This is just a new path in the never ending Star Wars saga, and it opens up the reader to a sense of suspense once again! Now we never know until the end of the novel if our heroes really will survive!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Salvatore must not like Star Wars","review":"I don't think Mr. Salvatore should continue writing Star Wars.Unfortunately for us he has to. Star Wars is a space opera not an intense drama. Killing off characters and warping others isn't my idea of a good writer.The book doesn't even refer back to other Star Wars books.However if you are a die-hard Star Wars fan you might enjoy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite a good Star Wars book!","review":"Having read almost every Star Wars book in the series, I approached this book with some trepidation, already aware of the ONE big event that happens in the course of the story. However, I found it to be quite good. Salvatore has a flair for characters and keeps the Star Wars gang true to form. The Yuzahn Vong are just plain scary, possibly the nastiest villians ever presented in this series. Unlike many of the Empire's remnants, the Yuzahn Vong are extremely dangerous and will stop at nothing; couple this with their alien technology and we now have some foes worthy of a Star Wars tale. Good show!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, but not the best...","review":"I thought that this was a great book. It was almost a horror story the way the author wrote. THe only part I didn't like was how quick the book was resolved... Any more information and I would give the book away"},{"rating":"2","title":"BAh! this is a good book","review":"I have read all of the star wars novels except the black fleet series !cough!. this is a good addtion to the star wars universe. althogh there is a drastic change, it is new and creative. so much so that am reading the 3 book series over agian- vector => onslaught=> ruin."},{"rating":"1","title":"This will be a book long remembered....","review":"...as the book that set the mood from the first page. Boring!! And really, did the author really need to kill of Chewbacca? I think Chewbacca was one of the funniest characters in the Star Wars Saga. What's with the lightsaber descriptions? Are they just a blade of energy or do they have some color? NO CHARACTER DESCRIPTIONS!! What does Bolpuhr look like? It seems that when a new character is introduced he is basically killed in the next twenty pages. Example: The Star Destroyer Commander. The map in the first two pages is completely useless. Where is Naboo? Where is Anoat? Where is Dagobah? But still a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The New Era","review":"I have often wondered about the journey of the Star Wars saga. Star Wars seemed to me, to be traveling very fast (Publishing more and more books) without going any where (slowly grinding to a hault; no dirrection),untill this new series was published. This book is FANTASTIC! It brings back the intrigue and adventure that we all know and love. I stongly reccommend you get this book and read it more than once."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vector's a Crime","review":"It disgusts me that as soon as Del Rey gets its Star Wars licenseback, they came out with Vector Prime. The story of the NewRepublic's battle against the Yuuzhan Vong begins with a disguised Yuuzhan Vong warrior wreaking havoc on a scientific research planet. The story goes on with the tale of this new species invading New Republic airspace. Many battles ensue, including one between Mara Jade and a Yuuzhan Vong warrior. I advise against reading this book. The story is choppy, the plot is pathetic, and the book is just plain boring. I hope R.A. Salvatore will do a better job on the novelization of Episode Two. Skip this, and read Timothy Zahn's Heir to the Empire."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lack of detail forces a good storyline bad","review":"The Star Wars universe has always been packed with detail that compels the reader to search for the secondary and tertiary storylines. Unfortunately, this novel was lacking of details. The characters were written very poorly and the author took liberties with them that a rookie Star Wars author shouldn't have. It is unfortunate that we did not find out much detail on the Yuzzahn Vong, except that they are bad and wanted to take over the galaxy. The main characters in the story showed no emotion other than anger (which leads to the dark side). Star Wars has always been an adults story dressed up in a way that even a child could find it enjoyable, this book was an attempt to change that. It was a very disappointing book, and I hope they can make a negative into a positive with whatever book comes out next. More details and more emotion would have made the difference."},{"rating":"2","title":"MAGNIFICANT!","review":"\\"Vector Prime\\" is the first book in the STAR WARS novels I've read. I picked it up at a book store, planning only to read it until the books I ordered arrived, but I got into the story so much I've gotten addicted to the series, I've ordered two more. \\"Vector Prime\\" is wonderfully written and has action after action. It has fallowed up on the characters very well and has given us the chance to witness, possiblely the down fall of our beloved characters. The introduction of the Yuuzhan Vong gives our heros a worthy villan. Plus, the writer adds something to the story that will change the lives of our hero's forever.If you haven't read this book, read it, if you have read this book, read it again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally some fresh air for the Star Wars universe!","review":"I think Salvatore did a pretty good job with this book. For a beginner he is certainly throwing things around in the New Republic. But it was all neccesary!Before the New Jedi Order(which starts with \\"Vector Prime\\") life was getting to be somewhat dull in the Star Wars univererse. Over forty books were published with nothing really happening to the people and planets of the New Republic. I can not even begin to count how many times I have read about some disgruntled imperial admrial trying to get back at the New Republic or some bitter war lord trying to kidnap the Solo kids, and so it goes on.Salvatore's book changes all that. Yes, he does kill Chewbacca off, but I am bent to believe it was neccessary!All in all, a great read, although the Solo kids tend to be irrittating little brats in the book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Salvatore Rules ?","review":"I must say that I found some of the other reviews of Vector Prime amusing. I am a big Salvatore fan but even he can write a bad novel. This one, thank god, is not one. Please don't bicker about what is going to happen to Mara Jade, we'll find out soon enough, and also don't be mad at Salvatore for killing Chewie. The publishers wanted one of the main characters killed, so who did you want them to kill, Luke or Leia? So come on an just enjoy a new chapter in the Star Wars Genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chewbacca should live","review":"I hated this book and believe they should never have killed Chewbacca what a disapointment Chewbacca was the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally a realistic Star Wars novel!","review":"A great read! Events finally have consequences and yes characters do die! If you want a good read where the ending isn't clear from the minute you pick up the book, grab this novel!This is the kind of story that reminds us all why we became Star Wars fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait a second!","review":"Okay, I haven't read this book yet, but from some of the other reviews, I have learned, that Chewbacca dies! Chewbacca is one of my favorite characters, he can't die! And anyways Mr. Salvadore or whatever havn't you read Kevin J. Anderson's and Rebecca Moesta's books - Young Jedi Kights, Chewbacca's alive in them and unless I'm mistaken which I don't think I am, young Jedi Knights, comes after Vector Prime. I was going to read this book, but frankly, now I don't think I want to. I am very dissapointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"GEORGE LUCAS -- GIVE THE FICTION CONTRACT BACK","review":"When I read that the fiction contract had gone to DelRey - I said \\"I have a bad feeling about this.\\" And this book proves it. It is too bad that we can't give negative stars because I would this book them. I was totally disgusted with so many things about this book it would take pages to state them so I will say that I feel like the Star Wars universe has died and I am in mourning. All the idealism, the hope and the fantasy are missing here. The book seem to last forever and the beloved chaaracters seem like puppets. The force was missing and so was the mysticism. A BIG MISTAKE. DelRey/Lucas Books are you listening?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Barely better then the rest of the novels","review":"I can not for the life of me understand how anyone likes the Star Wars novels. They rehash plots and dialog and lack originality. Vector Prime at least attempts to bring new life to this sad series and barely accomplishes that. I guess if you are a 13 year old boy or an adult in arrested development you might enjoy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grrrr!!","review":"I was going to read this book.......but then my best friend told me all about it!! Boy am I PEEVED!! RA Salvatore killed Chewie!!!!!!!!!!!!!! HE DID IT!!!!! HE MURDERED THAT INNOCENT LOVABLE WOOKIEE!!!!! You dolt you could have killed Ta'a Chume, or someone!!! And where in KESSEL has Tenel Ka gone? Since the New Jedi Order came out she's been missing. Okay...personally I think that he shouldn't be allowed to write another Star Wars book, because if he does, Mara Jade will die. Not happening. GET A CLUE AND GET SALVATORE OFF THE AUTHOR LIST!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"How's This For a Plotline...","review":"I know I'm only a mere reader, a lowly fan, and what do I know? But, I'd have really enjoyed this book more if Kyp Durron had been killed off instead of you-know-who. I mean, the guy doesn't have a clue. I'd love to see alot more Corran Horn, too. Horn is even above Skywalker in the \\"common sense department\\", as well as the \\"guts department\\". So, next time kill off Kyp and put Corran in his place, OK?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Entertaining story, but terrible writing","review":"I am a sucker for anything in the Star Wars milieu and the overall arc of the plot is very compelling and kept me engaged. But this was a terribly written book. It's so bad I found it distracting; I wanted to get out a red pen and make corrections. The plot too goes off or seems especially silly--even suspending your disbelief far enough to get you into a Star Wars novel. I'm not just talking about the famously controversial plot turn, which although satisfying has a certain authenticity to it. But many of the characters actions just don't make much sense. I put the book down several times in frustration."},{"rating":"2","title":"I didn't want to like this book, yet found myself drawn in.","review":"R.A. creates a whole new race, and introduces a new technology, or maybe reintroduces us to an old one of symbiotic relationships with living creatures.The death of the major character was NOT Bob's idea, but was strongly suggested by Lucasfilm. So don't hate Bob for making you cry and bawl like a baby when you get to that part.The character dies living it's life the way it was introduced in the books... and that's the part I liked about this. While it IS a sacred cow of sorts, it's not just to generate interest in the book in general. I would hate to think that Bob's book is only remembered for that sad fact.And to the other reviewers that tore the book apart because of some technical difficulties... no other series of books gets everything right. Get over yourselves, and get a life!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointing","review":"This book was a severe disapointment to me and any real star wars fan. The plot was acceptable but was still not to the level of Timothy Zahn. Furthermore, Salvatore has killed of one of the orignal Star Wars characters. To any possible readers, I suggest that you don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good But not Star Wars","review":"This book is good but is not made with the quality you come to expect from a Star Wars book. I am a big Star Wars fan and love Star Wars books, but while I was reading this one I did not feel like I was in the Star Wars universe. This is because the characters did not have the same personality as in other books. This book disappointed me. With the death of a main character the books that come after this time period will be limited. The disease Mara Jade has also took out some of the enjoyment. This is not one of those books that you can't put down. I would have rated this book higher if it was not Star Wars because it is too unbelieveable for Star Wars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely disappointing","review":"Mountains of hype, and under it this pathetic mouse of a book. The death of you-know-who doesn't bother me--but the arbitrary way it occurred does (gotta do the deus ex machina thing now). New characters completely cardboard. Old characters blandly handled. Plot stupid and cliched. Salvatore gets numerous things hilariously wrong. The previous comments about it being 'dark' are baffling--it's not 'dark', it's just dull. I thought the TPM novelization was an aberration--apparently not. This is the new norm. Save your money, folks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utterly boring, utterly idiotic, utterly ostentatious","review":"This is one of the most horrible books I have read in my lifetime; and yes, I managed to read the whole book. Why I wasted my time I'm not sure. I'm sure Salvatore can write well, but some authors can adapt to the SW universe and some can't (Salvatore being one of the later).That a particular character died was not the problem. Nor was the new enemy (though I think we all miss the Imperials). The book was just not suspenseful, not compelling, the characters weren't very well developed/captured...<sigh>. Part of the problem is that no author has yet given the Solo children well-written, interesting characters. Yes, they've been characterized, but they're not yet -characters-. Just works-in-progress (not even people in progress)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Salvatore","review":"Salvatore moves into the Science Fiction genre after many successful forays into fantasy literature. I must say the transition is seamless. This is a typical edge of your seat thrill ride that can't be put down until it is finished. He also does an amazing job of character development whithout losing the action sequence. If you are a fan of the Star Wars series, or sci fi literature in general, get this book!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"THE WORST STAR WARS BOOK EVER!","review":"If I could use one word to describe this book, it would be BAD. The plot was worthless, there was no character development, and even worse CHEWIE DIED! I thought that the main characters were'nt supposed to die! Chewie's death was even worse due to his doing absolutly nothing in the Hand of Thrawn. With the New Jedi Order series being 25(!) books long, I think that all of our favorite characters will be dead by the last book. I also think that there are some loose ends to tie up, such as the Ssi-Ruuk and the Hand of Thrawn, before they start up an invasion of stupid aliens that ends after one book. R.A. Salvator should stick to D&D if you ask me. DON'T read this book, it will ruin your enjoyment of the galaxy far, far away..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Star Wars + Salvatore = AWESOME!!!!!","review":"Being a big fan of Star Wars, especially the expanded universe, and a huge fan of R.A. Salvatore's writing, I was excited to read this book! The story is a big leap for the Star Wars universe, going in a totally new direction with a threat that even the Jedi find nearly impossible to handle.I don't want to give too much away to anyone who hasn't read this book yet, but Salvatore is the perfect author to write the farewell of a beloved Star Wars character. This is my favorite book in The New Jedi Order series. However, if you have not read any other Star Wars novels, you might be lost when it comes to some of the characters. If this is the case, start with \\"Heir to the Empire\\" by Timothy Zahn. This is the first book in a trilogy that will intoroduce you to important characters like Mara Jade, Jacen and Jaina Solo, Gilad Paelleon, Grand Admiral Thrawn, and the Noghri."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good SciFi, Bad Star Wars & Bad Editing","review":"I had a bad feeling when those who now control the Expanded Universe decided to kill Chebacca. They had a good idea to pump something new in the EU with an invasion from outside the galaxy. So here is SW fans were left with - A series of prequel books and movies that must necessarily be dark... and a new series NJO that starts off dark. Why was it also necessary to kill beloved characters?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Necessary but not enjoyable","review":"Although Star Wars fans will want to read this book as it is the kickoff of the New Jedi Order series, they shouldn't expect much out of it quality-wise. The writing is poor, the viewpoints change without warning and the dialogue is stiff and unbelievable. However, it contains the introduction to our heroes' new enemy, the Vong, and a wealth of information that is helpful upon reading later books."},{"rating":"1","title":"SUCKY BOOK. BORROW FROM A FRIEND, BUT DON'T BUY.","review":"This has got to be the worst Star Wars book I have ever read. The was nothing \\"star wars\\" about. The whole living weapons thing from the Vong(Youhzog or Prearite, who cares) was ridicules at BEST. The no resolution to Mara's problem sucked. Superweapons and space opera is what Star Wars is about. I liked the fact that is was a short read, not the long drawn out nothingness of Mr. Zahn. If there are any powers that be out there, please DO NOT let Mr. Salvatore back into the Star Wars universe. Even though it happened a long time ago, Star Wars should be hi-tech and science fictional. Not organical."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where was Luke's sense in the force?","review":"I was very disappointed in this latest Star Wars Novel. I found most of it hard to believe. The characters have lost their creativity. Even the death of Chewie was not believable. After his supposibly death even Luke did not \\"feel\\" the lack of his presence. I find that hard to believe given the fact that he is THE JEDI MASTER."},{"rating":"1","title":"That about wraps it up.","review":"Mr. Salvatore's book is good,however when you combine it with EP1, it starts to paint a very lousy picture of where the Star Wars Universe is heading. I think that now is probably a good time to say goodbye to this once great achievement. I believe that Mr. Lucas has forgotten where the interest in these stories came from. I hope Micheal Stackpole and Dark Horse continue with Star Wars, because they seem to have the right innovations needed to keep it fresh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Star Wars, or a demented fanfiction","review":"This is the first time Star Wars has resembled fanfiction.

Too many authors.We have about 20 books from the New Jedi Order series, and the first thing that you notice is the lack of continuity -- in story line, characterization, technology, weaponry... it's a mess. Using Star Wars character names makes the stories more aggravating, but it probably makes the books more marketable.If you are a hard core Sci-Fi person who reads indiscriminately, well -- these are books, all right.

I don't plan on buying any books by this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Dreck!","review":"Salvatore has no sense of the characters or society of the Star Wars universense; no talent for plotting (too much exposition, too little action, major plot points--e.g., Mara's illness--dumped on the reader with no setup, no tension or emotional affect--he kills a major character & it has absolutely no impact on either the storyline or reader) and an extremely mealy-mouthed attitude toward violance (e.g., ships don't blow up--they just 'go away');"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh!","review":"I'm over halfway into this book, and all I can say is that the Yuuzhan Vong (the enemies, if you haven't read the book) are pretty dumb. What is their point? Why don't they have a plan? They're pretty stupid in the book - just kill one guy, then go and kill the other.I wasn't able to read this book before because it was too boring, and then I picked it up again and started reading it. I have no idea what Yomin Carr was supposed to be doing, nor what Nom Anor is trying to do. It just doesn't make sense.Maybe this book fell short of my expectations, but I think it's due to the fact that it was ringed with a lot of hype. It's just a new series! So why get so excited?If you want an exciting and *sensible* Star Wars book, read the Hand of Thrawn novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bah! Stick with fantasy Salvatore!","review":"I have read the Crystal Shard series from Salvatore back in 1989 and loved it. I have read the Star Wars series ever since the Zahn series. This should have been the best novel yet. But Salvator only rehashes the same story lines that have been beaten to death in previous books. There is little imagination, what little there is is far fetched. If I tell you that this book is about an evil force threatening the Republic, you say \\"yeah, so? We've seen that in every book!\\" He has the big death of Chewie in this book. Something like this should be monumental. You should remember this like you remember when JFK was shot. But instead, it is an akward, messy moment. We don't have time to grieve Chewie. The whole book is rushed to get to the death of Chewbacca, and when we get there, we are in a hurry to get done with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"no consistancy","review":"I love Star Wars. This was a shallow picture of the SW Universe. It had a contrived ending, more like Star Trek when you try the trinitron burst from the Sony zappalizer to bring all to a conclusion. And the lead character in the beginning of the novel was supposed to be a warrior but acted like a coward, stabbing everyone in the back. Luke, Han and the rest were one dimensional. Only good part of the book was the Starwars timeline and map."},{"rating":"1","title":"Iam most displeased with this lack of effort.","review":"Well this book was a terrible experience for me as for a trueStar Wars fan. END"},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK","review":"This is without a doubt the worst Star Wars book in print today. It surpasses Darksaber in tedium and stupidity. The plot is predictable, the villians are trite, and the characters are as wooden as my front door. Vector Prime does have its moments though. There are some funny scenes involving Chewie, but overall the book is a real stinker. I had high hopes for this novel considering the good start the Hand of Thrawn Duology had given but it was a profound letdown. Hopefully the powers that be in the Star Wars franchise will not allow another magnificent blunder like Vector Prime in the future. As for Mr. Salvatore's writing style I think it best that he should stick to novels with titles beginning with the word Demon and stay as far away from the Star Wars universe as possible. If you want to read a good Star Wars book stay away from Vector Prime and reread the Hand of Thrawn Duology."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Mandi and others that think it is fine killing of Chewy","review":"Chewbacca shouldn't have been killed. All of the characters people have listed have been in 3 or 4 stories tops. Chewbacca has been in the story line for dozens of stories. He went through the movies and all the way to this book. And another thing Star wars is Science fiction and mythological. In those types of stories someone doesn't get killed for making and important decisive action. The author wrote the book as a horror story not a Science Fiction story. This guy did a horrible job on the book. The next book should bring chewy back some how."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't be fooled","review":"I don't want to go into detail with the review, rather than to point out that I liked it more than most of the SW Bantam novels, and that I thought the death was very well timed and necessary.Also, I wanted to point out to all of those reading these reviews from the top to look at the Customer Review Average at the top of the page: 4 stars. The reason you are seeing so many 1 star reviews at the top is because of people that read Mr. Salvatore's interview on theforce.net about his good reviews here at Amazon. It seems that a several people wanted to change that. Still, the average is 4 stars, and it deserves that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Creative. Well Written.","review":"I've read virtually every SW novel, and this is certainly one of the better ones. Salvatore is a skilled writer (unlike some of the other SW authors), who wrote a story that was interesting, and featured an alien race that I found to be a product of great creativity and imagination. I hope that the future books in this New Jedi Order are as good as this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horror instead of traditional Star Wars","review":"I can tell that Salvatore's previous books were horror books. He is never able to marry his horrific plot and the traditional Star Wars plot. If you remove any pretenses of Star Wars, you have a horror story with characters slaying people with axes. I was very disappointed. The notable characteristics of Han Solo, and Leia were altered, and the plots involving Solo & Leia were too comical. The omnipotence of 'The Force' was absent from this book. I think more previous research from the Bantam books should have occurred. I hope that the future Del Rey books remain with the traditional plots, characters, feel, and atmosphere of Star Wars Sagas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor","review":"I should have been warned by the TPM novelization, which used a good fantasy author to absolutely no effect. I have never read Salvatore's other work--to judge by his reputation, it can't possibly be as bad as this. The book is limp, full of errors, botched characterizations, and villains that are straight out of Ming the Merciless. Just awful. Did the publisher know it was bad? Sure they did, because perhaps the only good section of the book was the one they chose to excerpt on the net and in print. They imagined, I suppose, that quality didn't matter, because hype is all. Wrong again. A dire beginning for the NJO."},{"rating":"2","title":"Death of Chewbacca","review":"The book was really great. I was captivated, and didn't put it down for a second. I thought the charachters were good and so were the new aliens. The problem with these books, is the fact that, the writer builds up the story and then finishes it in the last ten pages. They defeat the aliens to easily in the end.My biggest problem is how Chewbacca dies in this book. Not only does he die, but he dies in what I feel is a non heroic manner. This is one of the greatest hero figures of all time and his death is anti-climatic. I kept wondering if some how he would be saved and that he would come back. I am willing to bet that Chewbacca's son joins the team in the following books.All in all it was a good book but in all fairness I have to send out a big F-U to the author for having the gaul to kill Chewbacca. It just ain't right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another reason why Lucas should write his own books","review":"I eagerly bought this book because I ADORE Salvatore's \\"Icewind Dale\\" trilogy....but he should stick to drow and not Jedi. I keep reading the \\"Star Wars\\" followup novels in hopes that somebody will do justice to Lucas' masterpieces, but with the notable exceptions of Timothy Zahn, Brian Daley, and Crispin, they're AWFUL, and this one is no exception. Killing off Chewie is only the tip of the iceberg....if a character HAD to be offed, WHY OH WHY couldn't it be the annoying C3PO? Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"You know this was the worst star wars book i ever read, and i think i read over 20. R.A.

Such as killing Chewbacca. It's like none of the Jedi's realy used the force except to check to see if one of their friends were enjured. And Anikin Solo could have used the force to raise Chewie up into the air and into the falcon. And then like I would be reading one curtain thing then the next chapter. The auther wrote something that had nothing to do with what had happened already or what never really happen. It was like a shock trying to figuer out what your were reading.This is the worse Star Wars book I have ever read. The others are pretty good. And not only that the auther took 2/3 of the book till there was really any thing good happening."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Greatest Star Wars Books ever","review":"R.A. Salvatore is my favorite author and to see him writing in one of the most beloved franchises ever is already amazing in itself. Yet he goes out of his way to keep fans reading. Yes, some people may complain about the death of Chewbacca. However i prefer to see Chewie dit to save his best friends son than to watch him die in of old age. A character like Chewie needed to die a heroe and thats what salvatore did. He gave Chewbacca the perfect burial. Besides, i don't Chewie would have had any regrets. Overall, this is and amazing book which should be praised for its risk-taking."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Great read! You'll love it!\\"","review":"\\" This book was very well written. Let me just say it's not for everyone. There are some pretty shocking events that take place. All in all this book was very entertaining. I'm only 16 and I have read every book in the Star Wars series, so I will read any Star Wars novel, but this one will appeal to both Star Wars fans and newcomers to the amazing world of the Star Wars novels. This is the first book I have read by R.A. Salvatore and he really knows how to put a story together. I really enjoyed his work. I believe this book will be a milestone in the whole series. Read it to see why. I HIGHLY recomend this book. (Be prepared for a BIG shocker!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for any true fan of the original trilogy","review":"The book was an incredible read. It became one of those books you literaly can't put down as I read it in one day. The new enemy is very well thought out along with the technology they use. Without giving away any of the plot, something that was bound to happen finally does, which makes this book a must read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did Salvatore fish this out of a dumpster?","review":"This was without a doubt, THE WORST book I have ever read!The author had NO feel for the characters, NO familiarity in the SW genre, and frankly NO writing style.You killed Chewie. How dare you just waltz into a genre that you don't belong in and kill off one of the best characters?And what is with the Vong? Did he even READ anything about the nature of the Force? Life creates the Force. The Vong shouldn't be invisible on in, if anything they should RADIATE the Force since everything they have is biological in nature.Ugh, this was just so terrible, I had to FORCE myself to finish reading it.Do yourself a favor and pass this one by."},{"rating":"1","title":"what have they done?","review":"like the phantom menace movie, this is one of those star wars episodes i wish they could just take back. while many of the events that take place in the book are meaningful for the series as a whole, the writing is flawed, the delivery poor. mara suffers especially as a character (altho this is in no measure exclusive to this book), as does her relationship with luke. the storyline itself, while introducing the newest and greatest threat to the new republic, is not in itself significant except for the death of a principle character. the depiction of the Yuuzhan Vong also lacks depth. after the amazing hand of thrawn duology, this book the biggest disappointment of the written series. unfortunately, i can't recommend skipping it, for it has enough information to merit reading if you i intend to continue reading the new series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not because of the Wookie!","review":"Vector Prime is my 5th book to read in the Star Wars expanded universe, and I gotta say this book isn't worth anyone's time. Its not the fact that Chewbacca dies, but the fact that the sotry doesn't really go anywhere at all. You think its getting better, and then the plot goes down hill from there. After you've read this one, you feel as if Star Wars has stooped to an all time low, but I hear the next one's by a new author, so don't dispair."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"This novel disappointed me for several reasons:1) the way the New Republic defeats the Praetorite Vong by freezing their underwater base makes no sense. By that I mean that it's a violation of physics laws. No big deal maybe, since a lot of physical laws are already mistreated by the Star Wars universe, but still: the idea is absurd.2) it's dark. I personally find it too dark for a Star Wars novel. The good-spirited Star Wars movies seem to me very different from the dark tone of this novel.3) some details make no sense: how can the Solo kids be Jedi knights at their young age? Is killing a lot of enemies with a lightsaber and displaying acrobatic skills in starfighter piloting the only skills required to be a Jedi knight?4) it's poorly written. Sorry, maybe I'm asking for too much, but compared to other Star Wars novels, I find both the style and the vocabulary poor.Overall I would not recommend this novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good book, but Salvatore did the unthinkable","review":"I liked this book. I really did. But I'm stopping reading this as of right now. I cannot believe that Lucas Books gave Salvatore permission to do what he did. Killing one of the most lovable characters, Chewbacca, was downright despicable. I hope that you're reading this, Star Wars fans, because I sincerely hope that I'm not the only one with these same thoughts. Salvatore,you do not deserve to write."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't Feel Like Star Wars","review":"The Yuuzhan Vong come off to me as a Drow Priestess combined with two Star Trek races: \\"The Borg\\" and their biological enemies from fluidic space. Basically a human shaped fanatical sado-maschochistic relentless soldier race who aren't too smart and use engineered organisms as their tools. They work to forcefully assimilate the rest of the universe into obedient organic-technology.This new story arc introduces collectivist ideology, but at the price of losing the mystique of the Star Wars universe.Vector Prime reminded me of fan fiction. No narrative drive, no character depth, and too many viewpoints (Luke, Jacen, Mara, Leia, Jaina, Han Solo, C9PIO, Chewie, Daniela Quinn, Anakin II, Yuuzan Vong bad guys #1 and #2 etc...).The fights scenes were the high points of this flat pulp fiction book, but not even the major character death could emotionally reach me. It just didn't feel like Star Wars."},{"rating":"1","title":"What in the world is this?","review":"How does a race kill everyone with the living? Very few fights involving the true passion of the jedi. Killing of main characters doesn't make you a great writer either. In my eyes, Timothy Zahn will always be the true master author of the Star Wars Universe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Failure to Star Wars Universe","review":"I have been a great fan of Star Wars for many years, and have enjoyed all the books, up till this one. Timothy Zahn's Vision of the future was such a great book, and the plot between Mara and Luke was so interesting, I thought, hey, this is a great opportunity to learn more about these characters. But I was so disappointed. The feelings between the two were so shallow and non-existent, and it was rather dull. The other characters were also potrayed badly, in a way that was actually unbelievable. The plot of the story was confusing and long and draggy, with very little advancements. The killing of Chewbacca seemed rather silly with no point other than to shock the readers. The emotions of the other characters surrounding the death were questionable. The ending was inconclusive and left off rather abruptly. In general, this book didn't live up to the standard of the other Star Wars books, and do not advise you to read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOTALLY DISAPPOINTING","review":"Salvatore really did a good job of messing everybody up. And why the heck did Chewie have to die? I mean, come on! This was probably one of the worst Star Wars books i have ever read! Oh well........ At least Stackpole's written the new book. He's at least better than Salvatore. GOD! THe plot was messed, though I rather enjoyed the Yuuhan VOng, cuz they're completely resistent to the FORCE!Also, Mara Jade, Han Solo, all of them were messed up! DON'T BOTHER EVEN READINGTHISBOOK! I reccommend all of the Timothy Zahn books, especially his Hand of Thrawn Duology."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing to say the least","review":"I bought this book back in 1999 when it was first released and I barely got 100 pages into it before giving up. I just didn't like the book and as a result I never really got into the New Jedi Order series. Recently I decided to give the book, and the series, another try. This time I did manage to finish the book, but didn't like it any better. It took me three days to get through the last 80 or so pages. The Solo children are portrayed like spoiled children who are in desperate need of discipline. Han, Leia and Luke have become boring old people, even though they are supposed to be only in their 40's and 50's. Plus the battle scenes could put you to sleep. I'm not sure if it was Mr. Salvatore's writing or the storyline that I didn't like. I'll have to read a couple of the other books in the series before I make my final judgement on the series, but I sure do hope they are better than the first installment."},{"rating":"2","title":"In response to my previous review...","review":"I would like to say that I have now read the book. Yes, it is sad that someone dies, but star wars was overdue. You can't expect everyone to survive every battle they ever face. It kinda angers me that people arn't more realistic. Sure, it's fiction, but there needs to be some sense of realism. Even disney movies have main characters die some times. That is sad when a childrens company has death more then something for older people. As for the content of the book, I say bout time the empire isn't involved. When you are reading these reviews, don't listen to them about it being a bad book. Read it for yourself. Most of the fools are just mad because someone got the axe, or the planet as the case may be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vector Prime","review":"Of all of the Star Wars novels I have read, I must admit that this work by RA Salvatore was the most riveting and emotional of all of them. The author takes you through a rollercoaster ride of excitement to battle to profound saddness. At one point, I had to put the book down and remind myself that this is in fact just a novel. Truly this is a work that no Star Wars loving fan should miss"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing read","review":"To me the only thing that saved this book was the major event that should have happened long ago but didn't, won't go into details for those who haven't read it yet. The characters were two dimensional lacking personality and the Solo twins played to large of a role for me to stomach. I'm a major fan of the X-wing series so the lack of Wedge cost this book a two star rating and the thought of Jaina replacing him as the primary X-wing pilot in the SW series is a frightening one. The book even goes as far to potray Han and Chewie as a pair of bumbling idiots in a cockpit. That was a major insult to their characters and to us the readers that have known them since they first found their way to the screen. Basically this book has limited value, you get to know the new villians and you get the long delayed event that is one of the books few bright points. Other than that it was a hugh disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Might as well wing it....or ...there's no there, there....","review":"If you were looking for a travel book that told you as little as possible about what you were visiting and ignored significant sites in the cities it covered, then this book is for you.

The next time, it tore straight off.I can't recommend this to anyone except as a practical joke."},{"rating":"2","title":"Functional","review":"We have a shallow appt kitchen sink so I chose this one after reading a bunch of reviews on similar products.

Just wish it would spray a wider radius but works good enough for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"works as advertised, but loud","review":"I'm quite happy with the product, for its advertised function. No leaking, seems like relatively durable construction. I've had it for about 6 months now, but I can't stand how loud it is any longer. I know that all aerators will create some noise, but I find myself turning up the television because I cant hear anything if someone is using the water. In all fairness, this could be mostly due to the acoustics in my kitchen, but just take this into consideration. (note- its not pipes/faucet creating the noise because its silent without an aerator and while its in spray mode)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for me","review":"I've tried the E*ro*et product several times and they all broke quickly (except for the white one which I have in my bathroom - that one is great and I don't know why they discontinued that design it is much better than the black). So I decided to try this one, which is perfect if you, like me, have a shallow kitchen sink and/or don't need a double jointed aerator. I like the fact it automatically reverts back to stream mode but understand that some people don't. This is compact, attractive, easy to install and so far has held up well.

A wonderful, delightful story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't Put It Down!","review":"I discovered \\"The Eight\\" a long time ago, and thought it was one of the best books that I had ever read. I also enjoyed \\"A Calculated Risk\\", even though the format was very different. After searching bookshops for years in the vain hope that Katherine Neville had written another book, I was so excited to discover \\"The Magic Circle\\", and read it in a weekend! As with all her books, Ms Neville has painstakingly researched her characters and history to create a complex, thrilling and credible yarn, and I can hardly wait for her next novel (I'm already back haunting the bookshops!). I find it necessary to read her books more than once in order to really appreciate the twists and turns and subtle and not-so-subtle nuances, and I will definitely have to draw out on paper Ariel Behn's family tree!"},{"rating":"1","title":"pretentious nonsense","review":"Why does this Neville woman think that just some historicalname dropping and multinational myths collage put together make a bookworth its salt? (By the way, the only bit I liked was the one with her musings about salt)...I hold no doubts about her making her homework, but reading history does not guarantee that you'll be able to write a novel afterwards, and the plot of this one is just not there. The story is supposed to be a thriller, and it just doesn't work. The Behn family affairs were so unbelievable that they became boring halfway the book. Considering the success of it, it makes me think that the fans of this book have something in common with the people who gather in front of the Dorothy Chandler Pavillion to see the stars arrive: look, there is Hitler! Nero came too!...Pathetic."},{"rating":"1","title":"endless piffle","review":"pee yew! This one is a stinker. I realize you must suspend belief when reading fiction. But for 550 never ending pages? Give this one a miss. Read The Eight instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely forgettable","review":"I found this book on my bookshelf and thought - hmm, must have missed this one. I read the synopsis, was immediately drawn in, and wondered why it had taken me so long to get around to reading it. So I started reading. Things seemed somewhat familiar. I thought that maybe I had started this once upon a time and for whatever reason wasn't able to finish. I read on. 300 pages, 350 pages - geez is this deja vu or what?! It seriously took me around 400 pages to realize I had in fact already read the whole book! I NEVER forget plots or stories! Never say never. So I had to finish it after putting in all the hard yards - what a convoluted and verbose piece of rubbish! It's so completely far-fetched. If Katherine Neville ever read a history book it was about as memorable to her as The Magic Circle was to me the first time around. So if you haven't read this - don't bother and if you can't remember, best to leave it forgotten."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deeply Unsatisfying","review":"I am shocked that this book has an overall 4 star rating (currently) .. I almost feel that this is some kind of conspiracy. Honestly, it is the worst book I've read in a while. Like most, I agree this book begins with promise and tantalizes us with myth, far away cultures, and ancient history. You stay with each new pile of information, story twist, and genealogical relevation as you trust the author has put it there for some reason. But, it builds and builds, builds and builds, builds and builds, builds and builds ...... You get the idea. She makes you work hard to stay with her through this wild goose chase and then she slaps on a deeply unsatisfying ending. Ironically, I think the book is generally well-paced and well-written with the fingers-on-chalkboard exceptions of romantic interludes, which read like harlequin novels. I understand her other novels are much better though I'm now hesitant to give them a go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another good story by Katherine Neville","review":"I was surprised to see how poorly The Magic Circle was rated. I thoroughly enjoyed the way the family is \\"roasted\\" by one of its members. More important is the belivable imagination used to recreate some history, and the interpretation of \\"real\\" history and of religion. Is the \\"Song of Songs\\" written in code? If so, who has the code breaker? As many of history's figures are presented from one side, it is refreshing to see how other sides can be imagined. I hope Ms. Neville continues to create her narrow, twisting plots, just like the narrow, twisting road between Swan Valley and Jackson."},{"rating":"1","title":"I have a far better book for you:","review":"I'm sorry, but this mishmash of confusion just doesn't make it. If you want a truly thrilling and suspenseful read, let me suggest the most intriguing \\"millennium\\" novel of them all, Glenn Kleier's \\"The Last Day.\\" It is, without question, a story that will keep you on the edge of your chair till the wee hours of the morning. I honestly couldn't put it down. Exciting and outrageous, with more \\"Magic\\" in one page than \\"Circle\\" has in 550."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious","review":"I think the editor fell asleep at the wheel for this one.

But this was the first of her books that I tried. WOW, were they right. The plot is wonderfully intriguing. And I was fascinated by the author's ability to link together some of history's most interesting characters. Definitely, a great book to take on an airplane or a vacation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing and Disappointing","review":"I found this book confusing and disappointing. Characters are either too defined or ill defined. I thought the author went beyond licence and into arrogance in describing Joseph and Hitler. I found it creepy that she kept refering to Hitler as \\"Lucky\\". The ending was too pat and did not provide an ending worthy of the very extensive research she put into it. The ending is very weak. Loved her first book but did not find this book anywhere near as satisfying. I would hesitate to buy another."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Much Work to Read -- Too Little Payoff in the End","review":"This book takes the reader on trips through time, history, mythology, you name it. Before long the reader is thoroughly mixed up on who is whom, what happened when, and why it all matters. The Eight was a terrific read. This book is a total disappointment. Any book that makes the reader work this hard to figure out what is going on should pay the reader for the effort not the reader pay the author for the annoyance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun With Nuclear Energy","review":"Katherine Neville is my favorite author for one important reason. Because she deals with hot topics like oil, international finance, and nuclear waste, and she is able to make her stories upbeat, even FUNNY! She tackles hard problems and makes us see the bright side. Though there are those who seem to want to convince us otherwise, I find her books entertaining and inspiring."},{"rating":"1","title":"I felt ripped off!","review":"I usually like books that force me to keep track of lots of characters, ideas, etc. -- I like the challenge of staying on top of it all. But this got to a point where, towards the end, when she would go off on some historical tangent, I would just skim it because I was losing hope that it was really going anywhere. I finished it only because I thought there was going to be some revealation at the end that would make it all worth it. I was so disappointed! I think she just crammed the book full of every historical fact, myth and legend she'd ever heard of."},{"rating":"2","title":"I re-read The Magic Circle and enjoyed it even more!!","review":"If one is interested in history, cycles of nature, heterogenity and finding out all about the world's myths and legends than The Magic Circle will take you on a ride you will never forget. This novel is not just a meal - it is a full course dinner with brandy in the library after. The characters comprise a salon of original, diverse and stimulating people. I now feel as though I know them even better. I hope Neville will grace us with more about Ariel and herglobal family in future novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"DIDN'T ENJOY THIS...NOT ENTERTAINING","review":"I don't know what all the excitement is about this book.

For me, this was not a pleasant experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's my kitchen sink?","review":"Oh, Katherine Neville took it and put it in her book -- She thought it was missing something! It seems like every thought or idea or bit of information Neville ever came across in her entire life is crammed into this book! I'm a careful reader, but I couldn't keep it straight by the end. Was it really possible that the main character turned out to be related to absolutely EVERYONE else in the book? Am I related to her?"},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY HARD TO FOLLOW","review":"This was a very difficult book to read and understand. The events seemed so bizarre and twisted that it became harder and harder to follow with each chapter.

What was magical about the entire book?"},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS BOOK WAS WAY OVER MY HEAD","review":"Maybe others found this book magical, but I just couldn't understand all the nuances in the plot and the twists and turns of it.

I live in Utah, and thought it quite amazing that she incorporated Salt Lake City into the book.

It was so fascinating and enjoyable that I'm now reading The Magic Circle. I recommended her books to a friend and she's now also reading The Magic Circle. Both my friend and I were wondering how much research she does for each book, ie how much is true and how much is fiction. I realize the story is fiction but she always includes what appears to be historical data, which makes the story really come alive. I love her wonderful books!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank you Ms Neville for writing such an intriguing book!","review":"I first heard about Ms. Neville's a short time ago...i happen to work in a bookstore...i noticed one of her books on the shelf and that peeked my curiosity....finally i began reading The Magic Circle....i got up to around page 410 in the paperback...I can't read it fast enough!...usually i can read at a faster pace but something in the book slows me down....it may be partly because of all of the details...but my usual favorite reading is Charles Dickens...I'd like to thank Ms. Nevillle for writing such an intriguing book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Questionalble history, Mysticism, and Incest","review":"If you like questionable historical fiction barely based in reality, incest, and mysticism all wrapped together in a long tedious narrative ending with a cliche then this is the book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite a below-average entertainment","review":"This book was quite below average for entertainment. I don't think even properly prepared readers will find things to appreciate and treasure in the novel. The writing isn't particularly noteworth, and the plot and storyline are absolutely ridiculous and unbelieveable. The characters aren't very interesting either, and the complicated, incestuous web that's woven and thrown out to the readers is detrimental to the entire story. Romantic moments are purely juvenile and read like some teenage romance. What a waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overly contrived and relationships bordering on absurd.","review":"This book was a great disappointment. In an efforts to weave history and the occult the author takes such great liberties with established fact and stretches the occult aspects beyond credulity. Attempting to join Solomon, Jesus, Roman Emperors Tiberius through Nero, and Hitler, in the creation and search for mystical objects of power makes for a disjointed and unbelievable \\"plot\\". The author's efforts at being complex in the personal family relationships of the main characters went beyond interesting or challenging to a pointless exercise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most people will not enjoy this book","review":"The premise and overall theme of the book is facinating and should attract you, but the execution--the way this is brought about in the book--is so poor, I can't think of many redeeming qualities in the book. The plot convolutions are unnecessarily complicated and at the end, the reader is left with a frustrated feeling. Carrying about 2 different timelines isn't the problem--I've read other books, and even the author's previous books manage to do this quite well, but I get the feeling Neville really didn't work this one through enough and the publisher was very negligent in not pointing this out to her."},{"rating":"1","title":"An utter waste","review":"This books wants to be a top-notch historical thriller on the same level as \\"The Eight,\\" but it ends up being just a bad soap opera. The story is convoluted, some of the history is garbled and wrong, and not even Neville's way with words can disguise how awful the book is. If you must read one of her books, and everyone should, stick to The Eight or *maybe* A Calculated Risk.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self-Indulgent Tripe","review":"Literary hubris at it's very core.

It's fun and stimulating (\\"Escape into History\\" ?) Looking forward to her next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterly job of research","review":"I have read Katherine Neville's three books and enjoyed them thoroughly. They are wonderful novels. It is clear that she has done a masterly job of research and is deeply interested in the human search for knowledge."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dig and ye shall find","review":"While reading The Magic Circle I was reminded that Neville's writings are a virtual metaphor for an excavation site. We dig thru layers of history, she writes thru layers of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like a rope fraying apart","review":"This book starts out with some interesting action and a good number of interesting characters. It captures your attention when it starts bringing in historical characters in thought provoking settings and circumstances. But although you expect all of the separate threads to come together into a single story line, they don't. There's no satisfactory resolution to the events and people spread over millenia. Maybe I'm missing something, but this just seemed to be a tangled, fraying mess of a story. And I still haven't quite gotten over the main character falling madly and passionately in love with her cousin. Yuck."},{"rating":"1","title":"A circle never ends","review":"I very much enjoyed this author's first novel, The Eight. With anticipation I picked up a copy of this one and found: the plot is almost non-existent, and long diatribes of Aryan-related metaphysical mumbo-jumbo stand in for it. The main character is by turns hideously stupid and smugly smart; the 'big surprise' is in fact neither very big nor terribly surprising. The title seems to herald a basic fact about the plot and about the way the story is told: one continues to run around in circles around the focal 'mystery', and never penetrates it.I'd strongly recommend her first novel instead. This one? Check it out from the library some day when you're completely without reading material. Buy it used.But don't spend your money on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time and money.","review":"Like many others who have commented, I had expected another intriguing and exciting book, similar to The Eight. I was sadly disappointed and can't believe I actually read the entire book. The cast of characters are without substance, the myriad myths and legends came across as many loose ends and the family tree - forget it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant, but almost too complicated to read","review":"The Magic Circle is absolutely brilliant in its connections between history, mythology, multi-cultural religion and the exciting plot. Full appreciation of this book requires knowledge more diverse than most of us can claim (myself included), and the many story lines are almost impossible to follow. The Magic Circle is like a beautifully written sentence that has just so many words that you don't know what it said when you get to the end. But don't give up on Katherine Neville! Go back to The Eight. It's the best book I ever read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING!","review":"What a waste of money... At the end I was angry and absolutely tired of all those boring relationships and strange members of Ariels family. The beginning was rather interesting but then... actually I would get my money back from Mrs. Neville for such boring nonsense..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I love \\"The Eight,\\" and \\"Calculated Risk\\" is good, too. But I was sorely disappointed with \\"The Magic Circle.\\" The language was just plain corny and the ending was wretched! I was intrigued enough by the story to read the whole book, but I found it sadly predictable. I may be a little harsh in rating this book a \\"1,\\" but there ya have it. If this is your first Neville read, and you liked it, check out \\"The Eight.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book I've read","review":"I picked up this book in the airport a year or so ago and finally got to it. Hoped to have a relaxing day reading in the rain. This book was a COMPLETE MESS. The main quirky character is likeable enough. The poorly transitioning history lesson inserts along with the character's crazy geneaology were so overwhelming and confusing that I had a migraine by the end of the day. I didn't even understand the point of anything going with the time jumping most of the time. All way too far-fetched. I rarely toss a book before finishing, but this is one I wish I'd just tossed in the trash. I'd really like to ask the author what the heck she was thinking!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It was almost good","review":"Neville missed the mark on this one. As a fan of The Eight and Calculated Risk, I expected her pattern of weaving in and out of history, mysticism, and adventure. Somehow, in this one, I got lost. Underneath all the layers she hints at a fascinating story that intrigues and wets the appetite. I found myself becoming more and more frustrated as the real meat of the story was set aside without enough follow through in favor of piecemeal action that felt shallow and directionless"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing....","review":"I thought that I will love this book as I loved the Eight but I was in a mistake. This book is so difficult and to boring in some parts that I tried to re read many pages of some chapters to make sense to me the story.I don't reccomend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"disjointed and chaotic","review":"I picked up this book because I had loved Neville's 'The Eight' so much. Sheesh, I wish I had not bothered. What a silly mishmash of loose ends that never get tied together. You keep *thinking* it's going to all come together in the end somehow, but it never does. A complete waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Profound and Funny!","review":"The Magic Circle is completely unique. Thanks to Ms Neville for bringing us in touch with our history, our past. It also takes quite a lot of talent to bring humor to the most serious subjects mankind can think of. One of the most profound books I have read. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"The plot is too contorted and complicated.","review":"The history in the book is not accurate. The family relations are so involved and complex that to follow them one would need to keep a family tree. The story goes through three time periods which is not necessary for the story. In the end the book has nothing to say except that we need to live lightly on the earth and not destroy it. I have read many new age books that have the same message with a more interesting story that is easier to follow. I don't recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT BOOK! TROGLODYTES BEWARE!!","review":"Am I glad I read this book BEFORE I read those other(negative)reviews! And since some reviewers seem to have set themselves up as the Thought Patrol, trying to prevent people from reading it - I thought I should go on record as agreeing with the positive reviews, which would seem to suggest that Magic Circle is a book that will appeal to readers who are independent thinkers, readers who want to look at things in a new way, learn something new while enjoying a fun-filled spin through history. This is a terrific, absolutely smashing, page-turner of a book. Even a great book. But it is definitely NOT recommended for intellectual Troglodytes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breaking through the cliches about evil","review":"This book is a good mystery novel. It also makes you reexamine your ideas about evil. Particularly in the context of the first- and twentieth- century experiences of genocide. Evil, like the incest in this book, is not what it seems. You can't excape dealing with it on a personal level of conscience. And there is no comfort in the appearance of success, either. I look forward to the sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loved The Eight, did not like this...","review":"I do enjoy an intellectual read, but what bothered me most about this book was its lack of unity. Unlike The Eight, The Magic Circle is by no means tightly woven or coherent. I was greatly disappointed by this book in the wake of The Eight."},{"rating":"2","title":"An intelligent, thought provoking and compulsive read.","review":"This book is one of the few I will read over and over again, because of the many layers it has. And also because it made my heart beat faster, as if I were on the verge of a great discovery. Each layer tells its own story and gives you something to think about.(It certainly made me think)And so it makes the total more than the sum of its layers. Absolutely great reading! This book is not about incestuous relationships, it is certainly not silly, it is not confusing and it is certainly believable because the characters are well rounded and consistent in their actions. By being able to write such a complex story, the writer will (alas) attract the jealousy and the spite of less gifted writers or readers who are simply not intelligent enough to comprehend the scope of this work."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT!","review":"I absolutely love reading Neville's books. I learn a lot and think she is an inspiring writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"an intriguing concept..","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The concept is intriguing....and the way she wove in history, myth, and religion clearly shows that she did her homework and left me in awe. I do agree that the ending was a bit of a letdown....after the pace and mind-boggling twists of the book I expected more fireworks....but overall I enjoyed the mystical undertones of the book and the way it made me stop and recall the actual historical facts as I tried to figure out how she came up with this concept! I recommend this book to anyone and have done so already with my friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"Listen to all the other people that said this was a not worth your time. The Eight was a wonderful book. This one though was interesting only at times and more often tedious and confusing. If you can't find anything better to read between your favorite author's new releases, pick this up. Otherwise find something else to spend your time reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chaotic, hard to follow and just plain boring","review":"After reading The Eight, I looked forward greatly to this novel. What a disappointment! The story was disjointed, mostly uninteresting, the characters unappealing - I put it down midway through and never felt the desire to pick it up again! In thinking about why I was so unsatisfied, I think The Eight had a great balance of history, the supernatural, and some very interesting characters following a complex, but fascinating storyline. This book has none of those - don't waste your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reading for pleasure","review":"For me, reading is for pleasure and I had a very enjoyable seven hours reading this book. While it was not up to the standard of \\"The Eight\\" (a book I found to be an exceptional read), I enjoyed every minute of this book. Having a fairly good knowledge of ancient history I was interested to see how Katherine Neville linked the past with the present day (late 80s). I will certainly be on the look out for her next book. If you read these reviews, Miss Neville - thank you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing.","review":"It could have been great. What happened Katherine? It is sad that the highlight of the novel was Jersey's fall into the grave. \\"I was startled by those damned guns going off in my ear.\\" Would that everyone else had done likewise."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT A STRANGE, BIZARRE BOOK","review":"The book seemed to be an endless stream of predictable \\"surprises\\" mixed with a horribly confusing set of character relationships. Complicated family trees of the main character definitely detracted from appreciating any other fine points in the book. The romance in the book was also lost in the twists and turns of the plot. No real surprises or situations that left me wondering...instead, I found all too familiar twists and predictable ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"TORTURES THE READER","review":"I didn't find anything rewarding in this book. The whole plot was so confusing and tiring that it was too hard for me to understand. Re-reading sections over and over never worked either. I think the plot has too many holes in it to be convincing or enjoyable. The way the different historical figures are linked together could have been interesting but instead, I was too confused to enjoy many moments in the book. I don't know if the other books by the author are similar; if they are, it will be hard to enjoy them."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Magic Circle","review":"This book was a mess. At first I thought that it was going to be interesting and suspensful, but I was wrong. The main plot line of the story is good, but the background and historical chapters are confusing and totally distracting. I love books of this nature and this was a total disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOO MUCH!!!","review":"I have read \\"The Eight\\" and I was expecting a thriller or a book that I wouldn't be able to put down. This book was very hard to read. Too many characters, I couldn't keep straight who was who!Too much narrative of historical facts mixed with myths, legends, conjecture, preaching...HELP... I was LOST! I kept thinking the story would get better and was thouroughly disappointed! Not worth your time to read. Like other reviews this story was hard to swallow. And her love affair with the handsome Wolfgang was TOOOO Much! A good word for this book: CHAOS! If you want to read it, I'll gladly give you my book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A confusing mess","review":"Poor history. Poor science. Poor theology.

So when I got \\"The Magic Circle\\" I was so excited--for about five minutes! This book was a complete waste of time--and I did finish it, though it was a job not a joy. The past was too detailed and confusing, the historical characters did not keep my interest like the ones in \\"The Eight\\"-I kept skimming over these areas to get back to the present. This side of the story was better."},{"rating":"2","title":"On the edge of my seat","review":"I loved this book. Kept me on the edge of my seat (good thing too, I was reading it on a transatlantic flight :-). Best part, once in Europe I looked for it in the local language to give it as a gift to my friends. It turns out, the salesperson at the bookstore was equally passionate about it. She, too, loved it. We spend quite some time talking about the book and pretty soon we had an audience surrounding us. I hardly managed to get a copy, as every person around us rushed to buy it!Moral to the story? Secure your copy before praising this book in front of audience! :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Neville's books surpass DaVinci Code","review":"Katherine Neville is a truly gifted writer. Her books are well researched, paced to keep you turning the pages, and are definitely more \\"literate\\" than the offerings of most authors in this genre.

It's amazing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Contorted, Unbelievable Tale","review":"What a waste of time reading this mish-mash of historical and pseudo-historical facts was for me. I began reading it with great anticipation, but my hopes were soon dashed in the complicated morass of the plot. It was nearly impossible for me to keep track of all the characters and all the unbelievable turns of events. I'm glad that I bought my copy at a library book sale for 30 cents. I liked Ms Neville's previous book, The Eight, much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this one","review":"Katherine Neville's other two books are loads of fun - The Eight is a fantastic book, and A Calculated Risk is really entertaining, even if it doesn't hold together as well. But I was really disappointed with this book. The plot falls apart early in the book, and it goes downhill from there. I didn't care at all about the characters, and the whole book feels like the author is simply trying too hard. Read Neville's other two books and stop there."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is absolutely worth reading","review":"There have been few books I've read that are this interesting and involving. Its a must for anyone who wants to sit down and get caught up in a wonderful tale."},{"rating":"1","title":"ONE WORD -- BORING","review":"This book seems like a colossal tease. The entire premise is one big bore and each chapter takes you through a mindless mess of confusion. What was the point of it all? It sure escapes me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does Katherine Neville have any new ideas?","review":"This book was a sore disappointment compared with her last twonovels. There was no stable plot, it just went everywhere withoutaccomplishing anything. The family background was so complicated you wanted to write it down as you went to keep track. She seems to think that jumping back and forth between history and present is her winning formula, which is too bad, I'd like to see her come up with another approach. Neville has so much promise, but this book lacked the magic that was in The Eight and A Calculated Risk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the effort to unravel","review":"There's a Big Secret, hidden from the primordial past!

The synopsis got me even more excited - then I started reading...It just went on forever with yet another member of the heroine's improbably family changing characterizations -first they're a bad guy - no, now a good guy - no, you were right the first time. Also, the historical references were ridiculous and never tied in satisfactorily with what was happening in the present day. This makes me very sad because I know this author can do so much better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is terrible!","review":"I hated this book as much as I loved \\"The Eight.\\" I felt that the author was more interested in showing off her vast knowledge and extensive research than in telling a good story. The \\"tales\\" in her book did little to advance the story line, and there wasn't much to the story line to begin with. The relationships between the family members was confusing and difficult to keep straight. If you haven't read \\"The Eight,\\" find a copy of that and skip this one altogether. I wish I had."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Confusing!!!","review":"As much as I enjoyed reading this authors' \\"The Eight\\", I looked forward to reading \\"The Magic Circle\\". But this new book gave me a headache and it is not fun to read. Most of the book was spent trying to connect the unconnectables of mythology, religion and history. Very drawn out for a work of fiction, and much too complex. Next time, KISS (keep it simple for us stupids!)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"Some time ago I read The Eight from this writer and really liked it. The argument was very attractive, with that mix of intrigue and historical facts and places. It was a book with a story so compelling that I could hardly stop reading until finished. So, when I got to know about this title The Magic Circle I bought it inmediatly and was really eager to read it. And it was a big disappointment. The text is so confusing with all those family relationships who no one can believe are true and the historical facts are so innumerable and thrown to the reader with almost no care, order or reason to be there that I could barely finish reading it. The ending is very bad constructed also, giving no reward to the reader who makes de effort to pass the many pages this book has. Really annoying and complex to the absurd, hardly believable story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ah...an adventure novel a feminist can love","review":"I must be the only one who's read this book without having first read Neville's first novel, The Eight. I thoroughly enjoyed this book, and for reasons perhaps different from some other readers. It was the first book I've read in a long time that combined history, intellectual pursuit, spirituality, action, intrigue and sex in a context totally without violence or domination. Even the final conclusion is respectful and feminist, which may disappoint some readers who are hoping for a \\"slam-bang\\" payoff. Certainly there is much in the 550 pages, and I found the going much more enjoyable if I just didn't pay attention to the latest permutation of the Behn family and instead concentrated on the larger issues: what were they really questing for? What are the connections between different time periods and cultures involved? I am eagerly looking forward to reading The Eight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible adventure!","review":"You won't be able to drop this book once you've started reading it, so I recommend to start on a Friday night!

Pure enjoyment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be prepared to RE-READ many pages to understand the book...","review":"Never have I read a book that must be read twice before I even finish the book. I tried to keep all the details straight by completely understanding all the side stories, but in the end... it didn't matter since she did not close the \\"Magic Circle\\" properly. I logged onto Amazon.com to see if anybody else was as disappointed and frustrated as me.Ms. Neville is very creative and inspirational in some areas, but outlandish in other ways such as Ariel's family lineage - how much incest can a family have and keep the secrets so well kept?The Eight is one of my favorite books, so I look forward to a better book in the future from Ms. Neville. Next time, I think I'll check the reviews first."},{"rating":"1","title":"I have no idea why I kept reading this book to the end.","review":"Generally I love this kind of book. Maybe that is why I kept going. When I arrived at the LONG awaited end I was sorely disappointed. The book has far to many characters, and they never really gel into a complete theme or plot. When I finished I still did not have a clue what it was all about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible read","review":"I read Neville's international bestseller The Eight a few years ago, and when she came out with the sequel (The Fire), I picked that up too. So when this came out, I gave her one last shot and picked it up as well.Straight up: The Fire and The Magic Circle are terrible.Neville is a one hit wonder, The Fire eventually turns into a love story that ignores all of the premises set in The Eight.The Magic Circle turns into an alternate history book with Neville's own numerology and gematria beliefs added. This book is incredibly difficult to read, not because of the history, but because there's very little plot in the actual story."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Taut Thriller, with a heroine","review":"I got this book through Bookcrossing.com and it sounded interesting. When I began reading it, I found myself engrossed in a tale that deftly combined the past & the present, New Age, New World and Old World, Christianity and paganism, pretty much all things that you wwould not think could go together.Now that I have read Dan Brown's work, I can see similarities between Angels & Demons, for example, and The Magic Circle. If you liked DaVinci Code, Angels & Demons or Deception Point, you will like The Magic Circle. Read it and share it with someone today!"},{"rating":"2","title":"History, Mystery, Magic","review":"I once read a review of Neville's writing that started that way. I've been on a joyous roller coaster ride ever since. Don't believe a word of it when people say she writes with a formula. No other author writing today is as unpredictable as Ms Neville. No one could possibly guess the endings of her works. There are surprises on every page. And for those of you who love history the way I do, this book is the most highly recommended and historically accurate of the three."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is lousy","review":"This is the worst book I've ever read, very boring and dumb.

I like swords, just owning one was never a priority to me. I got an offer for free $30 bucks to use on amazon so I decided to get this. I like that it is shorter than a lot of the blades I see in various stores. The shorter length does add some usability vs a traditional katana or something like that.It looks cool... I don't plan on taking on a group of ninjas anytime soon so that was the only criteria I used while shopping. Looks, and price.The thing I don't get is how you are suppose to do the straps. There is no picture or instructions of any kind. There is a long strap that seems you are suppose to thread through the sheath long ways, and no clue what to do with the short strap.I don't ever plan to wear it so that was not a big deal to me.

Overall im disappointed in this sword I was expecting better but for $20 I cant be helped."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting little blade for the price","review":"Nice lines for a shank ninja sword. Works well for rugged use in clearing brush. Not for combat or extreme applications. Cord wrapped handle will come apart after a moderate amount of heavy use.

There's a LOT of information about SNMP and MIB's. But it's approach to fault management is primarly on tools, and the tools described are out of date or even some of those companies no longer exists (like platinum, bought by CA); the scripts provided are somehow simple; the database fault management techniques described are very, very generic and basic.

I just wish that all of the spoken text, and music could all be together somewhere.

Maybe some day the two will be printed together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Generous and Wonderful","review":"Being one who always wanted to audition using the Witch's song or the Baker's Wife's song, I am delighted and grateful to Sondheim and Co. for putting out this amazing vocal score. The effort to do so must have been incredible. My only wish, not complaint, is that the chords were also represented by \\"C\\" or \\"Dmaj7\\" so that I could play along as I sing. I can read music, but if I have to play piano chords by sight only, it takes me days to finger it one note at a time. Well, that's probably my fault - practice, practice, practice!

Put some wb40 on it try to get it back out.. 15 minutes later it comes out after pulling it like i was trying to hold onto someone hovering over a fire pit. Put a ton of wb40 on it.. lets just do this simple step on more time.. surely it will work.Nope. Stuck again. I then promptly cursed for about 30 minutes staring at it and now I'm going to see how I can return it or just talk Pheonix's ear off until they somehow help me.Don't buy this product.

It is NOT, however, a treadmill for running or for someone with balance issues. Assembly is VERY easy, and with the easy-up feature for the belt base, it stores nicely.

The frame is too small and rickety for such use (the hanging on for dear life part).If it was smoother, the work out WOULD be worth it since its naturally on an incline and it makes you work it. But, its not worth risking your safety over. Just buy a power driven model so you don't have to wonder if you're going to trip and break a leg.Its so dangerous that I refused to give it away.

Cheaply made connections on the electronic portion spoil what is an otherwise useful treadmill. So, don't pay extra for the model with the electronic pedometer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't believe Denise Austin lent her name this","review":"Walking outside sets my allergies off, so I wanted to walk inside. I wrongly thought a manual treadmill would be beneficial. HA! It's nearly impossible to get a walking rhythm on this. It's like stuttering with my feet. I could easily walk 5 miles in high heels around my neighborhood, but this thing wears me out in 5 minutes. Within the first week of using it, I developed a pain in my left leg that may or may not be related to the treadmill (I have RA). But when this pain is present, it's all that more difficult to get the treadmill moving at a worthwhile pace. I am really sorry I bought this. I should have tested some store models out first.The info also leads one to believe that this \\"collapsible\\" treadmill can actually be stored somewhere.

This means that to stop my 15 month old daughter from playing on it we need to be put it in the closet or pile things on top of it... Not a great way to encourage yourself to get active.- The grip bar on this thing seems far too short for someone my height (about 6')."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple and Functional","review":"I purchased this treadmill as a backup.

Since you \\"power\\" the treadmill by simply walking, there is little risk of an accident. It will only go as fast or slow as you walk.

I read a negative review that belt is off centered, etc, but I don't find it. It does appear that it is off centered, it is illusion of the fly wheel that gives the resistance to the belt, and belt is off centered on the roller. I find it to be great exercise machine for personal use. One can control the speed along every step of the way. You are in control and not machine controls you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be Careful of reviews","review":"Beware of reviews! This is not a great machine. The saying is true \\"you get what you pay for\\". I wish I had opened the box and tried it before my 30 days because I would have returned it.

Nothing came close to imparting the understanding that I achieved while reading the Zen teaching of Huang Po. Beginning with the translator's introduction, the clairity and simpleness that is Zen transmission speaks from every page.

What the heck? Do something, man!Meanwhile, the brilliant female cop gets very little book time, and most of the time when she is there, she's making coffee.Other than that is the fact that the mystery is pretty obvious. The author basically tells you whudunnit.It's a shame, because I enjoy the author's writing style, but I just was disgusted with this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still a Thrilling Ride, Las Vegas Style!","review":"The book has some writing problems like you can't tell who's speaking to you at the time. The book is written by a variety of different voices. I loved the movie, Casino. The book fills in a lot of background details of the real-life characters and the movie starring Robert DeNiro, Joe Pesci, and Sharon Stone. DeNiro plays the lead character, Frank Lefty Rosenthal. In the movie, he's Ace Rothstein. Pesci plays Tony Spilotero as Nick who will remind you of Goodfellas role. Stone plays Ginger rather than Geri.I still find the book interesting especially about how thorough it is in regards to understanding the backgrounds of the mob, Las Vegas, Chicago, and the neighborhoods of Frank \\"Lefty\\" Rosenthal and Tony Spilotero's character. I always watching the movie but I like watching it from the beginning. I can't stand watching it in the middle but Scorsese did an excellent job in maintaining the voices that inspired the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"New Ride","review":"I read Wiseguy from Nicholas Pileggi and loved the book, though it was spot on with the movie Goodfellas with a few minor exceptions. The book Casino does however differ greatly from the movie of the same name, so it was much more enjoyable for me. Certainly the basics are still there, but many additional stories, altered stories and the timeline is a little off from the movie. Pileggi writes well and does great research. If you want to have more fun look up the real life people portrayed by Robert DeNiro, Joe Pesci, and Sharon Stone. It was amazing that Pesci and Stone looked just like the real life people. DeNiro wasn't even close, but he did a good job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable Read","review":"I had to read the book after seeing the movie by the same name. It's interesting and well-written.

The bright lights of Las Vegas do not shield the darkness of the desert surrounding it. In the novel Casino Nicholas Pileggi delves deep into the lives of the shady side of Las Vegas and the people who run it. The protagonist Frank AKA Lefty Rosenthal makes sure the readers understand that if you love someone you have to trust them with your life, with everything that you have because if you don't than what is the point of being in love. But Nicholas Pileggi puts in his own underlying message of in the life of a mobster you cannot trust anyone including your best friend and your wife. This book is full of non stop action and suspense. It gives you an inside look at the lives of the mobsters that made las vegas famous. I highly suggest readin Casino by Nicholas Pileggi."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cliched term, but, Couldn't put it down!","review":"Everything good that has been said about this book is true.

It's a magnificent tale."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pileggi Sans Scorsese","review":"My rating on this book is really a three and a half, if given the option to rate a half-star, that is.I enjoyed tremandously learning about the Teamsters, the politicians and of course the Mafia involvement in the Las Vegas casino operations. The book exceled in the abundance of information.However, the writing itself was not so great therefore lowering the reading experience. Just as in real life, when people tell you their side of the story, it hardly ever concurs with someone else's account. Since the book was really a collage of vaious narrations, the author had a hard time weaving together different points of views and tones. Sometimes readers are left wondering what really happened.I would recommend this book for people who are interested in information and stories regarding the Mafia. The topic is very interesting, but for those who prefers a bit more drama and fluency of writing, then this may not be your top choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Casino","review":"I was really excited about reading this book. I was living in Vegas and working at a Caesars, so to read about the history and lore of the city was intriguing to me. Yet, this book was hard to finish, I had to force myself to read it.

I find the real life experience of living and working in Sin City to be much more fascinating than reading about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grossly overated","review":"I am appalled at the glowing reviews that I've read for this book. It is, quite simply, terrible. The pace of this book is hyper-kinetic. It's not possible to feel anything for any characters because you never get to know them. First person is fine if the person remains the same. In this book, it is almost impossible to tell who is speaking because it changes virtually every page.

The clip on the back that helps stand the clock upright is flimsy, cheap and constantly falls out. I'm going to have to glue it in with D6000. As for function - you just move the minute hand around and the hour hand will move appropriately with it. Okay that's fine but I can make a paper clock do the same thing and spend pennies. Overall not happy at all with this product. I thought it was larger and had more function (the latter my own fault for not reading more carefully). I see other reviewers have said theirs have loosened or won't tell the correct time anymore so I have that to look forward to in the near future, I'm sure. My advice - visit the dollar store, make your own or splurge for a better clock."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS IS NOT A WORKING CLOCK","review":"I ordered 2 of these; one for the family room and one for my 7 year old son's room to reinforce what he has learned about reading a clock (I work with 8th graders and most can't read a clock with hands, only a digital clock). Nowhere in the description does it say that the hands don't move unless you move them. That fact should be made clear. Only when you get this does it state on the back of the box in tiny letters \\"not a working clock\\". As a tool for very small children, this would be great.

But, then these exchange students come to his school and this one kid from France ends up being in the movie, and then the relationship between the little boy making the movie and the friend kind of begins to dilute.The story seemed to be set in the 1980's, although they really didn't specify particularly.This is not a movie for young kids.

Two main things bothered me: Benson's style and her content. First of all, this is her first novel and it shows. The \\"archaic\\" style of the 14th-century segment is laughable. Generally, the pacing is simply incompetent. It is a plodding recitation of events which follow one another step by step by step by step... Benson made me appreciate once again how skilled suspense writers know which events in a narrative to stress and which to put side by side to create excitement and anticipation. Secondly -- and this is going to be rude -- Benson comes across as a dull person with nothing to say: her asides are pedestrian and unimaginative. I'm not expecting Milan Kundera in such a novel, but this makes me lack the slightest desire to hold a conversation with her.In short, there are great suspense novels being written all the time. Read them INSTEAD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Parts are good....","review":"I really enjoyed the first few chapters of this book, and went so far as to recommend it to a friend at that point. When I finished, I told my friend 'nevermind'. In the beginning, the sci-fi part is intriguing, and the historical part is entertaining. But after a little while the futuristic half of this book goes downhill pretty quick. Virtually all the major characters are medical experts, yet they ALL react to the possibility of the BLACK FREAKING DEATH PLAGUE making a comeback as if they were addle-brained children. In short, the characters are unforgivably, annoyingly stupid. The historical part of the book is much better, but still could use improvement. At times I checked the front cover to make sure there wasn't an oil painting of Fabio on it, the book read so much like a Harlequin romance. (Or what I assume one would be like). I'm especially disappointed because it seems like there's a really good book hiding inside there somewhere, tryin! g to get out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enthralling and Entertaining...","review":"The characters were fully fleshed and the twin plots kept rolling right along. It was a very interesting look at everyday life during the plague(s). I did not care for the language and (bits) of sex in it. I laughed out loud hard at several spots, not because of any poor writing but at some genuinely funny moments. This first book is very good -- I haven't had a book that caught me like this for a long time.

I also liked that Ms. Benson was able to weave these two plots together so seamlessly and create a believable future London.Her characters are very strong and I liked how Benson was able to show cause and effect relationships not just in one time period but between the centuries.It reminded me very much of my favorite book The Eight by Katherine Neville. Ms. Benson was really able to capture the feeling of both a historical novel and a medical thriller without alienating fans of either genre.This was a great read."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst ending of a book I've ever read","review":"I can't remember the last time I actually screeched when I finished the end of a book--it was completely unbelievable and tacked on! Most of the modern characters were barely sketched-in so I don't know why I cared. The only thing that saved it for me was the descriptions in the 14th century part, though I agree with many readers that the connection between the two parts was tenuous at best. The Doomsday Book was much better--at least I wasn't rolling my eyes in disbelief."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a fabulous read","review":"Ann Benson did such a beautiful job in telling tales of two different time periods all to come together in the end. Not only was the book ladeled with education pertaining to the black death but you also get caught up in both time period stories without getting lost. This has been one of the best books I have read in a long while. Ever so captivating was this novel I hated to finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Novel Ever!","review":"I though that this was the worst novel it has ever been my misfortune to read.

But there was something challenging about diving into this. The current year portion was just too drawn out. What could have been written in two sentances took up half a page."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good premise, cheesy writing","review":"Benson has managed to remind me of Dan Brown, with all of the bad writing and none of the interesting research. The premise seemed interesting--tale set in the future and the past, with similar events.Unfortunately, the writing was so bad that I, as a respectable Creative Writing major at a university, could not get through more than the first five pages. If you like endless cliches, bad dialogue, and thousands of thoughts in italics, pick up the new John Grisham and skip this mediocre tale."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Change from cut and dried Medical Thrillers","review":"I read the sequel to this book first so at times I felt like fast forwarding as I knew some of the outcomes, but I still found myself drawn in by the characters. Her descriptions of the 14th century are good -- I can't comment on the validity of them but they sounded plausible to me. As for the germs in the 21st century, I cannot comment on the validity of that either, but they do sound a little far fetched. </p> If you are looking for a captivating read -- not a suspense, edge of your seat thriller -- try this out for a change of pace. If you take your time you will feel yourself drawn in by the characters and hope and pray they pull through the plague."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is kind of fun, but ultimately annoying","review":"This book was fun to read. It is fun. Therefore, it should get an awesome review. However, the book suffered from what one might call protaganosis stupidos.. the main characters are unable to take reasonable actions even though they (and others) will surely die do to their inanity. If it weren't for this terrible flaw, it would be worth reading. Imagine a book in which there is a vaccine on the shelf, that you are told about, and the characters know about, but they for some reason never do, even though they are dying. Is that exciting? If it is for you, then buy the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A plague of bad fiction","review":"Is it science fiction? Is it romantic? Is it fantasy?

It didn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting story falls apart in the last quarter","review":"Science fiction in general requires the reader to suspend belief in order to enjoy the story. This novel is no exception. I was enjoying this book until about the last quarter of the book. Then the characters began acting in such an unbelievable way that I found my self actually angry with the author! I am not a critical reader. However, I can not remember when I was more disappointed with a story's ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great premise, terrible execution","review":"Here's yet another example of a fascinating and original premise that is so awkwardly handled that it renders the novel practically unreadable. The characters are so poorly drawn, clich��d, and unrealistic that at times you find yourself laughing out loud, and the many plot absurdities and failed attempts at historical verisimilitude, plus a frustratingly absurd ending, make the book come of as, well, silly.Don't get me wrong: I enjoy \\"check your brains at the door\\" books as much as the next person, but this one is so poorly executed that it's not worth the effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than many books out there....","review":"Although I do have several complaints about The Plague Tales and its sequel, the two books are still better than many things out there. People complain about this work like there are so many better works to read, and yet many fail to mention a single other suggestion.... I read this book over a weekend, during a horrible winter storm while my husband who had recentally had two serious surgeries, was very sick with the flu. The combination of constant snow and wind, a total lack of sleep, my husband alternatlly wracked with chills or burning with feaver and unable to keep any kind of food or drink in him made this book more real than I hope to experiance again. I have yet to read a historical book that is compleatly accurate, by the way Hot Zone is truely more fiction than fact, and far less intertaining than The Plague Tales."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointing Book","review":"After reading reviews and the hype, I was disappointed in this book. The two stories never really connect, and in the modern story, though it has an intriguing premise in the health police idea, the characters never come to life, nor is the resurrection of the ancient germ really plausible. The medieval story also has flaws. The author clearly knows very little about either the Middle Ages or Jews and Jewish customs. For a start, the idea that the hero could walk into a bishopric and murder the bishop (who, by the way, would almost never be alone, even sleeping) is absurd.

Unfortunately, she rapidly lost control of both her plots and her characters. The modern story became a string of bizarre coincidences, while the medieval one brought in mystical or occult elements that never really meshed with the high-tech future. Also, the contemporary, supposedly scientifically-trained characters repeatedly behave as if they are brain-dead. I kept hoping this novel would rise to the promise of its premise, but it disappointed me to its laboriously contrived end."},{"rating":"2","title":"King of Pop RULZ!!!","review":"This is an amazing songbook, a must-have for all you vocalists out there...it has the most amazing songs ever in the history of Modern pop.

It's alternately hilarious and heart-wrenching, and since the pavilion itself (the play takes place in a pavilion on a large lake) is a metaphor for the universe, Wright shows us how the smallest decision can affect an entire universe (and vice versa).

The Robot did work well the first few times and then after that, it just spread the water all over the kitchen without picking it up... I cleaned the bot well to no avail. Then, I let the bot put the water down and had to mop the floor afterward. This worked ok for a few months, but after 7 months, it decided it wound't move at all. Without the tank inserted, the unit kept telling me to check the tank! Check the tank? It was not even attached! IRobot send a software update early on so I again tried updating the unit. Nothing seems to work.This was an unfortunate waste of money and I would not recommend this to anyone."}]`),O={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:x},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:N,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},D={class:"card-container"},W=["disabled"],B={key:0},H={key:1};function M(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=w("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your SNAP 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",D,[(a(!0),i(y,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",H,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",B,"See more"))],8,W)):b("",!0)])}const C=d(O,[["render",M],["__scopeId","data-v-1ca8f66f"]]),L=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"library/48.md","filePath":"library/48.md"}'),R={name:"library/48.md"},P=Object.assign(R,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(C)]))}});export{L as __pageData,P as default};
