You are now in the world where the customer takes all responsibility and returns can take months to complete correctly. For me this is a huge deal.

I looked at the Jet Models and compared horse-power, number of spokes per wheel, construction and cost. I looked at all the woodworking dealers in my area and you will not find a better band saw for the money. Not only that it comes with a fence and miter, extra on other models. The fence is a godsend.The unit will take some time calibrating. Well worth the effort. I like the quick release for the blade. The cast aluminum parts concern me because you have to be careful not to over-tighten things. Get a mobel base for this unit if you plan on moving it around, it's heavy.

The paint job is nice, the stand is snazzy, and the roller bearings make you think you're getting a good value here. Buyer beware. The engineering on this is low end all the way. The roller bearing adjustment method/mechanism is K-mart-level and the bearings don't align flush with the blade, the lower bearings and trunion bolts are a real pain to get to, the table doesn't sit securely in the trunion, the table alignment process is mere wishful thinking and the fence installation instructions are blithely vague. If you want something that looks good, this is a great product. If you want solid engineering and a no-nonsense set up, look elsewhere.

Every family has characters similar to the Barrone family and it's easy to relate. The laughs just never stop but even with the family squabbles and uncomfortable situations they find themselves in, you can tell that there is a deep undercurrent of love within this family.

I am not really sure who is in the band. It seems like Kevin Drew and Brendan Canning started it. There are other members like from Stars and Metric and other groups. The music is moody and eclectic. This record is not a proper record but a collection of B-sides. Most of it was recorded over a long period of time. Emily Haines from Metric sings on \\"Backyards\\" and \\"Lover's Spit\\" and really shines. This is the new chill out sound. There are a lot of ambient ideas being thrown around here.

The text is amazingly detailed (it describes his behavior patterns as a child, his arguments with fellow Bolsheviks behind closed doors, and his final year in stunning detail). Service also gives insight into Lenin's personal motivation that drove him to the October Revolution in 1917, as well as the future of the USSR as Lenin had envisaged (let's just say Stalinism was not foreseen). Additionally, the book is well written and easy to read; a must for anyone interested in Lenin, the Soviet Union, or the Bolshevik Revolution."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cool cover, but the book is boring....","review":"This book looks good on the outside, but is terribly boring on the inside. It goes on and on about how Lenin loved to read books, and debate and that he was sick all the time. He was sponging off his mother so he could continue reading more books. Then you learn about Lenin's travels accros Europe and the letters that he wrote to his mother and sisters. I basically gave up right there, about 150 pages into the book.

I love the emphasis of having sex only when you are responsible knowing all the consequences. The book is not prudish. It shows real life examples of feelings and experiences about sex. For Spanish readers it is easy to understand. Do not get discourage for the language.Buy it and share it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Number 1 book for mom and teen daughters","review":"This book is wonderful because it's not only informative, but also very entertaining, fun and readable. The illustrations are great, as are the numerous anecdotes. And Ms. Weschler's sense of humor is always present as she unfolds the mysteries of menstruation. It's perfect for teenagers to read alone or for mothers and daughters to read together. Her discussion of girls \\"first time\\" will stimulate many thoughtful discussions. Previous generations of woman regarded their periods as the \\"curse\\". With Ms. Weschler's wisdom, future generations will regard their periods as a celebration of their womanhood."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life Changing Information","review":"I am sending Cycle Savvy to my 14 year old niece. If only this book had been available to me at 14. It would have been extremely helpful to my future when my husband and I attempted to plan our family. After getting an education and working in family planning for the past 20 years I am often surprised at the lack of understanding many educated women and men have of a women's fertility cycle. Cycle Savvy is full humor, personal stories and accurate information on how to learn about your own fertility cycle and how it affects your life as a teen. What a great time to learn about your cycle prior to becoming sexually active as a woman. The last section of the book raises the issues teen face as they consider when they will become sexually active. Cycle Savvy could be a great way to open up this important discussion between parent and teen. This is what I am hoping for my sister and niece."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tie Out Cable - Rusted and Faded","review":"Perfect for my needs. I have a 40 lb dog who uses this tie out cable. It seems perfectly sturdy without being excessively heavy. It has not kinked or twisted.I did receive a blue cable in case anyone is concerned about color.Edit on 10 Oct 2012.This cable has rusted and has faded to almost white. I don't use the clip on either end, so it is still working for me since I keep a collar permanently on one end. I'd image if you need to use the clip that the rust would make it difficult."},{"rating":"2","title":"Audiophile quality DVD (who cares about the visuals)","review":"I know some will expect great visuals from the DVD, especially if they are buying this new package for the video content and they may be disappointed. Fair enough. What impresses me is that the DVD contains the original album in 24 Bit resolution. What this means is that you will be able to hear the album in recording studio quality sound. The only way to get this quality previously was to shell out $$$ for a DVD-Audio player and buy the DVD-A release. This is the first album I know of to be released in 24Bit on a regular DVD disc that anyone can buy and play in their regular DVD player. Also you will be able to hear an amazing 5.1 channel mix if your DVD player/receiver can decode DTS. Depending on the qualty of your dvd player/receiver/stereo and your perception your response to the quality of 24Bit could range from noticing nothing to walking around your living room declaring the death of the CD. Viva La 24Bit !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Discover ANATO, 30 years after again .........","review":"ANATO is my first QUEEN album to buy in 1975.I love it too much.Now, ( 30 years after ) i could listen it from my DTS system !This DVD's 5.1 surround mix is perfect.

The DVD images aren't bad, with mixtures of videos, stills, and live footage, but the audio is where it really shines."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why is this out of print?","review":"Anthony Burgess seems to be dangerously close to being passed over by history. The only book that he is now remembered for is now more likely to be cited as \\"a Stanley Kubrick film\\" than \\"an Anthony Burgess novel,\\" and his many other works have been left to rot in used bookstores. While he's not certainly not the most visionary speculative fiction author of the 20th century, he deserves far more respect than he's received--I fully expect him to be \\"rediscovered\\" sometime soon.I first read \\"The End of the World News\\" back in middle school (about ten years ago) and still remember it clearly. His parallel narratives--a future Earth waiting for The End, the waning years of cranky old Freud, and the libretto for a musical about Trotsky's visit to New York--work together beautifully, like a more coherent \\"Slaughterhouse-Five.\\" Still one of my all-time favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"MEMORY","review":"I had a lot of fun building the castle, but when I went inside I kept running out of memory and it would crash.

The care and maintenance section is about two pages in length and includes tips such as: \\"change your oil after 3,000 miles.\\" There are no \\"how-to\\" sections, this book will not help you repair your scooter and doesn't offer much in the way of buying strategies, where you might find used scooters, etc. Buy it used if you must read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"yeah...","review":"oh yeah...i love these girls...germany has 5 new rising stars and i hope i don\`t have to wait so long for them...i hope they come to us next time..."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd rather cut my ears than listening this one","review":"you say that this is a good girl band because you are just naive like the other fans either! this one is spice girls made in germany,....who enter as a money production maker!uninspired songs! the girls cannot read any musical notes !!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Engaging and well written","review":"I continued reading the Lord John books in the hopes of delving more deeply into the relationship between him and Jamie Fraser from the original Outlander series (though Ms. Gabaldon insists that the Lord John books are a part of the original series, after reading two, I think that they really are more like spin-offs). In this book we get another small glimpse of the Lord John/Jamie Fraser dyad in the midst of a deep exploration of Lord John coming into his own as a man. A well written story and definitely engaging. For me - who is so addicted to the original Outlander series - there was not nearly enough Jamie Fraser. I will probably return to read the rest of the Lord John books, but am taking a break to try to find another good long series to get into."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible","review":"the first day i began using this phone it absolutely sucked! it has way too much static and sometimes people cant hear me at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bought the cheapest phone got what I paid for","review":"I bought the cheapest phone and that is what I got.

Science's incremental advances in knowledge about the universe, embedded in the text, are impressive.Because it is so well explained, this text would be suitable for self study.

I could have gleaned most of what I learned from this book from a two- or three-page summary of cosmology - that is, enough to spark interest and raise questions, and very little else. The author did attempt to delve into the heart of cosmology, but topics are dealt with so coarsely that it would be difficult for an uninitiated student to get a full understanding of the the details. No matter how low of a price you may find this book for, don't be tempted; you could undoubtedly find better explanations on the Internet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke the first time out of the package","review":"Never got to try these because they broke the first time out of the package.

It shows poignantly the frustrations and downright heroism of an immigrant student and of a teacher who risks his job to help her in defiance of a college administration that uses absurd standardized tests for academic cleansing.Furthermore, this is a fine novel. Using a double epistolary form, alternating narratives by teacher and student, it evokes brilliantly the complementary perspectives of its two main characters. It keeps us intimately involved in their thoughts and feelings while it presents the social and political tangles in which they are wound. I literally did not put it down, reading it in a single sitting, something I have not done since reading Nabokov's PNIN many years ago.I recommend it most highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overhaulin Season 3 Vol 3","review":"An excellent collection.

From the opening intro to the last song this cd is great for whatever mood you are in. TO all inspiring musicians and veterans of the game... this is how you produce great music. Marcus miller is on a whole different level playing most of the live instruments, yes live instruments himself. Unlike a lot of todays artists playing along to studio produced tracks.

I would say that around 90% of this book is devoted to modern toys and there is mere lip service to the exquisite machines from which they were derived.I also found it personally insulting that he claims to include restoration.

It is informative with helpful pictures that aren't gross. There are only a few sections that really get into all the problems that can occur during pregnancy, but it is presented in an informative kind of way, not a scary \\"I never want to get pregnant\\" kind of way.

The deluxe tool rest had a problem in that if you turned the guide around it would hang up so bad that it wouldn't slide. I called Grizzly and the sent me a new base and one side of the tool rest and a new deluxe tool rest. After about 2 hours of changing the base and different parts of the deluxe tool rests around I was able to get it square with the grinding wheel.

The apocryphal Book of Enoch goes into even more detail about the evil these so-called \\"guardians\\" wrought upon the human race.Commander X, and Tim Beckley etc, are placing their faith in \\"aliens\\" to save humanity instead of Christ.

The album title is correct, but the group is 35007, and not a group called Sea of Tranquility. This EP was released on February 12th, 2001 on the Stickman label. This is the first all-instrumental release from 35007. As a warm up for their masterpiece \\"Liquid\\" it is a very strong indicator of what was to come. As it seems with all the CDs from this band, there isn't a bad track.

From the white clayish sand in Key West to the shelly beaches of Naples up to the spectacular white sands in the Panhandle back down the orange sand beaches of the Atlantic near jacksonville to the white sandy beaches to Miami.

All the tracks are great, my favourite Blue Moon of Kentucky and the first song he wrote \\"I lost my little Girl\\" listen for the influence of the great Buddy Holly.I saw McCartney live in Australia and they played some of these tracks off the unplugged album, it was just great.Listen to track 17 \\"JUNK\\" this is a very good accoustic number."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paul Betrays His Solo Material","review":"This album contains some good songs like We Can Work It Out, And I Love Her, That Would Be Something, Every Night, and She's a Woman, but there are far too many cover tunes. The only redeeming one is Be Bop A Lula. Why is it that the youngest song on this album is from 1970? Where are the Wings songs? Songs like Band On the Run, Bluebird, Silly Love Songs and Listen To What The Man Said could've fit on this album.

Redlaw is a better developed and subtler character than Ebenezer Scrooge, and his visit with a spirit -- and the results of that visit -- are arguably more heartbreaking. Scrooge learned his lesson by looking in on those people he knew and watching their lives undetected. Redlaw only realizes his mistake once he has inflicted suffering on many more than just himself. There's a clear lesson to the story, but it's a little more interesting than the I found in A Christmas Carol Most everyone knows the importance of being kind to others, but not everyone would think -- or even agree -- that bad memories are an important part of being human."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Oh sooo bad","review":"This an extremely horrible- I don't know what to call it.

The club joints are great for dancing to, but the fans usually don't dig the stuff that is made for the real heads. It's like raid, spray/play a little bit of it and watch them take off running.Anyway, I took the Joyful Rebellion CD with me to use once before and played B-Boy Stance to get them out of there and it backfired on me. So I switched it up and used Emcee Murdah.....it worked like a charm. The song is a little preachy, but the message is a good one and the production is sparse and mellow.Also included is the funky Crabbuckit. It was released as a single and the video for it is kind of strange, but I like the song a lot. I recommend checking both tracks out as well both of his full length LPs (Joyful Rebellion & Exit). K-Os is proof positive that hip hop is far from dead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Old School Pop","review":"I grew up during the time when the Beatles and Paul Mc were relevant.

The way he treated his women was very insensitive, in addition to the bitterness and feud he had with his father. But the then came the heroine with all her caring caring, giving, and loving nature, despite being an orphan. She had opened the hero's eyes how love could actually existed among human beings, that also made him falling in love with the heroine, desparately in love ... All ended well and perfect!I actually want to give 5 stars, but I still feel something missing in the whole plot, may be it's about the way Ms.James wrote the ending. I think Michelle Reid could have written a better plot and ending for the same characters and story line. Still, I love the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well-written, okay read.","review":"I've never read Julia James before but the back cover sounded interesting - basically an update of Cinderella. Julia James is a capable writer and the basic premise has promise. But I cannot abide weak and powerless heroines. Not having an education or piles of money does not automatically make a woman a door-mat. I would have liked to see the heroine go nose to nose with the hero rather than just have everything happen to her.

Oh yeah, not to mention that it's sold with that feature and SHOULD work.Aside from that and the failing singing lady's voice who sometimes sounds like static on a bad cell phone call, this thing is constructed well, looks very nice and fits nicely in tight places.Oh - and good luck finding a second sheet to have as a backup to cover the pad."},{"rating":"1","title":"did not like this product","review":"We were very disappointed by this product. The metal bars of the bassinet sit directly under the mattress -- you can feel them with your hand so certainly a baby would be able to feel them as well. Seems very uncomfortable and we felt it was a poor design. Also -- the way the bassinet cover fits in place felt unsafe. We put it together, immediately took it apart and returned it. With our first child we borrowed a bassinet from a friend. It did not have these design flaws. Seemed as if the design of the product was for ease of packaging rather than for safety or comfort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dated, but still an excellent primer on corn snake genetics","review":"So many new corn snake color morphs have been developed since this book was first published that its coverage of the morphs that existed at the time seems a bit dated. Nevertheless, this book is still of considerable use to corn snake breeders, as well as anyone else interested in breeding for recessive traits, for its clear explanation of Mendelian rules of inheritance. Novice corn snake keepers ask too often the question of what you get when you breed this kind of corn snake with that kind; after reading this book, they'll be able to figure it out for themselves.Readers interested in descriptions of the latest corn snake morphs, and how they're made, should consult The Corn Snake Manual by Bill and Kathy Love."},{"rating":"2","title":"strange journey","review":"Brazzaville is rich bored youth seeking stimulation on strange exotic travels.

While we here at History House are always suspicious of any work with an obvious political agenda (printed by The Feminist Press), the accounts of doctors and their loopy practices in the nineteenth century are a hoot. If push came to shove, we would suspect some of the wilder accounts given are probably minority views, but the prevailing notion of women as fragile bits of fluff subject to the whims of their productive systems was probably held by a majority of the docs during the period in question. Besides, it's only about ninety pages. A good bathroom read.

Justin was a weak hero that couldn't be honest about his feelings to either Isabel or Helen.

Isabel used Helen to further her own causes and she too cheated behind Helen's back with Justin. Not a great tribute to either love or friendship.

I'll admit, I've only watched this show for like 30 minutes, total, but that's way more than enough. Wow, they're sitting on the beach. Fascinating. Never seen that before. Also, conversation between teenaged girls is the absolute epitome of banality, particularly stupid ones, like the ones featured on this show. The show has a few good points, however. Many of the people have hilarious names (Lo, Talan etc.) Also, they tend to wear moronic looking sunglasses, which are pretty funny to look at.

You know, the beach, the life...maybe. This show is just boring. What it really is is a bunch of hot, rich, teen girls and their life experiences. I'm sorry, but this has got to be awarded for the most boring reality show of 2004. Mainly, it's about Lo, Kristen, and Carrie going through Senior year of high school, going through relationships and life.I don't know, but watching teen girls grow-up is boring. The thing that probably makes this boring is that not only have we seen it over and over, but they have nothing odd in their live. They basically live their life by \\"the book\\", and do nothing abnormal, and just be the rich, wealthy girls they are. All they do is go to school, have relationships, hang with friends, and party and become sluts.Like I said before, I really tried to like this, but Laguna Beach is just a boring show about teenage girls's lifes."},{"rating":"2","title":"not watched yet","review":"Daughter saw this series a long time ago and is looking forward to viewing it at her own leisure!

The fact that it got renewed for a second season has to be some kind of sign of an impending apocalypse. Ditto on My Super Sweet 16 being renewed for another go-around. That show literally makes me sick and makes the characters of Laguna Beach look like they live in relative squalor. Oh well, just another vulgar chapter in our bold new American saga of glorifying extreme opulence I suppose. It's the Reagan years reborn!

On both of those albums he is very fluid and very versatile. Unfortunately this DVD only has 5 songs in tablature on it, the rest of the time is spent with him talking about picks, capo's right hand position and the like...That's fine if you want to be exactly like Tony Rice but as a purely instructional video, it falls flat.

For the money it is an excellent television. The pros are, of course, HDTV capabilities. It also has decent sound and good picture quality. The cons are no HDMI/DVI interface so no digital connectivity. Also, there is no 720p support so you are forced to go with 480p or 1080i.

Them Peppers are Red Hot...","review":"Wasn't sure what I was getting into buying this DVD, but I admit I enjoyed it. I've always enjoyed watching candid stuff about bands, in addition to watching them perform.This title, Funky Monks, does just that. It shows the Chili Peppers as they do a bit of publicity for their then upcoming album \\"Blood Sugar Sex Magic\\", and I think at points you can see that John Frusciante (sp?) was not completely stable at all times, a sign that he would leave the band as they were touring. I'd love to see something like this for their last album, Californication, to see how the reunion came about.The only downside I'd say about this DVD that holds back its 5 stars is that it didn't have any extras, like videos they made for songs from the Blood Sugar album, or for that matter, not a single song was played all the way through."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD won't even work!!!!","review":"I bought a Red Hot Chili Peppers DVD (Funky Monks) from Movie Mars through Amazon.com (not Amazons fault) and the stupid DVD won't even work!!

It is more about how to live with the seasons and what activities, both mundane and magical, are appropriate for the time of year.

Though not a pagan or wiccan, as the year progresses through its seasons and holidays, I become curious about why we celebrate (or not) the way we do and how our traditions evolved. The Easter bunny, and the Easter egg, for instance, are actually derived from ancient symbols of rebirth and fertility. Wheel of the Year can be read simply for its information, without fearing that it will undermine your religion, if you are secure in it. It also helps to understand what those who practice alternative religions are thinking, and why."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could've been better.","review":"Leslie Richford wrote a great review of this collection. I have nothing against the performances, but the sound irks me a little. The guitar sounds fine - it's the fortepiano that gets under my skin at times. A handful of keys are out of tune, and it was mic'd and recorded in such a narrow way that the piano sounds like one of those uprights languishing away, forgotten, in the basement of a school, church, or nursing home. Also, because of the heavier reverb employed on the piano, it doesn't blend well with the relatively dry and up-front recording of the guitar. It almost sounds as if the two musicians were in separate rooms. Carulli's work, though miniaturistic, is still majestic in scope. a Bosendorfer, Yamaha, or Steinway would not have been an insult to him. In fact, I'm quite certain, he would've worn an ear to ear smile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible transfer to DVD","review":"I know this movie (I saw it in 1975 in movie theater) but I like to see it again.

Metallica has been dead for years. It's an embarresment now. The only good thing about this album was that it wasn't as bad as St Anger and that it actually can be used as a good frisbee.E F E F gets really old James. Kirt's solos have not improved at all. There the same ripped off chops they always have been. However I will admit there were a 'couple' of good licks that he improved on.Lars, I won't totally diss him, I'll leave that for the Pro-Napster people to do. All you have to do is listen to a clip to see his 'drumming.'Bassist? What bassist? I thought he died in 1986.

The Some Kind of Monster song edit is a pretty cool addition to the E.P., making it sound alot better then the origional album version, which I might add, is how St. Anger should have origionally sounded in the first place. Not to mention since Metallica's going back to the studio for another album since they weren't too satisfied with the way St. Anger was selling...maybe it's time for a re-issue?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Some Kind of Whine-O","review":"You can try to paper this over (we Metallica fans are good at that now), but this is unquestionably one of the two or three worst Metallica songs in their catalog (and -really- stretching the definition of song).SKOM has all the limpness of Load and Unload sessions, and all the vocal laziness of the \\"new Metallica\\". God, Jaymz, GET OUT OF MY FACE... YOU get out of my head.Yes, the movie was pretty good, and St. Anger was not a total crime, but this song, as a single especially, sucks in a thousand different ways. It's the only track from St. Anger that's deleted off my MP3 collection, but it was an EASY call.By the way, wasn't the movie illuminating? I'm beginning to think that the last three albums have been some kind of decade-long therapy session for middle-age metal burnouts. Like Lars in the movie, thinking about this whole experience of being a fan of this second phase of Metallica, one word just keeps coming to mind... Sucks. Sucks. Sucks. SUCKS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"How did this happen?","review":"How could Metallica take great songs like \\"Damage Inc.\\" and \\"Ride the Lightning\\", from the early days, and massacre them like this?

James' weak and incoherent voice would have been acceptable if I hadn't listened to some of Metallica's other Live releases and KNOWN that he could have done better. And why the hell is Lars still banging on tin cans instead of a real percussion set? It was that kind of drumming that utterly destroyed \\"St. Anger\\", yet somehow Ulrich hasn't gotten the hint yet.It's amazing.

Do yourself a favor. Wait for it to come out on Napster, or even better. Don't bother. This band started to fade away when they hired Jason Newstead (who should've stayed with Flotsam & Jetsam) and shrieked their death knell when they put out Garage (Garbage) Inc. and attacked their fans for downloading their songs when they themselves copped to making illegal copies of their favorite bands (read the liner notes for Garage Inc. if you think I'm blowing smoke).

It's not because of the number of songs or the song selection, but the fact that the aggression that James used to growl these songs is gone. He now wants to be a singer. There's no singing \\"Damage, Inc.\\" or \\"Ride the Lightning\\". These songs have lost all of it's original feel of anger and aggression. And James forgets some of the lyrics to \\"Ride the Lightning\\" to boot! Lars' drums sound weak. They sound like a set of K-Mart children's drums. I realize they aren't young anymore but I think they would at least try to maintain some of the \\"fire\\" the got them going in the first place.

However, I guarantee you won't find this knife in any authentic Chinese kitchen because this knife is just too expensive.If you want to get a good Chinese chef's knife, you should buy the high-carbon stainless Dexter-Russell cleaver (costs around $40). It is only slighly less sharp but the difference is not noticeable, especially if you are chopping rather than slicing.There is nothing wrong with the Shun knife; it's just way too overpriced. It's just a knife, and no mass-produced kitchen knife is worth $170, no matter how sharp it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent asian style knife.","review":"I have a Shun KenOnion style knife, but then I'm chinese and always wanted a asian style knife. The quality of Shun is good, but the price tag is really really out of reach.At first site, the knife looks intimidating, it looks very big and heavy compared to the normal chef knives. Once you pick it up, you'll be amazed. The weight is perfectly balanced, and the wide edge makes picking up chopped veggies or meat a cinch. In fact, this one feels more ergonomic than the ergonomically designed Ken Onion Chef knife, hardly even use that one anymore since I got this.You can slice, chop, dice with ease on this blade.

For historical zealots (such as myself) this book will leave you hungry for more information about Colonial homes and their historical roots, but for what it is, it's pretty decent. This book has good artwork, clean pictures and an interesting array of different Colonial styles.That being said, I was profoundly disappointed in the book's lack of images and information on the ubiquitous Colonial Revival. That was my reason for buying this book, as I wanted to learn more about that style of housing. \\"Colonial Style\\" had very little on this incredibly popular genre (and derivation) of domestic architecture.Then again, I am a purist. If you want some decorating ideas and like to look at pretty pictures of old Williamsburg-era Colonials, you'll love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too museum-esque","review":"I think the hallmark of good design is the ability to maintain that integrity while also moving with some elements of style from the period in which you actually live. I guess the title really means \\"CLASSIC interiors;\\" the book shows how to create interiors that would have looked appropriate in 1763. Today, a number of the interiors come across as dark, overwhelming and provincial. The photographs viewable on Amazon are misleading because the interiors pictured are more simple, more modern, and brighter than most of those photographed in the book. I would take a long look at it in-store before investing if you prefer simple, classic design to stringently historical interiors. (Also, as an aside, the book seems to utilize an older understanding of acceptable paint colors for colonials-- darker, duller colors. Others, such as Martha Stewart's books, proclaim that newer research shows that slightly brighter shades were actually used more often than previously believed.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Agree with S. Haus","review":"I agree with S. Haus. I was also disappointed. The interiors of the homes in the book are generally dark and unwelcoming (unlike the one on the cover). I prefer the multitudes of other books that combine accurate colonial decorative schemes with a modern, lived-in feel, rather than something straight out of a tour of Benjamin Franklin's 18th century home. Not sure why some other reviewers seem to attack the S. Haus review; makes me wonder if they know the author personally."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review","review":"The book was purchased to help guide an authentic restoration of a 1925 Saltbox in Atlanta. The cover was among the best photographs in the book, but many others were helpful in establishing a general sense of the colonial aesthetic, with which we were unfamiliar. The mouldings section was far briefer(and less helpful) than I was hoping for, but suppose you can't expect a full chapter devoted to base boards. Because we were adding a fireplace and bookcases, pictures from the book proved invaluable in communicating trim details to the contractor. In summary, the book well served our purposes.

To make matters worse, part of it remained stuck in the cigarette lighter, and I had a difficult time getting it out.

Brian Wilson was becoming less and less involved, though he did provide the basic tunes for the great Marcella and the rocking You Need A Mess Of Help. Best tracks are probably the ballads, notably Dennis's epic Cuddle Up and the heavenly All This Is That. Other than these tracks (and to be fair at 8 tracks in total, there isn't *much* else left), the album is pretty weak by the Boys' early 70s standards, with too much reliance on the 2 new boys from the South African group Flame.Holland was better and seemed to pick up where Surf's Up left off. Carl is on top form with the 2-part Trader, the band hit a great groove on Sail On Sailor (the only track *not* recorded in Holland), Dennis and Mike enchant on Only With You, and Al revisits California Girls on California. Brian's bonus fairy tale is, errrr......, *very* Brian!"},{"rating":"2","title":"5\\" waves on the amazon","review":"For those who unconsciously view the 'official' Amazon reviews as more fact-based than those in the consumer section, I feel compelled to say that the Amazon critic really missed the boat in regard to the 'Carl & The Passions - So Tough' portion of this package; if you're only interested in fun, fun, fun or Smile-style seriousness, perhaps this isn't for you. But if the South African curve of the Blondie-Ricky era intrigues you, I don't think you'll be disappointed by this collection.And though we may never hear Brian's ode-to-masseuse 'Marcella' in its original form, the 'clean' revision debuted on 'So Tough' is a splash of muscular pop perfection that even Noel Gallagher would love."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great representation of an old classic porn!!","review":"Surround sound adds to the sensuous effect of perfect love making.

Books such as this one are inspiring because you can look at a photo and immediately accept, adapt, or reject it for your own living quarters.

A particularly moving scene for me told the story of a young dog who gets free just before she comes into her first heat, and comes home battered & pregnant.

Townshend probably agreed to this for some cash or a laugh, and he called it a \\"fun project\\". It wasnt fun for me to listen to. The original is a classic and ive listened to it many of times. I cringe when Petra tries to SING keiths drums and entwistles bass. Avoid if you want a life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crap, crap, crap","review":"For all you people who don't get out much, this album may seem chic and \\"concept' to you but lemme tell you something... collegiate A cappella groups have been doing what she just did for decades and have been doing it BETTER... I was in a couple groups during my collegiate years and we could've blown the pants off her. If you want some REAL a cappella music I suggest you check out the BOCA series from the mainely a cappella catalog (unless amazon has it). Boca stands for Best of College A Cappella and let me tell you IT IS. This petra girl needs to get her head on straight cause he vocals are mediocre and the mix is terrible. This CD isn't worth the plastic its pressed on."},{"rating":"1","title":"not so hot.","review":"this is just another chick with no original songs of her own trying to ride on the coatails of a great band. a few songs were ok sounding but in all it's a weak attempt at a classic who lp. it also figures that this is the daughter of a famous composer. these people usually are related to someone in the biz who can easily get them studio time instead of a true talented unknown who will never get opportunities like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Cover of Who's Greatest Album","review":"I agree with one review here that stated that the Haden version of this album made me hear things I hadn't appreciated in the original. It made me realize that this is my favorite Who album after all...being in the running with Quad, Next and Tommy. I would say that 90% of Petra's versions of these songs are on the mark with some weak spots in Mary Anne and Silus Stingy. Her Rael is tremendous. That alone justifies buying and listening to this."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a joke, but told well...","review":"When I first heard the samples I did not know what to make of it. And it grew on me. You really need to pick up the original album if you do not have it already. Petra picked apart a lot of the structure of the music, songs and backgrounds and now I can hear things in the original that I just passed by. But that's her job. It will no doubt spawn many imitators, but this has gotten better on repeated listenings, along with more listens to the original."},{"rating":"1","title":"good coffee, not so good product","review":"The coffee tasted much better in these, but:1. After two cleans, the top mica knob (I think it mica instead of glass) cannot screw back in any more.2. You have to dry inside the pot with paper towels or it will rust.

But Side 2 falls apart, sounding like a bunch of throwaways. George Martin should have recognized this, and told him to go back and write better songs to complete the record. Apparently, he didn't. Let's give it 2 1/2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst of McCartney","review":"I am a huge Paul McCartney fan, but this album is just terrible. This was the last Paul McCartney album I didn't have and I wish it had stayed that way. Maybe there are a few okay songs on here but really it is the worst he has ever done. A lot of his albums have some weak songs on them but this takes the cake. It is a pain to listen to and get through. I would still buy this CD, but not until after getting every other Paul and Wings CD. They are all better then this...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inferior Quality","review":"As soon as I opened the box, one cord came off the end connection bead and everything was one tangled mess.

Sounds of carnivals or mardi gras waft and wane.This is a very pleasant disc to listen to, and given the right frame of mind, it can be almost epic.There are few bands that conjure up the 60's and 70's the way that the bees do. The harmonies are stellar, and the songwriting is a hippies delight.I would be hard pressed to find a reason why most peole wouldn't flip out for this release.Do yourself a favor and check out the new Coral disc (roots & echos). they are right there with the bees.Exhale and enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Savage Mistake","review":"I read this book when I was new to romance reading and it's a wonder I kept reading the genre after this.

Este lamentable intento de rendir tributo a Neruda carece de todo merito musical (la música de fondo solo consigue hacer el texto ininteligible) y artístico (los interpretes que leen los poemas, en general, demuestran ser incapaces de capturar el ritmo maravilloso de Neruda).

She meets Keller Hunt who seems to converse with animals, and they understand his special signals. Lee Ann is immediately attracted to him, and when they look into each other's eyes, their attraction is somehow understood. Although Keller was injured on police duty causing him to loose his ability to speak, his touch communicates to Lee Ann all that she needs to know.This book displays quite powerfully that no words are necessary to let someone know how you feel. Although this book touches on the seriousness of a relationship, the humor and wit of Elizabeth Glenn makes the novel all the more outstanding."},{"rating":"2","title":"CUTE!","review":"WE BOUGHT THIS FOR OUR 3 YR OLDS BIG BOY BED.

It has bright and clear illustrations with the words in English on one page and in Spanish on the opposite page. I got this little treasure for my nephew for his first birthday and he never puts it down. He insists on the book being read to him over and over again. He just points to the pictures in the book so we can repeat to him the words then he looks for the same object in the house and points to it.

Unless your clitoris and vagina are *extremely* close together, this isn't going to do it for you. At all. My husband and I tried a number of different configurations, and all this toy did was irritate my urethra and completely kill the mood.It isn't even effective as a g-spot stimulator; the material is too soft and pliable to apply the necessary pressure.The only reason this gets two stars instead of one is that the bullet--unlike the attachment--is not *completely* useless. It is, however, a little weak, and not best quality (the chrome finish started chipping off pretty much immediately). The controller is sturdy and easy to use, and I like the thin, flexible cord, but...well...these features do not a good sex toy make.Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just never got the job done","review":"I've tried this product several times and it never manages to quite get the job done. Maybe it's because the vibrations are weak, or maybe it's because it's soo soft it's squishy, or maybe it's because more vibration goes to my hands then the region of interest. I don't know but it was a cheap waste of money :-("},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Small and No Power","review":"My wife was not impressed at all with this unit.

The very first use the motor seemed to be having issues or there is a short in the cord, would switch back and forth to different speeds on its own. I used new energizer batteries so I know it was not the batteries. In addition this is not hooked or long enough to reach a G spot so the only stimulation it gives is clitorial which is useless if it won't keep vibrating steady. Does provide a dampener to the pocket rocket if used in conjunction though so not totally worthless I guess."},{"rating":"1","title":"never received","review":"i never received this product.

I'm fairly new to the toy world and I was disapointed because all of the power is in the base and it doesn't distribute well to the tickler.

I've gotten more use out of the sheath alone then with whole thing. The vibrating egg vibrates too much and you cant really adjust the speed. It's either on full speed ahead or it's off. There is no real adjustable control range like there should be. And when the thing is on full speed, it vibrates so badly that I cant enjoy the gentle message that I'm supposed to get and it's so annoying that I just give up on trying and just use the sheath.Oh and it does have a strange smell at first but it does seem to go away."},{"rating":"1","title":"only the size of my thumb - too small!","review":"Actually I haven't tried this product since I didn't open it bcuz I want to return it (although returning sex toys is technically against their policy.)

Products really should have size descriptions on them. I was expecting this to be at least 4 inches long, or preferably 6 inches or more :) I love Amazon reviews and the reviews were largely favorable when I ordered this.

Virtually every one of the \\"conclusions\\" stated within it's pages are not only in dispute, but some are based on outright falsehoods invented out of whole cloth. The reader should be aware that it is nothing more than a theory and contains things listed as facts that have never been proven. I recommend that if you choose to read this at all, you should also read the critiques of this work of fiction, which should include the \\"Whitewash\\" series of books by Harold Weisberg as well as \\"Rush to Judgement\\" and \\"PLausible Denial\\", both by Mark Lane.

Your review says everyone waits for what limp bizkit is doing next and then write a negative review, but your just doing the same with those pop sh*t's. You must like all that pop sh*t. It's people like you who want more music from these crapy bands like bizkit or simple plan. And if anyone is going to respond you must be that stupid to buy this album and like this band."},{"rating":"1","title":"limp bizcrap had a greatsest hits?","review":"This is just pathetic. How cna Limp bizkit have a greatest hits album. Songs like faith, more like all of the songs suck. They even ripped off a Who song. Limp Bizcrap did not make the song. durst and Bizkit think they are sooo metsl. Well you are not. Metallica, pantera, black sabbath, etc is ral metal. This is this new hip hop crap everyone now likes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mr Durst, please tell the class, how does one spell ''BISCUIT?''","review":"Limp Bizkit? Metal? The two go together like when Dante met Bosh in a crack alley in Bogota: A real big mess...Being a true metal fan (a la, Slayer, Testament, Pissing Razors and Megadeth) I find Limp Bizkit's excuse for metal as nothing more than a pathetic joke. Metal never had rap in it's fold, and to even attempt to combine the two spectrums together would be disgracing the world of metal...and I'm sure rap fans would be equally angry.Make up your mind, Durst (your stupidly miniscule mind). Are you a metaller? Or a rapper?Oh, and I suggest that Fred goes back to school so that he can pay attention in his English language lessons so that he might just learn how to spell properly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Limp (Noodle) Bizkit Sucks....Period.....","review":"Please don't insult Pop Music by comparing it with Limp Bizkit, though any Pop Music of today sucks being as American Idol is promoting and influencing the vast majority of it!There was a time when Pop Music was some of the Best Music Produced, The Beatles being a case in point!Limp Bizkit, on the other hand reaches a whole new level of Just Bad Whatever you want to call it, because it sure isn't Music!In 2 words, They Stink, OK, I can Find a whole lot more words to describe Limp Bizkit, none of them good! Created by MTV for MTV and what's even more unbelievable is the 3, 4 and 5 star reviews here!

Korn puts out a greatest hits album and now Bizkit puts out one this year. You want to hear some good metal, hear MegaDeth,Black Label Society, Anthrax, and old Metallica.

A bunch of white guys jumping around trying to look tough (that's right Fred Durst...no one thinks you're a bad ass) and act like they're black.

There's not a single song on here worth listening to. Fred Durst is one of the biggest posers on the face of the planet. His voice is grating, his rapping is awful, and his lyrics are childish. The guitar is 2 chords, the bass is undetectable, the drumming is sloppy, and they don't need a DJ.For a good compilation, get Megadeth's \\"Back to the Start\\"For good rap-metal, listen to Faith No More, Biohazard, Rage Against the Machine, mid-period Anthrax, and Stuck Mojo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Significantly Destroying the Art of Music, One Album at a time.","review":"Seriously, why would anyone buy an album from someone who doesn't know how to spell \\"Hits\\"?

(Now thats saying something) Sometimes Durst just needs to shut up!There are many bands out there who's frontman has died. (Nirvana, Sublime, ect) Normally when that happens the band gets more respect and people start wearing shirts with dead rockstars on them. However I honestly feel that if Fred Durst were to die no one would care. I'm not saying I want him dead. I'm just saying you wouldn't see any Durst T Shirts at hot topic. Maybe a dvd documentary about him in the 5 dollar bin at Wal-mart, but thats about it.Other than that, if you don't have any of the previous Bizkit albums then you should by the hits."},{"rating":"2","title":"ztiH tsetaerG / Greatest Hitz","review":"This is the Greatest Hitz by limp bizkit, and if you don't like the band or Fred Durst then don't even bother...if you like the music, but don't have all the albums, then this is the album for you. As a fan, i already have all the previous albums, and the only reason i wanted this one was for the three previous unreleased songs.

Included are a mulititude of straps with no readily discernible purpose, but you're entirely on your own when it comes to setting it up. Also, once I adjust the strap for holding the horn in playing position, the straps gradually creep away from that setting, which means during a gig or concert I have to reset the straps three or four times. It actually becomes easier (when sitting) to simply forego the strap and just hold the horn. Additionally, the item's price is, in my opinion, way out of line for what you get and how it performs. I am not impressed, will never buy another and do not recommend this item for the reasons noted above."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Strap for tuba","review":"I am using this strap with a Conn 24J (a 6/4 tuba) and it does quite well.

Some are classical interpretations of modern songs but all of them complement each other and are consistent in style.

My evaulation of this product goes well beyond \\"I hate it\\". I have never written a negative critique of anything, but this requires a strong comment.I purchased this battery as an extra for my new and very expensive Samsung Camera. After I inserted it into my camera, two metal tags that were superficially stuck on the side of the new battery became un-stuck lodging the battery permanently in my camera. using tweezers and jewelers screwdrivers, I eventually pried the battery out of the camera. This process obviously destroyed the battery, but also badly damaged my camera. I contacted the dealer and they wrote me a totally BS form letter offering to exchange my faulty battery for another faulty battery.

As with his other recordings, John captures the spirit and the meaning of the music with an infectious passion that stirs the listener very deeply. The people he sings about are very real, their situations believable, their feelings human. He puts the blood and breath back into their lives and washes away time with the fresh tears of his audience. You can't help but feel for the broken souls of Galipoli in 'The Band Played Waltzing Matilda', or feel John's abiding love for his deceased father in 'The Old Man'. I have the priveledge of knowing John McDermott. I know him as a caring, down-to-earth individual with a heart as warm as his music.

In fact, I could not finish it. Owens claims to be a \\"centrist\\" but now leans far to the right.

What McCarthy has done is given us a series of short animal behavior stories taken from scientific literature but run through her considerable wit and sprightly--even sassy--literary style. The author has a thesis of sorts, but the true message of this book is that anyone who believes animal behavior to be simplistic or consistent across species is ridiculously mistaken and that no one will ever go broke betting on the complexity of the natural world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Various Artists: Unvailed '97","review":"Track Listing:1.

Very easy to set up and fold down, and the rolling bag works well on paved surfaces. The canopy weights (not available from Amazon, but I found them online) are a good idea if you'll be using it in breezy sites. Do be aware, the description is a bit misleading; the 10' x 10' dimension refers to the footprint of the sloped legs. The canopy itself is 8' x 8'. This canopy is large enough to comfortably shade 4 people, yet light enough (36 lbs.) for me to easily lift out of the trunk. Variflex also makes a heavier duty 10' x 10' canopy with vertical legs, but it's nearly double the weight at 62 lbs.

I'm going to see if the blade sharpener who comes around to the shop can do anything to solve the problem, but I'm not holding out much hope.

This show has some new songs which are great to hear and there are some re-workings of some classics. Go Insane is really awesome. I give this four stars because of three things. One, the camera work is weird and not always in sync and has a lot of audience shots who weirdly clap at odd times in the middle of songs as if on cue from a monitor somewhere. Two, NO BASS PLAYER. Someone in another review complained about the bassist. Well, that can be explained because there ISN'T ONE. It's really noticeable in Go Your Own Way. Three, Stevie doesn't really do anything. Her appearance comes off as a novelty.

Even the duet with Stevie, \\"Never Going Back Again\\" seemed labored and unrehearsed. Lindsey Buckingham is one of my favorite guitarists and he let it fly a few times on this video. But overall I'm disappointed. It would be better to buy one of the FM videos instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks...together again","review":"In my opinion, Lindsey Buckingham is severly and criminally under-rated as a guitar player. He has one of the smoothest tones my ears have ever heard. His solos are so fluid they just reach in you and suck you in. A very incredible guitar player and on the classic rock, and melodic level he is a personal favorite of mine. And watching him perform live is always a treat. This show is extrodinary, fantastic son selection, and Stevie Nicks does appear for a couple of tunes.

The color is a nice neutral that blends in well with your decor. Minimal assembly. I'm a total klutz and it was very easy. What's most important is that my cats love it. Even the one who shows minimal interest in playtime is all over it. It's taller than most scratching posts, which is good because it promotes exercise.

I have found him perched on top of it - that is it. For me it was a total waste of money. I would suggest you find out 1st if your kitten/cat is a vertical or horizontal scratcher.

The sisal isn't the ropey stuff that normally gets wrapped around carpeted scratching posts. It's really smooth feeling so maybe that's why. On the plus side it looks great and it's really tall, which would be nice for my cat that likes to stretch all the way up when she scratches, but no dice.

My cats just naturally took to it, and it required no coaxing on my part to get them interested in it. Both cats have been scratching on this post multiple times a day for two years straight! There is some small signs of wear, but nothing that isn't to be expected, and I think it's held up very well for how much my cats use it. My cats usually sit or stand at the base and scratch, but sometimes they also like to sit on the top and hang their paws down and scratch. This scratching post has never once tipped over.

If you have carpeted floors, this may not be an issue for you.I will update if Amazon/manufacturer sends screws that fit better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great post...if my cat would just use it","review":"I don't know what the deal is with my cat but she steers clear of this scratching post. I've had it for about 3 months now, and I have tried putting treats on it, dousing it in catnip spray, changing the location, but all to no avail. She strolls right by it and scratches the couch - ugh! If my cat liked it this would definitely be a 5-star purchase - it's sturdy, tall, and looks pretty nice compared to other posts, but my cat seems to prefer our other ugly sisal/carpet post. Too bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Recommend","review":"I have two older cats of my own, one is 9 and one is 10. The 10 year old uses it, however the 9 yr old is a vertical scratcher and prefers the cardboard floor scratchers. BUT then I ended up with TEN foster kittens ranging in ages 12-24 weeks and WOW!! All I can say is TY for this product!! They all have taken to it and all of them use this rather than my fairly new furniture. Yes, occasionally they still get the furniture but mainly they use this daily and several times per day! These kittens will be great pets for their new owners as they are already 'trained'."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only thing she scratches!","review":"First kitten and only scratching post I've ever had. All I can say is it gets used and keeps her from scratching anything else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seriously loved by my kittens","review":"I just got a couple of kittens and wanted them to have a good place to scratch immediately. Frankly, it is unbelievable how much they like this thing! They were only 9 weeks and they immediately started scratching on it. Put their favorite toys on top and they scramble up to grab them. It is very well built and gives the impression it will withstand the test of time. I just ordered the perch for the top so I will see how they do with that.This is really much more popular with them than any other scratching object on the same floor of the house. The upstairs will probably be getting one soon to prevent any other temptation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cat loves it!","review":"This was my last resort after my cat started scatching my new sofa.

Great investment!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm Happy...Hope my Cat is!","review":"Pleased to report that this scratching post was much larger than I thought - and is quite sturdy. I've taken my cat's paws and \\"demonstrated\\" scratching... and set it next to one of the tapestry chairs he's shredded. My DE-CLAWED rescue kitty \\"uses\\" it... BUT I HAVEN'T SEEN THE ONE WITH CLAWS USE IT!!! It does have a better \\"texture\\" and scratching \\"noise\\" than the chair, so I'm hopeful!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST cat post EVER!!!!","review":"No kidding, we will NEVER buy another cat scratching post other than this one. We were a bit leary because of the cost, but it is WELL worth every penny. First of all, my cats love this thing....they were so excited when we first got it and months later still use it faithfully. It is heavy and does not tip over, has a very neat appearance so although it's large, it fits well with decor and doesn't detract terribly from it like the cheap carpet posts. Also, it DOES NOT SHED. Amazing, but it doesn't. This is the only post we'll ever buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very sturdy and durable","review":"My cats have never been furniture scratchers (unless its leather, that is a completely different ball game!) but they do however, like to dig at the carpet. It has cost me a lot of money in the past when moving out of apartments. Since those days, I've always kept a scratcher, and they know that's what it's there for. The top also doubles a pedestal. For cats that like the perch feature...I think it's a really good investment of $50, it's made with the best quality sisal paneling I have seen. No carpeting that will eventually be dug away like other cheap scratchers. It is very hard to find a scratcher of this quality locally.Sometimes I will sprinkle catnip or valerian root from a capsule on the scratcher and it will rekindle my cats' relationship with the post. I have it conveniently located in a corner and they still use it, despite it being hidden away.I highly suggest this scratching post due to its durability and price."},{"rating":"2","title":"SCRATCHING POST REVIEWS","review":"IT TOOK MY CAT ABOUT 2 WEEKS TO START USING THE POST EVEN WITH CATNIP;BUT IM NOT SURE IF MY CAT RESPONDS TO CATNIP ANY WAY.THE POST IS VERY STURDY AND WILL LAST FOR A LONG TIME.MY CAT USES IT OCCASIONALY BUT PREFERS TO SCRATCH THE HELL OUT OF MY SOFA.THE PRODUCT IS GREAT AND I HUNG TOYS FROM IT TO ATTRACT HER BUT SHE ONLY GOES TO IT WHEN SHE FEELS LIKE IT.ABOUT 50 BUCKS INCLUDING SHIPPING WAS A VERY GOOD PRICE AND I SAW IT ON OTHER SITES FOR MORE THAN $75 NOT INCLUDING SHIPPING.IT PROBABLY WILL LAST A LIFETIME-HUMAN."},{"rating":"2","title":"good scratching post","review":"Post is sturdy and cat climbs up and down and jumps easily without tipping or knocking it over.

A worthy investment that I would make again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not your typical scratching post","review":"Our cat (big cat) loves this deeeeeluxe sturdy tall scratching post and can finally get the stretch he needs. Plus he can get all four paws on it and sort of scale it. It's very plain looking with a solid sisal covering which I like as opposed to the sisal rope and shag carpeted scratching posts. For a scratching post it's attractive (in my opinion anyway). We had a dinky sisal rope post that was too small and unraveling. As our cat was unfamiliar with the new post I rubbed a little catnip into it and left his old post next to it. In the beginning he'd still go back from time to time to the little one as it was his \\"security\\" post but eventually (within a couple of weeks--possibly less) he used only the new one. Old one got tossed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two paws up!","review":"Scratching post is fantastic for my extra large cat named Terrel. This post can accomodate his enormous stretch and is plenty strong to endure his sharpening his nails with his strong muscular pulls. The look of the post is also very complimentary to my decor. As my title of the review says--Two Paws Up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great, GREAT accessory. If you have cats, get this NOW","review":"I have three cats. I bought one of these posts a couple years ago after reading good reviews, however I had my doubts that the cats would use it. They do, often. Sits by the window in my kitchen and they love to perch on top of it after scratching and watch me, or gaze outside at the birds. Tall enough that they can stretch out to their full length when scratching. Also VERY stable; they can climb it with ease when they want to sit on top. Hasn't entirely stopped the ongoing, methodical destruction of my living room furniture, but it has slowed it substantially, LOL. Maybe I should get a second one. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a Winner!","review":"Knowing how finicky cats can be about any and everything, I ordered the scratching post with more than a little skepticism. The reviews were so favorable though that I decided to take a chance. Mine came through the Christmas rush and unfortunately the top of it was cracked but no matter, my husband put it together very quickly and we set it up in our family room. I dusted a little catnip around it and dangled a toy from the top and she was immediately hooked. Our sofa was her favorite piece of furniture to scratch on, but no more. She goes around the sofa to get to the post. She loves it and so do I. I may order another for the basement. This one is definitely a winner. Thanks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is an appropriately named scratching post--Ultimate","review":"Our cat has gone through many scratching posts and has used them until they are threadbare, but all of them were shorter and less sturdy. Now that she has the SmartCat Ultimate Scratching Post, she doesn't understand why there isn't one in each room. Yes, that would make her ecstatic. She can fully extend her body on this post, and she loves to stretch. No worry about it tipping over, which the shorter ones have a tendency to do. You can't go wrong getting this post. It is well worth the money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"SmartCat Ultimate Scratching Post","review":"This works well for cats who are taller and want to stretch out.

But for my two big male cats I needed a scratching post that was tall enough for them to really stretch out and sturdy enough not to fall over when they put all their weight on it. This scratching post is perfect for them. I finally got them to start using it by putting treats on top which forced them to really stretch out to get them, and in the process they realized what the whole thing was for. It even stays upright when one of my cats \\"climbs\\" up the post to get to the treats, since he isn't tall enough to reach the treats in the middle of the top with his hind legs on the ground. He has also figured out how to get on top and he likes to sit up there for a bit. Overall this a high quality scratching post and a good value for the money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of hype...!","review":"I was shocked to find a post that could be 4.5-5 stars on Amazon after hundreds of reviews. I bought one for my new cat thinking it would be a sure thing. My cat could not be less interested. I dangle his toys in front of it (per user suggestions) and he has on multiple occasions sunk his claws in - and had no interest. Even spreading catnip on it has had no effect. The only thing he seems to like clawing is my carpeting! Very unfortunate.Additionally, it should be known that this post is meant for hard surfaces only. On carpeting it tips VERY easily. I have a few spots in my apartment with hard floor thankfully, but that also limits where I can put it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good purchase!!","review":"This product is sturdy (an 8-lb cat can literally climb and hang on it with no problems) and even looks nice in the living room. Oh, AND it's the first scratching post this cat has ever actually used! Has little rubber feet so it doesn't slide on a hardwood floor. I would give it five stars, except I think the base is a little cheaply made - it's in two halves you screw together, and they don't always stay in the shape they should."},{"rating":"2","title":"My kitten loves it","review":"Helps to save my furniture as my kitten loves to run over and scratch it after she has a meal. It is very sturdy and with its seat attachment on top she has learned to like looking out of windows.

I wanted this to work! I have 3 cats who all love to scratch and not one of them will even look at this thing. They won't even go up to sniff it. I bought it to replace the sisal wrapped post on their cat tree that is falling apart from overuse, so I know they like vertical scratching on sisal. While I was setting this post up, they showed no interest, and played with the box it came in instead (just like a kid, right?). I really didn't think they would hesitate to scratch on this one, but they actually walk AROUND it to scratch on the couch instead. I've tried enticing them to use it with feather toys, etc., but they won't touch it.Having said that, it is a quality post. The base is wide enough to make it sturdy, and it's a nice height. It would totally be worth the price if the cats would just USE IT. I'll probably end up donating it to a cat rescue group."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cat Scratcher Extrodinaire","review":"this product was put together and being used within 5 minutes of it being delivered even my cat that used to scratch the wall now scratches this tower.

This scratch post is VERY sturdy (you will have to put it somewhere in your house where the base has support though; like the corner of a room or near some furniture- it can slip/move around if it doesn't have support).Once I sprayed it a few times with catnip spray the cats were ALL over it, now they don't go anywhere near the sofa!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This is the best scratching post around!

It is well made and lasts for many months.The only quibble I have with it is the top which is really too small for a cat to be comfortable on, as well as being slippery since its not covered with sisal. What I do is screw the top of a much wider piece from another brand of cat scratching post onto the top. This might cause it to occasionally fall over when the cats are being particularly rambunctious, but it seems they really do appreciate having a wider top to stretch out on."},{"rating":"2","title":"SmartCat Scratching Post","review":"I'm happy with the smartcat scratching post because my cat seems to really like it.

I've moved this thing all over trying to find their favorite scratching spot, I've tried catnip and playing around it, but no dice. They just aren't into the woven sisal... they'll walk over to the rope posts instead. Every so often they'll scratch this, but I guess they just don't get as much pleasure out of it.So on the upside, it's tall enough for your cats to get a good stretch and scratch, if they actually like it.

They reach way up to the top of the post for a long, powerful back stretch.Assembly: so simple that I assembled it myself in 10 minutes.One Caution: there is a single screw head that protrudes a bit at the very bottom of the base where it contacts the floor. If a person drags the post to a new spot over wood floors, there is the possibility of of a scratch (heh heh). Felt protector tape or subbing a flat screw for the rounded one included in the kit would solve this.

Luckily I do some woodworking on the side so I had the tools, however the product description said nothing about this, and there were no instructions included.

In fact, the top and bottom parts are made from several different shades of MDF and sandwiched together - functional, but extremely cheap looking. Made in China and it certainly looks like it.

Why didn't thy just cover the top in sisal too??? If they had this product would be PERFECT. The perch accessory just doesn't look like it would do it. the whole thing needs to be covered in sisal so they can climb all the way to the top! But oh well. It does the job.

They have tried standing off of the slick base to scratch the post with their front claws, but it's awkward for them. They've also tried laying on top of the base to scratch the post with their front paws, but they slide around on the hard plastic surface. As a result, they now just ignore this item.

It's not made of carpet, so it doesn't shed. Carpeted posts also reinforce to cats that it's okay to scratch carpet, so I hate them. This post is much bigger than I thought it would be, but it does allow them to have a full body stretch/arch. My cat is also very heavy and he hasn't even come close to knocking it over. The corners of the couch are currently covered in foil, so I don't know if it's preventing couch damage. I hope to one day remove the foil and live in a normal looking house. Both older cats are enjoying it. I'd buy it again and was definitely worth the price tag."},{"rating":"2","title":"my cat **loves** it- worth the money","review":"I have a very fat (20 lb) cat that started tearing up my sofa.

The base is solid, so even on medium carpet it doesn't rock. Even when she attacks it with all 4 paws and climbs partway up it. The 32\\" height is wonderful as it lets my 12 lb domestic shorthair stretch herself out fully. The wood is a nice neutral color and could easily be painted. Assembly was fairly easy.Make sure you put this post somewhere that your cat will pass by it frequently. I think you'll find that if they use it once, they'll quickly start using it a few times per day.

I would have saved the expense of getting a new carpet, thanks to her, if I had invested earlier. It is well worth every penny and I am sure she would agree as she hits it up every time she walks past it as it gives her a good stretch and keeps her nails just how she likes em.

This post is very sturdy and almost tall enough for him (his reach is a bit higher than the post), but unfortunately he's not very enthusiastic about this scratching post. He'll scratch it, but not as enthusiastically as he scratches the sisel post on our cat tree. I think it's because the material is a bit pokey, the type that will lodge underneath human fingernails with major ouch (almost like a wood chip). He prefers the softer sisel rope.The other cat in the household, on the other hand, LOVES this post and will dig all 4 paws in it at the same time and hang off it. It may simply be a material preference between cats."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cats like it!","review":"This cat scratching post was just what we needed and we are satisfied. The height of the post and the sturdy base are the best features about this product. Because of its height, the cats are able to stretch all the way out and they really enjoy it. The base makes it very sturdy and I don't need to worry about it tipping over. The only complaint we have is, that the screw that attach the top to the post and the post to the base stripped and are loose now - we will have to use some different screws to attach them tighter. This problem currently doesn't interfere with the use of the post though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for a big cat","review":"I looked high and low for a post that a big cat ( 20lbs) could use - he was using the wood work because the old post kept falling over.

This little 6 pound chainsaw has destroyed a doorframe. When I purchased a new sofa recently it became clear within a few hours that she was interested in shredding this as well. I have tried sprays, plastic nail caps, cardboard scratching pads, carpeted scratching 'houses', squirting her with water....nothing worked.I hesitated to spend $50 on a scratching post but did not want to have to budget for a new sofa every year so I ordered this one. SUCCESS!! Immediately upon unpacking and placing next to the sofa, my little chainsaw went directly to it and fell in love. It is really well constructed and stands up to her clawing and is sturdy enough to not tip over. She ONLY scratches this now. The doorframe she destroyed is no longer interesting and more importantly, neither is my furniture.I highly recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Here's the thing.","review":"This Sunflower/ Surf's Up set is really good and everything, but what you NEED to know is this: If you pass over this album, do yourself a favor and download A Day in the Life of a Tree. Of all the songs I've ever heard, none come close to the heart-aching beauty of this track. Only Big Star's Kanga-roo even comes close to how mind-boggingly singular this song is, and while that is without a doubt Alex Chilton's finest moment, it pales next to this, Brain Wilson's last great song.Seriously, get that track."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fell in love with This Whole World","review":"It was the summer of 1974. I was 16 and brought my first copy of Sunflower home from the record store. I could not wait to rip the wrapper off the album and place it on my record player. The only problem is it took me a week to get past \`This Whole World'. Carl's voice and the boy's harmonies along with the catchy breaks and the bells, pipes and organ just blew me away. I later got around to listening to the rest of the album and also fell in love with 'Our Sweet Love' and 'At My Window'. There is not a week track on Sunflower and this album remains my all time favorite Beach Boy's album. Surf's up on the other hand took some getting use to. I bought my first copy of this album around the same time in 1974. The three Brian Wilson songs are the best tracks on the album."},{"rating":"2","title":"a good bargain","review":"If you're considering buying this disk, you're probably already a big Beach Boys fan or else very curious. So, the fact that some of the songs are pretty damn cheesy shouldn't bother you too much. For fans, it's all part of the fun. Sunflower is a classic, beautiful album by any standards--the songwriting and production is the best since Pet Sounds. Surf's Up is just a hodgepodge of ridiculous things (e.g.\\"Student Demonstration Time\\") and great songs (e.g. \\"Surf's Up\\"). Remastered sound and artwork looks great--all in all, you'll be pleased."},{"rating":"2","title":"With hardly any Brian in sight they work wonders.....","review":"Till I die and Surf's up are the best songs, but over all, Sunflower is the best album of the two and actually one of the best BB albums.Of course one has to confirm that Brian was the genius of the group (and I agree) but Sunflower is simply a great early 70's album by any standard. Great musicianship, great singing and (even) great arranging of instruments. Just compare it to any a;lbum of 1970 / 71 and it will stand up. It's just that they had a legacy that pursued them (to this day, I might add...)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surf's Up is a great album!","review":"I mostly got this CD because Surf's Up is a great album and I wanted the digital copy as I already had the record album and still have it.

I would have just got the Surf's Up CD but I could not find it available any where so I took the second choice. I am a great fan of the Beach Boys and I have seen them 6 times now in concert. What great memories of these times! I say get this and enjoy the music you really cannot go wrong!

It's also a very pretty number. \\"Our sweet love\\" is a personal favorite and has incredible moments that surprise you. I can't say that i like \\"Cool, Cool, water\\", it get's old fast.

After hearing for years how great this album is, I am not disappointed. In fact, I'm overjoyed. Dennis Wilson is the hero of this record, contributing some of his best songs and performances. Bruce Johnston also comes up big time. Surf's Up isn't as strong, and the first eight songs are overshadowed a bit by the last two songs, the overwhelming double shot of Til I Die and Surf's Up. The album is still really good and among the most consistent Beach Boys discs. This and In Concert are the most essential of the new twofers. Thanks Capitol for finally getting your act together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beach Boy's Prime post pop post 60's work.","review":"Single bar reviewer (understandably) might be rating on Hit singleability. but the Beach Boys ventured into Art/Pop Rock with these two albums. When a band goes in that direction, the desired result is an album that's very contextual; meant to be listened all at once to be best enjoyed. Sunflower especialy will just enthrall you after focused repeated listenings! The group was becoming more democratic, other members writting songs 'like' the kinds of songs Brian was writting. Dennis's songs are fantastic especially \\"Forever\\", good as any ballad from Pet Sounds. Surfs up not as strong, but what's good on it (and Sunflower) are some of the very best and most artfully written, produced and performed songs the group ever did. \\"Till I die\\" is amazing and better sounding than Brian's post Beach Boys versions (ie. live at Roxy) \\"Long Promised Road\\" best Carl Song ever!Rock history is here."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Post-Brian Twofer to Die For","review":"Finally, as Capitol buddies-up the Beach Boys catalogue for re-release, a twofer that, for the most part, matches up to the band's best early work.\\"Sunflower\\" has a load of pop gems - democratically written and performed by the band's various members and \\"Surf's Up\\" - thanks in large part to Brian's album-ending contributions ('Til I Die & the title track) ranks as one of the Beach Boys most artistic and poignant releases ever.Littered with more-than-listenable music over the course of the disc, Beach Boys fanatics have known about these two albums for years.

Even while ommiting some of the more lurid details of America's most famous family, we are treated to the all too fammilar headline scandals.The idea that somebody rehashed them into a book and actually got it published does lend credibility to the notion that our society is very voyeristic and too addicted to trash. We've heard about the William Kennedy Smith rape trial and aquittal ad nauseum now, and problaly don't need to have it repeated 8 billion times.This is not the book for people who are in pursuit of a balanced and compassionate portait of the younger Kennedys.Please don't waste your time and money on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"No new information and poorly compiled","review":"This is an introduction into the Kennedy family, but beyond that the book is not very helpful. The author Jay David Andrews drew most of his material from other popular books (such as All Too Human by Edward Klein) and articles about the Kennedy family. Andrews does not divulge deeply into the Kennedy family, the myths, truths, or provide any new insight or information to make this book worth reading.

I'd like to point out, though, that all thesauruses are for writers, and calling this a \\"writer's thesaurus\\" doesn't make it any more so.All in all, this is an average thesaurus, but the essays are a distraction and their tone is too personal and opinionated for a reference work.

I found it a great read on two fronts: 1) You get a look at how each coach prepares for his game, some are completely hands on while others have great trust in their assistants and just overlook everything. 2) The part I enjoyed most about the book was how different schools/coaches look at their players. Some of the coaches it was win at all costs having no regard for classes or much else. Fortunately there were more coaches who went along the lines of caring about the student will promote winning. Alot of people think big time colleges are just football factories, but after reading this book you realize more schools care more about there students beinging students first and athletes second.A must read for any college football fan!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wide Right","review":"This book reads like a journal. It's a good comparative look at how different coaches run their programs; however, it's basically the same 15 page story chapter after chapter.

I don't think there is a simple interesting quote in the entire book. Often times the author will lead you down a path and then not deliver. The \\"feel-good\\" stories about each coach in the beginning of each chapter all sort of read alike and they don't relate very well to the behind-the-scenes angle that the author is trying to take.I was extremely disappointed.

If you're ever home sick or for a holiday, or anything outside your normal schedule, it's a pain to tell it that you're home and yes it really should heat the house.But now that it's about eight years old, it just decided to stop turning on our furnace. The display registers the correct actual and target temperatures, but even if they are several degrees apart, the furnace will not turn on. If we remove it from the wall and replace it (as if to change the batteries), then the furnace finally kicks on. Today, even that stopped helping - I've replaced it on the wall to no avail - no heat! I'm freezing here while waiting for my new Honeywell thermostat to arrive."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Lux TX500B is TERRIBLE.","review":"We bought two of these last year and both of them have issues.

The other day we were going up tp bed and the temperature was set to 74, and the AC was still blowing and it was actually 63. Our little baby was freezing in his room.

The TX500 is more compact and I think should be your first choice if you just need weekday and weekend programs.I did like the push-button display light on the more expensive and larger TX1500, but didn't appreciate the separate Saturday and Sunday programming. Since my hot water system has no fan, I just connected the red, green, and white wires and left the fan switch on auto per the instructions. That worked fine for the TX500, but no heat came from the TX1500 until after I changed the fan switch to OFF.

Lagrene's (and Luc's) Duet album shows up on my mp3 player between Beethoven piano sonatas and Green Day.You're not just getting Lagrene here; it's truly an ensemble effort and isn't merely a showcase for Bireli's gorgeous talent. The recording itself is great quality; clear, lively and dynamic with a terrific and varied selection of songs.

It's been to the track numerous times so it's seen maximum heat. Still looks and sounds great.SOUNDI think it's just right. Yes, it's perhaps 25% louder than stock. It's a bit deeper, too, but not tinny or \\"bees in a can\\" sounding.

I'm a Chris Potter fan, so at first I thought I might be dissapointed in his replacement, but McCaslin's playing is flat out amazing. McCaslin and Dave Douglass have excellent chemistry and there are several songs that feature intertwining solos and melodies. The song writing is great on this album there is a lot of space and everyone which gives all the members of the band a chance to express themselves. There is nothing radically new happening here, but if you want to hear an album with creative song writing and excellent playing then pick this one up. Highlights on the album are Culture Wars and Elks club. Apparently Elks club was inspired on a recent trip to Banf where Dave encountered an Elk while writing the song on vacation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Collection of Music!","review":"This is a wonderful collection of music with an unusual mystic sound.

In the four weeks that I have had the unit, there have been four scheduled weekly test and a number of alert and watch transmissions, none of which activated the radio. I have been unable to get any response from Oregon Scientific customer support. I would not recommend this unit if you are looking for something that will alert you to a potential hazardous situation.

I bought the Kodak V570 camera for many reasons - one of them being its sleek size. Early 2006 my parents had bought the camera, and also bought this cute black leather case to go with it. When I recently purchased my camera, I looked for the same case, couldn't find it - so I bought this one instead. BIG MISTAKE! The case is way too wide for the V series Kodak cameras, which completely negates their advantage of being so sleek and compact. Arrghhhhhh. . . ."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works","review":"The case is a good fit for these type of Kodak cameras. The only thing that I would comment on is the fact that it is a little too long for a V603 camera, however I believe this is due to the fact that the \\"V series\\" cameras may vary in length. Most importantly though, this is the only camera case that I have found that fits a camera with these size deminsions. Everything else is too wide and too square.

The Lasombra Clan Trilogy was infinitely better and written well."},{"rating":"1","title":"A huge disappointment","review":"I had such high hopes for this book/CD based on the reviews. While I speak Spanish, I hoped to augment my vocabulary in this particular area.

I contacted Amazon about this, and they are supposed to get a new shipment in, in early September. This will also be from the same manufacturer from Canada. I hope they get it right this time. I am getting a new copy when they come in.

If you have never been to college and have no concept of when semisters run, or that students rent houses with there friends, this book may be of help.

Milo couldn't get along with Hank Aaron, who never had an unkind word for anyone. But apparently Milo felt Hank's little home run chase was overshadowing....Milo. If he's still working, I'm glad it's with the Astros, where he has limited influence and exposure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bitterness and Megalomania - What's Not to Love?","review":"The two dominating themes of this book are 1) how much Milo hates Harry Caray, and 2) how much Milo LOVES Milo. As to the first, who really cares or wants to read about an extremely nasty fued between these guys? Sorry, Milo, but it is most certainly NOT to your credit that you keep bashing on the guy even after he's dead. As to the second point, anyone who has actually had to endure Milo's broadcasts of Astros games will already know this, as he treats this subject as far more important than the game he is allegedly broadcasting. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"bitter and uninteresting","review":"It is amazing that milo has been in the buisness as long as he has and has nothing interesting to say. The only question i had after reading this book, is why was it written. furthermore, why was it published.

Women, places and deeds all come alive under the skillful pen of Wiley. What might have been only set of dry facts laid upon a previous layer of drier facts springs to life for the reader. We are carried into Mary Boykin Chestnut's frustration with those around her or the distress Virginia Clay experienced as she sought to bear a child.

Good, pure, traditional roots-country-rockabilly is hard to find and able female vocalists are even more rare. But that's where this album falls short. The playing is competent (although the energy was a little lacking), the songs were well written, but Kim's vocals forced me to take this one out of the CD player after just a few songs. What's with the exaggerated voice? Why not just sing? Isn't the goal to entertain, not irritate? Why doesn't someone in the band say something? In all fairness, maybe Kim comes across better live.

However, defending a particular person against false claims of abuse is not the same as denying the reality of sexual abuse in general. Also, not all erotic relationships commonly seen as 'sexual' abuse are involuntary or harmful to the minor, as has been rediscovered through the work of Rind, Tromovitch and Bauserman, and others.Realism is a matter of taking all sides, facets and dimensions seriously.

In every paragraph the author, Peter Deleo, portrays himself as making brilliant decisions when if fact I think he made some very poor decisions. His tone is preachy and condescending and it appears that he cribbed a lot of his constant explanations from other sources. Deleo may be strong willed and very lucky, but good luck and lots of bad decisions doesn't make a good book.

That said, there are two phases of his experience where factual information is available for comparison with his story. These are the periods just before the crash and after he emerged from the mountains. In both cases, Peter's narrative deviates from the facts reported by the NTSB. Because his account deviates from known facts, it calls into question the accuracy of the remainder of his story.Repaetedly in his tale, he kept pushing himself because the lives of Lloyd and Wave depended on him surviving and finding help. He mentioned this so often that you had to wonder if this book wasn't a form of self flagellation for reasons only known to Peter himself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!!!","review":"The fact that Peter Deleo survived the 1994 small plane crash in the Sierra Nevadas is incredible enough, but to struggle day by day, walking toward what you hope is civilization despite painful injuries is mind boggling!

Although this particular saga is unusual in translation in that it occurs outside Iceland, it is part of a larger body of such works which occurred in Iceland in its day.A number of important things distinguish this saga:1) Violence. The Orkneys lacked democratic legal institutions found elsewhere in the Norse world and essentially amounted to a purely feudal system. Hence there were none of the checks on violence that occurred in Iceland, Norway, or Sweden.2) Christianity. The Orkneyinga saga occurs after the conversion of Norway, and it is distinctly Christian (almost proto-Calvanist) in its outlook.3) Location. It is the only saga to my knowledge which is set in Orkney, Shetland, and North Scotland for the most part.Hence I think that this is an important saga to recommend all saga-lovers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Research","review":"This is a marvelous book.

I reckon that's a big shame because the ALF DVDs show everything that's wrong with releasing syndicated episodes. The cuts are VERY recognizable, and not only that, they've been cut even further to remove any references to songs.

These characters are almost cheesy in their wholesomeness--it's very hard to suspend that much disbelief.As for the DVD set, I've heard that this version is somewhat cut, but since I don't really remember the originals, I thought this version was just fine.

This annoying banter is possibly funny the first time but you are subjected to it EVERY time you view the DVD!What a shame. I waited so long for ALF on DVD and get nothing but disappointment.

Some episodes have been cut by as much as five to seven minutes! This is a shame because the DVDs themselves are designed nicely, the menues have intros by ALF himself - cute. But what use is this if you don't get what you paid for in the first place - the episodes?"},{"rating":"1","title":"No good!","review":"The makers (Lionsgate) have been thinking of profit instead of their customers.

They've edited just about every episode in the season. The original aired versions that I have taped have more in them than these DVD versions. IF they decide to put out the second season (a big if, apparently) I will probably only buy it if it has \\"Complete Second Season\\" attached to the title. The only redeeming quality about the DVD is the gag reel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Comedy of the 80s","review":"I loved this show at 12 years old when I would rush home from basketball practice to catch it at 8:00pm on Monday nights.

You know all the jokes, and you know the Tanner family. You do not need me to explain to you how iconic and memorable Gordon Shumway is.I own all 4 seasons, and this is indeed the best. How ever, the only real problem with it, is that these episodes are released in shortened versions. There is 2-3 minutes missing from every episode. Instead of giving us the full, unedited episodes, we get the syndication release. This would not be so bad... except the idiots who made these DVDs left the edited out pieces in the closing credits! I mean... come on... really?!Awesome show... will keep these DVDs until the day I die. I just hope one day they smarten up, and release them all unedited!"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Starring Michu\\" ???","review":"I was appalled that this very funny series was put out on DVD using the syndicated episodes. Guess I'll have to buy the one from Amazon-Germany, as per another reviewer's info, which reportedly contains the first-run network eps.But what REALLY got my attention is the billing of the Hungarian actor (the then world's shortest man) who was only occasionally used when the \\"full body\\" of ALF was needed on camera. Who wrote these blurbs for Amazon -- Michu's agent? I mean, we don't see the heart, soul and voice of ALF on screen, either (Paul Fusco), but he should certainly have top billing over someone who was basically a stuntman in a costume. Bizarre."},{"rating":"1","title":"need a lot of work...","review":"It was diappointing to learn that these are the stripped down versions, as many other people are pointing out. Also, what I would consider a necessary feature is missing from this DVD set: play all. Especially with these chopped up eps, do you want to go back and click play every 21 minutes? Any TV show should have a play all feature so that you can just watch all the eps on the DVD straight through without interruption (gold stars to the first tv series that only plays the theme song at the beginning of the first ep on each disc during a play all). In Living Color has it and School House Rock even has two versions: straight through or shuffle. The other bonus materials are fun, but do not at all compensate for the lacking content and playall feature :(If you really really must have it, then enjoy... but if you're unsure or devout, you'll be disappointed and annoyed."},{"rating":"1","title":"The show is ok.

I have the originals on vhs and there are parts on the vhs tapes that do not appear on the DVD set, so that sucks. Lions Gate should be ashamed of what they call the first season of ALF.

After all, how bad could a 15-year-old show be at this point? I'll buy this set just for the unaired pilot episode, but if Seasons 2, 3 & 4 are also the edited versions then I'll take a pass and just watch my old VHS tapes.

Set in Las Vegas, Bernhardt couples this interesting setting with an odd, Edgar Allan Poe angle as each murder adds to the killer's strange goal. Susan Pulaski, the main character, is a deeply flawed woman, but Bernhardt manages to make her quite sympathetic and even likable. The aid from her autistic friend adds originality to the genre, and makes the book a lot more interesting (and also makes Susan a lot more endearing). The shifting points of view detracted from the novel, here, unfortunately, and as a whole, the book was rather out of the realm of realism. Still, those things aside, on the whole it was an enjoyable and entertaining mystery and I must say that I am looking forward to the sequel!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dark Eye is a Formula Book","review":"I've read and liked Bernhardt before, but IMO this one is a real stinker and not worthy of his talents. The heroine ? is not a bit likeable, in fact I found her disgusting in more ways than one. She did not act like a professional, yelling and talking when she should have not spoken. Also, why is Patrick in this? We're led to believe he is a better profiler (more experienced since he wrote the book) and yet he seems to be there for her to gawk at and to supply a love interest. Like one of the others who commented I am still hanging in there since I want to see how much worse it can get. Mr. Bernhardt, please don' t do any more serial killers; it just is not your genre. BTW, Capitol Murder was another one where the author seemed to enjoy writing like a Romance novelist, with the ridiculous sex being over the top.

When the psycho-killer's actions are stomach-turning and the heroine is so screwed up, the novel-read turns into mental images that linger in your head like ooze left in the fridge for years.

Actual story is not. I feel as though the writing is incredibly controlled and the whole plot just does not flow for me.

I figured this radio would be able to separate the stations. (2) to discover new stations on shortwave.It failed to do either, despite much experimentation with the antenna and external antenna. The FM NPR station is completely swamped by the country music station - feeble, considering I can hear it perfectly in my car in my garage, and this radio is on the 3rd floor of a house sitting high on a hill. As for the shortwave, I only picked up a couple of stations. Other annoyance: cannot listen to the stations as you tune it, as you would be able to with analog tuning.

It performs like other receivers connected to long-wire or random-wire external antennas. Another point is the ease of operation. The control buttons are straight-forward, with minimal use of \\"dual-function\\" controls. It has direct-frequncy entry, as well as \\"up - down\\" tuning/ scanning functions.

The musicianship and sound quality of the recording is second to none but the album is completely lifeless and will not hold your attention. The instrumental tracks are virtually \\"backing tracks\\" that will have you waiting for a solo or something that shows a flicker of life which never comes. The songs with lyrics are just plain corny, and not in a good Junior Brown kind of way. The highlight of the album is definetly the steel guitar playing of Jim Murphy.

As far as other reviews concerning tone and the lack of fire, well, I don't even know how to address that. Redd has one of the best tones I've heard on the tele and his note selection is what sets him apart from other pickers. Ever hear of diarrhea of the guitar?

The digital restoration is credited to Ken Robertson who has done better on other similar titles.

Moreover, the main character, Francis, is probably none like you've read before. The character development is impeccable. The location, mostly is Observatory Mansions, and we are able to dive deeply into the history of it's inhabitants and formal inhabitants. But it's more than that. We wonder why the people are the way they are, and what made them become so out of the ordinary. And then, a person who seems quite normal enters the equation and mixes everything up. I don't want to give away the plot, I just want to say this has a beautiful mix of humor, sadness, complexity, and judgement. You will find that it is one of the better books you've read this year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Visit the Mansions","review":"I wanted to curl back up into this book for days after finishing it. The self-contained world Edward Carey creates is so crooked, dusty and credible. One trusts completely what the characters see and experience because one is being guided so kindly by the hand.

This lends a richness and thoughtfulness to his characterizations not often encountered in today's disposable fiction. His observations about human behavior are insightful (albeit a tad bit stagey at times) and every resident of the Observatory Mansions has left me searching for similarly quirky characters in the books I have read since putting this one down. I have found none so curious, so satisfying, or so original.

If you're interested in typing out menus for a dinner party, making a dockside dining area, or have days on end to kill getting ready for every season than this is the book for you.

He assured me that I would love it, because he knew how much I enjoyed horror stories. I took it home and, on glancing at it, was actually pleasantly surprised to see something familiar on the list of short stories: one of the tales had actually been published in this INCREDIBLY age-inappropriate book I read in 4th grade. That put me in a good mood, because I had fond memories of the piece in question just scaring the crap out of me.Annnnnd then I started to read the rest.Frankly, the author seems very...well, full of himself. He goes for shock in the way of Carlton-How-Is-This-Guy-Seriously-A-Published-Author Mellick III. The God of the Razor in particular was just absolutely, absolutely awful. His writing style leaves much to be desired, and I never really walked away from any one of these stories -- even that old favorite -- particularly satisfied or wanting more.Not worth the buy. Not even a little."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"After reading some of the glowing reviews for this books I was somewhat amazed at the low quality of the writing. The stories are, for the most part, poorly crafted and sophmoric. A few shine feebly but mostly I'de like my money and time back. The author introduces each tale with a story about its genesis. From reading most of the introiductions I have gotten the sense that a) he is his own biggest fan, b) he wants to remind everyone every 10 pages that he has met T.E.D. Klein and c) he has read some Bradybury in his day.As no novice in the field of literature (horror, mystery and fantasy) I can assure you that, as a whole, this rates as one of the poorest anthologies I have ever picked up. Run away, and quickly, and buy yourself some M.R. James, Kim Newman or Lovecraft."},{"rating":"2","title":"Joe Gets Weird","review":"The stories contained in this collection are, in a word, weird. I love Lansdale's stuff and originally got into his work as a horror fan, enjoying \\"The Night They Missed The Horror Show\\" so much that I quickly snatched up all of his \\"horror\\" stuff. After reading the excellent short story collection \\"High Cotton\\" I moved on to \\"Bumper Crop\\" expecting more of the same.While \\"Bumper Crop\\" has its fair share of horror tales, the stories are more along the lines of weird Twilight Zone-esque yarns, with the strangest twists and turns you'll ever read. There are also a few fantasy-type pieces, and some rather intensely violent pieces that play out only as Lansdale can do. Absolutely worth reading, but if you're more of horror fan, I recommend \\"High Cotton\\" as the quintesential Joe R. Lansdale short story collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"I love Joe Lansdale . Because I am not a writer, all I can think to say about this book is that it is totally entertaining, humorous,weird, sometimes creepy, overall a great read. I highly recommend this and since I'm on the subject of Lansdale, The Bottoms is all those things plus poignant. Critics are justified in comparing it to To Kill a Mockingbird."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh - not a fan","review":"I got this to try to get introduced into the world of the Weird West and Joe Lansdale who is right now one of the big names of the genre - this set of stories is mostly horror based and not too many have a western influence in them - I actually do not remember any having a western flair - even the one story about Western Cowboys takes place on an airport shuttle and lasts for 4 pages - this is not a good read for Weird Western, but it is if you are in the mood for horror short stories - which I am not a fan of nor did I want to become a fan of them - 2 stars is because it was disappointing and some of the stories were flat out stupid to me - but this is only my opinion - others may like Lansdale's work"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good price","review":"More as a lolipop than a sucker.

The way in which each beat is presented shows how minor changes and adjustments can turn a familiar rock beat that I have been playing for years into a up beat Brazilian Samba rhythm. I have also leanred Bembe beats, which I had never heard of before, but have found to be incredible. This book has also helped me to see the similarities between different drums beats which has given me the skills to move smoothly from one form to the next. I think I would have been lost had it not been for the accompanying CD which gives me the opportunity to play along side a Berklee band.

I am from the NYM area and love panini sandwiches, but this book's recipes bordered on the ridiculus with a tremendous repeat of ingredients, used over and over again. The recipes seemed hardly original to me. My local delis have a much more interesting assortment of ingredients than any recipe in this book. A let down, as I was really looking forward to this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply put: I'm returning it","review":"This book was incredibly disappointing. Not ONE recipe in it looked worth-while. After reading the reviews of all the books, this one seemed to have the most positive response. But I wasn't impressed at all.

The author(s) apparently wanted an elitest book geared towards the \\"natural is good\\" movement, i.e free range chicken eggs, etc. Also, they seemed to try and hide a crosteni/bruschetta book in the garb of a panni book; very few grilled panini recipes.

Basically, there are not that many panini, bruschetta, or crostini recipes in this book. Maybe a total of 50. Or fewer. What there are, are very good. But also very similar to one another.Whenever I make a recipe from this book, though, I'm glad I bought it. Example: rosemary focaccia with ricotta, swiss chard, and sun-dried tomatoes. Yum!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious","review":"I was so disappointed in this book because there were very few recipes that called for a panini maker. In addition, most of the recipes consisted of specialty foods that you wouldn't normally have in your pantry or fridge. For example some of the ingredients needed were: Greek oregano, white bread made with unbleached flour, cornichons (aka pickled gherkin cucumbers), imported canned tuna, etc. The author recommended only \\"high end\\", imported/gourmet foods that were organic.

My husband has bought numerous cheaper, thinner cables with standard clasps. They don't last very long at our house. The one-hand operation of The Beast's clasp works really well for me, and I have arthritis. Also, our German Shepherd Dog has had no trouble getting out of tie-outs with standard clasps. She simply rolls in the grass until the thumb latch is activated. Then she's free! But she can't get out of The Beast! Thinner cables crimp when they get tangled, then the plastic cracks, exposing the metal cable to the elements. This results in thinner cables rusting quickly. The Beast's thicker cable does not crimp, plus the plastic sleeve is softer, so it doesn't crack. In our Wisconsin yard, with our 75-lb GSD, thin cheap cables last one season. The Beast lasts several years.

It was exactly what I wanted -- I wasn't interested in something that had to be permanently installed (not to mention way over my budget) and I didn't want anything with an earpiece. This product was the perfect fit for me.The TravelSpeak is simple to install and use. One end plugs into your cigarette lighter and the other plugs into your phone. That's it! The sound quality is excellent. However, my one complaint with this unit is the sound clarity for people on the other side of the conservation: it tends to pick up EVERY background noise while you're talking, then goes completely silent when your party is talking to you. This can be somewhat distracting for your caller, but I consider this a minor annoyance compared to the safety this unit brings to you.

I don't understand why all these American shows are widely available abroad but not at home.

The cost of implementing the episodes as is - with all the music intact - would be astronomical just because of the ridiculously expensive song rights they'd have to pay for. So, rather than service the fans, the network is trying to keep its costs down since I'm sure they've done a cost-profit analysis and found it wanting. Which is fine and practical for them, but very, very unpleasant for viewers. Sure, a couple episodes are available... but that only feeds the rage at not being able to watch the WHOLE season.

Rather than being an insightful look at one of the key years in recent human history, this book seemed to be more interested in pushing an agenda that is itself unclear.The book is a rather stale rehash of a lot better works like Martin Gilbert's History of World War II. Gilbert has the same Anglo-centric viewpoint of WWII yet he tells the story better and doesn't ignore key actions to support his claims. Further, this book seems to be confused as to whether or not it is a social, economic or military history and actually spends very little time in 1945. A far superior work along these lines is the book 1759 which does everything this book fails to do. Tell the story of a single year, provide context and background and lead the reader to their own conclusion with out hectoring."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is new here?","review":"I was disappointed to find nothing new or revealing in this book. Dallas's charge that the allies dawdled on their way to Berlin is not new, and not proven. That the USSR caused the cold war by snatching eastern Europe is the received wisdom. Certainly Churchill's 6 volume work on WWII covers the relevant material more convincingly. Dallas needs to establish that the allies could have moved against German forces quickly enough to prevent the occupation of eastern Europe by the Soviets. And he needs to show that the Soviets could not have moved more quickly in response. The latter point Dallas himself argues against. He insists that the USSR could have moved more quickly but that Stalin wanted the Nazis finish off the Polish anti-communists. Dallas has nothing new to say. His book did prompt me to read Churchill's account which is fast reading compared to Dallas contentious style."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"This \\"kit\\" is way overpriced or what you get - a few seeds, a tablespoon of dirt and a sheet of instructions.

This book was the first broadly published accounting of William Dembski's ideas on Complex Specified Information and his \\"Law of Conservation of Information.\\" After reading and several hours of discussion by seminar members, we agreed that the book was written in a style meant to impress readers with jargon rather than lead them through a consistent and logical argument for Intelligent Design. Even apart from the numerous unanswered published criticisms of Dembski's hypotheses, all seminar members found serious inconsistencies and transparencies of his arguments. His ideas boil down to Paley's original \\"gee whiz, life is too complicated to have arisen by natural mechanisms.\\"This book ought to be read so its weak arguments can be dissected and not be accepted in any consideration of Intelligent Design."},{"rating":"2","title":"Profound in its implications","review":"William Dembski's newest book, No Free Lunch, helps complete the job he started in his 1998 book, The Design Inference (Cambridge University Press). The Design Inference laid out Dembski's rigorous formal apparatus for determining whether an event or an object is the result of chance, natural law/necessity, or intelligent design. What he didn't do in that book is apply the theory to the natural world. In No Free Lunch, he does so. Not only does he tweak and strengthen his earlier theory, but he applies it to biology, and offers a devastating critique of various self-organizational theories, which recognize that Darwin's theory is inadequate, but hope to get information for free. Dembski argues convincingly that you can't. Although No Free Lunch does have some fairly technical sections, for the most part it is accessible to the educated non-specialist. Besides, it's worth the effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great monitor","review":"I've been using this monitor for about 6 months now and love it. It is very versatile.It has a 4 port USB hub built into it which I use for my thumb drive and BlueTooth adapter. Both of which work perfectly. Two of the ports are on the left side of the monitor, with two more near the power cables.The stand that comes with it allows you to move the monitor up / down, rotate the screen so that it's sideways if you prefer that for really long documents, and has about 140 degree left / right movement.I have not tried the built in audio.It feels very solid and well built and the OSD menus are easy to navigate.

He states that this is the basis of his strategy. After reading this page I threw the book away. I recommend that you not even buy it in the first place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Count cards or lose money","review":"This book presents readers with the ridiculous idea that they can win money with what is basically little more than progression betting. The author starts by complaining about the Martingale system, but then just offers a few more conservative methods of losing money, his main being the CLB betting system. Dunki-Jacobs doesn't seem to understand that unless you are building knowledge of the past cards into your betting strategy, there is no way to overcome a negative expectation. There may be a loose correlation between your losing streak and the probability of winning the next hand, but it is not enough to overcome the odds that are already stacked against you by the house. His simulations are ridiculous and his understanding of math is very limited.If you are going to take the time to read up on blackjack, and especially if you plan on playing the game often, I recommend learning to count cards..."},{"rating":"1","title":"a disappointment","review":"This book has some very nice photos, but on the whole it wasn't what I wanted. I intended this to be my first and only book on Gaudi, but it won't serve that purpose. The photos don't include any of the usual angles -- for example, there are far too few shots of the wonderful roof of Casa Battlo, and none that adequately show the sinuous serpent-back tiles. The text explains the symbolism of the roof features, but the photos fail to show the features described in the text. Some of the wide angle shots looking up at ceilings are hard to interpret. The book is best as a complement if one already has a book with shots taken from the standard angles. In that respect, it would be excellent. I won't buy a book like this again without looking at it first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never been to Barcelona","review":"I purchased this book with the idea that I'll eventually get to Barcelona.

Now I'll have to work on my Catalan (the language they speak there). But that's another book altogether.I'm also a mosaic artist and Barcelona is one of the epicenters of mosaic work.

The death toll is sky high with Chan killing about 100 men in one battle. But besides the over all slaughter, the martial arts seemd slow, and there were no fancy techniques or shapes, it just seemed like a bunch of angry drunk guys kicking and punching.

Rather than a swift and powerful conclusion you get a shockingly long morass of increasingly obscure nonsense. Unless you enjoy trying to juggle 30 or 40 mythological bit-part characters (who often have multiple names, yay!) while the internal logic of the story is taken beyond the breaking point, give this book a pass and make up whatever ending you'd like for Amelia and crew."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of fun if you can find your way","review":"This conclusion to the trilogy is, if anything, even better than the first two books. In case you ever wondered what happened to the ancient gods who seemingly no one bothers to worship any more, Wright shows that they still reign in metaphor and our fate may still be in their hands. It can be hard to follow the disputes of the old deities and the relevance of their powers, especially the growing ones of the orphans, but making the effort is entertaining. Even the titillation of the mild eroticism comes to a pleasing conclusion in the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful.","review":"The Chronicles of Chaos is one of my favorite book series of all; I've checked these books out of my local library at least five times and I figured it was about time to buy my own copies.

This isn't Percy Jackson, though! It is written very much for adult reading levels, without being inappropriate for younger readers. The story line, the characters, and the vocabulary may make this book inaccessible to younger readers exploring fantasy novels. However, if you know someone who learned to read because of Harry Potter or Percy Jackson, have matured beyond them, and if they have some decent background knowlege of mythology, then this trilogy would be a wonderful next step."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent wrapup to a decent series","review":"All in all the final book of the Chaos Chronicles fulfills its responsibilities to wrap up the long convoluted plot laid out in the first two books. Well-written, well-thought-out, the only drawback is the shear immensity of plot crammed into this hectic roller-coaster. A working knowledge of mythology is almost required to untangle the woven web of characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Finale","review":"As others have mentioned. The end of the Chaos series is a little weak. Things are mostly wrapped up at the beginning of this book, though it continues, it starts to feel dragged out towards the end. Despite this, the book itself was enjoyable. Though perhaps not as good as the first 2 books in the series.One amusing thing I noticed in picking up the paperback edition. On the front cover its labeled Titans of Chaos. On the spine however, its labeled Fugitives of Chaos. I can't remember ever seeing a printing mistake like this.

I know that this is only 600 PSI greater than my last one, but it is almost too much power. However, it was able to get the overspray from my paint job off of the concrete with no problem.Only problem I forsee, is the unloader valve. This one stuck a couple of times the first time I used it. This was the same problem I had with my 2400. One thing to check before purchasing this unit, is to make sure you have the proper water flow of 2.5 GPM from your faucet. If not, you will not get the proper pressure from the pump and burn it out real quick.

The series is still ongoing, judging from the ads I read in Swing Journal which is a Japanese magazine that I subscribe to which keeps me abreast of the latest reissues there.If anyone is into serious jazz reissues, I suggest they try Japan for availability and variety. Its good to see Amazon.com offering these for sale as I have just relocated from Singapore (where they are available) and am still trying to find someone who will keep my supply up.

Secondly, there's no real violence on show. Just supernatural silliness; violence and sex shouldn't mix, and in this film, the tongue is placed firmly between the cheeks.

It looks like a super 8 film transfered to VHS, then transfered to DVD. During distant scenes on the banks of the river, John Cleese's face looks like a white blob. There is a definite hum in the sound that obviously suggests this is NOT a digital transfer at all. You can also see video tracking at the bottom of the picture. (This has defintly come from a VHS tape)I was so looking forward to buying this DVD, and adding this fantastic short movie to my collection. (I'm using it as a drink coaster now)The picture is so washed out that there is barely any color at all.This is so bad. If John Cleese knew they were selling his work like this for money, I'm know he'd be pretty pissed off. (If it was my work I would be)Even though the price is low for a DVD, many people feel they've been ripped off. They should."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unless Your Buying This to See Connie Booth . . .","review":". . . don't buy it. Faulty Towers is the funniest thing John and Connie ever did together--this is nowhere near that level. There are only two pieces of Cleese's work I enjoyed less than this: \\"How to Irritate People\\" and \\"The Strange Case of the End of Civilization, as We Know It\\". There are a few laughs in \\"Romance\\" but seeing a most lovely Connie in the buff is its only truly redeeming trait, and that is only redeeming for half of us . . . The funniest Cleese-Booth work ever created is the \\"Fawlty Towers\\" complete set. It is pure genius and you can watch the episodes a dozen times, each, without tiring a bit!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Come on now #2.","review":"I gave this 2 stars because everyone gave it 5. If you just look at the star rating you might be misled. Five stars is really overdoing it. The Meaning of Life is absolutely 5 stars, but this is really more like 3-3 1/2 stars. I am a big fan of John Cleese and most of his endeavors, but all his efforts can't be 5 star material.Overall, a pretty good flick, quite charming."},{"rating":"2","title":"A comedy of class and timing","review":"John Cleese and Connie Booth star in this adaption of Chekov's play. Without dialogue and often without clothing the pair make their way through a variety of social and personal situations with a care which Miss Manners would appreciate.This is less slapstick than it is social commentary but hilarious none the less."},{"rating":"1","title":"The movie is worth your time and money. This DVD is not.","review":"I'm surprised that no one has mentioned the poor quality of this particular DVD. I own it and even though I got it fairly cheaply I still feel like I got ripped off. This DVD has been created from a very beat-up copy of the film, full of scratches and other signs of wear and tear. To make matters worse, some of the nudity has been chopped out. To call it \\"edited\\" would be putting it too kindly. Whoever was responsible for the cutting simply removed some of the more revealing frames of film, taking the corresponding bits of dialogue with them.It IS a charming, funny little movie. It deserves better treatment. This DVD should be avoided in the hope that a better transfer will come along."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very amusing","review":"This is a fun story. John Cleese and Connie Booth perform well together. A well-written story about a budding romance between a musician and a princess. There are a few parts where John Cleese throws in a Monty Pythonish type of dialog, which adds to the hilarity of the show."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, especially for bassists","review":"This is a film that I had always heard about (I am a professional bassist). It's a cute, relaxed little film based on a Chekhov short story. I suspect it was made for British TV in the '70s. The production value isn't great, but the performances are charming and it's a perfectly pleasant way to spend 40 minutes or so. Bassists and their admirers will enjoy the references to bass stereotypes. Plus, it's fun to watch John Cleese lug around a giant wooden bass case for 30 minutes!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Even better than WInter Enclosure!","review":"Octavia has done it again.

The very best books about forgeries tell you a great deal about books and manuscripts, not just the fraud in question. I had hoped that this book would be in that vein -- cool, dry, utterly objective, facts-only, and absolutely convincing, while at the same time opening up the world of ancient manuscripts and how to reason about them.Instead it is unconvincing and inflamed in the *weirdest* sort of way. It seems as though Stephen Carlson really wants to settle a score with Morton Smith. I was looking for an exquisitely argued piecing together of a puzzle. Instead I got a very erudite, very lengthy disquisition bundled up with a huge number of angry neurosies, not all of them Smith's by any means."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm not convinced","review":"I'm just not convinced. A lot of people seem to have a very strong vested interest in seeing Morton Smith proved wrong. And yet his work passed serious academic scrutiny for decades until -- speaking of \\"convenient\\" -- after his death, at which point this guy steps up to indict him as a hoaxer.\\"The Secret Gospel\\" is not Smith's only book-length work of Biblical history. He pursued many of the issues raised by this work in the later \\"Jesus the Magician,\\" which is a fascinating and persuasive book -- more so, in my opinion, than the earlier volume -- and his arguments and analysis would seem to be valid regardless of the historical status of the \\"secret\\" gospel of Mark.I kind of suspect a different sort of intellectual dishonesty at work here: hardcore Christianists who can't stand their core assumptions being called into question."},{"rating":"1","title":"A HILARIOUS pack of LIES","review":"If Carlson *truly* believed that Secret Mark was a modern forgery, he would simply track down the manuscript and carbon-date the parchment/ink.However, since he knows it's genuine, (but doesn't fit with his version of Christianity) his only option is embarrass himself with his feeble arguments about how Morton Smith \\"forged\\" it: Clement is TOO much like Clement. The Morton Salt theory (hilarious). Etc.Bottom Line: Don't waste your time or your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Note to Christian Apologists: Keep Trying...","review":"Baylor University Press lists no credentials for Stephen C. Carlson. His bio simply says: Stephen C. Carlson is Partner in Ditthavong & Carlson (Fairfax, VA). Although this apparently not current, I checked. So he's a patent attorney. So what you have is yet another Christian \\"pseudo academic\\" attempting to take down a well respected academic and scholar.And this is what happens whenever any claim crosses with established canon about Jesus of Nazareth: the apologists come out of the woodwork and pile on claiming fraud. Take the recent discovery of a papyrus fragment in which Jesus refers to his wife. Before anything at all is published it's labeled a fraud with absolutely no evidence whatsoever.This book, which is no longer being published, belongs in the same bin with anything published by Jerome Corsi or Orly Taitz."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very fragile","review":"As soon as I put it on, it broke.

I did all my Christmas shopping on line this year and didn't want this to be an exception. I read other customers' reviews before purchasing and was disappointed at first because out of the bottle it was really strong and I wasn't too fond of it. After about 10 minutes on my guy, it mixed with his natural chemical smell and turned out to be PERFECT for him. Other reviews I read indicated a long-lasting scent, which is true. I wouldn't advise buying this blindly online. Test it in the store first to be sure you like it. The price was right, and the packing and shipping were excellent.

It is DEFINITELY not the real cologne. It smells exactly like it, it may even be made by the same company, but something went wrong with it at some point, either it stored in some place too hot or cold, because the SCENT DOES NOT LAST. I'm telling you, I have bottle that I bought from my local perfume store and it lasts a good 5 hours or so. This scent from this online bottle is gone within in an hour. This is also not a lone case. I also bought a Jean Paul Gaultier cologne on amazon and had the exact same issue. I would not again be swayed by the good prices and simply pay the 20% more at my local store for the real thing.

The scent smelled weird on me- really, really weird. I think the notes are floral but they smelled like plastic on me. The fragrance is described as musky, but I couldn't smell a bit of musk.

This is such a twisted, liberal rewriting of history. If you want to know History read their own words. Read Washington, Jefferson, Franklin. I watched 3 parts, before I had to give up.

(esp the Southern campaigne) But, an embarrassingly weak last disc...which only re-hashed the prior 3 discs? So instead of going forward and learning more, which was well done in the first three discs, the last disc takes us BACKWARDS only?, over scenes you've already seen before in the first three discs! (multiple x's if u watch the intro to each chapter) Shame on the laziness/greed of the producers.... If this was a great 3 DISC series, then stop. Other histories that are famous build to great closing last discs. This History Channel series was infuriating to any viewer who bought and watched the whole thing and then gets: DISC #4? It doesn't deliver near the great ending you hope for and I know I felt a bit taken for paying the price of 4, when they series makers were out of gas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"I received it as a Father's day present and love it.

However that being said wanting to enjoy it is completely different than what this movie was able to deliver. It would seem this movie was made by Pro-British and Pro Loyalist directors.

It's a short book, but also very detailed. No one can read this book and fail to understand the urgency of our need to reduce carbon emissions worldwide.

The author offers some breathtaking solutions to this problem that could really make for a great new world. If only. If only. I'll mail a copy to the next president. Now..if only someone would write a whole book about how science is too dangerous (biotechnology excepted of course) for America as it threatens to make Americans think and challenge the status quo.

This type of writing is totally inaccurate and not supported by factual information and yet many readers think they read the truth.The climate has always been changing and will always continue to change. It is really arrogant of man to think he can do anything about it. Fact is on a long range trend the world is cooling, not warming. There are always peaks and valleys in the trend line.I live in Kansas and millions of years ago this was a tropical land following being under water and sea, the gulf came clear up here and we had dinasaurs and all kinds of tropical vegetation. Today we have farm land and moderate climate. The trend has been one of cooling, not warming up. The liberal writer is nuts. Frankly it is written with out common sense.

I am sure he is perfectly aware of the monstrous inaccuracies (I dare not use stronger terms), but is doubtless hoping that it will be a best-seller.As a professional scientist, I am very troubled by this aspect of the climate change debate. I see it as just one manifestation of an extremely dangerous development in modern society, the creation of a widely accepted mythology by activists using the 'big talk' of science to delude the public.I urge everyone to read this book, and then to check authentic scientific sources to judge whether it was worth paying $22.00 for such propaganda."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS IS NOT A \\"DVD\\"","review":"This is a \\"Music\\" DVD...meaning you get music with a still picture to look at while you listen.

With this in mind, Fatherland is a true suspense thriller with awesome actors and a believable 60's set design and nostalgic, yet somewhat futuristic wardrobe ( although the film's events take place in an alternate past). Rutger Hauer is one of today's most underappreciated actors and Miranda Richardson is very convincing as an American journalist. The most disturbing role of all is played by Jean Marsh as an extremely bitter Nazi actress; Listen to a very chiling line about the \\"resettling\\" of the Jews. This one particular line is very shocking and haunting ! It serves as the underlying basis for the plot in this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Waiting for DVD","review":"I really enjoyed this movie on VHS but I'm waiting/hoping for a DVD release because the tape is starting to wear out in a few places.

Churchill sent in excile to Canada, King Edward en Queen Wallis, Speer's realised buildings in the Reich. The makers used authentical images to create this alternative history and they succeed: it was very convincing.For the first 30 minutes, the story was allright. The pictures of Nazi-Berlin in the sixties were impressing. But then everything went wrong. There was nothing left of the subtile and tragic plot of the book. I hardly believed my eyes and wondered what Robert Harris himself would think about the rape of his story. What drove the scenariowriters to turn an brilliant story in XXXX like this...?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Confusing... just a bit...","review":"I guess the reason this movie was so confusing to me is because it has such a complex plot that it's impossible to absorb everything by watching it only once. Yes, the question 'What if Hitler had won World War II?' is an interesting one indeed. But all the things surrounding that tends to become a big puddle of confusion. Several things are happening all at once in a movie and it gets quite deep. There was very good costuming, and an excellent cast. I'm a Miranda Richardson fan so I think her portrayal of Charlie was fabulous. How does so manage to always do that? She never fails to make me gasp in awe at her acting talents. Great job Mandy! I have the movie and I plan to watch it again very soon and make sense of it all. I recommend it only to those with long attention spans and those who can figure out plots easily. It's definately worth watching!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yikes","review":"Despite being a compatriot of the leading actor, even patriotism cannot convince me to donate more than one star to this effort (such as it is). Anyone who read the book must have been acutely aware of the great film potential and I can imagine that Robert Harris must be kicking himself because he allowed this version ever to be made - SO much more could have been done with this story, if for instance they stuck to the original plot.

There's no way in the world this disc is anywhere close to being worth more than five bucks.I bought this out of Goodwill (in excellent shape) for 50 cents simply because I, like so many other people, loved \\"The Safety Dance\\" when it came out. This disc also includes an extended mix of \\"The Safety Dance\\" that's four and a half minutes long (the regular version clocks in at just under 3 minutes). Those are the only two songs on the entire album that are remotely close to being listenable.

I really don't know why Lucette Aldous was able to get a chance to play the leading role with her flat, robot-like performance. What's more, in the final act she seems to be totally exhausted with sore legs that couldn't stretch or even stand at all. I think the only reason Kultur Video made this DVD so well is simply because it presents Nureyev, whose name is supposed to attract lots of ballet fans (although I personally don't think his performance could compete with Ruzimatov's in the Kirov version).

On the average, IFriedman made one or two points per Torah portion that made me say \\"Wow!\\" to myself.On the negative side: this book is simply not comprehensive enough to substitute for the committee Chumashes.

Friedman's depth is gained at the sacrifice of breadth: he covers only the topics that really interest him.And of course, he doesn't cover Haftorot at all.This book is a fine supplement to the committee Chumashes (or to Hertz, who is also more comprehensive than Friedman) - but not a substitute."},{"rating":"1","title":"Commentary on the Torah by Richard E.

Robert Englund as the mayor was priceless and the supporting cast was good. A good mix of cool gore and humor really made it a treat. Then I waited two years or more for them to make a sequel. Boy, I could have waited anther two!The movie sucks beyond belief, a big let down. The humor is alright but the people they go out and slaughter are really annoying. Bill Mosley is a respected actor among horror movie fans and he did good but the script was poorly written. Granny is back and she did a good job as well but like Mosley, something was off. I didnt care for the rest of the maniacs. In the first movie, they are against blacks and asians but they are in this movie. The gore was cool but there wasn't often in my opinion. Then ending was pretty stupid as well.Overall, if you enjoyed the first one then you may enjoy this movie. I didnt laugh too much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst movie ever, what a waste of time.

It is boorish, trite and a regurgitation of the same theme over and over ad nauseum. No suspense, no scares etc.. Everything is telegraphed in advance. The film is infantile at best. The acting is atrocious and amateurish, but what you expect in a low quality film like this. Their attempts at humor in the film border on the childish and moronic. The only humorous thing about this film is that the people involved are so deluded that they think they produced a good piece of work. It is hilarious to think that a film company wasted valuable money in today's economy on a joke of a film. This dvd isn't worth 11 cents much less 10.99..If you want to get value for your money, buy the original 2000 maniacs film and not these cheap cardborad regurgitations and reimaginings. The original was a trailblazing film unlike this pile of dung."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why all the praise?","review":"2001 Maniacs, the Field of Screams, is a sequel to 2001 Maniacs, a remake of an earlier title called 2000 Maniacs. The first movie and it's remake were serious horror movies even though there might have been some comic relief involved. As far as I am concerned, and I don't write a review often, but I felt people should be warned, this movie was worthless. It tried to have comedy that I felt failed miserably, and it tried to have gore, I felt not nearly enough, not often enough, and not real enough. The whole movie felt like a bunch of people trying to make a parody of a horror movie. I felt the movie failed on every level. It'll go on the shelf with the other two, but who am I kidding, I'll never watch it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spare Your Eyes and Mind!","review":"I own the older version of \\"2000 Maniacs\\", which I enjoyed.

A stupid pointless movie. They should pay me for my pain and suffering for trying to view this picture.Please people, don't buy this junk. As some viewers have said, this movie is horrible. The acting is terrible. It was not funny, nor entertaining. Watch, \\"Shawn of the Dead\\", \\"Fright Night\\" with Chris Sarandon, or \\"Army of Darkness\\" instead.

It doesn't include all of the Shrek movies. The book talks a little about characters, design, and other animation aspects. And actually, a lot of the content (sketches and notes etc.) are shown on the DVD extras. Still, I like the book form better because you're more free to go at your own pace (but if you're reading this, you're probably already a book person so that's moot I guess.)But over all, I was very pleased with the book as both a book on an animated film and about Shrek. Perfect for anyone who's a fan of animation,"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE guide to Single Malts","review":"I consider myself an above-average (although by no means an expert) fan of Scottish single malts, and I own several books on the subject. I find \\"Michael Jackson's Complete Guide to Single Malt Scotch\\" to be the most comprehensive, intelligible and above-all useful book in my whisky library.While no book can take the place of sitting down and doing some tastings, buying whisky by the glass for tasting can be prohibitively expensive. If you are buying by the bottle, it becomes an even greater investment, and figuring out your individual tastes will be a considerable investment. Michael Jackson's guide goes a long way in the selection process, leading you to the whiskys most likely to meet your pallet. Each whisky is outlined, explained and graded. It will at least give you an idea of what to expect when approaching an unfamiliar label.This book definitely falls into the \\"If you only own one book about single malt...\\" category."},{"rating":"2","title":"A welcome update of a classic guide","review":"Many of us have learned to appreciate the variety within the world of single malt whiskies with a wee dram in one hand and an opened copy of Michael Jackson's guide in the other. The new 1999 edition of this classic work on single malts is a welcome update. It includes all of the information from earlier editions and adds reviews of many even more whiskies than were included in the last edition. Jackson's descriptions and opinions are accurate and they are fun to read. Running Press has done a first rate job in publication of the material; it is a beautiful book.If you are new to the world of single malts and want a single reference, this is the place to start (although you should also seek out the writings of such authors as Charles MacLean and Jim Murray). If you already have an earlier edition of this book, the 1999 edition is still worth getting for all of the new reviews.Thanks to Michael Jackson for his outstanding work."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Bible","review":"This is the \\"Bible\\" of single malt scotch.

After reading Unger's work, you would think that John Hancock single handedly brought this country to freedom. The author's extreme adulation for his subject constantly paints Hancock in positive light and ALWAYS as the victim of others, never at fault. Lame excuses are given for why Hancock did not receive this office or that praise. One of the most disturbing elements is the vindictive condemnation of Samuel Adams (probably the man most singularly responsible for influencing the Declaration of Independence) is incredibly overdone and grossly inaccurate. Speeches which were written by Adams (and some given by Adams) are credited to Hancock, a man who is overwhelmingly acknowledged as lacking the writing ability for such speeches. Hancock is instrumental in bringing about revolution but unfortunately, not in the way suggested by this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Purchase","review":"This book is written so well, I couldn't put it down.

I had installed them correctly, in case you're wondering. So I paid a little more and bought these solid, single-edged blades and couldn't be happier. I needed to look up the manual online to be certain the installation was correct but they work flawlessly and make me wonder why I never tried them before.

But this film is a dreary, nearly unwatchable exercise. Bream is not at his best doing commentary, which manages to be at the same time both pompous and shallow. He is also hard to watch in close-up because of the extreme effort involved in his way of playing. But the long, tiresome and pointless excursions in the Spanish scenery are even worse. And all too often, commentary of some sort is uttered above a musical performance.The DVD ends with a performance of the Concierto de Aranjuez of Joaquin Rodrigo that merely demonstrates that Bream is NOT an outstanding concerto performer.Unfortunate that such a great artist as Julian Bream should be remembered by this badly-done film."},{"rating":"1","title":"extremely disappointed with the sound - its dubbed!","review":"One would surely expect (and demand) live guitar sound in such a production? Instead however most of the playing scenes show JB in effect miming to a studio over-dub! You might as well turn the sound off and pop in one of his CD's.Of course one will expect some roughness in a live setting (and indeed this is hilariously illustrated when he 'plays' Cadiz in a bumpy train carriage) but, for me at least, this adds to the experience.If I had known the sound situation beforehand there is no way I would have bought this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"julian , an old gentleman","review":"julian is great but picture looks very old because this film was recorded in eightees.Everything else is good, travelling through the spain also."},{"rating":"2","title":"War resisters speak out","review":"A most-important film about the GIs who resisted the war on Viet Nam while inside the military and in the country itself.

Most of the information presented was correct and factual; however, the anti-war movement was never as extensive as it is portrayed in the movie. Especially the behavior of the American military. The Army was never at a point of mutiny the way it was protrayed in the movie. The truth is we pulled out of Vietnam because it was perceived as a losing war, not because of any perception of the war being unjust. Anti-communist feelings were strong up until the early eighties, when it was replaced by fear of radical Islamic fundamentalists. I grew up during these times and the anti-war movement was never as extensive as the movie makes it out to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning piece of unreported history","review":"These guys had cajones-- they went to the brig -- one even got shot to death-- for resisting fighting in Viet Nam. They had a whole network of resistance- radio, magazines. Watching this, you get a better sense of what really probably ended the war in VN- not necessarily protesters back home, but resistance within. I met a vet once who punched his senior officer; apparently he was not just an odd duck with an anger problem. There was a whole movement that has been whitewashed."},{"rating":"2","title":"documentary or docurama: whatever you call it--it is true and great.","review":"Truly one of the very best documentaries I have ever viewed.

I hated it and soon cashed it in on a trade at the local vinyl exchange. Their 1982 album, Business as Usual, is stellar all the way through. Cargo, released the following year, was okay, but far below the first release, and - with the exception of Overkill - had the feel of a gathering of outtakes and extras that were not deemed worthy of inclusion on Business as Usual.I recently found a copy of Two Hearts - again on vinyl - at a local shop and decided to give it a second chance. Time has not improved this mess. This was apparently the band's last gasp. While it is not painful or grating to listen to, there is nothing memorable here. For completists only.As an aside, some of Colin Hay's later solo projects are quite good."},{"rating":"1","title":"It flopped and it's out of print.","review":"The below 1-star reviewer is a punk and a sissy for countering other people's reviews. Stay out of American websites, you little Yankee wannabe!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Flop album from a no-talent band.","review":"Each of Men at Work's albums sold significantly less than the one before it. The sophomore slump \\"Cargo\\" sold substantially less than \\"Business as Usual.\\" And \\"Two Hearts\\" sold way less than \\"Cargo,\\" which was already viewed as a SERIOUS disappointment as it had only ONE hit single. \\"Two Hearts\\" was a huge disaster for the band; the single \\"Everything I Need\\" wasn't even a top 40 hit. It FLOPPED. This means that by the mid 1980s, Men at Work were already washed up with nowhere to go. DuranDuran, on the other hand, survived musical differences and changes in the band lineup, but STILL whipped out hit after hit after hit. Think about it. You have DuranDuran in one corner, and you have the forgotten \\"Men at Work\\" in the other. Which of these two bands would YOU choose?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Overlooked CD","review":"When this album came out in 1985, I think people had grown tired of Men at Work and their constant presence on the radio and MTV. One thing Men at Work were good at were quirky, comic videos. \\"Two Hearts\\" might have done better with a hit video done in the same vein as the previous two albums. Instead, the videos from the album came out without the typical Men At Work humor, and in a more serious vein (\\"Maria\\").To me, this album contains some of their strongest material to date, good melodies and good lyrics. Stand out songs are: \\"Giving Up\\", \\"Snakes and Ladders\\", \\"Children on Parade\\", \\"Hard Luck Story\\" and \\"Still Life\\". If you're a fan of the group, you may find this album to your liking. Also, check out Colin Hay's solo material - \\"Looking For Jack\\", \\"Wayfaring Sons\\", \\"Peaks and Valleys\\", \\"Topanga\\", and \\"Transcendental Highway\\".

In addition to an 85% reduction in energy consumption, the kitchen doesn't get hot from the bulbs. The incandescent bulbs generated an incredible amount of heat.

However, the instructor in this video, Ashley Turner, has a very different teaching style. Not saying Ashley's style is bad, just that there was WAY too much personal improvement/development conversation added to yoga pose guidance for our liking.

I would have been more happy had there not been so much warrior and cresent pose in the vinyasas, a change up would have been nice. However, it is an overall body work out including upper body (with pushups and chaturanga) which you dont get in many yoga DVDs. The ab section is AWESOME - you will really feel it, this coming from someone who works abs nearly daily so it takes a lot to challenge me and she did, for sure!! LOVE that she does wheel.

Additionally, the book contains several beautiful color plates and a very useful illustration of the Tree of Life (with corrected attributions).

Nicholas explains the XMLHTTP / XMLHTTPRequest objects, which enable web developers to create highly-interactive, useable web applications - much like \\"normal\\" applications.The chapter, \\"Deployment Issues\\" is outstanding as well.

I was never second guessing the author, and I found it hard to put down in places. The information that builds the soryline is well thought out, but I did find some problems. First of all, I totally thought the gay line issue was overplayed in this book. Alex is presented as having openly gay friends and an ex-Navy Seal boyfriend who is just o.k with that and never throws a few slurs in their dirrection. Right. And then using the gay / sympathy ploy with the murderer character didnt work for me at all. In fact this is the biggest turn off of many current novels I read. This is a hottly debated issue, and personally I think that sexual orientation ploys disstract readers from the plot of books that arent intended to dirrectly deal with this subject. Aside from that, it didn't ruin the book for me as in many ohter cases. Read it, its a sure thriller."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Fourth Wall","review":"The Fourth Wall is the third book about Alex Bernier, investigative reporter, and these books just get better and better. Alex, is a wonderful character with a great sense of humor, but she also has depth, which a lot of mystery heroines lack. It's written in the first person, so you really make friends with her.

Since there are so few books on the subject, any new book is a welcome addition. That is, until you actually read it.

Perhaps it's the curtain on the cover or the whimsical thought bubbles that lead people to believe the secrets of directing are within this book.If you want a book on directing that is uninspiring, lifeless, and an all-around chore to read, this is your book.If you're still looking for the straight-forward approach to directing you thought would be within this book, \\"A Sense of Direction\\" by William Ball will ultimately be more helpful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deadly","review":"This book reads like a recipe for deadly theatre.

Funny thing is I still know every word, every nuance, every odd little tic they threw, in every single spot over the whole album, on first new listen, I instinctively found myself talking along with the little spoken snippets & singing along. Fortiethed also that the album is a solid hit from start to finish. It does sound awfully dated in terms of its 80s aesthetics and big beat euro-synth style in places, but, whatever. I'm excited to see so much love for this for I too played it into the grooves of my cochleas in my first few years of owning it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"This album is the test of whether, deep down inside, you're a cynic. There's an earnestness, a sincerity, and a thrilling honesty to the songs here. The title track is a quiet little classic, but there are many things here far better than the follow-up \\"Moonbeam\\" single. \\"On Tuesday\\" is a beautiful song by any measure, with delightfully lyrical flute work by Jethro Tull's Ian Anderson, and \\"In the Name of Angels\\" should very well make your hair stand on end and make you think about all the time you've been wasting in life as you leap into action. It may sound odd but this band is kind of like the \\"Peanuts\\" comic strip set to a dance beat--kind at heart, gentle, fun-loving, and intent on saying something real, damn the fashions of the day.

(Sidenote - I actually remember seeing the video for 'Moonbeam' on Nick Rocks on Nickelodeon way back when!

The real math IIC test is 50% functions. This book will leave you ill prepared for the real test. Furthermore it includes many topics that aren't on the test such as statistics. If you don't want to get a bad score on the SAT II Math IIC test then don't buy this book. I scored a 550 out of 800. I scored in the bottom 10% of all of the other people that took the test.

The explanations and the questions are both broader in scope than anything that might be found in the actual test or a math class. The questions are hapazardly thrown in with no regard to difficulty, and the tests themselves seem to have no consistent difficulty levels (I scored 800 on one and barely 700 on another.) One exam, for example, had 2 or 3 questions testing the exact same concept, with slightly different numbers.

I do not think I have laughed so much in a romance before.I love the story and the characters were very suited, I also loved the sisters, and Thomas's friends.The part I did not like, was how dumb Marianne was at times. For a woman who was suppose to be such a bookworm and intelligent...she seemed to much a dreamer and silly at times. I wanted to smack her. I understand independence, but she just did not seem very independent to me.It was fun to read, and I really laughed hard at how hard poor Thomas tried to win her heart....my four stars are all for you Thomas Effington."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amusing read with weaknesses","review":"\\"The Marriage Lesson\\" is the light amusing story of a woman who longs for adventure, only to find it in a place she hadn't expected.This is an often-hilarious look at two people attracted to one another despite their best intentions. Alexander's writing flows smoothly, and the dialogue between the two protagonists is witty and clever. The characters are related to characters from \\"The Husband List,\\" and I, for one, always appreciate revisiting characters from previous books.Despite all that, this book displayed some weaknesses. It almost seems as if Alexander decided on a plot and stuffed her characters into it despite their growth away from it! The plot seemed old and hackneyed, and the characters, although clever and appealing, were not well-developed. Their motivations seemed very shallow and somewhat unrealistic.All in all, I'd call this book a good light read for someone who enjoys laughing out loud and doesn't mind a lack of development and realism."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoroughly Enjoyable Summer Read","review":"What a fun escape to Regency England!

Also, many of the recordings (being the originals) have the very old sound quality of a record, marring some of the older and better tracks.

I bought a SWA-3000 Wireless Receiver Module so that I wouldn't need cords to wrap my living room for the rear speakers. Though this sound system is wireless ready, it has a hard time maintaining the receiver's speakers! So when we would watch a movie the rear speakers wouldn't work half the time! Also to really feel the movie, you have to just turn up the volume, but then it is over saturated and you loose all depth in the sound quality. On another note, the DVD player portion would dub poorly with the sound to screen . . . the sound would not match the mouths of the actors. And to top it off, when watching movies the screen will go blank even though the sound of the movie will continue! If Circuit City were still in business I would trade this in!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Undependable junk!","review":"This unit does have good sound, but that's where it ends. The controls are very user unfriendly and no other remotes will operate it. It went completely dead in two months. Samsung has the worst, most unfriendly customer service I have ever seen. I had to pay $30.00 to ship it to them and when I got it back the dvd player kept getting worse and finally died. While it was in the shop I used a $28 Apex player out of my rv and the picture actually looked better. Now, when you try to play a dvd it just says \\"disc unknown\\" and shuts off.

I recommend for students in International Relations and Science Polict."},{"rating":"2","title":"Detailed and enjoyable","review":"Diplomacy conveys the history of international relations from the 1600s to the 1990s. Concepts of Reason d'etat, Realpolitik, Containment and the reasoning of nations' behaviour with one another are introduced and their implementations are clearly illustrated.Historical lessons are provided from French Expansion, German unification, the World Wars, and the Cold War. The American policies of the 20th Century are the focus of this book. The personalities involved are very detailed I enjoyed the sharing of Dr. Kissinger's personal stories with the likes of Truman, Nixon, Ford and Reagan.I did however notice the basic omission of Jimmy Carter's term and Carter's work towards peace between Israel and Egypt. Some may be disappointed because this book only covers up the the early 1990s(written in 1994) but other books like Huntington's \\"Clash of the Civilizations\\" should fill that gap."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the must have book to everyone who deals in international affairs.","review":"Henry Kissinger's diplomacy is one of the greatest book of the 20th centurie, but you need to be warned of one thing: it is a book which express a point of view, and it does very good, it is not linked in cientific discurs or anything that resembles \\"neutrality\\" in the ideas.So, before hailing this book as a bible of diplomacy and international affairs i STRONGLY suggest to read the Wilhem G. Grewe Epochs of international law to have a second throught about kissingers book.But, even with this impetous of trying to convince you that the truth is been spoken, this is one of the must have book for everyone, especially those who deals in the international area.And very usefull explanation about the north american diplomatic psique..."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Diplomacy behind the History","review":"Dr. Kissinger takes us on a wonderful ride through modern (last 300 years) history and tells of the workings of diplomats and heads of states behind the scenes. Yes, we know that a war happened, but what were the diplomats saying to each other before the first shots were fired? Why did this country form an alliance with that country? Did they agree with each other (United States and England) or did they need each other to put down an enemy that was worse (England and Russia vs. Germany in WWII)?This book goes beyond the typical history book and explains the strategy of diplomats when confronted with another power. It also explores the differences between a collective security (United Nations) and Balance of Power arrangements.I have thoroughly enjoyed this book. Thought provoking and insightful. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very insightful - not just a rehash of events.","review":"Overall the book was great. I found the book a little hard to read at times, particularly the treatment of pre-WWI events. It picked up nicely after WWII, and the discussion of Vietnam was fascinating. Most interesting to me was the \\"behind the scenes\\" look at foreign policy development and proof that it is easier for critics to throw stones at decisions people make than to actually make the decisions."},{"rating":"1","title":"LIES LIES LIES","review":"Dispite the fact that history has been altered in this book, Kissinger fails to achive his goal, to propagandize the American tactic and policy of his era and after.

This book is a must read for anyone interested in understanding foreign policy in the Western world. Kissinger shows a remarkable lack of bias, which makes the book truly useful."},{"rating":"2","title":"International Affairs","review":"Kissinger writes of the history of international politics from the Peace of Westphallia until the modern era with obvious familiarity and ease. The chapters can be read individually or as a continuing history. This book proved worthwhile not only by giving me greater insight into politics among nations, but also some very well appreciated background on subject matter covered in my Modern Europe 306 history course. The philosophies of Idealism and Realism shine through, and Kissenger always a realist, presents his case well. One aspect missing from this otherwise nearly complete volume is a more telling account of his involvment in the context of the greater scheme of things: Arms talks, Indonesia and Chile to name a few. Taken as a whole I recomend this to any student of history, international affairs, and especially to the individual who would like a greater understanding of how things international work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Danny Kicks it Hard","review":"This CD didnt leave my player for about 2-3 weeks after I purchased it at his show in ATL.

They are best known for the synth-pop favorite \\"Safety Dance,\\" but in this album they throw out the synthesizers and pull out the real instruments. There is a somewhat psychedelic feel to many of the songs with just enough of an '80s touch that you know which decade it came from.

The plot's many twists and turns and the author's understanding of all walks of life (young, old, male, female, academics, hippies, mad poets, jehovah's witnesses, and crazed existentialists) prove he is a master storyteller.

The director tries to use camera angles to suggest the Tharks are much taller than John Carter but within a few shots just says \\"the hell with it\\" and makes them the same size. Traci Lords as Dejah Thoris is more like the \\"Spinster of Mars\\" as she seems too old for the role. Plus, she always has this look on her face like she's really cheesed about something (maybe the fact that she has to do Asylum movies to earn a living). The Thark masks are horrible and not even in a good way. Tars Tarkas (Matt Lasky) is also way over-dramatic in his line delivery.

First of all, the writers take great liberties with the Burroughs' books and, in essense, do little more than use the character names for their own story, much of which has nothing to do with the \\"John Carter\\" series. The makeups are incredibly bad with no attempt to make the masks fit around the eye or let the actors speak without sounding gagged. Deja Thoris looks nothing like the \\"vision of beauty\\" described by Burroughs. And the CGI effects are extraordinarly cheap and poorly done in every scene that needs them.

The acting was B-movie at best (perhaps no rehearsals and limited or no re-takes???), the handful of special effects were apparently very low budget, the editing was rough, the reinvented plot seemed like something half a dozen drunk college kids might create as a spoof skit for a fraternity party.

This movie makes the worst Tarzan film look like Gone With The Wind in comparison.The novel's story is gone, the characters are all wrong and the tharks only have two arms and obvious rubber tusks.

The sets were cheap. The acting is wooden. The makeup is 1970's horror film style. Traci Lords is 40ish acting as the 20 something year old Princess. She still looks great. Sabato is a cigar store Indian. The green Marians are 6 ft 6 in or less, with 2 arms & 2 legs. The story is very loosely based on the Burrough's book. The rewrite is weak, but the book is too long for a 100 min movie. This is a grade B movie without much CGI to help out. If James Cameron would direct/produce this, then we would have something. thanks Duffy O'Dell"},{"rating":"1","title":"dont get your hopes up","review":"this film could have been so much better. they tried to condense the book too much, and shouldn't have tried to adapt the storyline to modern settings.

And what's his name, Antonio Sabato, Jr. Neither of which are first rate actors. Not that they had much to work with, the dialog is pitiful, only made worse when delivered in a serious manner.As I only paid 5 bucks for it at Target, I can't complain too much. (The clerk warned me at the checkout, \\"you do know this isn't the Disney one?\\") Hey, I was curious; 5 bucks didn't seem too dear to satisfy my morbid sense of curiosity.Poor Edgar Rice Burroughs, if he were alive today this would have killed him.

The grid starts in the northwest corner of Cook County and the maps work eastward. Consequently, many of the western suburbs are clearly pictured on a single page, but the eastern ones are awkwardly divided and require a lot of page-turning to view. For example, Evanston is divided between maps 101, 102, 117 and 118. The driver has to turn 3 pages to see them all. The most exasperating fact is that downtown Chicago is divided between 2 maps separated by the metal spiral, which makes them extremely difficult to read. Given that just about everyone who buys this book will at some time want to use the downtown map, Rand McNally might have included a clearer one at the beginning or end of the book. Alas, they didn't. If you are mostly driving around the south and western suburbs, this book may work for you.

First of all it's supposed to be about Emma, the book talks about war in Sudan and things that go waaaaay back like Gordon and anti-slavery, word to author: this isn't supposed to be a history book I'm assuming. I understand that \\"Emma's War\\" meant the war between Riek and Garang but it was supposed to be a biography of Emma, not of the history of Sudan or what some guy in the government had to say about this war. Second, she jumps back and forth from Emma to what's happening in Sudan to her own experiences, it's hard to understand when there are all these names that Emma is associated with, then add the people she met and people who are fighting in Sudan, those against it and you don't know who is who. Also I found that this booke xplained very little about the conflict in Sudan, I just got the gist of it that it's between north and south. That was it. I might as well mention this was required reading for school"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very powerful, engrossing & stunning descriptions of Sudan","review":"Scroggins' story about Emma is a strange one, but the detailed descriptions of Scroggins' observations and experiences provide a stunning description of starvation, war, and disease in southern Sudan. Some parts of this book will stay with the reader for a very long time. The book is monumental and fulfills one's expectation of an epic story.

She can also just put herself to sleep with the pacifier - way cool!

Once my kids used up all the food, they switched to real stuff like cola and water. When the diapers were all gone, they gave her drinks without diapers on, and that is about as messy as a toilet that overflows. They went through the food and diapers in about an hour. After I told them no more MESS so no more feeding, they threw her in the corner and never touched her again.I think they would have played with her more if she had been more appealing. But she's kinda big and heavy for little kids, and she's hard so they can't snuggle with her.I would not buy this doll again.

Like the other reviews my doll has problems too.-In the loud store she sounded fine, but at home her gears and such were really loud and weird.-Lip color wore off on the first day of use.-Not enough hair on her head.-Hard to move her legs around to get a good fit for the diaper.-Not sure what happened but my doll recently suffered a shattered cheek bone and is now deformed.I was really excited to get this doll then quickly realized, surely I could have got something better for $50.

I went on-line and tried everything they suggested. Nothing worked. When my daughter wiped the food off the dolls lips, the paint came off. Did I mention this was within the first hour of having the doll. When I asked my daughter how she liked the doll, she said , \\"She's o.k., but she doesn't eat her food and the water from the bottle leeked all over except in her diaper.\\" Needless to say the ONLY thing she wanted for her birthday went back to the store and was replace with a Magical Glo Bear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Baby Alive not worth how much I paid","review":"I purchased the baby alive for my daughter and in ONE day the lips rubbed off just from using the bottle and spoon. She had not even fed it food yet! Not only does it look 3yrs old in one day the hair on the baby alive leaves alot to be desired.

First off, it is HEAVY. My daughter is 5 so this isn't that much of an issue but it can not fit into any normal doll beds, strollers etc... Her head is HUGE and rubbery so it isn't easy to clean. She is a total mess and honestly she is going back. My daughter loved it the day of christmas but after 3 packets of food and 3 diaper changes, she is bored with it. I knew that would be the case but bought it anyway. She only says a few phrases and once you press her bracelet, you hear a dull buzzing sound for about 3-4 seconds and then her eyes click click click and then she laughs. Everytime her eyes close, it clicks. It is very annoying and not lovable at all. I think the Fisher Price talking toddler doll is much more doll like and a cute normal voice to boot. After 2 days of not touching this toy, I am returning it before it gathers dust and molds on the inside."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute, but not worth the money","review":"Five minutes out of her package, Baby Alive had a tear in her mouth. Is it a defect or just over-eager spooning? Either way it's unacceptable for a $40 toy. Also right out of the box, her face was filthy. Her \\"skin\\", while life-like, is strangely sticky and attracts everything from dirt to fuzzies. She comes wearing one diaper and has a spare, but after that she's pantless, which is a bit jarring because of the large hole in her bottom. On the other hand, my 3-year-old daughter loves hearing her talk and pretending to feed her. The facial animation is very cute, and she does say a variety of things. Overall I'm happy because my daughter is happy, but I'm quite disappointed in the quality of this doll."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't buy the Baby Alive Diapers too expensive.. there is a better option!","review":"My daughter received this doll for Christmas and she really enjoys it!

It was a $3 coupon I could use if I spent $5 dollars. My Father-in-law was an Engineer for matel, he said it should have not happen.

Mothers of younger children will find that buying Baby Alive is alost like having another baby . . . children younger than about six will need help mixing her food, changing her diaper, cleaning her out afterward (so she doesn't clog up). My daughter usually wandered off just after Baby Alive \\"made a stinky,\\" leaving me to complete the cycle (and there's nothing a mother of four likes better than changing a plastic baby :). Our also makes an odd clacking sound for no particular reason (I think it's supposed to be fussing, but am not entirely sure).

She is very cute (once you get past the strangely large eyes!) Her voice is sweet and she tells you what she wants. She moves her mouth when she sucks on a bottle and she even \\"chews\\" the food you put in her mouth. My only flaw is that after you get done feeding her the water you have too to flush her out, it is usually running out the diaper since the diaper doesn't hold much at all. What we learned to do was to feed her, give her a little water through the bottle, then take off her diaper and flush the rest of her over the sink before putting on a new diaper. She is fun to play with and turns off after she goes to sleep, but stock up on the diapers, you will use all of them!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Baby Alive is a great gift!","review":"Both my 4 year old and 2 year old girls love this doll!

So, we called Hasbro. They sent a postage paid sticker and promised a new baby in 4-6 weeks. They also explained that the coloring of the lips may come off but it's non-toxic.

It goes everywhere with us, just like our children do! They did't care about the physical challenges we had with the first doll. We didn't make a big deal of it, so they didn't see it as a big deal.

Which could be good in the long run.But now I notice some things are not working right. I did what the directions recommend that you give her lots of water after a feeding to keep her clean. Now after two months of eating and drinking the sensor in her mouth is not working. She asks for food and you give it to her and her mouth doesn't move so she keeps telling you she is hungry.

I picked this up from the library expecting a book about the founding of the USA with respect to our first three presidents. While that may be in the book, the book is primarily an anti-Bush diatribe. I am not one to defend President Bush but I can not stand intellectual dishonesty. In the book, Vidal states that invading Canada in response to 9/11 made as much sense as invading Afghanistan. While the issue of invading Iraq is and continues to be a controversial one, there has been very little opposition to our invasion of Afghanistan. Our current President Obama has stated many times that our fight against terror was in Afghanistan and not Iraq. For Vidal to state that Afghanistan had as much to do with 9/11 as Canada comes across to me as intellectually dishonest. His hatred of President Bush has made the book almost completely unreadable in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pseudointellectual","review":"I thought I loved history, but maybe because I didn't graduate from Harvard, I wasn't able to find any excitement in Vidal's history lesson. It felt more like a lecture than anything engaging. If only Dave Berry can collaborate with Vidal, then we may have something."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unscholarly Rant","review":"In this poor excuse for a work of scholarship, Vidal spends his time (and ours) entertaining personal assumptions (see Publishers Weekly review), viewpoints, and pet themes. Why, in the middle of a purported historical work on the Founding Fathers, does he digress into making weak connections with the war in Iraq, his generalizations of contemporary America, and other unrelated, obviously biased drivel? If I want politically charged opinion on the topics of the day, I'll read Op/Ed pieces, or at least something that admits its bias from the onset. If you are looking for an unbiased, focused, and SCHOLARLY substantive work on the topic, read Ellis' Founding Brothers. It won the Pulitzer--because it is everything Inventing a Nation is not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Creating history in his own image.","review":"I concede that history is written with some bias as to the opinion of the Author, but historians are, or should be, purveyors of those opinions, not the manufacturers of them. Historians are not writing history, they are in a manner of speaking, collecting and reporting on history as it was written. I would not recommend this book as a basis for understanding this period of time (Try Benson Bobricks - Angel in the Whirlwind, or McCullough's - John Adams). This book is history according to Mr. Vidal. His references to modern day events and persons are more an indication of his political leanings, than his connection of current events with events of the past. You can not understand the present by making moral judgements on historical individuals since they did not have benefit of your understanding of the past, conversely, they had no understanding of what was to come. History is becoming a victim of politics; when it should be an accounting of the past. Skip-it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning","review":"This book about the founding of the USA is laced with anti-Bush diatribes. This is more political commentary than history. If this is what you are expecting, then you should enjoy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some history interspersed with the 'Hate Bush' propaganda","review":"I borrowed the audio book set of this book, not knowing anything about its author or his political views, hoping to get a greater insight into the minds of the founding fathers. Unfortunately what I found to be the most prominent subject matter of this work was the anti-Bush/Republican propaganda. Now, I do take exception with many of the policies and stances of the current U.S. presidency, however, if I wanted to research the effecacious practices of the current presidency I would have rather borrowed from my library a politically motivated work. I, for one, find no place for such subjectiveness in a work on what is supposedly historical truth. I prefer my history books to simply contain history, not political commentary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Manipulative Nonsense","review":"I had never read a Gore Vidal book before. I was looking forward to it and even enjoyed the first twenty pages or so. Then Vidal starts manipulating history. I had no idea why he was distorting things until he went off on his tirade about corruption and the 2000 election that has no place in this book. I actually agreed with most of Vidal's points about corruption in current government, but there is no excuse for his manipulation of facts. He guesses at motives, or makes them smoothly fit into his ideals. The more I read, the more insane Vidal became. Making absolutely stupid conjectures about the founders' actions and how they would look shamefully upon this America (when they lived in an America where Tarring and Feathering was common). There are much more accurate books on the foundation of the country and much better books about the current political climate. Vidal's corruption of history is despicable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another trash the founding fathers book","review":"This book is a sorry attempt to trash the founding fathers of the United States of America.

Instead, these tapes try to take the very complex study of \\"terrorism\\" (political violence) and explain it in 60 minute intervals. The only utility of some of these tapes is the background information on some of the groups portrayed in the series. I would highly suggest any viewer to question the credibility of the information on these tapes and also note the dating of the material examined.As a scholar of political violence (\\"terrorism\\"), I would suggest viewers instead pickup books and journal articles to gain a better understanding of the phenomenon of \\"terrorism.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Fascinating but not practical","review":"I would agree with other reviews in that this book does not contain clear instructions. Many individual steps are cramed into a single confused diagram. Most of the instructions lack clarity and a simple step by step approach that is common to how-to origami books. I also am of the opinion that many of the folds are not good, clean origami. Additionally, even in the diagrams, several of the end result objects do not look like what they are intended to be. There is a basketball player project where the end result looks more like E.T. holding a crystal.More of the pages should've been used showing step-by-step instructions instead of short-cutting many of the diagrams into step-step-step by step-step-step drawings that look like the artist was as confused as most people attempting to use this book.This book is not for beginners or intermediate users.

My desire is not to tear this piece to pieces, and while I am not of the faith of the people in the film or most probably the people who buy the film as well, the movie is sub-par. A few examples include, 1) Staircases exploding from the side of the burning house, 2) The pastor's denial that his rescuer in the fire was another firefighter who said, and I quote \\"Follow me and walk in my path.\\" There are many examples of items similar to the aforementioned.

Bad form.Just exactly who is dear Rita trying to kid with the likes of Jody Miller? Jody's behavior is at the very least outragious and nobody bothers to find out why. Nor is there any indication that serious efforts were made to find out who really gave her that shiner. It must really be nice being a juvenile delinquent in Rita's version of Crozet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review of \\"Murder On The Prowl\\"","review":"As I have stated before, I love the series of mysteries written by Rita Mae Brown. Her use of Mrs. Murphy, the tiger cat, Pewter, the overweight gray cat and T. Tucker, the Corgi, to help solve murders in a small town in Virginia are so interesting and the animals are immensely appealing. Even if you are not an animal lover, you would enjoy the way they are woven through the story. Rita Mae Brown is a very good mystery writer and I seldom figure out who the murderer is before the end of the story. She's very creative in her settings and sometimes they are very unusual. I certainly recommend the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"uninteresting subject matter...","review":"does NOT compare to The \\"Cat Who\\" series by Lillian Jackson Braun, whose books were humorous and easy to follow fiction"},{"rating":"2","title":"Vintage Halloween","review":"Fantastic collection of light-hearted Rock 'N' Roll songs for any party during October. These songs are catchy as well as hard to come by. Horror Hop is the companion to Monster Bop, another cd packed with a bunch of songs from the 1950s and 60s, perfect for Halloween parties. The songs were probably taken from actual records rather than the original source, but it still sounds pretty decent. Besides, where else are you going to find all these songs? All the songs are great. They even got Lon Chaney Jr. singing a song about monsters stealing Christmas presents from Santa. However they could have left out the song \\"The Zoo\\". Hearing a song about seeing rhinos, hippos and monkeys at the zoo doesn't exactly conjure up images of ghosts and graveyards in ones mind. But who cares? There are 30 other songs to play during your next Halloween party."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vintage Monster rock music!!!","review":"I just bought this CD and the music is real vintage rock music with a monster theme to it! It seems it's from the 50s or 60s,but hard to say which time period. My only 2 complaints is that each track song listed on the back cover does not have it's release date! and the thin booklet that comes with it only have photos of some of the bands with no written commentary on this music genre. I wish it did! The sound quality is great and clear and some of the songs have a rockabilly sound to it with cheezy vintage terror sound effects! Awesome!I give it 4 stars for the great spooky music but 1 less star because no release dates on each track song."},{"rating":"1","title":"I got Screwed","review":"I sent for this item, the song selection is great, but it has a manufacturing defect, there is very noticeble unwanted noise throughout the CD.

Now I have two useless CDs that they charged to my credit card and they never replied to my complaint. This after being a long time customer who has spent thousands of dollars here. So much for customer respect.~John Alfano"},{"rating":"1","title":"None","review":"Flew has some good points, he's well read and obviously an intelligent individual.

They keep you on the phone for 45 minutes going trough very basic driver checks and reloading the printer software and then tell you you have to go to the next level of support to waste more time. They know this tray thing is mechanical but they won't address the issue headon, hoping you will go away.

Now he's the biggest thriller writer in existence. I like Patterson's stories, but I don't think his pre-1990 novels are worth reading.THE MIDNIGHT CLUB is an example of why. It comes across as a pretty mediocre novel, especially if you've read a lot of thriller fiction. The characters are quite flat, and the plot is pretty predictable and filled with silly cliches. The romance, in particular, is not the least bit believable. Unlike Patterson's later novels, this book is also pretty slow paced and overwritten in sections. I found it a chore to read.I think THE MIDNIGHT CLUB is for Patterson completists only. If you're new to his work, my advice is to try KISS THE GIRLS, 1ST TO DIE, THE QUICKIE, or JUDGE & JURY. Those novels are far more entertaining than what I found here."},{"rating":"2","title":"ANOTHER GREAT JAMES PATTERSON STORY","review":"HE IS MY ALL-TIME FAVORITE AUTHOR, I'VE LOVED ALL OF HIS BOOK EXCEPT FOR THE FLYING CHILDREN SERIES, A LITTLE TOO OUT THERE FOR MY TASTE"},{"rating":"1","title":"not good..couldnt get into it","review":"I just couldnt get into this book at all. it starts out okay but then it just plateaus and nothing exciting happens. not worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Holds your interest","review":"I have recently found James Patterson.

The greatest flaws were the characters, and the climax (if you want to call it that). The characters were so 2 dimensional, with no real emotion, just basic stuff like \\"he was angry, she was sad.\\" And the love story... need I say how simple and lame that was.

However, my excitement lasted for about the first 10 pages.

The last 100 pages, however, were horribly disappointing. Most notably, there is NO description of how the plan that is the climax of the book is developed or pulled off.

The hero just can't trust anyone. The villain is a superman with absolutely no morals. I've read most of the James Patterson novels, and he vacillates between really good and pure nonsense. This book is from the latter end.The sadistic and perverse sex doesn't add anything to the book. Really, now, naked 12-year old girls? Torture? Rape? I'm not a prude, but I objected to all this sexual melange because it was obvious that the writer threw it in, not because it developed the plot but because it would--well, you supply the rest of that.Patterson has given us much better books. Much, much, much better. This one is a waste of paper and reading time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read","review":"I thought this was one of his better books not involving Alex Cross.

From the moment the book starts till the end, you really do get a feel for the main character and the pain he is going through.

I even use it during the morning round-up around the downtown hotels, because it is a kind of hypnotic music, with the bass rhythm keeping people in a slight trance as we move through the morning rush hour. It also helps keep down needless and silly inquiries as to the local weather, what the mayor is doing, what the Governator is doing, when the gay parade is coming, and if I am doing this job fulltime, or do I work in a real job?In other words, busloads of pretty well-heeled folks from around the world put their stamp of approval on this great driving CD.Down the Silverado trail, here we go!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One Star For the One Track I Liked","review":"I'm going to the trouble of writing this review to warn you: this cd is not like the other Putumayo cds.

I use it for commentating and skype calls. a downfall to this mic is how quiet it is! you have to be about a foot and a half away to get loud enough sound. really clear audio though. not a lot of background noise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blue Mic","review":"Great to use with Skype on my laptop which is the reason that I purchased it on the recommendation of a friend"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very clear, good affordable starter mic for recording","review":"I mainly got this microphone because I couldn't afford a super-high-quality professional recording studio mic but I wanted to start doing some vocal and instrumental work. It sounds really good, very clear, and the -10 dB pad cardioid mode (position 2 on the mode switch) is very good for very blast-y instruments like saxophones.However, I noticed that it picks up a little too much in the lower range, which gives the sound a bit of a boxy (and for voice, nasally) feel instead of the more airy, clear sound that I was originally looking for. Don't get me wrong, it's a big improvement over the Logitech headset mic I was recording on before, but I think I'll save up and get a real high-quality mic before I start getting really serious about recording. I'd probably get two mics, a condenser for vocals/narration and a ribbon for my sax."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best USB mic in the price range","review":"I have years of experience in recording and live sound. This mic is definitely the best quality you are going to get in a USB mic. That being said, you have to expect that this thing is not going to be good for micing things like screaming, loud electric guitars, and drums. For that, you need to be looking more in the direction of an actual mic and USB interface. This thing is very good with regular singing, podcasts, acoustic guitar, and light instruments. Definitely well worth the money. It's a very good bargain for what it does. Sound quality is nothing you'd expect for under a hundred dollars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Well","review":"Used primarily as the audio source for recording online video tutorials. The space in which you record is very important. If you have a dedicated area where the microphone and other recording equipment is set and stays in place, you should be able to produce good quality results in a very short period of time. If you have to move your recording area around all the time, you could get very unpredictable results in volume and voice quality.Overall a great product for the price, but as with any recording environment, be sure to test before you start recording to establish consistent recording results."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blue Rocks The House","review":"This is one of three DIFFERENT Blue microphones I have.

This microphone did a great, quality job. I have no complaints at all about the sound.However, I had a problem with the plug and play due to security restrictions on my computer at work. I work for a government agency and security's pretty tight. I have admin. rights to my computer but I still had to use someone else's computer who had higher rights than I did before I could use the microphone. I used Adobe SoundBooth. I tried it on my personal computer and laptop at home and it was instantly recognized. Just a heads-up for those whose IT departments have got things wrapped up pretty tight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Satisfied.","review":"I use this to record piano practice.

Blue's user support has been utterly unhelpful with this problem. None of my phone calls were returned and the few comments posted on their online forums by user support have been rude. They have flatly refused to give any indication as to when or if the problem will be solved. Instead, they blame Microsoft and even suggest creating a separate XP-only partition on your hard drive so you can use this mic. The simple truth is that you won't be able to use this mic if you have a Vista machine. Read the forums on Blue's website for more on this before you waste your money. Good luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"No luck on Windows XP","review":"Bought this mic on the positive reviews here - could not make it work on my Windows XP system.

You can raise the mic, but it does not stay - just slides back down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this Mic!!!","review":"You're really taking a gamble with this mic. I plugged it in and followed all the instructions included and its just not picking my voice up. It sounds like I'm 5 feet away. There is no way to up the gain and after a quick search on google, it seems that Blue knows that either there is a compatibility issue with Windows 7 32bit or that there are some bad units in circulation. Avoid this mic! I'm heading to Guitar center tomorrow because they have some in stock and I'm going to gamble again...but this Snowball is getting thrown back to amazon. BTW, the copyright under my box was 2009.If you search google, there are a lot of people angry with the Blue Snowball and their customer service is known far and wide to be lacking.

Contrary to what the user manual says, I found setting 3 to be best for vocals and most guitars -- setting 1 came across as too distant and flat, while setting 3 seems to provide more presence and richness. I highly recommend using the mic in conjunction with a pop filter for vocals. Also, don't hold the mic while recording, because doing so produces audible sounds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"This thing ROCKS! I bought the Snowball to record hypnotherapy sessions, and I love it so much, I'm podcasting now!I love how it easily just plugs right in to my Mac and Garage Band knows exactly what to do with it. There was no learning curve whatsoever, it was just plug-and-play. The added bonus is that it looks really cool, so it's not like I have a lot of gadget-y equipment in my nice peaceful office. The sound quality is more than I could wish for, making for great professional sounding recordings with minimal or no surrounding noises making their way in, which is very important for my clients' recordings. The only thing I would change would to add a travel pouch to keep the Snowball safe during travel from my home to the office and back.

All of my Macs have successfully used other USB mics without additional drivers, so I do not believe Blue's assertion that these problems are Leopard's fault. Apple sells this product in its own stores. It wouldn't if it were truly incompatible with its OS. Blue's support offered no help except to suggest that return the product for a refund.I would have been happy to receive a replacement, however, the unhelpful and seemingly uninterested help from Blue has made me decide to never buy another Blue product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of crap!","review":"What a steaming pile this thing is.

I didn't like how it didn't come with directions on how to setup the stand since I had no idea so I had to figure out myself, but it isn't too difficult.

I've heard nothing but good about this Microphone and it was only the truth.I highly recommend you buy this if your into Podcast and going videos for Youtube.Downfall is the mic picks up EVERYTHING! if your in a small room with a TV behind you its going to pick that up you will need a quite room since the microphone grabs stuff it hears but thats the good thing you could be around 4-5 feet away this microphone will pick up your voice."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Niece Is So Happy With This","review":"I bought this for my niece who makes YouTube videos of her playing her guitar.

You won't have to do any editing to the vocal track. Just drop the track in and it's good to go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Microphone After Kinks Worked Out","review":"My organization purchased the Blue Snowball to conduct a educational webinar series. The microphone is easy to use and has good sound quality. An important thing to note is the microphone needs RAM and a fast processor to work ideally. Initially, we used a mediocre computer and had mixed results. In the testing phase with the Snowball, one user with a laptop had their speakers on max to hear me just below normal speaking volume. After switching to a computer with a lot of RAM and processing speed, this problem was alleviated. Another great feature of this microphone is the ability to change channels and frequency. Buried in its settings you can adjust the microphone from the default 1 channel, 44,000 Hz to 2 channels, 48,000 HZ. Overall, it is a decent condenser microphone for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Windows 7 & the Blue Snowball","review":"When I got the Snowball I was a little alarmed because the box and instructions didn't actually indicate that the Mike is compatible with Windows 7.When I first plugged the mike into my computer, Windows 7 started babbling something about software and the mike didn't work. But typical to my experience with Windows 7, I restarted the computer with the Snowball plugged in and Windows 7 found the Snowball, it's software and it came to life.I've played in bands for about 40 years and while I don't know if this mike would put up with high audio levels found in a performance situation, it certainly has a wonderful tonality (I sound like me!) with very little room noise pickup and provides the computer with good audio levels in my home setting.This is going to make my creation of \\"crazy grandpa\\" videos for my grandchildren a lot easier and they'll remember my clear melodious voice in high fidelity for years to come. Good Microphone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Mic!","review":"This is my first review, but I wanted to post because I almost didn't buy the mic because of some of the reviews here, but I went with my gut and got it anyway. It is totally amazing! I think the other reviewers that are complaining about it, simply just don't understand how these types of microphones work. To have a pro level mic, that plugs directly into USB for under $100 is incredible! Get this mic, you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fatal Flaw","review":"I'm using my Snowball under Windows 7. The unit is a new unit so it should have the \\"high gain\\" firmware update already installed (I can't be sure; the company says it isn't needed on models after a certain serial number but I can't find a serial number *anywhere* on this mic or the box)Anyway, the problem, as others have mentioned, is that the mic's gain is just too little. To record voice, you have to have all your software input levels at 100% AND have the mic about 2 inches from your mouth. Then on playback, you will need strong speakers as well. If you can't get the mic close to your mouth, or you are trying to record a room of people, forget it.I've sent an email to customer service, but no response.This *could have been* a great product-- what were they thinking??"},{"rating":"1","title":"Recording level too low","review":"It's pretty. It gets great sound, but the recording level is just too low.I went through two of these things, and here's the deal. If you are going to be two inches from it, or you are going to be recording loud sources, you'll be pleased as punch.If you are going to be recording the normal volume of a human voice, or you want to record a number of participants around a table, you will find that the recording levels are just far far too low.To make sure I didn't just get a bad one, I went through two of these and found exactly the same problem. I even spent a good deal of time with their customer support person (who seems to be a really swell guy) and there are no driver or firmware updates to increase the gain on this newer version of the microphone. It's just the way these microphones are designed.I ended up sending the two Snowballs back and purchasing the Audio Technica AT2020USB Condenser USB Microphone. The AT2020USB turned out to be just perfect for my use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent quality for the price","review":"I had been using a headset to record some screencast videos but the audio was sub-par.

I was able to tweek the settings, and within a couple of minutes my problem was solved.Also, I broke the tripod on accident while attempting to put it together, however I think this may have been more my own fault then the manufacturer's.

The second level is noisy with background static and the other two levels are noisier. The Bundle doesn't include the ringer; only the stand. You must purchase the ringer separately.

One at home and one at work. I've found them to be very finicky. A difference of an inch can change the audio levels a lot and since there is significant lag in the analog to digital conversion it is nearly impossible to monitor the levels while recording oneself. I finally gave up on these and went with a separate mic mixing board and firewire A/D converter.

I'm not certain how some of the CDs can be so well done, while others (like this one) can sound so amateur. Different musicians perhaps? The playing on this one is SO bad it's distracting.Instead, I would give really high ratings to some other CDs from Dr. Thompson, for example, I really like the \\"delta\\" (natural and ambient) music releases, the two \\"gamma meditation\\" releases get a lot of spins around here, as do the \\"healing mind\\" CDs. The two \\"delta\\" sleep disks are wonderful also.\\"Sapphire Skies\\" is just not his best effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beavis & Butthead Production","review":"This DVD is a completely amateur production. I've seen better high school video productions. The material was not presented in a straightforward manner. There is more footage of Bob & Brett than of the Pro-Tools interface. There is little to no attention paid to detail or accuracy. For example, they show you how to arm the click track for recording as if they were going to record audio to the click track itself. Brett probably says \\"So\\" and claps his hands about 50 times. I don't know the total for sure because I couldn't stomach the whole DVD. It looked as if they had no script at all. They were kind of just winging it as they went along. It was a very unprofessional and uninformative production overall.

If you look at the number of first and second round knockouts of champions and top contenders, then you will agree with me. Floyd Patterson and Cleveland Williams at the hands of Sonny; Joe Frazier and Ken Norton at the hands of Big George.The problem with these big punchers was that they lacked defense at the hands of a skilled boxer, who stayed out of range of their big punches. Another problem was their lack of stamina or endurance. Since most of their opponents were knocked out by the third round, they did not really train to go the distance, although Sonny Liston's performance in the twelve-round fight with Eddie Machen was commendable. A third problem was that they could not really take a punch and if you could sneak in a good one, then they would fall down. A fourth problem was that they did not have the will to keep fighting right to the last minute."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heavyweights The Big Punchers","review":"The video itself was OK, but failed to mention the greatest punchers in boxing history!

My son found this book just as much of a hoot as the poop book. His sense of humor isnt, shall we say, all that sophisticated and *going for the gross-out* in his case might be considered a plus.So while I, as a mom, didn't find this to be anywhere near as good as the other book, I think my son enjoyed it as much and since it was a book for him, I have to say that ultimately it was a good purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"educational story","review":"I first came across this book at Toys R Us.

I find it refreashing that someone has finally written a book about such things."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Boring Treatment of an Interesting Body Part","review":"Another book in the spirit of Everyone Poops, but without the same humor or simplicity. It opens with comparisons of different people's nose holes, and proceeds to animals' nose holes (the dolphin has one on top of its head; seals and hippos can close theirs to go underwater). The content of \\"boogers\\" is described, and there's an explanation of how the nose and mouth are connected. There's a little experimentation, where children are asked to hold their nose and try to talk, and a bit of non-essential body humor: \\"Wed the holes in my dose are sdubbed ub, I candt sbell id eved wed I fart.\\"Young children are fascinated with the aspects of their body which they are not allowed to talk about, and this book attempts to bring a lighthearted, scientific understanding to this oft-overlooked body part.

However, while Modesitt is able to keep interest in his books by delving into the history of his fantasy world, they all seem to follow a basic formula and that formula is begining to wear a little thin. I personally would continue to read any new books in the Recluse series, Modesitt has been able to keep my attention with a long running series without sacrificing quality like Goodkind, or even Jordan(face it, Jordans last 2 haven't been all that great, just filler). But I think that in order to keep the interest of other people he needs to change the formula, give us something unexpected, suprise us.

Modesitt continues the tale of Lorn in this sequel to Magi'i of Cyador. Modesitt fills in more of the history of Candor and deals again with the themes of power and action. I would strongly recommend this book to those following the Saga of Recluce or who have not. This pair of books even stands well by themselves for the 10th and 11th books in a series. All the elements of an excellent novel are present well rounded characters, solid descriptions, good dialog and a strong plot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story and characters, too much repetition","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book and its really on a 5-star caliber, but I just can't help being a little frustrated at how repeptitive Modesitt is, not only throughout the series, but also within this one book. I mean, how many times do you have to describe how much Lorn loves the Pearapple tarts and does he really need to read the same five poems over and over again?? Even still, I'd give this one 4.5 stars because this really is a great story that was a lot of fun to read. Lorn and the other characters are really great and the whole land of Cyador with all of its political factions, secrecy, and plotting makes up to a very believable and exciting world. I'd reccomend this one but remember to read the Magi'i of Cyador first (you don't need to read the rest of the series though and actually these two would be a pretty good place to begin)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scion of Cyador","review":"I enjoy the Saga of Recluse series.

I really didn't care enough about a chicken carcass being thrown overboard and sinking to the bottom of the ocean to read about it for three pages. Every situation is explained to absolute death, and I found myself yawning endlessly until I finally, joyously, reached the end. I recoiled in horror when I saw a new book by the same author in bookstores. Reading this one was enough to put me off this writer forever, and warn everyone I can reach!

Obviously, this can be broken down into 1000s of subtopics. It's a good introductory book to the basic aspects of Native American studies.The tone set by Fleming is obviously a native perspective. That's great, as we already have plenty of white perspectives. Regardless, some of the things he says are objectionable, but i highly doubt any of the facts are false. Ironically though, some of the things in this book are claimed false by other books. That's just the nature of this topic.This book is best to be accompanied by other books. It's difficult finding accurate information on this subject though. It's best to stay away from scientific and anthropological books, which can be very inaccurate and biased."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to continue reading after glaring errors","review":"I bought this book as I was traveling in the Southwest. I enjoyed the first couple of chapters and looked forward to getting into the meat of the book. The style was fun and I picked up a lot of facts I hadn't been aware of.I had just finished reading \\"The Wordy Shipmates\\" and so I was quite surprised to find that (according to the book) Squanto helped the settlers in Jamestown. That made it hard for me to enjoy the rest of the book. How many other errors are there that I didn't pick up? It made me suspicious of all the \\"Idiot's Guide\\"s I've purchased or thought of purchasing. Don't they require an expert reviewer?I'm very sympathetic to the native american tragedy and the author had a chance to improve the general perception of the Europeans' conquest of the New World.

You won't find anything useful, fun, or informative here.If, on the other hand, you want a play by play of everything crappy that has happened to native americans since white people set eyes on them, you'll love this book. If that was its purpose, it's a great book but to me it seemed like a whole lot of whining disguised as an introduction to the culture and history of native americans. It's a lot like a teacher or professor giving a political rant instead of, say, teaching the subject you came to learn.If you're old enough to read and haven't already learned how horrible white people have been to native americans, you're a complete idiot and reading this book won't help you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank You, book I've been wating for","review":"I've been wanting to get my SSCP for some time (hoping to ultimately get CISSP), but it has been difficult becasue there is not a lot out there for study tools. I was psyched when I saw that Syngress was publishing a SSCP study guide, becaues I've used theeir books before on other exams and always really liked them. This book did not diappoint. The book is very will written and does an excellent job of covering all of the (ISC)2 domains. The authors are CISSPs and SSCPs and you can tell they know what material is important to highlight in the text for the exam. The DVD that comes w/ the book is excellent as well. You get a couple of hours of instructor training with power point presentations, graphics, etc. This exam has a lot of theory and concept types of things, so it definitely helps to have an instrutor explain this stuff in addition to just reading the book. Anyway, many thanks to Syngress and the authors for a long overdue book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy","review":"The SSCP DVD and Training System was probably the most useless training mechanism I have ever used. The book is divided correctly, however it fails to cover important information on the exam. Some chapters are unclear, and overlap to an extent where it becomes unclear as to what domain you are actually covering.The DVD was the biggest disappointment of all. It is a quick PowerPoint presentation with the author in a PIP window giving an overview of \\"key points\\".Needless to say I used this as my single point for studying and FAILED the exam.DO NOT BUY!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent set","review":"This is a very good set to own if you are a Bonanza episode collector. The beginning of each tape has a short narration that really sets up the episode. The video and audio are excellent. Our Bonanza theme song isn't there, but that a very minor thing.

After a few full lengths and some single eps, Prefuse 73 has explored both ends of the spectrum, from a more traditional hip-hop sound to a more electronic sound. This collaboration leans much more towards the electronic side, as there aren't guest rappers on this effort. I enjoy this the most out of his works. This just doesn't sound like much else that is out there, including his other works. This ep has enough innovation to keep the listener interested, however it is possible to sit back and enjoy this shorter release without concentrating too hard either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great film, even with the dancing","review":"This film is the only Bollywood movie I have seen, but the plot is so engrossing that it quickly takes away any preconceived ideas one might have about Indian movies. Although there are a few down sides, the overall \\"awesomeness\\" of this film makes up for it. The premise of the entire film is very unbelievable, but the fact that director was able to take that and still make a memorable film is a huge achievement in itself. The unintentional comedy is what makes this film so unique and good. Although it's not \\"good\\" like The Godfather, it's still good like a good old superhero film. With the extremely long and drawn out dance sequences aside, KRRISH is a one-of-a-kind film that has good morals and is still fun to watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't like it","review":"I love Bollywood but I have to say this film is not one of my favorites. I understand it did tremendously well at the Box office yet I don't understand why. Perhaps because of the dancing and charm of lead actor, Hrithik Roshan who imo, has yet to prove his ability as an actor. The guy needs to stop making these movies where all he does is dance and pose for the camera. That's pretty much all he does in this movie. It's supposed to be a movie about a super hero yet we don't really get to see that super hero until the very latter parts of the film. The lead actress, Priyanka Chopra is terrible. Just terrible.The love story doesn't work. In fact, nothing works except for the scarce appearances of Rekha who seems to give the only real performance in the film. Give this one a skip unless you're a fan of Hrithik Roshan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Coming Home","review":"I returned the DVD because it was evidently the \\"edited for cable\\" version and I wanted the full version.

For instance, to blow up a small childs plastic swimming pool takes at least 10 minutes. As you notice, nowhere can you find the airflow amount on this compressor. My advice is to pay more and buy a better product. I wish I had. The positives are, it's cheap...and it's small, so you can keep it stored in your car for emergencies. Oh, almost forgot, the power cord has a label stating that it contains lead. Now that part wouldn't bother me since alot of products have warning labels, but then it says to wash hands after use?

The film reproduces the look and much of the style of movies of the mid-Sixties and does so masterfully. The film parodies the style but hews closely enough that it could easily be just an extreme example of an actual Sixties film. The protagonist, played by the amazing Jean Dujardin, is cheerfully oblivious to his obliviousness in the way of Peter Sellers' Clouseau and Will Farrell's mainstream Hollywood characters (but in a film with wit and intelligence beyond any of those mainstream Farrell comedies)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good For a Few Laughs","review":"I bought this along with a few other similar spy comedy titles, and this was the second best title behind the first OSS 117: Cairo, Nest of Spies. I enjoyed this, but after Nest of Spies this wasn't quite as funny. It's a more polished movie in many ways, reflecting the advances in filmmaking at the time that the director and crew ably imitate in the modern era, but it just didn't tickle my funnybone quite the same way. Still, this is a quality title, and one I reccomend with one caveat; buy and watch the first adventure of OSS 117, then if you enjoy that movie come back and buy this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cairo is better","review":"I would say the funniest part of the movie is the opening scene. Oh, and the chase scene in the hospital. As an American with no knowledge of French or French humor, I could be missing something, I suppose, but it seems that the other reviewers agree with me that \\"Cairo, Nest of Spies\\" was better. And since no one else has mentioned it, I suppose I should warn you that this contains a slight amount of nudity. For those of you who think this may be an additional reason to buy the movie, it isn't.Note: when I give a two star review, it doesn't mean \\"I don't like it,\\" it means \\"if you have nothing better to do, it's not a complete waste of time.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninspired Sequel to OSS 117 Cairo Nest of Spies","review":"The thought behind the first spy spoof featuring OSS 117 was that France's imperialist ambitions in the Mid-East were guided by clueless bureaucrats and their agents who never bothered to learn about the cultures they were controlling. And it worked! But the sequel is absolutely meaningless.Our super-spy is sent to Brazil to track down a former SS Nazi who is selling a list of French Nazi collaborators. The mission is to \\"deliver ransom money\\" to the Nazi. Right from the start, it is clear who is \\"on the list.\\" When OSS 117 goes to Rio, he meets some Israeli Mossad agents who want to capture the Nazi and put him on trial in Israel...and have no interest in thelist of dirty French bureaucrats.The plot is thin...the acting even thinner. This is one French spoof that you should avoid.

At their first show, I picked up a s/t ep with 5 songs on it. I was instantly hooked. I then got a Hopeless Records sampler called \\"2001:a punk oddity\\" where I heard the song \\"Identity Crisis\\". I couldn't belive it was them. Before, they were a band no one knew of, and now, they're on one of the biggest punk rock labels. I was excited to see how much they matured, and I wasn't let down a bit.This cd blends the cruncing guitars and screamed vocals of hardcore, and the melodies of pop punk to make it even more original. With songs like \\"To What End\\", \\"Pheonix Ignition\\", and \\"T&C\\", you can't go wrong. A sure winner for fans of any kind of punk rock."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you were to buy one CD this year make it this one","review":"In my opinion Thrice Identity Crisis is the future of melodic hardcore their lyrics with so much passion and their music with so much power I love this CD"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thrice times champion!

LILLIAN!","review":"Ms. Braun has obviously worked this formula for all it is worth and should put it to rest. While I could not wait for her previous works to hit the stands, it has become almost embarrassing to read her last few books in the CAT WHO series. Especially if you are expecting a mystery with lots of witty interchanges between man and cat(s).The only roll the cats have lately is loud meows and eating. And forget about mystery. What it is about is Quill's community service, eating out, and writing his column. I totally agree with Pat Dulude's review on every point. So without having to repeat everything, just read that review and remember the days when THE CAT WHO books were exciting and fun and move on to another author that can deliver."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can we say GHOSTWRITER?","review":"Having read the entire Cat Who...series through five times, I am noticing a profound change in the books. Several of the reviews address the fact that the characters and story are falling flatter with each new book. That being said, has anyone noticed that the entire writing style has changed?My theory is that the first few books (the \\"non-wealthy Qwill\\" ones) were written by Braun. Gradually another writer phased in the \\"Moose County\\" era (the most charming of the series, to me). These past few books are NOT by the same person who came up with the Moose County idea. A lot of the phrases are copied from older books, but the writing style is more elementary. It's as if the book flip-flops between Braun's writing and \\"filler\\" writing. Is anyone with me? This book is so disappointing, I can't even finish it. I think I'll go curl up with \\"The Cat Who Wasn't There\\" and start the best part of the series again. Sigh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ho-Hum","review":"The newest Cat Who book has its charming moments, but just like the last few books, it's mostly about the old days of Moose County and very little about a mystery. The mystery in Cat Up the Creek is secondary and feels rushed. I keep hoping the author will write these books as she did the earlier ones, in which Qwill and the cats dominated the stories and there was no Polly. The Cat Who Saw Red is one of my favorites; also the Cat Who Played Post Office where Qwill got into an accident while riding his bicycle. And how about The Cat Who Lived High, an interesting departure for Qwill and the cats into the world of a rundown hotel. Ah, those were the days - and the books - that made the Cat Who series so great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ho Hum","review":"Having read all the of Cat Who's, I've got to say the only enjoyable sections in this, the 24th, are when Quill and the cats are reading, playing, eating or just simply musing. Agree there is too much filler here and not enough pasties (meat). The plot wanders around and in particular, the Polly and Walter plot went nowhere. Quill and the gang are old friends but they either need a real vacation or maybe a dog to spice things up."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Cat Who -- a real sinker","review":"Definitely not one of Lilian Jackson Braun's best efforts. Ms. Braun's writing seems more formulaic than inspirational. Qwill offers several conclusions to the \\"case\\", that leaves the reader to accept what seems correct to her or him. I wouldn't recommend this book..."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm still trying to figure out what the mystery was.","review":"As so many others, I too have read & reread all of The \\"Cat Who\\" books. They have always brought me such pleasure. They are easy to read, are never insulting to my senses and leave me in a pleasant frame of mind. Not this one! I felt as if I had been taken up the creek and left there without a plot. Just a lot of menu ideas for a dinner party. Could Lillian have been on a diet while she was writing this book?I can only hope that her next \\"Cat Who\\" puts us both back on solid ground."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I am a fan of Braun, have all her books, reread them from time to time and have enjoyed them all -- except this one. I felt the characters -- even the returning ones -- were flat, \\"Quill\\" didn't exhibit his usual witty repartee and the book didn't flow with Braun's normal intelligence. Quill seemed more preoccupied with who he was taking to dinner and what he was eating than the actual mystery. While reading, I wondered if this, in fact, was a draft that was published for whatever reason. If this had been the first book of the series that I had read, I don't think I would have read any of the others.Keep in mind, though, that Braun has set some very high standards for her readers. I shouldn't expect her to hit the mark every time, and yet she has until this book. I admit, she's spoiled me. I'm looking forward to the next one with the hope that she will again be back on top."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've lost a friend","review":"I've read and listened to all the books in this series, spending many enjoyable (!) hours on the freeway listening to the talking books and forgetting about everyday concerns.Unfortunately, this book is unfulfilling. I missed the mysteries, character development, and plot of the earlier books in which each book was an adventure. It was like visiting old friends. This is no longer the case.I understand Lilian Jackson Braun plans one last book and I only hope that it lives up to the wonderful early stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Something is missing here","review":"When I finished this book, I was left with such a sad feeling! My first thought was that Ms. Braun had passed on, and someone else wrote this book. The mystery at the end was never really solved, Quill just assumed who the culprit was. The story line of Polly and Walter was left hanging. The whole book revolved around Quill's vacation and the social happenings at Black Creek, rather than focusing on the mystery. Even the cats played a small role this time. All of the new characters introduced were not well fleshed out, and the old favorites just made some cameo appearances (Arch and Mildred, for example). Whomever wrote this (and I don't believe it was Ms. Braun) should go back and read the previous titles. Something is missing here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Down By The Creekside","review":"Another vacation without Polly. Qwill and the cats go to stay by Walnut Creek. First they stay in the lodge. You could tell they weren't comfortable. So they decide to rent a cabin by the creek. The only problem is that none is empty and the man who should be checking out has disappeared. Could he have been the body Qwill saw floating downstream?I emjoyed this episode of \\"The Cat Who\\" series. It was comforting spending time with Qwill and the cats in the land of Moose County."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where was the climax?","review":"I have been a fan of Quill and his amazing cats for a few years, but this one really soured me. When I finally got to the \\"climax?\\", I felt like I must have missed something. It fell flat. Was that what I stuck through the books for? What about Walter, the heart condition,etc,etc,etc?

These books are cute, but the formula never changes. A stranger (non-Moose County person) is involved in some mysterious dealing that Qwill and the cats must investigate. How boring. Here's some advice for the people that loved it -- find a new author, one with imagination.I wish that the author would find a new formula for her books. But, why bother when this one will end up a New York Times bestseller like all of the rest of her books? I am very glad that I borrowed this book from the library. Don't waste your money on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"I have read all the books in this series; they are my reading \\"comfort food\\" when I need something warm and cosy. The eccentric population of Moose County are, for the most part, the type of warm and kind people I would like to have in my own life. However, there is very little of that in this book. Most of the regulars are not heard from. The cats are too much like my own rather untalented critters (although I love them dearly, they can't find their dishes without my help, let alone solve mysteries!), and Qwill seems unfocused and not very interested in this mystery, either. It is the only one of these books I haven't re-read, and I can't bring myself to do so.I see that there is to be a new book due out in January. Let's hope that this one will be \\" the cat who did something\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Haven't read an obituary....BUT","review":"I TOTALLY agree with \\"GhostWriter\\" and \\"Former Glory\\". These books are not being written by LJB any longer. The style is completely different and the stories are non existant. Read the first one, \\"The Cat Who Read Backwards\\", and then read this one and tell me it is written by the same person! Not to mention the fact LJB wrote the first book in 1966 and she was old THEN, she must be something like in her 90's. I am convinced if she is still alive, someone is writing the books in her name. Goodbye Lilian, rest in peace but this is the last Cat Who...for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best one of the series, by any means","review":"I have read several of \\"The Cat Who\\" series over the years. I personally liked them better before Qwill became a multi-millionaire and had money to answer every single problem that came up. The plots seemed to loose \\"creativity\\" when big bucks from the K Fund are ALWAYS the answer.In this particular volume I thought if I read one more reference to \\"Mother Earth\\" I was gonna just trash can the whole book. I managed to hang on to the very dissapointing end. I suppose if you are a liberal enviromentalist wacko you could appreciate the message in this book, but I did not. I am saddened to see a work of fiction with such a blatant liberal agenda behind it.I do not reccommend this book..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"As a fan of Ms. Braun's Cat Who books I always look forward to each new chapter. But The Cat Who Went Up A Creek is a far cry from her usual entertaining fare. After 27 episodes featuring the cats, she has finally hit a wall. Without revealing any of the details of the mystery (and there are only a couple)this book relies too heavily on the local characters and Mr. Q's ability to have dinner with each of them. This book spends more time on social events surrounding Moose County than on even pretending there is a mystery. If this series is going to survive (and I hope it does) Ms. Braun needs to relocate Mr. Q and the cats to a different location, Moose County has become stale."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment for fans","review":"I have been a long time fan of the Cat Who mysteries, but the last couple of books in this series have been a severe disappointment for me. What happened to the well-plotted story lines, the devious twists and turns, and the rich cast of characters?This last installment is just mystifying to me. It seems to be written in a desultory way, as if the author is performing an unwanted task, or filling an onerous obligation by doing the minimum necessary to get by.If Lilian Jackson Braun is actually still writing these herself, I would be shocked. Even if it is getting hard to come by fresh ideas and new characters, I can't believe someone's actual style of writing could change so much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Feeling a little lost...","review":"I truly have unconditional love for this series but can not help but feel unsatisfied with the last couple of books. Well, actually since \\"Stars\\" came out. There have been some new characters introduced that go nowhere. Some central old characters are being ignored (Does no one else think that the cute new Inn Manager and Fran Brodie would be perfect for each other?). The mysteries are too predictable. I do not mean to be gruesome, but everyone being knocked off is someone from down below... I had to immediately go re-read an older book just to get a \\"Qwill\\" fix. What's happened?"},{"rating":"1","title":"There is no mystery here.","review":"Ms. Brauns' books about Qwill and his cats have been declining in the last several years, and this one confirms my fears -- that she has run out of ideas (there is no mystery, nor is anything remotely pretending to be a mystery resolved), and is published without much editing (she repeats herself in plot points and gets away with ignoring plot twists -- such as when a body is spotted in the water. The police are called and then for several pages it's as if nothing is amiss!) This book is more about travel, history, and only having conversations over meals, cookies, drinks or snacks. Granted, Qwill has always seemed a bit overly prim, even feminine (calling the cat litter box a commode, the vanity regarding his mustache, the obsessive compulsive neatness of his home) and he's getting prissier as he ages. I'm glad I didn't buy this book, and I sure won't recommend it to ANYbody."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"This will be the last new Braun book I'll buy. Most of the text includs \\"filler\\", like using a page to duplicate letters or stories, and lots about meals. It seems as if that was the main method for getting tidbits into the storyline.My biggest disappointed -- and a real surprise -- was that the ending was tidily summarized by Qwill based on his conclusions, not real facts. I would have been much happier with the book if some of the filler had been left out and a really well thought-out ending had been included. One that showed how detective work discovered the motives and confirmed the culprits."},{"rating":"2","title":"Time for another visit to Moose County","review":"This is the 24th installment of the continuing adventures of Qwill and friends. The action again is in Moose County, this time centering for most of the book on the newly opened Nutcracker Inn out on Black Creek. The mysteries and bodies begin pile up until Koko once again points Qwill in the right direction.As always with this series the mysteries are secondary to the characters. Qwill and his cats are like old friends to fans of the series. His on-going relationships with Polly and other friends in Moose County are what keep people looking for the next book. By now most fans could draw a map of Moose county and describe many of its residents.This book, like the others in the series, is not meant to be a challenging puzzle to figure out but is instead and pleasant read for a quiet weekend.There is no profanity, 'adult situations', or graphic violence."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Cat Who Went Up the Creek","review":"Maybe not as good as some her other Cat Who stories, however her newest like all her other books in this series is witty, amusing, very readable, entertaining, and suitable for any age. Lilian Jackson Braun is a great story teller. Read it in two days. Hope there is another Cat Who mystery this year. Would be great to have a feature film or tv series based on Cat Who mysteries."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another tour of Moose County","review":"Ms Braun has once more slipped away from writing about Qwill and the cats solving crimes. There's a lot of filler in this one about stories from county residents, the various people in the county, and Polly's travels, but very little about the crime or why Qwill gets involved. She needs to write a separate book about all the extraneous information she's beginning to create and publish it separately. This is one that adds little or nothing to our feelings for Qwill and the cats."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Cat Who Went up the Creek","review":"Jim Qwilleran is an unintentional sleuth.

I'm glad I did. It was a fun read and I wish it had been longer.

This Conair one is uesless. You might as well just buy a regular mirror with no lights. The bulbs are dim to say the least. Don't waste your time. Unfortunately the Clairol one is no longer made, but I would suggest looking for something similar that contains two 6w or higher flourescent bulbs. This Conair one has two tiny bulbs that are about as bright as a christmas bulb."},{"rating":"2","title":"makeup mirror","review":"I owned this mirror 20 yrs ago and I loved it so much I wanted another.

I got this Conair mirror yesterday, and it will be going back tomorrow. It doesn't even come close to replicating real lighting conditions. The \\"brightest\\" light setting is a dull yellow color, at best. There is no way you can get a true picture of what your makeup really looks like by using this yellow light.

But I am not happy with the Conair. The lighting is terrible, very yellow and dim in all settings. The mirror swivels horizontially, not vertically, making adustments not an option. The Jerdon swivels vertically, which makes it easy to adjust while using - tilt it for whatever you are doing. To turn the Conair on and off, the contrlo must be turned. If you use anything but the nearest setting, this is annoying. The Jerdon has an on/off switch, and the setting is a separate control. I seldom change my setting, so for me this is more convenient. Jerdon did immediately replace my mirror when I contacted them, and that is what I am now using. I have always liked Conair products. Don't know what they were thinking with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"So disappointed","review":"I've been searching for a mirror with lighting b/c my bedroom, where I usually apply my make up is quite dark. Unfortunately this mirror is not what I searched for. It's all the negative reviews sadly. The light is barely there. I have to keep overhead lighting, lamp, open window etc just to be able to see! I essentially wasted $25! I wanted to return this but they were not going to give me a full refund and were going to charge me for return shipping so I'm eating the cost.I honestly recommend that you save your money and purchase a more expensive mirror. I'm thinking of buying one to attach to the wall of my bathroom like the ones I've seen in luxury hotels in Vegas."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible","review":"I ordered this because my vintage Clairol true to light mirror finally gave out. As some other reviews said, the lighting on this thing is really bad. The magnification makes me cross eyed and I have to get my face practically on the glass before my skewed vision can clear up and I can see how to do anything. And the lighting! Don't get me started! The first time I went out after applying make up with this thing was down right scary. I'm sending it back. Unfortunately, after doing a lot of research, it seems there is much agreement that the true to light (now discontinued) was and still is the best make up mirror. I will be searching ebay for my replacement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me","review":"I bought this to replace a Jerdon three panel mirror that had pooped out after less than a year. To be fair, I had my previous Jerdon mirror for about three years, so maybe I just got a dud. Anyway, I decided to try this mirror, and was very disappointed. The lighting is harsh, and none of the settings looks at all natural. The middle mirror swivels from side to side;I prefer the up and down swivel of the Jerdon. I ended up giving this to my daughter and ordering another Jerdon. I would not re-order this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"light too dim","review":"The light is very poor on this mirror.

I was looking for a Clairol mirror with the two lighted sides. The closest I could find was this Conair and after reading the reviews, I thought I'd give it a shot. It was a total disappointment. Ended up giving it to my 10 year old daughter. I knew going into it that probably the only good setting would be daytime but even that didn't work well. The bulbs are not the flourescent type and therefore do not give you even-brightest that you need at 43 years old! It was way too forgiving and I wanted something that didn't lie! I ended up finding an old Clairol one in by mother's basement. Save your money and look on ebay if you want a good one like the olden days!"},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL!! Terrible light.","review":"After years with my similar style Remington and Clairol mirrors, I assumed this mirror would be the same. I expected the same fluorescent long bulbs that the others had but, instead, this comes with little bulbs that give off very little light.

Also the name dropping of big Hollywood names doesn't hurt either. We hear mention of Drew Barrymore, William Baldwin and a few others. It's easy to see that Ms. Farmer is acquainted with the Hollywood party scene. We even get mention about very good food, and that's not a bad thing either.

A teacher using this book could assign her students to read a couple chapters and then, in class, talk about the suggested discussion questions which address the short stories within the chapters. A teacher could also require her students to choose one of the writing assignments at the end of that week's assigned reading and bring in a draft of the Burroway-inspired story the following week for discussion.

She barely mentions the effects of Chiron transits, aspects to Chiron, Chiron in the the signs and houses; instead she goes on and on about some undiscovered planet she has given some strange name, and talks about chakras and psychic healing.

She could not say in depth anything about my house position of chiron or sign seeing how chiron in pisces is something that has not yet been recorded.

If you haven't read the first installment of this series, be sure to check it out. I have read that the author has a three book contract with her publisher, but hope this will not deter her from continuing her Sarah Booth Delaney mystery series. The descriptions of the main character, Sarah Booth, and her day-to-day dealings with trying to keep her old family plantation, her Southern way of life, deal with her great granny's nanny's ghost, plus continue her PI work, are witty and enthralling.

The worse it got -- the harder it was to look away. I kept watching -- searching for a sign that it was done tongue-in-cheek. Sadly that did not happen.The acting is stilted. The sets look cheesy.The plot is convoluted. Some people seemed offended at the premise of a less-than-perfect person becoming Santa.

Raymond Carver has a tremendous ability to take the smallest thing in the world like a garage sale or a shot of a whiskey and making it alive and slyly special. His concise words, which some people like and others don't, leave no room for pretenses. There is no literary snobbery in his ideas, just images. And I love these images.I love Raymond Carver"},{"rating":"1","title":"He is famous for his short stories, and rightly so","review":"I'm criticizing Carver with the utmost deference, because I hold the man in the highest regard and strive to write like him. I can't say enough good things about his short stories (My favorite is A Small, Good Thing), which manage to say so much with so few pages. His poems, however, are not as good as his short stories. They lack the continuity of his stories, as well as the practiced craft of more experienced poets. The line changes seem awkward, and there is not a consistent theme in each sub-collection. These poems are not meant to be read by poetry afficionados, but by precocious teenagers who need a little encouragement to start writing for themselves.

The intro and Die Blechtrommel (11) are really the only saving graces to this album. While most of the mixes have seamless transitions, his choices leave something to be desired. French Kiss (7) starts out as a decent piece but soon degrades into a lusty 1,000 bpm nightmare.On the Acostanation-o-meter, I would order his albums this way: Awake [heavenly, the best of 2000], PM edition [must buy], Members of X [for fans only], AM edition [pass]."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Selections!","review":"George can do better, as he proved on the PM Edition.The PM CD blows this one away!The PM is melodic,smooth,driving,soaring synths and deep driving bass that is very well put together, Trance that just wants to make you lose yourself in the music.

AM is kind of dull,like it's going nowhere,too hard to get a feeling,no emotion,just kind of drab.It's like you are waiting for it to get better and it doesn't. The song selection was not good for people who love dreamy,exilerating,touching,fly away on a Magic Carpet ride Trance. I bought the AM and PM CD's for about five bucks each.

A movie withrobots shooting people with lazers. Where is all this\\"Chopping\\" at? Maybe it seems alittle shallow, but thetitle of this movie just doesn't fit with what actuallyhappens in the movie. The plot is actually somewhat newin that we usally don't see store robots just go crazyand start killing people with lazers. But it simply isn'twhat I expected."},{"rating":"2","title":"'Choppong Mall' review","review":"A good cheesy 80's Horror. Teenagers trapped in a mall with Killer Robots. The Killer Bot's are actually well designed, and look good even today. A good story, even the acting's not too bad. Though the movie seems to drag a bit at the end. Favourite scene: The blondes death, Great panty shots followed by exploding head. Classic. If you're a fan of 80's Horror, a good addition to your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"More unintentional comedy than you know what to do with!","review":"I think my favorite scene in chopping mall is when they get into the sporting goods store and conveniently find an arsenal of weapons and ammo on display right in the front of the store. This way, the customers can load up the guns and try them out without having to wait for some lazy manager to get them out of the locked glass case behind the counter. In my opinion, put the guns & ammo right up front with the golf clubs & baseball gloves just like they do in TEH Chopping mall! I give it 5 stars for awesomely bad dialogue, awesomely bad special effects, feathered 80's hair for the dudes, and big big big permed 80's hair for the seriously hawt actresses."},{"rating":"2","title":"Have a nice day","review":"Without getting into hyperbole, this is the best film made in a zillion years!!!! Well maybe not, but certainly the best from Hollywood's long line of feature films about sexy teens trapped in malls while being chased about by security guard robots who have been hit by lightning and now roll after the sexy teens and try to kill them.The teens are divided into two groups - the two Virgins, and then the Lusty Horny types. Guess who dies first! The robots are very cute and roll about the mall (They take an escalator at one point, thus answering the question of how they maneuver between floors) to chase their sexy prey. The robots shoot rays of light at their prey, just like the Care Bears.The teens, trapped in the mall by these killer robots, must face their fears of robots and the perils of consumerism and fight for surival in the ultimate battle of man vs machine. As the pun-friendly DVD states, the viewer will \\"shop till you drop...dead!\\" Dramatic!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Hold a Candle!!","review":"I absolutely loved Kissing in Manhattan and expected the same quality writing in Sweet and Vicious. I attended a book readingby Mr. Schickler in our shared hometown. He read the book with such enthusiasm that I was hooked and bought the book. However, it was a disappointment. Where his first novel was clever and weaved the characters lives together, the plot in Sweet and Vicious appeared fairly predictable and lacking in creativity. It was a quick, pleasant read but I felt uninspired and disappointed. Mr. Schickler has great talent but unfortunately he did not reach his potential in his latest novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I loved Schickler's first book, Kissing in Manhattan, but it's hard to believe that this one was written by the same person. I was unable to connect with the main characters, and a lot of the dialouge felt unnatural and forced. Some of the subplots were engaging, but they weren't enough to carry the book. The ending didn't even have a sense of resolution."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not nearly enough","review":"As an admirer of the interwoven stories in his collection, KISSING IN MANHATTAN, I was sorely dissapointed by this novel. The two main characters, finely sketched in their quirks and foibles, were seductive noir figures inexplicably but reassuringly lodged in the present tense. However, they forfeited all charm as soon as they came together. The pairing and their joint antics were more than over the top, they were senseless, unbelievable and unrewarding. Intimate moments and \\"stupendous\\" decisions were shown on fast forward and in such a slim novel, you get the feeling somebody got lazy.Let's hope the third book is a charm."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great novel for a lazy afternoon...","review":"Schickler's latest novel, Sweet and Vicious, is a fast-paced, delightful read. While I thought the characters were a bit implausible, the plot worked for me. This book reads like a softer, gentler episode of \\"The Sopranos\\". I found myself caught up in the overall motion of the story and I enjoyed reading about Henry and Grace's cross-country adventure. The secondary characters were entertaining, as well.I'm surprised to see so many negative reviews of this book. True, if you're looking for highbrow fiction, then this isn't the novel for you. However, if you're looking for a unique story that's not too terribly taxing on the brain cells, then Sweet and Vicious will deliver."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ho hum","review":"After a promising start the entire story moved along with such linear precision that it may have been written by a mathematician. Never did it deviate from a plotline that was anticipated after the second chapter. In the genre of heist stories we've come to expect twists and turns until the last minute. Here we had none. I was waiting for somebody to be something other than what they appeared to be, somebody to do something out of character. And the thorough implausibility of the climactic confrontation on stage in front of 5000 people had me shaking my head. Oh, and if somebody would be kind enough to post a follow up review explaining the significance of the hitch hiker, I'd appreciate it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bigger than expected","review":"I got this for my dad who is the president of a college around Christmas and they were eating it at parties at their house for months and they said it stayed fresh and delicious the entire time.

Both only lasted about six months. I will admit that I watch a lot of movies but after about six months the DVD player just stopped working. The first one just seemed like it wasn't plugged in and after checking all the connections to make sure it was still in place, everything seemed to be fine. It just didn't work anymore. The second one powered on like normal and opened and closed like normal. But when a disc was put in it, it acted like there was nothing in it. So all in all, for 40 dollars if you're not expecting it to last forever I guess it's not a bad bargain. Personally, I choose to stay away from all RCA DVD players due to similar problems with an older model."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!","review":"The worst DVD player I ever had.Firstly, the player sucks with audio. I am sure some do not notice, but if you keep looking at the mouths of people talking, you can clearly see the audio is not in sync with the video. There is some sort of small delay with the audio.....if you begin to notice it, it does become a problem that ruins the movie/tv show/etc.Secondly, whenever I press stop or turn off my player while a movie is playing and then later insert a new DVD, the player acts like it is the same DVD and returns to playing the video at the time spot that the other dvd ended.I recommend staying away from this DVD player."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work at all through component plugs","review":"I just got an LCD TV and bought this DVD player for it at WalMart (the scariest place on earth).

I tried hooking it up through the normal RCA plugs and it worked fine (so thats why I give it 2 starrs rather than none), but i want it to work through the component plugs so now I have to go back to the last place I ever want to be to return it.

The Schick Quattro/Extreme 3 or Venus or Gilette razors never cause the same problems. Even the cheap, no brand name disposables are gentler on the legs than these.

I used these on vacation over the summer, and couldn't buy something else... They left several cuts over weeks! They also are not made to last, if you have any long hairs, they get trapped behind the blade and it gets clogged and needs to be thrown out very quickly.

Except of The Great Pretender and Barcelona there is no real good song on it. Since you can get SOLO including the original(how Mercury himself did it and not how an engineer remixed him) Mr Bad Guy and Barcelona albums for the same price than this, you shouldn't doubt. Here, one of the greatest vocalists ever was mixed to a drunken rocker, but in the songs he made besides Queen, he was as people imagine him: a good, but a bit crazy artist who wanted to show this in his songs. THE ALBUM is the product of his vocals and a lot of studio work after his death. Would he listen to it, he'd probably turn around in his grave. Get SOLO and you'll be fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you are in the US, save your money!","review":"This album, a compilation of remixed songs, mostly from 1985's MR.

The drummer is great too, there is even a rhythm workshop with the drummer and the bellydancer. She talks as if you're right there with her, love it!But, its not terribly easy..

The music is all one person on bongos, which I like very much. The dvd is broken down in 3 sections, beg, int and advanced. The menu lets you choose different levels of instructional breakdowns. You can choose a slower easier breakdowns, or faster breakdowns. You can also choose a practice performance breakdown, or just performance. This is great when you need to just refresh your memory for the routines. Jenna is the most professional bellydancer I've ever seen. You can tell she is a very well trained professional dancer buy the way she moves. The 3rd routine (the advanced level) is such a fabulous routine. It really has a \\"WOW!\\" impression. It's more of what the audience would like to see. I'm at the Intermediate level, and although very challenging, the advanced level is not impossible to master with a lot of practice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Drum Solo Lover","review":"This is a fantastic video for dancers with some knowledge of bellydance. It has a lot to offer! There are three performances that Jenna has broken down in to somewhat easy to learn steps. The camera angle is a little awkward at times and is the reason I gave this video a 4 instead of 5 stars. The video explains where to get the music so you can actually perform this on your own. It has a great shimmy workshop/ workout for those of you who are looking to perfect the shimmy. Jenna is fun to watch and has developed fun choreographys. The video also includes a section that breaks down popular middle eastern rythms-the key to performing drum solos is understanding these rythms. I love drum solos but lack the patience to choreograph. I appreciate that there are teachers willing to share their talent and ability."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good DVD","review":"Excellent choreography DVD for someone who already learned the basic belly dance moves or to accompany Jenna's first DVD, I highly recommend it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceptional","review":"Nobody breaks down the choreography and teaches the moves as well as Jenna does and I have watched quite a few instructional belly dance dvds. One thing to note though, this is definately not for a straight out beginner. Its more for somebody who knows what the basics are and wanting to gain some techniques and expand their dance moves. She has become my favourite belly dance teacher. I know she has a new dvd coming out sometime in Summer 2006, I will definately get it. I recommend this dvd 101%!

It was detailed from the warmups, to the lessons, and the drills. Jenna and Raquy appear focused on teaching and learning in this video. What was even more impressive was that there were no hidden agendas here. Absent were oiled bodies, crowded sets, mediocrity, \\"superstardom\\", or carved-up physiques when I am trying to focus on the entire dancer.

I usually like this type of story but this one is a dud!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I Could Get a Refund","review":"I bought this book based on the half dozen good reviews posted here on amazon.com. After getting a third of the way through the book, I am confident that the people who wrote these shining reviews are either friends of the author or teenagers.I can't imagine what the point of this book is. Nothing happens! The characters are unrealistic, the story jumps pointlessly around, and nothing makes much sense. But by far the most annoying thing about this book is the author's constant use of italics. Every page contains one or more words in italic type and for the life of me I can't figure out why. The occasional italicized word for emphasis would be acceptable. But why so many?I won't even mention the typos (of which there are many).I'm terribly disappointed by this \\"novel\\" and will delete it from my Kindle. What a hot mess."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ferris Beach","review":"This was the second Jill McCorkle novel I've read. The first was years ago and I enjoyed it enough to record in my journal. So, after reading an article in North Carolina Magazine on Jill, I decided to try another this summer. (Thanks to Amazon and my new kindle for making that easy). This is a wonderful story of \\"coming of age\\" for young southern gals. A great blend of growing up in the south and true family life. I look forward to my next McCorkle novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Evocative novel of a Southern town in the 1970s","review":"This coming-of-age novel packs a surprising punch. McCorkle deftly shows her ability to build a large set of characters, to let them loose, and to have them behave believably. She captures a small Southern town in the midst of social change. Integration is on hand; a Toyota dealer now sits alongside a Ford dealer on the pike; a new high school is being built. We follow McCorkle's main character, Katie, through childhood and early adolescence, to her first love. As she makes her way in the world, she learns about loyalty, betrayal, and dishonesty, and she understands that adults make mistakes. The key is how to deal with one's mistakes and what to learn from them.This highly evocative novel uses the popular songs of the 1970s and earlier decades as its soundtrack. It fills the reader's mind with the sights, tastes, and smells of the decade. It quietly achieves a high level of literary success."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, Plotless, Full of Cliches and Bad Writing","review":"There's no plot in this book. And the characters are too priviledged for my taste. Therefore their \\"trials\\" and troubles don't ring true. I tried to find something to like about them but they never came to life. All in all it was a silly story about a young girl with a birthmark. It reads like a sophomoric young adult book; it lacks the depth and heft of a Real Novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ferris Beach","review":"Even though this is a different style of story than I normally read, I found this book very intertaining and took me back to my childhood."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ferris Beach","review":"So far Ferris Beach is very good, but I have not finished reading it yet.

One tube lasted us a long time. And it is easy to apply wherever spray is undesirable (kid's rooms, kitchen, any narrow spot). Better than a bait since the ants just can't pass this attractive poison.

He showed us how/where to put the gel, so after we ran out of what he gave us, we bought this stuff and it works great. We've since had a small ant problem and used this stuff, and they were gone in a day or two."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works","review":"Works really well. Ants disappeared completely in a couple of days. Only thing I would add is what some other reviewers have written as well- the gel consistency is a bit runny, so it squirts out and drips a bit.

So share it with the neighbours if they're friendly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Combat vs Terro","review":"Terro has been my ant killer of choice for jeez, almost 10 years now. I tried it side by side against Combat in the new house and Terro (liquid bait) hands down wins.

This couldn't be farther from the truth! We started by placing the globules around in areas where we have these little black ant armies, and at first they gobbled it up, and it really looked like the problem would be taken care of. The ants died and we concluded they must have taken the toxin back to the hive and thus will kill off the rest as the information states....But then the next day and every day after, hordes of ants continue to permeate our home and surrounding deck. We have no choice but to conclude that this supposed, \\"ant killing gel\\" isn't all it is made out to being, and quite honestly, a can of Raid at half the price would have done the same job.As the ants continue to haunt us, I would in no way advise anyone to waste their money on this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work","review":"I have an ant problem in my kitchen right next to my sink. I left some food out to attract the ants out, then put down the gel. No ants went for the gel. I tried later by just putting out the gel with no food.

A couple weeks ago, they started coming into the house, so I ordered some of the Combat Ant Killing Gel, along with the 6 Terro-PCO Liquid Ant Bait Stations to try to wipe out the colony.

I ask the apt. manager to send someone to help but that did no good whatsoever. When this product arrived, I used it as directed and went to work. When I came home about 7 hours later, it's like the ants magically disappeared. It's been over 3 weeks and I haven't seen another one yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Messy and ineffective","review":"We have battled ants for a year and I tried all the natural remedies first. I had high hopes that my first try with actual poison would kill our ants, but this didn't even slow them down. The plunger is kind of touchy, so I ended up with blobs of gel all over instead of a nice line. The extra gel dripped out of the plunger while I was moving around, which made me paranoid that my crawling baby and cats would find some on the floor. All of that would have been fine if it killed the ants, but it didn't. I used three kits over two weeks with no results. We moved on to the borax powder barriers and have found those to be much more effective."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"The best thing about my experience with this ant gel was the fast shipping and overall good job done by the place we bought this stuff from on Amazon.I bought the Combat ant gel because my cousin told me it worked great for her. Unfortunately I don't have the same testimony. Some ants ate it, most didn't. A month after eating they were still feasting on the stuff. I'm sure it got rid of some but I wasn't impressed. I went to Walgreens down the street from my house and purchased Terro liquid gel. The stuff is like an ant magnet. They swarmed to the stuff and in ONE DAY I began to see a huge reduction in traffic. One month in, I haven't seen ants where I've placed the Terro liquid. When I see activity in a different part of the house I put some down there and get the same results. The stuff cost $3.50."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ant Problem is Gone","review":"Combat Ant Gel was the only product we found that completely took care of our ant issue. It took a few applications but its been two weeks and the ants have not returned. As other reviewers mentioned, let them swarm to the gel and apply multiple applications if needed.

I never wiped it off, but it did nothing.I called Combat customer support and described my situation. The guy instantly started to look for ways to deny their \\"guaranteed to work\\" promise. When I said I left it on the house for a week and a half, he claimed that I had used the product \\"incorrectly\\" and said it would've killed the nest if I'd left it for 20 days!!!I was irate.

Anyway, I bought this product along with several others which gave me a good chance to test various products. This product didn't attract the ants very well compared to other products. Also, it became useless after it dried which took only a few hours. In side by side comparisons with this product (Combat Ant Killing Gel), Raid's Ant Gel, Terro Liquid Ant Killer and a few others the Terro product attracted more ants and lasted much longer.

One push will empty almost 1/3 of the gel. I only pushed 3-4 times, then the tube became empty. I only applied the gel on the kitchen counter. Then there was nothing left for my bathroom.

My daughter is already 16 months old and it's taken me awhile to get back in the right frame of mind to even want to exercise again. I'm 250 lbs., and even I can do this workout! It makes me feel powerful. I'm amazed that such simple moves can really work your muscles and make you sweat! I would highly recommend this workout to any mom who has a lot of weight to lose because it just gets you moving. I lost 70 pounds doing Tae Bo workouts before we conceived, so I know it works. Love, love, love Tae Bo! I especially love that Billy & Shellie are believers in our awesome God!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Balance!","review":"I read the reviews on this dvd before doing the workout, and I have to say I completely disagree that it was too low in intensity. I used to do the Taebo Advanced workout before getting pregnant, and was moderately active through my pregnancy, gaining 30 pounds total, so not obese or anything. And this got my blood pumping and thighs burning!!If you keep your stomach held the whole time and make sure your legs are bent low enough, I don't see how you couldn't burn by the end. It's an hour long and the cardio segment was awesome, definitely more than \\"a walk around the block\\" as one user put it. The ONLY thing I would change is a longer ab segment, or the ab work being on the ground as crunches, like in the advanced dvd from Billy Blanks. But all in all, I think it's great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked this but I was just off of bed rest.","review":"This work out dvd is not too bad.

Too bad it is hard to get."},{"rating":"2","title":"Low impact, easy to follow","review":"I gave this 5 stars because: 1) it's simple and low-impact, but hand weights or resistance bands can be added for women who are more advanced; 2) it has chapters, so you can target certain areas, or do the entire video in a different order.I'm 5 months pregnant and bought this video because it was getting hard to keep my balance through the Billy Blanks Boot Camp workouts (which I also love- been using that series for over a year). I've been using resistance bands with this dvd for a more intense workout (my doc gave me the ok to lift weights because I was strength training pre-pregnancy)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for postnatal","review":"The workout is great for postnatal. It is not too intense but enough that you feel it. I like how you can choose what segments you want and do as long as you like. You can go up to an hour but often I only want to workout for 30 minutes.

A riot-grrl fan, postmodern-sceptic and feminism enthusiast has actually managed to write the dullest, most fatuous piece of study (although it hardly merits the title) I've read in a long time. The author wastes practically half of the book trying to impress us all with his vast knowledge of philosophical theories through the ages, to finally astound us with the revelation that...postmodernism is derivative of modernist theories. yaaaaaaaawn.

You could get away slicing meat with a chef's knife, but the low profile and length on this make it much easier. The metal on these knives are brittle, so you need to take care to avoid hitting the fork. Also be sure to cut on wood or plastic only. If it's your first time with a high-quality knife -- these things are sharp, so be warned. Electric knives shred the meat and seem to make more juices fall out, not the case with a manual knife like this. Pick up a smooth honing steel if you don't already have one to keep the edge straight."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Slicer that Really Slices","review":"I looked at several slicing knives in the Shun Classic price range. I chose the 9-inch slicer because it is large enough to handle large cuts of meat. The first thing I tried it out on was a braised 6-pound beef brisket; it worked perfectly. Beside the hollow ground grooves in the blade, which cut down on blade drag, I like the knife because the handle fits my hand well: not too small, mainly. It just gives a comfortable fit. For the time being I store the knife in its box; I don't have a slot big enough to accomodate it elsewhere -- at least not yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Obsolete","review":"Years ago I depended heavily on Maclink Plus.

It is more of a sociological study of Russian filmmakers as a class. Faraday presents his thesis (over and over) that late Soviet conditions made the filmmakers a privileged class that resented the restrictions placed on it but failed to connect to popular taste in any meaningful way. Thus when the USSR collapsed, Russian filmmakers were unable to make popular films and became marginalized.This would have made an interesting article, but as a book, it goes on for too long. Also, it would have been nice if Faraday had actually discussed some of the movies. The only movie he discusses at any length is \\"Burnt by the Sun,\\" which he dislikes as trite in theme and overly pretty. Overall, this was a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Vague Textbook","review":"The book has wealth of information for those absolutely new to Food and Beverage.

The music could pass for not being Christmas music at all; however, it sounds just as beautiful at Christmastime if not more so. I fall into the category of one who tires quickly from traditional Christmas music after hearing a few in a row - this CD does not have that affect on me at all. The piano playing is so pretty, soothing and relaxing. I actually use it to help me wind down since I have trouble falling asleep and calming down at night. The second song really is effective. I would say this is the only music CD that truly helps me.

The staging is flawless and the orchestra is above reproach. A very good listen and view."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Tribute to a true Diva","review":"Although La forza del destino is not my favorite opera by Verdi, it does showcase Leontyne Price's magnificent voice. At times it almost seemed as if the composer had written it for her. As for the DVD, it is wonderful to be able to view the opera singers up close (something one never sees on the stage, even with opera glasses)and see the emotion on their faces. The lighting was quite dramatic, although I was a bit disappointed in the sets and expected much more from the Met (as I have seen far better and grander sets at the local operas where I live). All in all though, I highly recommend this DVD to anyone who admires Leontyne Price, as well as to anyone who hasn't had the opportunity to see her perform. Brava!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What DVD were all these reviewers watching?","review":"I am appalled by all the praise heaped on this DVD. There are many good things about most MET productions but often they utilize a big name who is well past their singing years. Why can nobody see that Price's performance is a DISASTER! We all remember her early recordings which were full of wonderful singing. But by the time this performance was taped she was less than a charicature of her former self. Her tone is often hollow, she approximates most of the melodic lines and doesn't bother with many consonances. Yes, its a shame we have nothing from her best years but lets admit that this the present performance is nothing to rave about. Like the MET Rigoletto which faltered on McNeil's long past retirement lead, this should never been released.Sadly, here is another great work for which there is no really adequate performance on DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD!","review":"I initially bought this for the duet between Ana and Chayanne, but was blown away by the rest of it.

This dvd has worked flawlessly. It has an HDMI port, composite out and component out and has a 9 in 2 card reader so you can watch slide shows of your images straight from your camera cards it can also read mp3s from those cards to make a music slide show. This dvd player comes built in with TV Guardian which can filter out foul language on dvds, I havent tried this feature out so I cant really comment on it.

But still it brought good old memories."},{"rating":"2","title":"This game hits the SPOT!","review":"I was very pleasantly surprised by Frogger 2. I will confess to not being much of a Frogger fan in my arcade days, but I took a chance on this one. Definitely not regretted. What makes this game brilliant is that the controls are very easy to master (compared to many video games which require you to spend hours to master all the different combinations) and the overall concept of the game is simple to grasp. It's the kind of game you (and guests) can pick up in a minute! But that's not to say it's simple or boring. Like all great arcade games, it has that addictive quality that keeps you coming back for more. The depth here is in the level design, tricks, traps and the general coordination you need to get through it. The cute graphics and sound track just add to its appeal. Highly recommended.

Now, the reason to believe me is because really, i am a school GENIUS. when i get home, after completing my A+ homework, i play my dreamcast. I am a total fan of adventure games and almost nothing else. Frogger 2 is adventure, and i would know if it's good orn not. NOT GOOD. it is just a little bit of fun.

This is especially disappointing when Sena claims that this is one of the great features - secure hold. Theoretically the clip will only release when the Treo is horizontally AND you push the release. But after one week, it suddenly started releasing the Treo without a need for the release to be pushed. And of course, the Treo is always horizontally anyway (gravity). So I bouth a replacement belt clip (for a whopping $20) and it worked great... for about 3 months! Now it is the same thing again. For such an expensive item, this is ridiculous.

I cried at one point. It is not a sentimental love story. In fact, it's not a love story at all, so don't be misled. It's a simple and moving story about life set in the Amazon. It felt much like Hemingway's \\"Old Man and the Sea\\" and had the same feeling of directness and simplicity combined with profound truth. Sepulveda is much more in tune with contemporary sensitivities than most people would find Hemingway (although I love Hemingway's stories). A major theme of Old Man who Read Love Stories has to do with the destruction of the Amazon. This is not to say the story is any sort of politically correct pablum. It is much more profound than that. I think Hemingway would have approved with gusto."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful and magical","review":"I read this book in a university anthropology class, and I loved it.

I looked over the camera and the film, and then wondered about battery replacement after all this time. The computer helped a lot because it told me of the ingenious idea of putting a spark in the film pack to have the old battery working.

All the tracks on this album are top notch, and the whole things flows better than \\"Tally Ho\\" even though \\"Tally Ho\\" is a great piece of music on its own. A couple tracks on this album stand out as some of lukes best work ever. Definite unmissable songs. Making this a must have for anybody into experamental down tempo electronic music.I also want to mention Ninja Tune doesn't tamper with the music thats being released.

I was expecting goofball IDM like U-ziq or Chris Clark, so I was a little disappionted- at first. After a few listens though, I caught myself laughing at and eventually enjoying it. It sounds like a satire and yet the production quality matches the best. With those qualities combined, it makes a pretty good album. I like Plug, Vigbert's other moniker better, but only because I'm not really a fan of \\"chill out\\" music. It's all a matter of preferance.

It is certainly a collection of eclectic accessible electronica, but perhaps a little \\"too\\" accessible for my tastes. I found the novelty interesting yet overall the feel was a bit superficial. Wagon Christ has played a dancey-hiphop-pop, hypereclectic wash over Plaid or Autechre sound; but, replaced depth and complexity of composition with easy bells and whistles. You might like it.

His \\"evidence\\" is slanted or non-existent. He claims to tell the full truth, yet this is a one-sided diatribe against all media he finds objectionable. One could probably write a fair book that intelligently and accurately explores both sides of the \\"culture war\\". This is not it. If you are truly interest in Mr. Thompson himself, there are better resources out there to get a composite view of the man, both good and bad. If you are concerned about media and it's possible adverse effects, there are better books available. In short, your money is better spent elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly researched, poorly written","review":"I found this book to be poorly researched and poorly written.

Having been an English teacher in foregin countries, I can honestley say that I have seen better examples of writing from people come new to this language. Doesn't \\"Lawyer\\" mean you, presumably, had to go to three years of extra schooling? I would highly reccomend NOT buying this book based on the grammatical errors alone.As for the rest, his opinions are his and he's allowed to have them, however, when taken in the context of everything else he's done in the past year, I would honestly reconsider putting any stock in those opinions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic","review":"What Jack is doing here is using the most pathetic techniques to make people believe his inaccurate views. He uses religion, lies, and other shameless techniques. He claims the game Killer7 has pornographic material in it, I myself have the game and I love it, it has no such thing. I do applaud him however for his effort. But this is a new age, like it or not, video games are becoming incredibly huge. We can't try to convince people to stop playing them, it's already too late for that. All in all, don't buy this book. Your money is better of going to other good books. On a side note, I do find it funny he put a quote of someone being angry at him on the cover. Guess he must have been desperate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Embarrassing","review":"It's sad in this day and age to see such an gross abuse of prose. Whatever one thinks of the author's controversial political stance, one thing that is undeniable is his poor command of the English language.Jack Thompson writes as if English were a second language to him, from his ridiculous proclamations to a proclivity for grandstanding that would make Cotton Mather blush.There are plenty of good books out their about violence and videogames. This isn't one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well...","review":"There's always that man you hear about, and because his name kept popping up on the news, I found this book used at [...] and decided to give it a read. In all honestly, I wasn't suprised when I didn't agree with anything Mr Thompson had to say. But after reading it, I do believe the man is entitled to his own opinions.As far as the book itself, it's terribly one sided. It reads as if theres a debate, yet only pushes his point of view without mentioning anything else. So in that aspect, I was rather disappointed. I also felt that the book lacked serious content. It seemed as if most of the book he was rehashing the same material. In my opinion, if you have to rehash your material over and over to get people to listen to you, I really don't feel you should be writing a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, Poorly Edited, and Insulting","review":"[...] this book just isn't worth the time. The style of writing is bland at best, and really shows that whoever actually put the words to paper isn't an experienced writer.

It's also almost insulting at points due to its lack of objectiveness, like if you don't agree with the opinions in the book you're a monster.This book just isn't worth your time or money."},{"rating":"1","title":"One-sided","review":"I found this book to be far too one-sided in it's arguements. If the author truly wanted to present their debate in a meaningful manner they failed miserably. The view that opposes the author is not even mentioned clearly, and for the most part not at all. I would like to know more about where the author had published his research, but I think that would be a useless point since this seems like nothing more than opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Book","review":"One of the worst books I've laid my eyes on.

This book could be useful if shredded into little pieces and used as cat litter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Finding A Valid Argument","review":"Despite all of the controversy surrounding this book, it seems unclear as to how he can justify all of his accusations against the media. His case could have been done exceptionally well, but it wasn't. Rather than provide a clear argument on behalf of those concerned with family values, Thompson remarks in a fairly childish manner without any real evidence beyond his own suspicions. This, coming from a lawyer, has me very concerned. It isn't necessarily the language, I will not say he is incapable of putting a sentence together by any means, but his argument is lacking. I wish he could have done better.If you're looking for a book on family values for the media, this isn't it. There is certainly a feel of Ad Nauseum throughout the book.

One of the worst school shootings of all time, University of Texas in 1996, happened 6 years before pong was created. to make matters worse, Thompson capitalizes from tragedies.

For those of us who live in the real world reading this book was a great disappointment, and waste of time.

He starts gloating about his successful court cases but then goes on a long digression about his spiritual enlightenment. And to top it off, he uses the words 'video games' and 'pornography' interchangibly (not kidding), I'm not sure why though.If Mr. Thompson wants to write an autobiography, then write one. If he wants to argue his views on censorship, write on about that. And if he wants to argue his legal and political views, by all means, go ahead and write a book on it. But don't try to combine all of those into one book, and cram each chapter with a little of each."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same old, same old","review":"The author argues that video games make us more likely to kill and generally do stupid things.

In addition, it teaches how colors can be mixed to produce new colors.Not the slickest graphics, but I definitely recommend this for action oriented learners who will sit still long enough for a video."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounds too good to be true?","review":"You're right! I bought this software, excited because I want to learn vietnamese, french, tahitian, russian, and polish up on portuguese and spanish. 25 of the languages have vocabulary glossaries only (not that 76 languages isn't alot). But there is really no guideline to follow, there is a long list of phrases, some practical to repeat and good speech recognition software, but I was lost. I found the alphabet to print out and practice, and this software kept my interest for only a couple of days. It is easy to get frustrated because you don't feel like you're learning, just repeating phrases you hope you can remember, but don't seem very practical. I would recommend this software for polishing up already learned skills, maybe, and introducing yourself to a new language, but don't buy the hype that it is all you need to learn \\"guaranteed.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"quantinty but not quality","review":"I am a native speaker of Polish and my wife is American. We tried the speach recognition feature in our native tongues. We barely made it in our native languages into the beginnig of yellow and sometimes not even that. This feature one has to take with a grain of salt.The program only has 76 languages with pronounciation. The remaining 25 are only vocabulary collections without any speach recordings.There is some translation mistakes in Polish version but not very many.The lessons are a little bit chaotic in their structure. I suspect they made an abridged version of their more extensive single language programs. In general it is not a bad tool for somebody planning a trip to a country and would like to acquire some basic vocabulary along with spelling and different alphabets. I would not get depressed if one cannot get the pronounciation right - even native speakers are unable to accomplish that. And for the price of under 20 bucks, one cannot ask for perfection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth The Money","review":"I am a student that studies 5 languages currently. I am very much into languages and I thought this would help me. I bought this software specifically for Icelandic, Vietnamese, Arabic, German, and Inuktitut. Turns out that the only helpful and useful language title was German. Most, actually all of the other languages just gives phrases to practice, and it is the exact phrases as the other languages. It makes learning a language fun, GUARANTEED! Dont purchase this software if you would like to learn a language that is on here. If you are really interested in learning a specific language, purchase Rosetta Stone Software. It may be a little bit of money, but it is definatley worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Garbage","review":"Like everyone else is saying, this is absolute garbage and the company is trying to scam you by posting bogus 5-star reviews on Amazon. All products by Transparent Language are basically a 10-page piece of text spoken aloud by a native speaker. To lay the foundations of your language learning they use short, useless help files (a one-page list of the letters of the alphabet and a very sparse introduction to the different parts of speech) and nothing else. If you pay a single penny for this you'll regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"101 languages of the world","review":"This book does not cover Tamil..which is the most refined ancient language in the world..The Tamils or Dravidians arrived in India from Mesopotamia..more than ten thousand years ago..establishing the Mergargh..Indus Valley etc civilizations....Tamil or the Dravidian languages..developed a rudimentary form of Sanskrit when it arrived on the Indian shores from Asia Minor..Many route words in the European languages have Tamil roots..Even French..The Dravidians and the other Mesopotamians were very good mariners in Ancient times well before Columbus..they even colonized South America..which is why Columbus went looking for them in South America..he knew what he was doing!Extremely influential group of people in ancient times...some historians even believe that the pharoahs were Tamils or Dravidians..Currently in India..Dravidians are found all over India..and some of them have mixed with the indigenous of India.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Entertaining","review":"I love comparing and hearing the sounds of different languages, and this product has definitely given me much enjoyment. You can probably learn some good phrases and vocabulary, but as other reviewers have already said, this is more of a sampler, than a serious language product. To go deeper, go elsewhere.The pronunciation feature, where you speak into the microphone and have your pronunciation judged against a native speaker, looks cool, but it's useless. It took me awhile to figure that out, but for fun I tried speaking Japanese like Goober of Mayberry and got a much better rating than when I tried to sound authentic. I promise I'm telling the truth here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Four Stars","review":"I only gave it four stars because it is exactly what I was wishing for.(five stars would be for a pleasant surprise)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, complety different at the first movie","review":"An unknown director wanted to continue with the great story of Takeshi Miike but this story is complety different and without sense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cutting Corners","review":"You know soon after a movie starts whether the cast and film crew put in a worthy effort. In this case, not so, besides jumping between scenes making it difficult to follow the story you also have very poor coherence between every line of English voice over and corresponding English subtitles - just a mess. As an indication of poor directing was the directors use of very difficult to see darkness as a cheap crutch for creating suspense and drama. Creative directing should manipulate lightning to give suspense and still allow the audience to see what's going on. The story itself is a well worn copy of many other horror movies with the same theme of an imprisoned tortured person/soul coming back to reap revenge on the perpetrators and relatives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but not as good as the first","review":"This sequel is good, but not as good as the first.

Thus, this is the first release of Sunset in the West in full color. Visual and sound qualities of this video are excellent with very good color qualities. This is a full length version with a running time of 67 minutes. Sunset in the West is the 17th out of a total of 19 released by Republic in Trucolor. Highly recommended for Roy Rogers' fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good but not worth $50!","review":"I was either delerious or hungry when I ordered these chocolates. I don't eat sugar so decided to treat myself to what I had hoped, based on the reviews, would be out of this world sugar free chocolates. I received the tiny box and had that \\"what was I thinking!\\" moment. I know it says 25 pieces but they are some really tiny pieces. The chocolates are very pretty and are tasty but to me, they are on par with Ashers, Bartons, and any other number of very good sugar-free chocolate for a fraction of this price. They also (I later found on their website) contain maltitol which can cause severe tummy upset (and worse) in many people. They are definitely a pretty presentation, and possibly a nice gift but no one will ever think you spent $50 on them (including the high delivery charge). I'll stick to my Ashers and Bartons where I can get really good quality sugar-free for an affordable price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Order cancelled by Amazon","review":"Not sure why but my order was canceled and price was significantly more when I tried to reorder. Not a bad review for the product but for Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very boring......","review":"Very boring, my 3 months old son just ignored this video in the beginning and then just started crying, although he loves Sesame beginnings and Baby Einstein DVD. Overall, waste of money.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I was Hoping For","review":"I needed a video which would be helpful in making a 7-9 year old into a QB. I needed a video which would go over the details of taking a snap, footwork, hand-off, cadence, timing, and all of the other things I don't even know I should know about. At this age level, passing is the least I need to be working on.This video did not meet my needs; although on the surface it appeared as if it would. The picture on the case shows (or looks like) a 7-9 year old focused on making a hand-off. The title talks about youth development.What the video contains are mostly QB drills (and the reason behind them). The drills are being executed by 13+ year olds. Over half of the video covers passing.If that is what you are looking for, I would give this video a solid 3 for the $40 price. If you are looking for a video on developing 7-9 year olds, this is not going to be very helpful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tastes great and not loaded with corn syrup or sugar","review":"These jerky packs are great. They actually do fill you up or at least stop the grum bellies. I stay away from all the products that are just different ways of eating sugar and corn syrup. I have a boy with ADD and I don't have him on drugs so it is very nice to have a great tasting and filling snack that isn't just sugar with flavoring. Since sugar and corn syrup are major contributors to that condition.

I keep it in a cool dry place and it doesn't expire for another year.I've had it in the gas station before and it's fine. But the couple boxes I ordered from amazon had ones with mold on them. I personally like this jerky but molding product gets a 1 star review."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good snack!","review":"Have order three boxes in total now. I bring one as a snack to work almost everyday. Soooo much cheaper to order from Amazon than to buy at a gas station. Some reviews say they've had 'moldy' packages. So far I've only had one single package that tasted a little off. The rest of the box was fine. Some jerky strips will have a bit of congealed grease on them, I just wipe it off. Perhaps those folks with the 'moldy' packages were mistaking grease for mold? I will continue to buy this product from Amazon and will always have a box on hand in my pantry. (Oh, of note, these strips are made from WHOLE strips of beef, not the \\"chipped, chopped, pressed and pattied\\" variety, and it is very lean. Lots of protein and only 70 calories a package. 'Beats a package of potato chips any day! They are a tad salty, but so are potato chips - and I always have something to wash them down with too!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very dry, kinda crumbly :\\\\","review":"I was pretty disappointed with this.

I've made jerky myself that tastes much better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs to retain freshness longer...Gets like shoe leather","review":"Even though these are in sealed, individual packages, which is nice, it seems like they don't retain there freshness. A few of the sticks got like shoe leather and had little taste. I would not purchase them again. I think they should have more flavor since they are vaccummed sealed for freshness. Also the sticks get very hard."},{"rating":"2","title":"These are great!!!","review":"I love Jack Links Beef Steaks.

The first few I ate I didn't have any problems with. Since then, they either have mold or have been so hard that I cannot take a first bite through it (sidenote: I am an avid carnivore). They need to step up their quality control before selling this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like licking a salt cube! 1470mg of Sodium!","review":"After trying the teriyaki flavor of these beef steaks, I decided I would try another flavor so I ordered these peppered ones. The flavor is really like throwing a salt and pepper shaker into your mouth. You never really get a chance to taste the meat since your tongue is overwhelmed by this cloyingly salty, stale pepper flavor. The worst part? There is 1470mg of Sodium in a single package, which is a whopping 61% of your daily value of sodium for the ENTIRE day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tasty but very salty!","review":"I've picked up the smaller size at convenience stores and have always liked them. I read some of the reviews and one person mentioned how very salty they were, but I bought this pack of 12 anyway. I thought maybe he was just a little sensitive, but, wow, he was right! I like the flavor, but cannot eat much of it at once. I eat only a small amount each time and close the package back up. The small ones I get in the convenience stores don't seem this salty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flavor/yes price /Hmmmm","review":"I'll give Jack Links 4.5 stars on flavor and quality but a much lower rating on bulk pricing. I order quite a bit of beef jerky online in larger quantities from many vendors. To keep fresh remember to store this in a cool environment. The 2 ounce package is a perfect portion size."},{"rating":"1","title":"Try it in strip form and from somewhere else","review":"I usually buy the Sweet&Hot; jerky strips at Walmart and love the taste. I decided to try the 2oz stick from Amazon and was disappointed for 3 reasons:1. They came with expiration date only 48 days away. I've bought a couple of grocery items from amazon and this seems to be a common pattern. I've also read reviews complaining about the expiration issue on other Amazon grocery products. I love shopping from Amazon, but this reason alone may stop me from buying perishables from them again.2. These sticks are not nearly as soft in texture as the strips. Maybe it's because it's almost reached its expiration date?3. The flavor is not exactly the same as the strips. It tastes more or less the same as regular beef jerky. A bit of hot (as most jerkies are), but not much sweet. Again, is age a factor?I've tried many brands and flavors, and Jack Link's Sweet&Hot; is by far my favorite. Get it in strips.. and get it from you local grocer."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's beef jerky ...","review":"I would recommend to stick with the bagged beef jerky.

Very dissapointed in the taste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eating Salt Jerky","review":"I thought this was similar to the Jack Links Peppered Beef Jerky, boy was I wrong. This stuff is like eating pure SALT. Nasty as hell. One package serving is 57% of your recommended daily intake of Sodium. This is one of the highest content of sodium I've found in Beef Jerky. I don't recommend this unless you really really like SALT."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Awesome flavor, great texture, just the right amount of pepper to give you a great tingle to the taste buds.

Since jerky is more expensive by the piece, I recently restarted the subscription... only to cancel it after the second shipment. It's nasty. I got two boxes of it and don't know what to do with it. It's old, moldy and disgusting. I am very disappointed with this product and recommend people avoid this until the company steps up and improves the quality. It may be a better deal to buy it in quantity, but it's not when you can't even eat it."},{"rating":"1","title":"To much dietary salt.","review":"I do like how these taste but there is too much dietary salt.

The best deal I can find for jerky anywhere is here on Amazon.They are so easy to carry around and are very filling. Sometimes they are a little tougher than others, but it's not so bad you'll rip your teeth out eating them.

Oncologyst, Primary Dr, and several therapists told me there was no cure for it and it was life long. A naturopathic Dr gave me Lymphomyosot and I have not wore my sleeves/gloves for about 8 months.

My doctor sold me this stuff for $135 claiming it would help my swollen lymph nodes. It didn't do a thing. I read labels a lot and wondered what the labels on this product meant and that's when I read about homeopathy. I was so irate I sent a vial of this stuff to a lab to be tested and they sent me the report showing me it was pure sodium chloride in water. I showed this to my doctor and he decided to play stupid and acted like he didn't realize the company selling this stuff was selling water, yet he's selling homeopathics all the time.Do not buy this stuff people, it's just water, and I suspect all homeopathic products are the same way. If you get better and attribute it to the product, then you might as well attribute it to anything else that happened because you could drink tap water for much cheaper and still get the same effect."},{"rating":"1","title":"For costume use, it's fine","review":"We bought this to go with the Jango Fett Halloween costume.
