From our tests, we found that the write speed was about 10mb/sec and the read speed is around 12mb/sec. If you're using this to backup large amounts of data over the network, expect your backups to take a LONG time...

There's a very active user community online that supports this product - just go to http://www.nslu2-linux.org/. By downloading new firmware and following some relatively simple directions, you can add all sorts of additional applications to the NSLU2.

Also, the second port will not support NTFS formatted drives although it will support FAT32 but only up to 80 Mbytes.So, for about 80 bucks, if you stick with EXT3 and your network bandwidth is pretty good (100 mbytes, hardwired), you may have some success."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did they forget to tell you..................?","review":"I apologize for the single star review.

They will only work on this device.We got it set up and moved all the files we planned to share for our home business to it. They were now easily accessible from any computer and life was great. At least until we had to later move the adapter to another location in the office. After turning it off and moving it, all of the data disappeared. The file icon was still there but different.

Very often the system would totally hang and not be addressable from the web interface. This required unplugging the power to reset the box -- the reset button was useless in these cases. After many days of frustration, I tried reformatting the drive to the native Linux ext3. It's worked automatically without a problem since. The issue here is if the device fails, the drive is unreadable from a Windows machine. So my recommendation is if you are strictly a windows operation, look elsewhere. On the other hand if you have a mixed environment this could be a very cost effective NAS system for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good concept, poor customer service","review":"The concept is good - but Linksys customer support is - at best - inadequate.

Very disappointing...so far I have spent more than ten hours installing, debugging, testing and trolling internet sites looking for a solution. I don't have limitless time to debug the NSLU2, especially since I originally bought it as a covenience to SAVE me time.

It makes me really frustrated, there's really only one thing a water bottle needs to do and that's hold liquid - which my fairly expensive sigg bottle now fails to do after merely months of use. I'm not sure what I'm going to buy to replace it with, but I know it won't be one of the new Sigg bottles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I love the Sigg water bottle; the quality is exactly as advertised.

Honestly, because they were just so much more appealing to look at than Klean. I regret it. I've read they do not include BPA anymore, but that doesn't remove the fact that once this liner peels off, as it did with mine in 2 days, you have aluminum to worry about. Read about the diseases associated with aluminum ingestion. This is my second bottle in 2 weeks as my initial order's bottle had a weird plastic taste to it and already the liner is peeling at the opening. Returning both and going with who I should have went with first, Klean Kanteen.

And the deadline to switch out your bottles was 4 months ago.

I purchased a SIGG for the same reasons I purchase organic food, I thought it was safer for my children. But SIGG betrayed that trust. The company DID put BPA in its liners and lied to all of us. In fact, I've contacted the firm Caddell & Chapman about the class action lawsuit. I bought a SIGG to be safe and they deceived and lied to make more money. Now all they will offer is to exchange my BPA bottle for a new one. Oh, ya, sure, I trust you now. Just give me a new bottle.

They did this while quietly lining their bottles with BPA plastic. This was announced when they came out with new ones, and there is (was) an exchange program. Now I went to their site and found that they sell PVC stickers to go on the outside of your bottles for decoration purposes. While you do not drink out of this sticker, PVC and the inks that are typically used to print on PVC outgas nasty chemicals (VOCs) and are not at all recyclable (they are laminated with adhesive). This is NOT something that an environmentally concerned company would do. Perhaps Kleen canteen is better - at least they are stainless.Do what you will with this information."},{"rating":"2","title":"a great bottle","review":"The mouth isn't large enough to add ice cubes with ease but you can't really go wrong with this bottle.

I bought the bottles because they were highly touted as SAFE.

They were supposed to e-mail me a certificate to buy replacements. Now I'm out $60 for the bottles and $8 for shipping.Now I hear they never stopped shipping the old bottles and some customers have recently bought ones with the old liner. I will NEVER buy another SIGG product and will strongly advise others to stay away. A bad product, deceitful company and lousy customer service.

I could buy bottled water and have \\"fresh\\" every day, but I find that level of plastic consumption indefensible. I found an ad for a steel water bottle, and was poised to buy it, but it was made in China, and my understanding is that Chinese manufacturers may use recycled metals with little consideration of their origin--they may even have traces of radioactivity.So I jumped on this one, which is manufactured in Switzerland. It can be washed in a dishwasher, but wouldn't need that if used exclusively for water. My daughter uses it to take to school, and our only complaint about it is that despite its reported double-wall construction, it doesn't hold liquid temperature well--heat and cold tend to be conducted quickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Feel misled by a bottle containing a toxic liner","review":"Bought this to have a water bottle without having to worry about BPA.

The author was given access to a parade of high-level Baha'is who are on the fast track (which runs over the little people)to get to more powerful Baha'i positions. I have not yet met a single Baha'i of lower rank who could, or would, speak for himself, and I spent 30 years under the regime.

Not even one week of play (and really not hard play as they occasionally run a train on it!) and one of the straightaway pieces developed a crack and splintered off! What?? I know.

My daughter had checked it out at her school library some years ago, and we both fell in love with it. Not only are the pictures beautifully-illustrated, but the story is about a little girl who has learned what truly matters in life, and gives sacrificially to that end.

So, if you need a piece of U.S.A pottery identified, then this book probably has the mark. (Please note that this book is not about finding markings of European pieces. As stated on the cover, this book is strictly about U.S. marks).P.S.: This book also includes all the U.S. RESTAURANT-WARE markings. Very helpful if you collect \\"RESTAURANT-WARE\\", along with other American pottery and china."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unusually Good","review":"This book does not easily fit the normal genres. It is however an unusual treatment that pulls the reader into a very different world. Thought-provoking around what distinguishes a human from other species and how we treat one another. At the same time, it keeps a strong sense of mystery as the reader gradually finds out how Isserley is different from us. Worth your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't like it at all","review":"I really enjoyed Crimson Petal and the White but was very disappointed by this book. It wasn't the writing, because I find Michael to be a page turner. Just not my cup of tea. I didn't like the subject matter at all. Too \\"out there\\" for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Book","review":"WOW what a waste of time. I still don't understand the story line and I don't care. I kept waiting for something to make sense but that never happened."},{"rating":"1","title":"Knee slapper","review":"Rarely in life are we granted the opportunity to be filled with such utter contempt and disappointment in an author's genuine attempt to tell a story. The descriptors that immediately come to mind in describing Faber's work seem to be limited to sanctimonious, trite and absurd. The story unfolds with all the subtlety of a Mike Tyson innuendo and left me laughing out loud at the author's fustian vegan agenda. It is the kind of novel that leaves you feeling embarrassed for its writer. Enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would not recommend","review":"I read at least 1 or 2 books every week or so and this is possibly the worst book I have ever read. Someone gave this book to me a while ago and since I had run out of books, I decided to read this one. Had I had the time to go get a new book, I would have thrown it out at anytime during the week it took me to read it. I got the feeling he was a card carrying member of PETA and trying to make a statement. I had never heard of this author, so maybe that's what he is all about and if you're into those kind of books, you might like it. I stuck with it until the end.....and it never got any better for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost Credibility","review":"It started off well. The main character is Isserley, who picks up male hitchhikers in the Scottish Highlands. I was interested, even though I don't know what icpathua is. But come page 135, I left the book. It lost its credibility there. If you've read it, then you'll know why. (DNF)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Under the Skin","review":"This is one of the most fascinating science fiction books I have ever read. Michel Faber writes so descriptively that the feeling of being there is magical. From the first page to the last I was intent on finding out what was going to happen next to Iserly, a beguiling, cunning, and somewhat undescribable female. This will always be one of my favorite books."},{"rating":"2","title":"I think I liked it....","review":"For some reason I couldn't put this book down. It intrigued me from the start. I wanted to know why this strange girl was traveling around Scotland in search of muscular hitchhikers. I'm not sure that I completely understood this book. I think this is one of those novels that you must read more than once to grasp what the author is trying to get at. Here, you have this young disfigured woman traveling around in her little red Corolla injecting big muscular hitchhikers with something, so that they can have horrendous things done to them and then be shipped who knows where. I would have liked a little more information near the end because as much as I liked it, I felt I was left hanging."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why Isn't This Book Better Known?","review":"Tremendous! Over the first half of this great book Michel Faber sloooowly plays out the setting, gradually answering your question of \\"What's going on here?\\" His mastery of tone and exposition is really something for a first-time author. When you finally understand the story's context, for the second half of the book Faber explores the main character Isserley's gradually arrived-at decisions about her own future, which emerge from her bitterness at her own past experiences. I know, I know, that doesn't seem to tell you much, but this is one of those books whose plot cannot be revealed in any detail -- you just have to read it! Told in wonderful prose, the book really sweeps you along. Yeah, I really couldn't put it down. It functions on so many levels, as social critique, as suspense thriller, and as fantasy. As my review title says, why isn't it better known? I can easily envision it as a \\"cult classic\\" for years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Negative reviews have merit, but still a great read","review":"If your a sci-fi geek, you might not like this book. If you're easily disturbed, you might not like this book. If you love a good disturbing novel, try it out.The book does lack a certian amount of technical expertise in writing (it's is first novel, and it reads like one) as well as in the sci-fi element of it (some aspects just don't seem plausible. Even in the novel's sick little world.) Nonetheless, it is enganging and entertaining. Just stay away from the farm while you're reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing...","review":"I discovered that this book is supposedly the basis for Jonathan Glazer's newest film. Glazer directed Sexy Beast and Birth which are both brilliant movies, so naturally I was intrigued by this author. I just finished the book and I have to say I'm quite disappointed. I generally like science fiction, but this book doesn't work as science fiction. There are no explanations of who these visitors are, how they got here or why they're doing what they're doing. In 200+ pages we get a lot of flowery details on the scenery, but little actual plot or character development. The ending is sudden and unsatisfying. Based on this book I will very likely not be reading any more of Faber's work. I will however see Glazer's movie if and when it's ever released."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea, shame about the book","review":"It's a promising premise: a strong female protagonist on a mission with a dark secret is on the lookout for hunky Scottish men. Nice. Unfortunately Faber's plot build-up is obvious, if not trite. The clunky construction betrays the author thinking aloud to himself: \\"and this is where I put in the clue about her background\\"; \\"if I make her look funnily at him here then readers should catch on to what I've been getting at about X\\"; etc. This book is about a single idea, which is so under-developed that if your best friend had told it to you over a drink, you would have laughed and sworn that it'd never get published. This is not a triumph - it's just a leaking plot that Faber attempts to cover up with gruesome imagery and heavy-handed suspense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better Reads Else Where","review":"I got this book (thank God from the Library rather than with my after tax cash) based on it's being in a book titled \\"1,000 Books You Must Read Before You Die\\". Well, having read a great many classics (by such as Tolstoy, Woolf, Nabokov, Chaucer, and so on) I can state that it is NOT a book I feel need be read before one dies. Repetitive, dreary, almost absurd in its \\"plot\\" I gave it even two stars most reluctantly. That part of Mr. Fabers career includes being \\"a guinea pig for medical research\\" may have a lot to do with his writing and fantasy."},{"rating":"1","title":"got under my skin","review":"I bought and read a copy while in London several months ago after reading a review in a bookshop. I found this novel ridiculously implausible, truly creepy and repulsive; yet, at the same time, I couldn't put it down as it is well written. The main character is an unforgetable \\"lady.\\" In my view, you're better off waiting for your teenage kids to see the movie and telling you about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't like it.","review":"I really didn't like this. The story didn't cohere. There were a lot of loose ends. This author has a very political agenda. He puts human earthlings in the position of cows and pigs--animals to be eaten and slaughtered. Yes, that theme appeals to me to on the surface. But he sacrifices too much of the story in an attempt to parody all the major players in the meat vending and eating world. I get the feeling the story would naturally go in one direction, but he has to artificially bend it in order to accomadate some other point he wants to stick in there about the immorality of eating animals. I still eat meat anyway. I especially love bacon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!","review":"I read The Crimson Petal and the White by Michel Faber and loved it. I was wowed enough to read another of his works, Under the Skin, but man was I in for a shocker! This book is weird. I don't mean different or unusual but just weird. If you read what is on the book jacket, you get a feeling for what you think the book is about, but these aren't \\"ordinary\\" characters. Some pages I couldn't even read--they were too horrific. If you like gruesome science fiction, then this book is for you. If you were interested in another book similar to The Crimson Petal and the White, keep lookin'!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgusting","review":"Michael Faber captured my imagination with The Crimson Petal and the White. I eagerly read this book expecting another wonderful tale.I found it to be both repellent and disgusting; it is juvenile, silly and obvious. I did finish it, but wish I had back every moment wasted reading it.If there was actually a time travel machine, I would reset it to the moment before I bought this book. If I want my gorge to rise, I'll dose myself with ipecac."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Will Haunt You","review":"Brilliantly written, thoroughly original dark fable with a number of shocking twists. A timeless favorite for me, demanding a re-reading every couple of years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Need A Lift?","review":"The writer deftly maneuvers the reader into believing the unbelievable, using the chords of reality to tie the unspeakable horror together. Such a unique tale, guessing \\"what happens next\\" would likely be impossible. Take a ride, let the story do the driving and you may not be quite the same when it's over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Take a walk on the wild side","review":"You will pick this book up and start reading, unaware of where it will take you. This is what I found most exciting and at times frustrating about this book. Farber does an excellent job of developing his main character, Isserley, and taking us through her twisted soul searching journey. It is an easy read and you will want to devour it as fast as you can to try and figure what it all means. In fact, it may be a better read the second time around!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely Different!","review":"I finished \\"Under the Skin\\" this morning on the subway and made a mental note to see if Michel Faber has anything else available or in the works. Isserly's tale is an odd one but so beautifully told! Faber has a firm and romantic grasp of the language which is obvious in his descriptions of the Scottish Highlands and, surprisingly, fairly common weather conditions. No, it's not great science fiction, nor is it great horror - it lands in a crack between...and creates its own world. There are some gory bits (the main location of the story is a meatpacking plant after all), but I hope that won't put a reader off from some truly beautful, readable, and thought-provoking reading. Recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Slaughterhouse","review":"Isserley's character developes at the same speed as does the men she picks up that poxy little rattler that patrols the wet Scottish roads in search of broad shouldered male hitchhikers. She becomes less likeable, they become more human, and their end is of such frightfulness that the book cannot be put away until the story is finished. It is a monstrous and pertinent tale, written beautifully."},{"rating":"1","title":"Under the Skin","review":"From reading the sample of 'Under The Skin', I did not expect it to become a stupid scifi story with basic theme inconsistencies. After completion and looking back, I consider it a waste of my time and money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Didn't want it to end!","review":"Sometimes, when I am going through a down phase, I have a hard time sinking in to a book. The way this book was written and everything about the story drew me in and held me from the first page. It completely enveloped me. The only negative thing I can say about it is that the end came far too soon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a good read","review":"As I read I became more invested in the storyline and began to understand that they were not normal_curiosity kept me reading this book. It was a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"An imagination to rival that of Stephen King","review":"Very shocking book. At the beginning you have no idea what the heroine is doing with the males she picks up. When the truth is revealed, it shocks and appalls. I dare not give it away, but this is a book that can definetly compete with the imaginations and story types of both Stephen King and Dean Koontz. It was a horror with a twist and a definite moral in the story, that we are all indeed, the same under the skin. I would also like to add, one will never look at a piece of steak the same again after reading this. Truly a remarkable and well thought out novel and should one read between the lines and see the moral, one will find themselves pondering it for hours after reading the final page."},{"rating":"2","title":"Startling, captivating, warped","review":"Read this book. Michel Faber tells a powerful, graphic story in an elegant, concisely written, halcyon style. Isserley is an indelible protagonist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ick","review":"In one work, ick. I have read two other novels by Faber, The Crimson Petal and the White and The Courage Consort. Both were excellent. I finished this one thinking WTF did I just read. Yes, it was creepy. But in the end what was the point? Creepy for creepy's sake? It was a let-down, particularly since it was well written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save yourself the agony.","review":"Reading this book ranks as one of the bottom five reading experiences of my life. I had previously read The Crimson Petal and the White, and frankly, found it to be a little more disappointing than other reviewers. I'm sure I've lost plenty of people by saying that, but I thought that maybe it was just a product of a writer looking for but not yet finding his stride. At least the idea was a good one. At least good enough to give Faber another shot. Well, fool me once...etc. Under the Skin was not only filled with weak, half-baked, preposterous storytelling, but it had such a heavy-handed metaphoric agenda that I often had to laugh at the writer's clumsy attempts to equate the aliens with the meat packing industry. I found the book unpleasant and ill-conceived. Faber doesn't get a third try with me."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"On Christmas Day\\" Image submitted by Brenda","review":"Although it is better than nothing, and has different cover art than the CD I own, which some may prefer, the quality of this scan can be greatly improved. I would suggest that Brenda resubmit the cover art for this disc with the following tips in mind: (a) Try scanning in color if possible, (b) remove the sheet or booklet on which the cover art is printed from the jewel box before scanning the image, and (c)edit the scan by cropping the image so that the bits of the jpg file are full of the desired image rather than the background of the entire glass on the surface of the scanner to create the final image."},{"rating":"2","title":"One single missing...","review":"It didn't really suprise me, but still it's a bit depressing.

Blur singles are hard to find in America and so here is our answer. The lucky consumers will even get some live tracks. Blur's music have changed since their early years. The contents of the 22 cds will then cater to Blur fans who liked their music then and now. Each cd neatly enclosed in the singles' original cover sleeve, the whole collection may become valuable in the new millenium.

It is a good source of information."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's all here in one little package.","review":"I've been in search of the right Ironman training book for a while. Most regular tri books devote little time to IM training, and others are so complicated they're intimidating (The Triathlete's Training Bible has great information, but I find it really complex.) This gets it right. If you're a nerd like me who likes to understand the logic behind a training program, you can get it here. You can also skim for tips or workouts if you just want to know what to do and when. Especially great is the nutrition section -- Gordo has some very logical, no-hype tips that really work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasn't what I expected","review":"I bought this to see if I could use this to help train for my first full IM event. Maybe I can, if I read it again and again, and take the tips where you find them. Other than that, to me it is hard to follow, some of it seems designed for Elite Pros and then lapses into a tidbit for beginners. If you are like me, an average guy, looking for a very easy to read, yet comprehensive book with full training plans and all the background and reasoning behind the plans, choose Don Fink's Be Ironfit instead -- it is perfect and exactly what I needed."},{"rating":"1","title":"same old story","review":"Really, two stars might be a bit generous.

I enjoyed it so much that I went out and bought the others. I loved the instant attraction between our hero and heroine. Sparks literally flew when they were in the same room and it stayed that way throughout the book. Simply put, this was one very sexy read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Reads!","review":"When I read my first breed series book, it was different from my normal type of book, but after the first one, my goal is to read them all. Once you start reading any of them, you just can't put them down. I love this series; of course I love anything by Lora Leigh. I haven't found a bad one yet. Or less than great, yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow! What a great read!","review":"The cover of this book grabbed my attention, but the story kept me glued. The concept of genetic engineering is a fascinting one and the savage qualities in Braden had me shivering. Braden is sexy, arrogant and demanding, which makes him a keeper in my eyes. No spineless, wimpy heroes for me!! And Megan is no pushover. She holds her own with Braden and shows a strength that had me cheering her on. Great book! Simply great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of the Breed Series","review":"As I peruse the other reviews, I notice some rather angry ones which lecture on \\"no meaning no\\", implied rape, etc. Sister, get off the cross, someone needs the wood. Erotic books are not tame, casual reads to pass around some reading circles nor are they the basis of sociological theses. They're private entertainment, with warning labels [a clue] and everything.For first time Lora Leigh readers, the Breed series is a long standing series from Ellora's Cave publishing (internet and e-book shopping). Yes, you actually would enjoy this book more if you read previous ones first since the characters and history flow through the series. However, the books can stand alone and be a great read. Megan's Mark is by far the best of the series on several levels. Megan \\"rocks\\" and Braden, oh have mercy. The only complaint I had about the book is the length (Breed books always end too soon!) and I wished for more on Megan's uncles.Ms. Leigh, we're waiting for the next and thank you!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Move along","review":"This book is not good.

For the first time you have an alpha female mated with the typical alpha male. I loved Megan! Most of these books have the female eventually submitting to their mate but not her. She can help her mate because of her training and empathic abilities, it is a refreshing change from the norm.Another reason I liked this book so much is because it has some action/fighting. Readers have always been told of the constant danger to breed mates but in this story you get to experience it. If you are a breed fan, it's worth the read."},{"rating":"1","title":"repetitive","review":"Repetitive I read first three books and found myself bored because each book was the same, just with different character names. I started reading the Feline series by this author, which is really good. Assumed this series, being a continuation from the Feline series, would be a great read also. WRONG!!! Seemed as another author wrote this one. It was so bad that, (I never not finish a book or series) I could not read another book in this series even if it was free! Which is a shame due to the storyline was great from Feline series. So great it could have been made into a TV series. Very disappointed and upset because, I originally wanted to read another series with breed in the title, but read a review that stated this was so much better.

I'm not into fluffy never have been and Megan's Mark is definately not fluffy it does help if you know a little bit about Lora's work of genetically engineers soldiers/warriors and the reasons for their creation she hits on it in Megan's Mark but to truly understand one could do with reading all the others lol.. you won't be disappointed... I love series that build a world.It is romance but just not in the fluffy, soppy - sense and a very good one too..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Megan's Mark","review":"This was the first Lora Leigh book that I read and prompted me to start buying, and keeping, her books.

Im sorry Im not trying so sound mean but when every other paragraph is repeating over and over, the same discription, it became extremly boring..\\"hes been alone inside himself\\"...\\"she felt the burning lust inside herself\\"...\\"Tears where building inside her eyes\\"..CORNEY..Renegade was the first book I read of hers, and It was the same..same discriptions over and over, like a cut & paste, nothing original. Its just awful!..Im sry but Im done with Lora Leighs writing..Its just not for me!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not her best","review":"I've read several Lora Leigh books and this one falls short. The main character is fluff and the romance lackluster."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a warning","review":"I have recently started doing reviews because I realize how imporatnt they are in my decision making. With that in mind I wanted to give a quick warning. If you love hot sex scenes and virtually no plot, this book is for you. I am not a lover of erotica but I do read it occasionally and in my opinion, this book was subpar as a mainstream attempt. Do not get me wrong, I had read Ms. Leigh's other erotica concerning the breeds and the concept is very good. I thought that it would be a good device to sedgeway erotica and romantic suspense. It did not happen. Braden is bothersome. The heroine is not much better. As far as using the ploy that they must have sex or die, Leigh could have altered that. Kept the urge but killed the need. For erotica fans, this may be a good read. There is a little meat on the bone. But for fans of romantic suspense that are used to great and compelling stories sprinkled with great love scenes that actually have a purpose....this may not be for you"},{"rating":"1","title":"It was OK","review":"The plot of the book was rather intriguing, but the character's reactions were rather on the unbelievable side. If you are going to have a romance flavor, I would like to read the romance, not he bites her and she just can't resist him because of some weird hormone that he injected in her. Not to mention, I'm really not big on the strong-willed woman gets \\"seduced\\" into turning into a floppy, hormone stiken love slave, just because of a good set of abs, and a big..."},{"rating":"1","title":"series is not in order waste of money","review":"i want to read a series in order this book says its the first but its really number 7 but number 7 was published in 2006 when the first book was 2009 when i read a series i want the books to be in order"},{"rating":"1","title":"The cover is better than the book","review":"I am very tired of reading \\"romance\\" books where abuse is called love and rape is called passion. The heroine says \\"no\\" repeatedly but the hero continues to sneer at her wishes, he's amused and disrespecful. There is a long scene where his goal is to break her and force her into submission. I was sickened by his sexual torture.The so-called erotic language is dreadful. The words are crude and the sex lacks imagination.Every man in the heroine's life worked very hard to make all her decisions for her although she did try to fight back and be her own person. It just felt like her charater was crushed under all the men in her world.I won't be loaning this book to my friends. There are some interesting ideas in this book and had the hero been a little likeable and had the heroine not been a vicitim it might have been an enoyable read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just too much sex, and LOTS of icky language","review":"I certainly like sex in books, but there is barely any story here. Just a huge string of sex scenes, which are all basically the same. Also, I just don't care for nasty slang. Constant use of unflattering names for female genitalia wrecks the mood for me. If you don't care for this, be aware that every third page or so is full of it. I really wanted to like these books, because I like the premise. But I want to read a story with sex and romance, not page after page of gutter talk. If that appeals, then you might love this book, as apparently others have."},{"rating":"1","title":"My standards are not that high, but this was not it","review":"To begin, I'd like to mention that I didn't finish the book. I got about a third way through, and put it down in disgust. To me, this was a poorly written paranormal porn. I mean come on, shouldn't there be some kind of a unique story? Something that differentiates this book for the rest in its genre? Unfortunately the only thing that stood out for me was the uncanny resemblance to bad porn. I leafed through the rest of the book after I decided that I wasn't going to finish it, and everywhere I looked either the heroine was really hot for the breed guy or there were the descriptive scenes of their various encounters. Not much room for the actual story.It's my personal opinion of course, but I really don't get all the praise that people seem to have for this book. I just want my $6.99 back :("},{"rating":"1","title":"too many filthy words","review":"Wow - I have to say I was shocked. I don't mind a sex scene - but the words she uses for shock value are over the top - and it is dedicated to her mother and father - who read all her work? Wow - what kind of a trashy family does she come from!"},{"rating":"1","title":"trash is too nice of a word","review":"I enjoy paranormal romance as much as the next person - this however is pure trash!

But I didn't enjoy it. I see that alot of the other reviewers thought it was great, but, I guess it was just not to my taste. Bummer is I bought it new. (lol)I am not going to go on with the series...why throw good money after bad?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible, depressing and not worth buying","review":"DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!! If you have, you would most probably throw it away as far as you can. I am glad I have bought her other books that are very good. This one is depressing, all her characters are stuck in their past and struggling too hard to move on. The man the heroine loved get killed in the process, another character get accused as a pedophiliac and lo and behold! The rollercoaster solve the problems! This book should never go out to print under SEP's name... use another alias! You get you money worth buying It Had To Be You, Kiss An Angel, Nobody Baby's But Mine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible and depressing","review":"This book was awful! I've never read a book before where every character practically screamed \\"I NEED THERAPY!\\" The potential for a good book was there but Phillips killed her story with her deeply disturbing characters. What's the use in a romance novel if the ending isn't happy, but bittersweet?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read!","review":"I have read several of her books now and I love them all. This one is different from the others. It's darker and less predictable. But it still has the wonderful characters that make SEP books such a joy to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"I love her books, but found this one very different.","review":"I found this whole story far-fetched from the beginning. I just never got involved with Honey, in fact, I didn't like her or believe her. I couldn't seem to put it down either. I found the part on child abuse so upsetting. I just wanted it to get over. Give me Heaven,Texas or any others. Has this been my first book of hers, I never would have read another."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"I am glad that I had read some of her other books before this. I made myself finish it and I would not do that again. I never cared about Honey and I just don't see how the rollercoaster solved her problems. Read _It Had To Be You_, _Heaven, Texas_ or _Dream A Little Dream_ instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of her better ones","review":"Though I did not enjoy this book very much I adore most of Susan Elizabeth Philip's books. If you are new to SEP, please do not read this one first because it will undoubtedly turn you off from her other books. I suggest reading Nobody's Baby but Mine, or Heaven, Texas for the best of her work to date. I think it's still good to read all her books to see how she has grown as a writer, but don't start with Honeymoon, or Hot Shot (this on is even worse)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to par!","review":"Such a disappointment!! I read nearly all of Phillips books. Many I love, the rest I really like. This was horrible! The characters were unlikeable, the story unbelievable, and the relationships ridiculous. I'm not clear if Phillips was trying something new but she should stick to what she is good at... lighthearted romances with spicy, likeable characters and plausible (mostly) relationships."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you are looking of a light read - avoid this \\"dark\\" story","review":"SEP's books are usually funny and the characters are so lovable. This story was depressing from start to finish. The heroine actually marries her onscreen \\"father\\". He is killed. She falls for another man named Eric who is accused of molesting his down syndrome daughter and other daughter. How much more depressing could this book possibly get? SEP should check her estrogen levels."},{"rating":"2","title":"While not one of SEP's best, this is a very enjoyable novel.","review":"I have read all of SEP's books, and while not her best, this is a very enjoyable book. Not your typical romance story, SEP never goes for the standard plot twists, her stories are always very original. Honey Moon is a great heroine, who goes from nothing to become a famouse TV actress. She falls in love with her co-stars, one a burned-out cowboy and the other a sex symbol. The book spans a long time so we get to see Honey grow from a cheeky brat to an outspoken young woman. Just when you think you know what is going to happen, the author throws an unexpected twist and your off in another direction entirely!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not sure what SEP was thinking","review":"I did not like this book one bit! It was very depressing. There was a pedophile, Honey Moon's father figure (like 20 years her senior) married her and then eventually died, the other hero lost an eye, honey believed that walt disney was god and there was a \\"magical\\" roller coaster that was the most important thing in her life.At the end the pedophile, the one eyed hero and honey lived happily ever after thanks to the magical powers of the roller coaster.Don't waste your money on it. Buy the Chicago Star series or Lady be good instead!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Never read this book","review":"This book was disappointing. Not fun at all to read. I found myself wanting to hand the characters the pistol so they could put there shallow, lame selves out of my misery. I'm not kidding. I wouldn't even donate this book to a prison.

Filter seemed to have shed their Nine Inch Nails sound from their first CD and opted for the a straightforward alternative Rock CD.

If you are a fan of alternative/ newer Rock, I would recommend this CD. It rocks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Filter is simply...awesome!","review":"I would like to say that Filter \\"Title of record\\" is simply my favorite c.d. I own. Richard Patrick has the most awesome voice. I prefer bands like Tool, Stabbing Westward, Metallica, and Nirvana, but Filter's new album just blew me away! In my opinion the best songs are: \\"Welcome to the Fold\\", \\"Captain Bligh\\", \\"The best things\\", and \\"Iwill lead you\\". The songs are put together in a masterpiece-format that will keep you listening to the c.d. non-stop. Please go to your local music store, and let the new sounds of Filter consume you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soothing and head-banging at the same time","review":"Filter's style is so fresh. I got a lot more than I expected with this. I have high expectations for any album I purchase and Filter lived up to them and made me forget I had any. You can just close your eyes and go to your happy place. This guy can sing very well and that noise in the background kicks a$$."},{"rating":"2","title":"Filter - Title of Record","review":"I am very glad I ordered this CD. However, it was completely different than what I was expecting. Filter has a definate hard edge, and the songs reach you deep down in the pit of your darkest places. Take a Picture reflects the mainstream influences on the band. I say that Filter should stay with the hard edge, and not conform to the Top 40 Billboard music standard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Use your brain","review":"Personaly i found this to be a very enjoyable album. To many people bought this cd for \\"take a picture\\" then come here and complain about why it sounds like \\"welcome to the fold\\" in places.

In its own right the song is about boozing, however, I listened to the rest of the album while completely sober the next day and wondered why Richard Patrick decided tone down the bands sound and make it more \\"accessible\\" to the masses. So he could sell more records obviously. This album just doesn't cut it, when Brian Leisgang was still in the band Filter had very hard and yet sophisticated sound that was showcased well on its debut album Short Bus.

I didn't listen to it for a long time and then decided that i might be too harsh in my judgment and put in my cd player again. The result: my stomach started doing somersaults. I noticed that most people think this record is the best thing since sliced bread, but to me its sheer torture, especially when i realize how much i loved the first album (even if its supposedly more immature - and by the way, when did selling out suddenly become mature?). I guess it's just one of those records that people either hate (that's me) or (more commonly) worship like a household deity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be fooled by \\"Take a Picture\\"","review":"I bought this album after taking the advice of a friend and hearing \\"Take a Picute\\".

If you like \\"ROCK\\", Filter is the band for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Record of 2000","review":"Lyrically uneven. Not an example of the greatest musicianship. However-A truly great record. A seemless collection of dynamic, beautiful pop music. A record one can savour from beginning to end. Flawless, crystal clear production that doesn't sacrifice warmth or feeling. Its an emotional, moody record expressed in infectious verse-chorus-verse- what else can you ask for in a pop record anyway?Great tunes, sometimes personal and thoughtful, sometimes absurd, with a depth that manifests with multiple listenings. Buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"If this is industrial then britney spears is a deathrocker","review":"What happened!?!?!

It's depressing to see a talented musician like Patrick (or maybe liesegang was the one with talent?) churn out mindless radio-friendly garbage, but hey-anything to make a buck, right? It seems that the person below me is rather confused as to what industrial music is; it's NOT Filter (or even NIN), it's bands like Front Line Assembly, Numb, and Cubanate, although i doubt anyone here has heard of them . . ."},{"rating":"2","title":"SHORTBUS (10), TITLE OF RECORD (8) MAKE WAY NIN","review":"This is a truely great cd. I gave it 4 stars because I was expecting more songs with the same median of *Welcome to the fold* but there were a few ballads..... not bad though. Short bus was definatly better. BUT THIS CD KICKS!

But after the second or third listen, I really found myself getting into the songs. The lyrical content is impacting and truthful while the beat is infectous.

I think of 80's groups like the Birthday Party as a much more credible \\"angst.\\"Its unfortunate, I was looking for a good rock album.

While the tracks may be good (I don't mean to bash the band) they are much heavier than what I was expecting or than I like. I thought a few songs on the album were all right (in addition to \\"Take A Picture\\") like \\"Miss Blue\\" and \\"The Best Things\\". Since I haven't heard other albums by this band I can't make a comparison but if you're looking to buy this album based on the single itself I'd suggest not getting this album.PS - The album should be stickered too for profanity."},{"rating":"1","title":"wish i could put no stars","review":"1 good song the rest blow if u buy this cd u are wasting more then just 13 bucks your wasting the time it takes to find out its garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ah-hum . . . \\"Way go my airplane?\\"","review":"I don't think any other song has made me feel more embarrassed for the singer.

I strongly don't recommend this.Favorite songs: Welcome to the Fold, Captain Bilge"},{"rating":"1","title":"In response to John","review":"When I write a review, I \\"call 'em as I see 'em\\". There is no denying Trent Reznor is was very talented at what he's done. His songwriting was more impressive than Filter or Marilyn Manson and on that level I agree with you. However, NIN is not in a competition with Filter but rather with themselves to always top their previous work. For a band to release only once every 5 years is inexcusable."},{"rating":"2","title":"This album is amazing","review":"This album is much more lively than Filters previous album Short Bus, being that is was a much more darker album. \\"Welcome to the Fold\\" is probably my favorite song of all time\\".

(short buss is also good)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gets better with each play","review":"I've been a Filter fan ever since \\"Short Bus\\" and I have been waiting for a new album for ages. At first I was a little disappointed by \\"Title of Record\\" because it didn't sound a lot like the first album, but after listening to it over and over again, I was hooked. The best thing about Filter is their ability to start a song out slow or go through a slow part in a song and then just explode. This album is definitely the best that I have bought in 1999. It may not be a NIN facsimile like the first, but it definitely possesses more creativity and variety."},{"rating":"1","title":"anemic","review":"the sophomore album falls deeply beneath my expectation. on the first album the band distinguished and differentiated itself with the great energy radiating from each song. i'm sorry to admitt that i can't sense that anymore. i'm throwing a second star in appreciation for the improved melodies."},{"rating":"2","title":"With all due respect... Skinny","review":"There are some good songs on this CD and some what I would call \\"fluff\\". Take a Picture is probably the weakest of songs on the CD and I know that will be an unpopular stance, but it is definitely not representative of the entire album. For me the song that stands out the most is Skinny. It has the soft intro and verses that lead into a rocking chorus. This song, and many of the others are equal too or better than Hey Man Nice Shot, which should be expected of a follow-up album if the band has talent. I enjoy this album immensely."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm 40 and I like it","review":"Whatever the category is for this band, Heavy Prog Industrial Choir Music, thisCD has alot of energy and I play it loud and I play it often and only when my young kids hop in the Suburban is when I have to turn it down. It's good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Astounding","review":"This CD features some very great songs. This is my first Filter CD and I'm probably going to buy their first one. After \\"Welcome to the Fold\\" I never thought Filter would make the ballad \\"Take A Picture\\" but it still sounds really nice. Richard Patrick w/others, has done a good job writing these songs and producing them. The CD sounds cool, and is very well done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Filter Offers A Variety","review":"The first song I ever heard by Filter was \\"Take a Picture\\" and I loved it. Infact, that was what made me go out and get the cd. Then when I heard the cd, most of the other songs were more alternative/rock like \\"Welcome To the Fold\\". It was hard core compared to \\"Take A Pic.\\" but i loved it as well. In Title of Record you get a taste of so much, theres alternative, rock, slower songs like \\"Miss Blue\\" and \\"I'm Not the Only One\\" which by the way are very deep, (all their songs have significant meaning), theres also a little techno upbeat sound to \\"The Best Things\\" and then theres \\"Take a Picture\\" that has a smooth free flowing sound. Richard Patrick can sing smoothly, scream, and hit high notes. Whether you liked Short Bus or not, i recommend Title of Rec., because they still have the same style but in this new record they bring in more variety. All their songs are results of real experiences, you can tell by the feeling Richard Patrick brings forth in his music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sand","review":"Putting aside all of the NIN ties and industrial history of this album's creator, you should be able to focus on the beauty of this record. The production is fantastic. This record is a collection of 9 finely-written pop songs with a beautiful sonic layering of guitars and sounds. The drums sound great - a perfect blend of electronic and live drum performances. Even the lyrics, while resembling the written word of a High School Sophmore, are excellent. Lines like, \\"You know a little bit goes a long way\\" communicate feeling more than something that could have been really worked at. The lyrics suit the melodies well, and the melodies are what shines the most out of this sonic sludge of lush sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Filter Album yet!","review":"Filter rocks on the new \\"Title of Record.\\" Much more consistent than \\"Short Bus,\\" Filter provides a mix of ballads with hard core industrialized rock. Pick it up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An intense, emotional album.","review":"I'll admit that when Short Bus was released I bought it mostly for Hey Man, Nice Shot, but a year later I was still listening to it repeatedly. Richard Patrick seems very talented at touching on subjects like isolation, loss, regret, bitterness etc. without sounding like a spoiled generation x-er. (ie. Pearl Jam, Bush etc.) Every song on this album has it's moments much like short bus did. Highlights include: The best things, take a picture, and welcome to the fold. Solid, unique and touching throughout, I really can't recommend this cd enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beginning violin","review":"works for me.

As Winston Churchill stated about General Marshall when WWII was over \\" Thank You\\".

At first, she seemed to be alright to listen to, but she seems to really be turning into another one of those manufactured rip-offs. Her latest song, Naughty Girl, is not really an enjoyable song. I really thought that it just wasn't anything exciting or uplifting to enjoy. The song at the very beginning samples Donna Summer's Love To Love You Baby. The song just simply is the beginning of her overexposure. I think it has to be one of the worst songs I've ever heard right now. As for her, I just hope she reunites with Destiny's Child soon. She just seems to be lost right now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I always hated her but surprisingly I have liked her latest material this is the Beyonce of old crap she is really not that good and I was always a hater of Destinys Child.Lyrics 2/10 Production 5/10 Overall 3.5/10"},{"rating":"1","title":"beware","review":"I ordered this used and it's NOT the same single described by 'bigboy010205', the other reviewer on here....the one I got only has 2 songs, the regular version of 'Naughty Girl' and 'Everything I Do'.

We're on our 4th regular nylabone and both dogs love it, so I thought I'd give this a try. I have to first mention that nylabone's definition of \\"giant\\" is way different than mine. I was expecting something 6-8\\" in diameter made of 1-2\\" thick material. I should have read more, it's actually about 5\\" in diameter with .5-.75\\" thick material. Still not bad, big enough to avoid any issues with my giant breeds.Otherwise it's a regular nylabone, burly and apparently tasty. One fringe benefit of the shape is that without corners, the dogs tend to tear off fewer shards (the regular and galileo ones do this a lot). They don't seem to like it quite as much as a regular nylabone, but they'll play with it occasionally. All in all a good purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT TOY","review":"My dog loves this toy.

She's had it just over a week and already it's gotten more chew action than all her other Nylabone Durachew toys. She seems to enjoy the shape, which she can brace with one paw. I bought it because I thought more chewing surface would make it last longer and less likely to break off in larger chunks (and it does seem a little safer than the bone-shaped toys).

It is a dark work with some outstanding songs like the title track, All The Madmen, Black Country Rock, Width Of A Circle and The Supermen. There are nightmarish imagery and some of the aforementioned songs have their sublime moments, but overall the album lacks memorable tunes and hooks. It is thus an atypical work that would appeal only to devoted fans and those into late 1960s/early 1970s hard rock."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor writing ability meets compelling characters","review":"From the start, the writer's technique disturbed me. Most stores from the Civil War era are written in a voice that matches the dialects of the time and region. This book felt like it was written by a teenage girl in modern-day society. The story would move too quickly for comfort through interesting things and then suddenly slowed down to dwell on less intriguing items. The characters were compelling but so many loose ends were left unresolved that it was hard to really understand how the ending came to pass. Also, I found myself wanting to fact-check several times, leading me to question the historical accuracy of the writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful & haunting with a message of hope.","review":"The Wedding Dress is one of those books you read more than once and never forget.

Not only does the author demonstrate an insider's knowledge of the legal system but he is also that rarity -- a writer who puts together no-nonsense sentences and manages to be graceful.At the heart of the book is a woman who must fight to save her child -- at any cost. And a lawyer who must count the cost if he is to hang on to his integrity. For those looking to be offended, there is lots of material here -- lawyers, judges, doctors, feminists, journalists -- you name it. In the end, however, the book reaffirms faith in humanity and its institutions, including the law. Rather than a legal thriller, I'd call this a legal drama.

However, his description of the area being a group of inbred, ruthless, body of people which exploits then abuses women and children is not fiction, but reality, showing in them not the best, but the worse humans offer in egocentric, greedy, individuals who are not only in law, but feel they are above the law. 92 cents is far more than anyone should ever pay for this sickening story written to exploit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeps you thinking every page!","review":"Book was very well written, and kept me thinking.

Anyone who cares about stepfamily life would benefit by reading this interesting analysis.George Barna and others are reporting that the divorce rate inside the church is the same as outside. Why isn't Christianity responding with more help for divorced people and stepfamilies? If you're interested, search Amazon for books by Rev.

A hobo (R.C. Bates) spills his blood in the same warehouse and re-animates the toys destroyed in the last film. Not only is there an alien doll man (Tim Thomerson), but now there is a doll girl (Melissa Behr) as Nurse Ginger. She originates from a third movie, \\"Bad Channels.\\" Don't worry. If you haven't seen any of the three prequels to this film, they show you plenty of excepts to catch you up to date.Judith (Tracy Scoggins) for some reason believes a 12 inch man can defeat a 12 inch doll easier than a 6 foot person. The demonic toys are aided by security guard and former Ewok, Phil Fondacaro. In a role reversal, toys want to have sex with a woman. It is short and it is what it is. You might be better off just watching the prequels knowing it gets worse. The toys are not as funny and clever as in the first film.F-bomb, sex, no nudity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sexy Meshell","review":"Meshell's new album is luscious. Sure, her bass is absent, but this album didn't call for that funky sound. This album is a reaction to her break-up with a former girlfriend (thank goodness she's now hooked up with the fab Rebecca Walker). She admits that this album was done to fulfill a contractual obligation-- her best man producer David Gamson was even kicked off the project but she was able to put together an album of integrity and soul. Thanks probably goes out to Craig Street for not letting Maverick turn her into a pop-40 flash. Don't be afraid, Bashir, to go to an independent label! We'll follow you, girl!

I was very sad of hearing the \\"Bitter\\" CD that she may have changed style...but NO! I just saw her in concert last week in London and SHE'S ALIVE! We had plenty of soft and funky song with plenty of electric guitars, rhodes piano, slap bass and groovy drums, jazz solos, velvet ambiances...just as in the first 2 albums. She performed 2 tracks that should be part of the forthcoming release. No date has been mentionned so far..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too melodramatic.","review":"I am a music fan of this lady. I couldn't wait to buy her new CD for my growing music collection at home. Since I love variety, I was happy and anticipated adding her latest to my easy listening category. Unfortunately, I absolutely hate this CD. I wish I had returned it the next day but I was in deep denial that it was a bad as I thought it was the first time I scanned through it.I really tried to absorb what she was saying but the style was literally just \\"too painful\\" to listen to. \\"You hurt me! why did you do it? You left me alone... etc\\" Most artist sing about real life/love situations. However, if she's singing (in this case) \\"talking\\" about her personal experiences, I think she should seek therapy right away!

I am a true fan of her music, but this cd has no redeeming qualities whatsoever. I certainly hope she feels better soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Phenomenal - even without the bass Meshell is amazing!","review":"This CD defied my expectations. I've always loved Meshell because unlike most popular artists, she does it all - the writing, the playing and the singing. And being from Atlanta, where bass is a life essential, Meshell has always come correct with more bass than my speakers can stand. So you can imagine my surprise when \\"Fool of Me\\" started. Even without a heavy bass guitar, Ms. Ndegeocello is simply amazing. The minimalist tone of tracks, like \\"Fool of Me\\" and \\"Bitter,\\" the layering of vocals in \\"Wasted Time\\" and \\"Satisfy\\" (my absolute favorite), and as always, her honest (almost eerily so) lyrics combine to make an incredible album that hasn't left my CD player in two weeks. Some of the tracks made me wonder - has she been in my head or what?! Everybody, no matter what your musical preferences, will get something phenomenal out of this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Possibly the most brilliant lyrics ever written","review":"This being the first cd I've purchased by M, I started out listening with some trepidation, but was hooked after the first track. I have never felt so moved by any other artists lyrics as I have with the devine,exquiste M. Her heartbreak, joy, sexuality is sung with such raw intensity, you are compelled to listen over and over again. Thank you for touching my soul."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"This is one of the few Cd's I crave, if I have not heard it for awhile...I love the lush orchestration the tight lyrics and...Meshell's voice.

I have read reviews by others (and I respect your opinions, of course) that say that this CD is too \\"far out\\" or \\"not MeShell\\". I view this CD as a creative experiment, both musically and lyrically that comes straight from the heart. The song Bitter and Beautiful make me cry every time I hear them. All artists go through a metamorphisis...that's what makes them artists worth anything. Do yourself a favor, and free your mind and heart and listen to this CD with no preconceived notions....I think you be hooked."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD is EXCELLENT - I love it!","review":"I love this CD it is absolutely excellent.

My favorite cut is the one w/ Grace Jones. I truely feel this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"NAKED TO THE WORLD","review":"Virtually turning her soul inside out, Meshell musically bears all. She finds words and gives voice to the vortex of feelings, when in, out or inbetween love, we have all had but lack the eloquence to express. A brave and deeply affecting work of art."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 stars is not enough","review":"Me'Shell threatened not to record again as a result of a lack of radio play and Urban radio acceptance. Thank god she did. This album is outstanding from beginning to end, it goes by all too quickly. Every song is powerful and thought provoking. Do yourself, and others a favor, buy this album and spread the word. Radio's loss is our gain."},{"rating":"2","title":"me'shell's masterpiece","review":"I liked on first listen, loved in on the second and was in a trance on the third. This is a GREAT CD. The musicianship is top-notch, the music is beautiful and MeShell's laid-back vocals make this an instant, if unappreciated, classic. Her sense of distrust and confusion about relationships come out crystal clear in \\"Fool of Me,\\" \\"Bitter\\" and \\"No One is Faithful.\\" The strings on all the songs are beautifully arranged. Just listen with an open mind and don't expect \\"If That's Your Boyfriend\\" or \\"Soul Record.\\" This CD is in a class by itself. Anyone who's been hurt by love will relate immediately."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet shock","review":"I saw Bitter by chance, I'd never heard of her. From the first tunes I was hooked. Her voice is deep, the music so sensual, sad, strange, it makes my fantasy go I don't know where. Her lyrics touch me deeply and directly. I love every song, it's magic. I carry Bitter with me all the time, I recommend this to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Old song found","review":"Wanted a song from the movie \\"Love and Basketball - You made a fool of me\\". The song is not available on the soundtrack, when I found it on the album it was a must have. The album as a whole is good easy listening music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deep","review":"I do miss the funk and the politcalness from the first two albums, but more than that I'm a fan of whatever Me'Shell does, and this cd will spin many times in my player. Track 11 seems to have confused alot of people. The ending is supposed to be like that, the last word you hear is \\"broken\\" so that ending is pretty much in context of the message expressed in the lyrics. It's not a defect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deep, emotionally raw and beautifully arranged","review":"Having become a fan of her amazingly smooth voice and driving bass from the first album, and more so through the second, this was a radical departure from those funky workouts. However, although there is a noticable absence of her bass, the emotional depth still shines through in some beautifully arranged pieces. My personal favourites were Bitter, Grace, Faithful and Wasted time. The mood is painfully melancholy though, so this is one to chill out, or do some thinking to. Definately a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Meshell- Bitter enough to be sweet!","review":"I was dying to hear this WAY before the release. I was lucky enough to get a pre release copy. I have since nearly worn through this cd and still cannot get enough. Her lush voice and voluptous melodies make way for an amazing soudscape. Each piece of work by this groundbreaking artist take you through emotions and convictions which are thoughtfully evokative and immeasurably intense. All her cd's are a must have for evolved music fans.Luana..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Meshell's Best","review":"I have been a long time fan of Meshell's, but if you are looking for another Peace Beyond Passion or Plantation Lullibies, you will not find it in this album. Bitter is a beautifully composed album that chronicles every aspect of relationships from lust to love. Fool of me, Faithful, and Wasted Time are my personal favorites but this is definitely a CD that can be played from front to back. She is one of the most talented and truthful artists making music today. BUY THE CD!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A radical change","review":"I am still listening to \\"Plantation Lullabies\\" and \\"Peace Beyond Passion\\" after all this time. There are few CDs that I can say that about! I give Meshell credit for going in a totally different direction this time. However, I do miss the funk and bass from previous endeavors.

I stripped one of the screws before it even got snug. The mounts didn't fit my bike, and the screws that hold on the wheel reflectors are made from soft nylon. I will leave the wheel reflectors on until they fall off, but the rest of the kit is going in the trash because I can't use it. I am really disappointed because I really only wanted a good rear reflector, and all I can use from the kit are the wheel reflectors.You can buy a decent light or some reflective tape for less than the price of this kit.

He makes weird, bizarre films and i love him for it!One thing that really surprised me was how gentle and sophisticated he is, not having seen many interviews with him before i was really surprised at how humble and gracious he is and totally unjaded.Loved Jack Nicholson before seeing this movie, but i must say i have an added respect for him now, it was very touching seeing him talk about Mr Corman.Just ordered 2 more Roger Corman classic dvds, so i can enjoy the master for hours to come!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Portrait of a pioneer producer","review":"This documentary detailing the fascinating career of the legendary Roger Corman does a great job of showing how much he has impacted the film industry all while being slightly outside its walls. There are many great little lessons to be learned from some industry heavyweights in the interview sections and extras for indie filmmakers. The included film cuts look sharp and colorful and do a great job of keeping the action rolling while providing insight into Roger's producing and directing techniques besides eliciting many moments of nostalgia. I hadn't considered how the era of the blockbuster had affected the drive-in/exploitation industry but this film provides some great insight into this notion. This is essential viewing for film students and fans of Hollywood, I found it inspiring and entertaining throughout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Corman's World","review":"An honest and sincere look at the legend behind the American B-movie.

Besides biography of Lautrec it shows life of struggling late nineteen century \\"bohema\\" and night life of famous Montmartre and different cabarets, e.g. Moulin Rouge, etc.The version that I read contained color inserts of Lautrek lithographs, which really helped during the reading, because I wasn't very familiar with artist's work at that time.

I think it is honest because of the kind of music Slipknot plays.If I compare the sound with the Blu-ray of Jeff Beck (2008 Live at Scott) or Snakes and Arrows (Rush), of course the Slipknot has a confusion sound, but in the context of the show the sound is good.Too tell the true, the bass's sounds of drums are very clear, but the guitars have a digital sound. The bass guitar I couldn't hear, it is lost in the wall of sound.Too much energy and too much visual!

The first disc is nothing more than live scenes from their tour spliced together. A complete waste. The second disc contains three different elements.

Outside of Psychosocial, I don't think their last effort was very good. Lastly, there is concert footage from a festival in London. I would have liked this better if it had been concert footage from a show in a relatively small arena, it would have a better feel to it. The good thing is that it was professionally done, and you get some great songs that were not on Disasterpieces.

I admit that I am probably too picky, but honestly if a product tells me on the box that it sets itself automatically, then I expect to bring the darned thing home and have it do so as soon as I plug it in. Sadly, this is not what happens. I plug it in and it just flashes 12:00 at me like any other alarm clock. I have replace the batteries countless times, and read the instructions and web sites until I am cross-eyed. I have even returned it for another unit!!! (yes, it would appear that I am a glutton for punishment, but my wife likes it for some reason) This is the sort of product that makes people associate a company with really crummy products.

It's the most usable alarm clock I've ever had. I'm not sure where to start - the fact that you can have both alarms be buzzers at the same time? The way you can set the alarm with one hand, because you're not trying to hold down the \\"set alarm\\" button while setting the time with the other?I like the huge display. I tried the blue version of this one, but I find the green easier on my eyes. I tested out the battery backup - the alarm really does go off, even if the alarm clock is unplugged (although the radio alarm goes off as the buzzer if it has no power).The only drawbacks are that with the speaker on the back the radio has to get turned up to make it loud, and in my dreams it would be great if I could plug it into my computer and upload music to it to use as the alarm. But really, it's a great clock."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap Walmart Garbage","review":"Purchased the RCA model Rp5420 on 11/17/07. The first thing I noticed was that the thing did NOT automatically know what time it was, in spite of the claim on the box, and the batteries that came with it were DOA. I put new batteries in it, but noticed that no matter where in the house I plugged it in, there was a static type crackling noise constantly emitting from the speaker that would not shut off no matter what I did.I figured it would be my luck that it would catch fire or something went I left for work if I kept it, so I will be returning it today for something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total disappointment","review":"I love the design of this alarm - it met all of my needs.

Nothing worked - no display, no radio, nothing. It was extremely hot on the left side of the unit and I could smell hot plastic.

With that said, the author is clearly a zealot and he is unable to stay on topic for more than a paragraph or two with out some anachronism creeping in or jumping to some other related topic. The first 2/3 of the book is an interesting read and the photographs are both informative and hilarious. In the last 1/3 of the book the author's zeal really takes hold as he begins talking about football. At this point I lost interest, as it seems the author is really just another football obsessed fanatic that is all too common in the area these days.

Ms Feehan has a good number of books published with loyal fans, so I assumed that she was worth reading. This first novel was something of a let down as I could not really get attached to the characters, feel the emotions on the pages, nor get engrossed in the universe portrayed.I am willing to try another in the series because writers evolve and can grow into something spectacular.

While it was interesting to finally read Sarah's story (I've read the other Drake Sisters novels and really enjoyed them) this was like reading a summary of a novel or like watching a whole movie in fast forward.

The writing style can be light and fluffy at times but there is enough period detail to keep the historian in you engaged. The action is quite bloody and there is a certain gritty realism to much of the story. I could have done without the whole chick element that Louisa brings but it does serve to offer some insight into Sharpe's character by the end of the story. A quick read, and hard to put down. I'm looking forward to Sharpe's Eagle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great book....bad price","review":"I love the Sharpe series but I will not pay this ridiculous price. lucky for me I found a copy for $3.50 at a used book store."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid!","review":"Why would anybody buy this book in the Kindle edition when it can be had in paper for half the cost?

I was debating which one to get Obi-Wan or Anakin.I decided Anakin since i had the Luke one. The only thing i dont like about this is the handle. It is uncomfortable. Cause if you like having two hands together it is hard to do unless u have small hands. Cause u will keep pressing the button to change the color {which is an awesome feature}. Thats why i gave it 4 stars instead of 5. The only difference between Anakin's and Darth Vator's is some of the parts turn black when he becomes DV. Amazing lightsaber i advise u get this lightsaber."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for any Star War Kid","review":"I bought this Lightsaber just a few days ago. I ordered it long time ago, and they ran out of it. I kept my order and choose to wait, and it was well worth the wait for both of my boys (10 & 5 years old). As soon as this toy got home, they took it out and started to fight with each other in their room with the lights out. They started to imagine the movie and started to quote Darth Vader. The switch between blue and red ( Jedi and Sith) is pretty nice for the kids, and it keeps them going back and forth between the two characters. All in all a very nice toy to have for the boys."},{"rating":"2","title":"My son will be so excited come Christmas!","review":"My two year old son has been obsessed with Star Wars and he could watch it all day if he could.

I'm not sure how I'd rate Stendeck compared to any of these, but check it out and decide for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Striking First Book","review":"It is fascinating to me to see the number of reviews of this book--obviously Mark Wunderlich has struck a nerve among readers of contemporary poetry. It's also interesting to note how politicized this discussion has become. What hasn't been said here is that these are finely crafted poems that use intense, beautiful language in a new and interesting way, and that give shape to a voice that is fully-formed and authoritative while not retreating from difficult subjects. The writer of these poems has made himself vulnerable, and that is to his credit. This reader will look forward to seeing what Wunderlich does next."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moving, a great debut","review":"I found this to be a very moving debut collection and an insightful look at the changing impact the AIDS pandemic has had on gay men from different generations. There are deeply moving and fresh poems here, like \\"Given in Person Only.\\" The prose poems are wonderful. Slow down to read these and read them over again; don't race through the yellow light to get where you wanna be faster -- you miss alot that way. This is a young engaging poet who will prove himself in future collections -- I'm looking forward to them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self-Absorbed & Self-Righteous","review":"The speaker of these poems, in his cavalier attitude and faux importance, is unbearable. The poetry is a bad cross of Mark Doty and Henri Cole, but the description here is overdone Doty, and the lacerative language is too overblown when compared to Cole. The run-to-the-top-of-the-hill-and-scream melodrama of these poems is just depressing to watch. Mark Wunderlich knows how to make poems--as evidenced here--but he is too concerned with being a \\"voice\\" and being THE voice of gay men. As a gay man, I don't want Mr. Wunderlich speaking for me. I much prefer to read poems in the voice of one gay man than poems where the speaker is trying so hard to be the voice of an entire group of people."},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing first book from my oldest friend.","review":"Mark Wunderlich's work is amazing. While I haven't seen the finalized incarnation just yet, I've watched this collection of poems evolve over the years and can't wait to hold the whole thing in my hands. I am also extremely fortunate to be able to count Mark as one of my two best friends since the age of nine. This is going to be an incredible collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Puerile and cynical in its political gambits","review":"It would be impossible to exaggerate the folly, self-importance and cynicism of this self-indulgent collection of exhibitionistic pseudo-confessiond. Wunderlich tells us, in a language of facile and adolecscent self-satisfaction, that he would have no regrets about his behavior if he contracted AIDS. Then he asks us to share his trumped-up sense of tragedy over the losses of his lovers and friends. He gives gay rights activists a bad name and gives poems a worse one. If this is what poetry is coming to, give me Milton and Pope any day, but I'd say look to Snyder, Hacker, Howard, and leave this child to his masturbatory incantations."},{"rating":"1","title":"presumptuous, pretentious","review":"there's a tendency in younger poets to want to make huge claims with a voice that is neither confident nor earned. here is an example of that. poems that \\"witness\\" are powerful, exact, and if done well, teach the reader something important; poems that \\"see\\" are flawed and lack the insighful vision that make me want to read more carefully.

Solid performance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outlandishly overplayed hacking of a masterpiece","review":"The Pirates of Penzance is a masterful piece of work representing Gilbert & Sullivan at their finest. Unfortunately, this Stratford production neglects Sullivan's beautiful music by casting sub-par singers who make little attempt to stay in time with the orchestra, and slaughters Gilbert's brilliant text by throwing in as many outrageous bits of slapstick characterization as possible. Brent Carver's Pirate King barely had a line that wasn't interrupted by an uncomical tendency to get hung up on his words. The dancing dominates the show -- ballet fans may enjoy the Pirates in Tights who dance instead of Act. I am very disappointed by this particular production -- apparently an abberation, as the quality of the other Stratford G&S productions is far superior (particularly the Mikado)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just awful, especially if you know the operetta well","review":"After being delighted by the Stratford performance of the Mikado, I quickly bought this one, and what a huge mistake. If you aren't very familiar with the score, you might enjoy it, but if you know Pirates by heart, you will cringe. The horrors begin with Pirate King quoting Shakespeare and the girls stripping down to Victorian underwear on the beach-- accompanied by awful new dialogue. Gilbert would turn over in his grave. And it just gets worse. The sound quality is bad; Fredrick is dull and hasn't much of a voice, and the applause is distracting... which is isn't in the Mikado. It's customary to add little touches and in jokes (see I've Got A Little List in the Mikado), and that's fine, but this is just beyond the pale. Save your money, and buy this company's wonderful Mikado. (Even my 8 year old son, who has never seen this and loves pirates in general, greatly preferred the Mikado.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"blech","review":"I rented this from the library, luckily, thinking naively that because it was the Pirates of Penzance, it would be nothing other than a treat. What I found instead was a shabbily acted, and even more so sung, operetta where all I could do was cringe and be sorry that I was replacing my memories of the hilarious masterpiece with such an unworthy production.What bothered me the most was that Maybel and Friedrich were both so unlikeable! Maybel I can't claim was off-key because she was on every key! Friedrich was anything but \\"exceeding beauty\\" and I don't think any girl would be wooed by that whiny, wimpy voice of his.Just about every other character disappointed me as well, though the pirate king had his moments.

I use it in my \\"water garden\\", but instead of having fish in the bowl, my kitty Tigger laps up the fresh cool water from the lilly pad where the water bubbles out into the bowl. The slide on the side makes adjusting the height of the bubbles easy ... if it's too high the water splashes out of the bowl, but you can adjust it down to just the right height for Tigger. I use bottled water so to keep the pump clean from any chemicals that might be in facet water, although I do believe the pump has a filter. It also keeps the bowl and glass rocks clean. By doing this all I have to do it pore in about 1 1/2 cups of fresh water each morning.

I cut out the toe of a pair of old panty hose and put that over the pump, cutting holes for the suction cup feet to poke through. This keeps the cat hairs and other debris from entering the pump but does not hinder the functioning of the pump.

I hooked it up and it worked great, good water flow, and it has been running constantly ever since without any issues.The fountain gets a lot of debris (leaves, etc), so the pump will probably need to be replaced regularly, but at this price it's not going to be a big deal, and having the flowing water adds a pleasant visual and audible aspect to our deck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sunterra 104506 pump","review":"The pump in an older tabletop fountain stopped working and this was purchased to replace it.

We bought a Canon case that looks identical to this for the first one, and it was great. It is just slightly larger than the camera, is easy to put the camera in and out, and thus protects it well. I keep the lanyard out of the side so that I can wear it around my neck. I ordered this case for my wife and got an identical LOOKING case that is much larger, it still holds and protects the camera but is thicker, wider, and taller than our other case and thus defeats the purpose of having the tiny camera. I suspect they may be making the case larger now since people complained that it was hard to fit camera in and out, but I never had any problems. Perhaps this bigger case can hold a spare battery or memory card wedged against the camera, but that's not what I wanted when I ordered it. I would really like to know where to get the case we have for the first camera."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this leather case","review":"I bought this case thinking it would be a perfect fit for my Canon SD1000.

Well, thats about all that is good.The biggest issue I have is with how bulky it makes the camera. You buy a camera which is subcompact expecting to slip it into a pocket unnoticed. Then you buy this cover from the manufacturer for the same camera and it literally doubles the volume of the camera. That too without adding any useful pockets for spare batteries, memory card etc! I think that is unacceptable.Also, the slot on the cover flap for passing the camera strap is useless and shocking given that Canon designed the cover as well as the camera! The camera strap has this small friction device that lets you adjust strap length. However, the slot is not large enough to let that device pass through. So you essentially cannot pass the strap through the slot.Very disappointing I must say."},{"rating":"1","title":"doesn't fit the SD1100IS","review":"I ordered this case based on other reviews on Amazon which said it fits the SD1100IS.

You can not easily close the flap (so the magnetic latch engages) when you have the wrist strap attached. The only option is to pass the wrist strap through the designated hole in the flap. But doing this will prevent you from quickly removing the camera from the case, requiring you to unthread the strap. This is unacceptable for a camera designed to be carried for anywhere/anytime photography.If you don't use the wrist strap, than this is a nice case. Sturdy, using good materials, and attractive.

There's a hole on the top of the case that I suppose is supposed to work with the strap, but the strap that ships with the camera is far too large to fit. The camera is tiny and really needs the wrist strap so this case is a bad bad choice. Go with something else.I'm back to using my old case that fits pretty good and actually has room for my extra battery, which you also must carry since this camera doesn't have a battery life meter.

Unfortunately, the hole is too small to let the joint of the lanyard pass through it without a struggle.

Having the strap threaded through the case makes it cumbersome for those fast moments when you need to pull out the camera and start snapping. I'm not crazy about the texture of the materials-previous versions were more like soft itallian leather, this has more of a cheesey-cheap walmart texture. It does the job, and is better than other models out there-however- they need to go back to the previous versions.

So, I ordered this case assuming that an original Canon case will be the best fit and worth paying $15. However ...1) The length of the case is not enough to fit the SD960 properly, so the door doesn't close easily. It's only after pushing it in a little to force the softer bottom part out that you can close the camera. (I tried the other listed case model at Best Buy, and doesn't fit properly either! Great job Canon!!!)2) As others mentioned, the plastic part of the wrist strap doesn't go through the open spot on the door3) The build quality of the case isn't that impressive either. The front and back material looks OK, but the sides not so much."},{"rating":"1","title":"low quality","review":"The case is poorly-made so, I returned it.

Go for case logic instead.","review":"I have a case logic with my canon sd600 and I like that case a lot as it looks nice, padded, easy access, holds battery and sd card, etc. It was the perfect case. I got this canon case for free with my canon sd1200. It's terrible. First, I have to take off my belt to put it through the case. Second, it doesn't hold anything but the camera. No battery or extra sd card. Third, it doesn't seem as protective as other cases. Lastly and my biggest problem is that it is way too tight. The camera is like jammed in there and I have tightly squeeze my thumb and fingers to pull it of the case. That means I am getting thumb prints on the screen and accidently pressing buttons.

What storage? What do you think you are going to need? I charged the battery and used the camera for weeks before the low battery warning, I took hundreds of shots. With a 4Gb card you can take pictures all day, even videos, and not run out of memory.

Innovation is not the only benchmark here, though. Neal Barnard's electric guitar sears and sings and is in the same class as some of the best axemen today. Martha Roebuck's voice is positively ethereal, and it would be a mistake to call Mike Stetina's drumming anything less than dynamic. He seems to have all the tools. 'Verdun' is not an easy transition if you've just played some AC/DC, but it should be given a chance on its own.

When the marines stumble upon some corrupt dealings of Confed officers, the \\"Betrayal\\" part kicks in; they are conveniently sent on a mission that they have almost no chance to survive. This book consists mostly of gunfire and lobbing grenades, so don't expect \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\". The characters are disappointingly undefined. They are simply generic sterotypes -- Male Marine, Female Marine, and Cyborg. Whereas \\"Halo\\" was a video-game novel that exceeded expectations, \\"Brute Force\\" lives up to them.

The book starts right in the action (very pale by the way) and develops slughishly through the paces of diferent operative misions. By the time it starts to get momentun; voilá, the book is over!!!

They performed very well for one full season. This season, however, most (but not all) of them are either completely dead or the LCD display is malfunctioning or not responding to button pushes (yes, this is with fresh batteries installed). Speaking of batteries... the battery compartment lacks a proper seal to keep moisture out, which is a glaring oversight by the manufacturer. The angle of the design can be a bit awkward depending on the angle of the hose bib to which you connect the timer -- and can also create more vulnerability for the seal-less battery compartment should a connection leak. The ability to adjust the angle and a sealed compartment would be great improvements. And, of course, these little timers are way too expensive to last only one season."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreliable -- avoid this one.","review":"Have gone through two of these in the last six months and they both have had valve failures. In one case, the valve just stopped working -- disassembly revealed that the motor or controller failed as the actual valve would still close. In the other case, the valve did not close completely, and the water kept running, albeit at a diminished flow rate. Since this valve controlled a drip system, the diminished flow rate had no impact my plants were watered for *hours*. They're happier than I am.

It is very easy and intuitive to program and has fewer connections than some, eliminating possible leaks. Also, it has dedicated buttons for opening the value to water manually, and an especially handy rain delay button that allows you to turn off the watering during a rainy period, without having to reprogram.

That means you can NOT have it turn on at 7 am for 2 mins and then at 10:30 for 5 min. This unit is not humidity proof let alone waterproof. The batterry compartment does not seal at all. There are large holes in the battery compartment that lead directly to the electronics. Huh what? I'm guessing that since this is an Israeli designed product and Israel is a desert country they don't have to worry about rain and humidity.

However it should have been shortened by at least one half. Lundy simply begins repeating and repeating the observation that sailing the Southern Ocean is dangerous, high winds, big waves.I found myself simply glancing at the pages after the halfway point as Lundy continued to repeat this message. OK. The winds are high, the seas are high, you are alone and far from land. Geez, that's not too hard to understand."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to the editor?","review":"I started to read this book (1st 50 pages) and became totally frustrated because the author doesn't know how to tell a story. He jumps from one idea to another never finishing the first. In the first few pages he tells us about sailors capsized waiting for rescue then leaves this story to discuss other things. He says a frenchman pioneered techniques for surviving storms at sea, but then doesn't tell us anything about these techniques. He talks about a bet between two English sailors that resulted in a solo race accross the Pacific but then tells us nothing about this inaugural race, skipping to how a frenchman won the 2nd version......and the discontinities continue, who knows where it's going next. I gave up which is very atypical for me. I usually dig in and finish. I'm fascinated by the subject, but the book needs some serious editing before it is worthy of publishing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ADD on the ocean","review":"I have to agree with the others who have bashed this book. The writer meandered around way too much telling this story. If he had structured the book differently and cut down on the break aways from the race itself, it would have been a much better book.

The writer jumps from subject to subject and to me there was no continuity to the book. The book and the subject matter could have been presented in a much clearer form.

As adventure stories go, this is first rate. I was also very impressed at the handling of the heros and the victims. He avoided easy pathos while intimating the gravity of the highs and the lows. My only trivial complaint about this book in hard cover was the lack of any pictures whatsoever. It would have been useful to at least see the racers faces, as well as a sixty foot wave."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Tough Read","review":"This book was a tough read. Not in the sense that it was technically overbearing, the challenge came in the form of continuing with this style of writing.

The writing fails to present the reader with the true essence and magnificence of the Vendee Globe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unable to put this book down...","review":"From the beginning sentence, I was unable to put this book down. Lundy describes the terror and excitement of the Southern Ocean race so that you are right there experiencing the event with the sailors themselves. The first chapters introduces some of the sailors and describes in detail the capsizing of their ships - then he leaves you there with them at the brink of death or rescue. You don't know the outcome until you've read further and get to know all the players and events that took place in the race. This book was fascinating from page one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic and intelligent","review":"The first truly thoughtful book on extreme sailing; heck, on extreme sports in general. This book is NOT another addition to the genre of adventure porn, in which the reader is constantly titillated and made to feel that, vicariously, they aren't the sloppy couch potatoes that they probably are. This book approaches this sport from a philosophical and intellectual point of view, and still manages to be a seat-gripping yarn. If you need to be held by the hand and spoon-fed your books, this isn't for you. This one's for intelligent readers, only."},{"rating":"2","title":"The \\"Into Thin Air\\" of Sailing","review":"I agree with the reviewer from Ottawa. This is a very gripping book, although the beginning is a little muddled. I got a similar rush reading \\"Into Thin Air\\" last summer. And like Krakauer, Lundy's realistic writing style manages to entertain as well as teach about one of the planet's most fiercecom challenges. Definitely worth picking up."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books","review":"Godforsaken Sea is written so well that the reader is swept aboard one of the magnificent boats battling Southern Ocean storms. In the first few chapters, I dreaded and desperately wanted to read, scared for the lives of the sailors and the boats and thinking 'Wow this could happen to me.' You can't think, 'This is because they were not prepared,\\" because the competitors were, but this shows that in some places, no matter what, you are left in the hands of the sea. As for not wanting to sail anymore, it is quite the contrary.I deeply admire those who have the strength to complete this race and survive in the icy conditions of the Southern Ocean. Not only that, but to sail in such horrible conditions to save a dying comptetitor is extrodinary. This is a horrific tale that everyone should read."},{"rating":"1","title":"The \\"glass\\" was half full.","review":"I have read several books about the Vendee Globe, and the BOC, and in most cases have been riveted by the ferocity of the sea, and the the hardships these sailors faced. But this book was disjointed, and disorganized. Several times the author begins to take you into the fearsome southern sea only to digress into the technicalities of yacht construction...back to the sailors risking their lives...the history of the round-the-worlds...back to the sailors, etc. But near the start of the book he reaveals the dire straits some of the competitors are facing, and then shortly after places people thousands of miles away from their perils. Near the beginning of the race. Start the book at least half way through, and still be prepared to skim read. I'll give this book away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Godforsaken Sea","review":"This story could have been told in about 100 pages instead of 272 pages. Mr. Lundy's tale reminds me of 'Groundhog Day'; the content is repeated at nauseum. What sounds like a thrilling topic, and I'm sure it is a great adventure, translates on paper very poorly. Sorry Mr. Lundy but adventure stories are not your strong suit. More exciting are, \\"The Hungry Ocean\\" by Linda Greenlaw or \\"The Perfect Storm\\" by Sebastian Junger. Spend your reading money on those two instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy This Book NOW","review":"Derek Lundy puts you on the boat folks. This books is a read in one sitting type book.

If you carefully unscrew all of the screws, beginning with the battery cover, and carefully pry open the two sides you can see the motor. Try and locate the red and black wires connecting to the motor and cut one of them. Make sure to either cut a section out or move the severed ends away so they don't rub and still complete the circuit. Voila no more annoying vibration, but still the sound and light. I understand some work is involved, however it's worth it.Than it was sooooo fun to play with its skinny and easy to handle,but the fact that the lightsaber part doesnt go in all the way is weird but that made it much skinnyer the other lightsaber's are huge compared to this one, and it only makes one sound effect when you hit something that gets annoying but overall its great!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love small farms","review":"This is a factual and interesting report on what small farmers have to endure.

This book helped me focus on the mental part of my game. I've taken the tips and won my last 3 matches.

Brad gilbert is a tennis genius and a very good writer. He has a keen sense of humor which is just in his personality - he writes the same way as he speaks (you can see him on TV a lot during the tennis tournaments). In this book he describes what is going on in player's head and what should be going on up there. He teaches how to be mentally strong during the matches. He also gives some very good practical advice on how to improve your strokes and how to play different style players. Very useful book for a tennis player. I'm going to re-read it again - every single page has wealth of valuable info."},{"rating":"2","title":"Men's Tennis","review":"This book was very helpful for improving my game. I would give the book five (instead of four) stars had it not focused exclusively on men's tennis. For example, in the section about stocking your tennis bag, the suggestion \\"bring an extra shirt onto the court\\" obviously does not apply to women and no alternative is suggested. The \\"Learning From the Legends\\" chapter does not include a single woman player. Otherwise, it a great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Off Court Conditioning","review":"If only I played in a match the way I play in practice!!! Want to know why? Because very few tennis players prepare mentally for competetive play and Gilbert gives you the tools to prepare yourself for anything that can happen during a match. The techniques work and they will make an immediate impact on your game if you truly apply his strategies and methods. The really great thing is that it works in conjunction with the game you already have (read: this is not a book written to improve your strokes). Overall, a great practical tool with a lot of insightful and entertaining anecdotes from Gilbert's own career matches against some of the games greats."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reading Ugly","review":"This is a self-indulgent ego trip for Brad Gilbert. It has a few interesting points, but in general it's simply Gilbert talking up his own experiences and telling us what a wonderful player he was. Despite 40 years of professional tennis, Gilbert uses only his own games as examples. I saw him play many times; he was not exemplary enough to justify the bombastic arrogance he shoves in the reader's face page after page.There's little new here that has not already been written about in many other, there are better sport psychology books or autobiographies of great competitors. Gilbert only describes situations, he does not set out techniques of how to compete under pressure, focus, counter negative tactics, etc.The writing style is unsophisticated and puerile, more suitable to a teenager's frivolous blog than a book.One positive: his chapter on game preparation is worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Winning Ugly","review":"Brad Gilbert is an admitted long-time sports nut and analytical strategist, and he brings his unique, analytical perspective to tennis. After having read his book (I'm on the second go-round), I'm finding myself much more observant of both my own game and that of my opponent. The book is more of a left brained Inner Guide to Tennis, and is well worth the reading time. Plus, Gilbert has a kind of sardonic, self-depreciating sense of humor which makes it fun to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Winning Ugly.","review":"Great book. Lots of useful tips to make your tennis game better. Entertaining as well, since the book is peppered with personal anecdotes to illustrate his point. The only thing is that I was not following tennis during his professional career, so I only know the players of his era superficially."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple but efficient - and definitely not outdated","review":"This book deals with mental tennistactics. Brad lets you think about your own game, and analyzes where things often tend to go wrong (on all levels: pros, but also clubplayers). It is helpful in making you a smarter player. A must read, and a true classic already, for everyone who wants to get its own game improved."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"Excellent book, unveiling another dimension of the game. I applied its content, and I saw immediate results. I did not have to practice many hours to change any of my strokes to win against players who used to give me trouble. On the other hand, based on my improved analysis of the game, I now know the shots I have to master in my practice sessions to get even better.I have more fun playing in leagues and tournaments because, now, I am able to manage the game, always trying the find the weak spots of my opponent, in order to get him to play difficult shots.Marc, Gatineau (Québec) Canada"},{"rating":"2","title":"A pure ace from start to finish","review":"After playing women's doubles in our inter-club league for such a short time and being so unsuccessful.

But it was not for a lack of trying. I tried everthing that Brad said. After a while , with book constantly at hand. I did win some matches.! I know I drove some poeple to distraction. ( a nicer way to say I DROVE THEM CRAZY ) quoting Gilbert. Well our Pro took the book off me, I thought to throw it away. Instead he went to the USopen that year and had Brad Gilbert autograph it for me. It is ONE of my prized possessions. Along with Jimmy Connors autograph on my Prince Racquet cover. Thanks Brad.

The VH from before \\"Everything You Want\\" had NO electric guitars, NO rock edge & virtually NO musical substance. However, these things aren't always necessary to produce an extremely enjoyable album like Running on Ice. If you are a little open-minded and can get past the fact that this band tried to make it acoustically for most of the 90s, failed, and then totally reinvented themselves just to get a record contract, you may enjoy the album.

The author visited some of the field sites discused in the book, along with the scientist whose research covered the site, but not even one photo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Snowballs and egos on the loose","review":"Great writing for the layperson interested in pre-quaternary climate change theory, but some of the geoscientists researching the 'snowball earth' appear to have personalities verging on the psychotic. Would make an excellent case study for psychiatrists studying the obsessions of the geoscientific research community. Some of these geologists should've had their egotistical butts coldly rocked when they were being raised. I feel sorry for their students."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent writing but .... no pictures","review":"This book is about the theory that, over 600 million years ago, the earth underwent periods when it was completely covered with ice, hence, Snowball Earth. Although many scientists have contributed to this theory over the past few decades, the book focuses mainly on the efforts of Dr. Paul Hoffman, the main scientist responsible for developing and promoting the theory, thus raising its status to level that it has today. This is a very well-written book. It vividly describes the way in which science works, as well as the fact that scientists are all too human. It also contains well-written discussions on the science involved. Such a book should contain diagrams, figures, charts, photos, maps, etc., to better illustrate the locations, ideas and facts presented in the text. Unfortunately, the book contains none of the above - no picture whatsoever; if it did, I would have easily given it 5 stars. Despite this shortcoming, the book is definitely worth the read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, but not very in-depth.","review":"I truly enjoyed this book. It revealed the scientific theory more in the form of a story than just a book of factual information pertinent to the theory.One need not have any knowledge of or even much interest in geology to enjoy this book. The basic outline of Snowball Earth is that there is extensive geological evidence that there was a global freeze-over about 700 million years ago that ended the precambrian era of unicellular \\"slime\\", and possibly caused or affected the following cambrian explosion.This book is very much a story of Paul Hoffman and his friends and colleagues, and I would not recommend it for someone looking for an in-depth explanation of the snowball theory."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS WILL SCREW UP YOUR COMPUTER","review":"I got this program, having more than 30 gig free on my hard drive.

Luckily, I had made boot disk number 2 and was able to get it back. Note, during this process, I ran out and bought Partition Magic that doesnt have these hokie issues.ANyway, getting the drive back was not as easy as this sounds, since the software didnt tell me it was hiding a partition, it took me a day or so of panic to figure out what the software did.I dont recommend this to anyone that are using Multiple NTFS partitions.

And when i saw a good review for this Mariani brand Philippine Mango (and outside the bag says \\"BEST TASTING MANGO IN THE WORLD!\\"), and i thought that must be very good. Well, i was WRONG. It was too sweet, they added 25 grams of sugar in a 4 oz of dried mango, it was too much for me anyway. The slice of mango was a bit too thin, and it wasn't as chewy as i like it. I really don't think this mango is the best taste in the world, because i had some that were way way better than this stuff.

Example: guleriz guleriz..and their english translation said it means smile often when in fact it means, we smile, we smile , literally ( smile we, smile we). Every page has mistakes like these. Another example: sonra gulmeye baslariz..meaning- later, we start to smile. Literally, later smile to start we, but since it doesn't make sense in English, Later we start to smile is sufficiant, however, their translation.... Smile big... Um..what?? \\" Buyuk gul \\" Lit (big smile) means this, not what they wrote in Turkish!!?? The translation is horrible. They needed to take more time to make this a more accurate translation."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD translation","review":"This book is not quite translated from English to Turkish. Seems as though Mr. Erdogan had taken it upon himself to write a book of his own and come up with another story that doesnt follow the English version.

But very heavy even beginners should not use this kind of raquet and hurt your wrist"},{"rating":"1","title":"Way Too Loud","review":"For the price and for being a fluid bearing(supposedly)fan this one doesn't make the grade. I put back in my 5 year old sleeved fan because the noise this one made was unbearable. I wish I had listened to the one other reviewer's comments but I assumed this person was overly critical or may have hearing sensitivity to certain pitches. Since no one else complained and since my PC sits 20 feet away from me I took a chance. Big mistake, don't waste your money or time if you're looking for quiet. I gave it 2 stars only because it does have good airflow but you can get this in a sleeved fan with less noise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good airflow, long life, BUT TOO LOUD...","review":"I agree with the other reviewers who complained about the noise. This fan makes an \\"electrical buzzing\\" noise and a horrible high-frequency whine that sounded like my ears were ringing. Not really loud, but it was enough to annoy me.I had to replace it with an Ultra ULT40141. I'm back to peace and quiet with just a little \\"whooshing\\" noise that doesn't bother me at all. I hated to pay that much for a plastic fan. But, after this one, I just wanted a quiet fan and it seemed like the surest bet. The airflow is supposedly rated a little less on the Ultra, but my temps haven't changed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Noisy","review":"While the fan is very powerful and moves a lot of air into my TT Tsunami Dream case, it is unfortunately the loudest component in my setup and easily discernible from the rest (i.e. a 1,300rpm S-Flex SFF21E as an exhaust fan, Zalman 9500A cooler, and Corsair HX650w PSU). I have the tower next to me on my desk and find the turbine-like sound slightly annoying. I strongly suspect the 28 decibel spec is incorrect or over optimistic.Had I know how noisy this fan would be, I would have bought 2 of the SFF21E model instead (which is whisper quiet)."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Middle of nowhere","review":"Once again I have read a good book.

It is told from the first person viewpoint of a woman who is descending into irrationality. It is painfully accurate in the subtle ways that the irrationality of a mental illness can take over the psyche of an individual. It is more than a self-help or a true experience book though. It is true work of art that captures the reality of the sufferer of mental illness. I have seen it written that the sufferes of mental illness have just a differenr way of looking at reality and that this way may be in its own way more accurate than the normal population. This book to its merit shows the falsity of this idea."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good sounding slider.","review":"Fit my fat fingers quite nicely, though it is a bit heavier than expected (it's brass, duh).

Made of good materials. Clips fit on neatly. The lengths are a few inches longer than stock, making them easy to fit. Overall very easy, positive experience installing them.Compared to the stock Ford Motorcraft wires, these are thinner, have less heavily fortified plug connectors, and lack the heat shields to protect the wires from the exhaust manifolds.

But this is one of my favroite albums. And about the song \\"Jesus Freak,\\" it isn't a bad song. Out side of christianity, we are all \\"Jesus Freaks,\\" and they are speaking from others point of view........ \\"I don't really care if they label me a Jesus Freak...... and I'm not in to hiding it,\\" and about christian Hard-Rock, God uses Christian rock to minister to the unsaved and to provide a safe alternitive for Christian teens.If you are gonna get an album buy Dc Talk, get this one, it is the only one I like, and it is one of my favroites.Other kewl bands are Five Iron Frenzy, MxPx, and Skillet"},{"rating":"2","title":"great album","review":"this is what i am taking about final a great christen band, song Jesus freaks wow i never thought a Christian band could make a song that good. most bands say they are Christian bands but none say one word about god or Jesus. they are not afraid to hide beyond there faith. 1000 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"This album is awesome!

I listen to it over and over again, and just because of them and a few other Christian groups, they have brought me a lot closer to God. I love \\"Colored People\\", and can't stop listening to \\"What Have We Become\\" or \\"In The Light.\\" My 2 sisters,9 and 6, and my little brother,4, also love all the dc Talk CDs, and when I put \\"Colored People\\" on, my little brother always yells the title! I'm just saying, GET THIS GOOD CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a great CD","review":"\\"Jesus Freak\\" is a great Christian music CD. DC Talk does a marvelous job in converting Christian music in to the rock genre. It also has a small mixture of other music styles thrown in between tracks that add to the Christian nature of the CD but tkae away from its rock basis. Their songs are filled with meaning and well written, especially 'Jesus Freak' and 'Colored People.' They confront the issue of racial discrimination head on in some of their songs. They also have well written music in their songs that matches the lyrics quite well. The only major problem with their music is that it is limited to a Christian audience but i do not consider that necessarily to be a bad thing. overall if you like rock and Christian music you will enjoy this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome cd","review":"This is an awesome cd.The cd starts out with an incredible guitar riff,followed by the song \\"So Help Me God\\".A great start to the cd.\\"So Help Me God\\",\\"Colored People\\",\\"Day by Day\\",and the awesome grunge tinged title track \\"Jesus Freak\\"are my favorites.They are all good. For all you people who were expecting somthing like Jars of Clay,prepare to be blown away!Also,to all you idiots who called dc talk's music blasphemous or ungodly,you are mentally unstable.You need to buy this cd and read the lyrics,if that doesn't change your mind nothing will.The sound has nothing to do with the integrity of the song,it's the words and heart behind the song that count,remember that."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the very best albums of the '90's","review":"Jesus Freak is such a classic, do you really need much convincing to get it? Almost all of the 10 songs are well-known, and deservedly so. \\"Colored People\\" urges love overcoming racism in a unique and undeniably fun presentation. \\"Like It, Love It, Need It\\" rocks the house with a slamming rap in the bridge of the song by Toby Mac, foreshadowing his solo days. \\"In The Light\\" is nothing short of brilliant and \\"What Have We Become\\" and \\"What If I Stumble\\" ask difficult questions without offering trite, sugar-coated answers. \\"Mind's Eye\\" closes out the album in a powerful manner. And, oh yeah, there's a little song called \\"Jesus Freak\\" that ain't too shabby either. The album as a whole is simultaneously cohesive and diverse, showcasing dc Talk at their utmost best."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most moving CD you'll ever here","review":"When i was in church we were talking about being in the light if God and my pastor played the song \\"In The Light\\" which is on Jesus Freak it moved me so much i rushed out and bought it that same day i have to say no other CD could ever compare to Jesus Freak if you dont belive me listen for yourself and even if you've never heard of DC Talk you'll fallin love with there moving spirtual with a hint of rock music and there incredible voices!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Essential Hit even today!","review":"I honestly gotta say, even after so many years this album is THE big on in my ipod song list. Never has there been such a mix of genres in one album! (well now there are ,but dc Talk started it!) Before Lincoln Park ,there was dc Talk! We have Rap, Rock, Soul, and Grudge. What more could you ask for?? This album is one of the reasons why Toby, Michael, and Kevin need to pair up again and give God another show!! Be blessed!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this cd","review":"I love this cd so much i have wore out four so far i like all the songs on the album my favorites are colored people ,jesus freak,what if i stumble, minds eye&just between you and me . i so albums i have free at last ,jesus freak, freak show,& super natural i realy am a big fan and hope to make it to a concert one day."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST CHRISTIAN ALBUM EVER!","review":"I bought this album nearly 2 years ago ! and i have to admit that still rocks my cd player! you find everything from pop to rock and alternative.....mixing some rap glances and nirvana s influences! i rediscovered this album and i love all the songs, no one is bad! trust me and dont forget to check out the kevin max poem (hidden song) alas my love ! this album rocks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"DC talk: Jesus Freak","review":"The cd \\"Jesus Freak\\" by the musical group \\"DC talk\\" is a very good cd in my own opinion. I would classify this as christian rock. The songs include: \\"Just Between You and Me,\\" \\"Colored People,\\" \\"What If I Stumble?\\" and the title song \\"Jesus Freak.\\" All the songs have some meaning hidden within the unclear lyrics of the song, which took me three days of listening to actually understand, that has a spiritual message. The cd normally costs about $12.99 at most music stores nowaday's. This cd is a good listen if you have the time and the patience to really listen and let it all sink in."},{"rating":"2","title":"DcTalk isn't afraid of being Jesus Freaks!","review":"The title song really ispired me not to be afraid to show my true self. I have been a better witness to Christ. This album has great rockin' songs with power cords, and some are slower and reflective of life. Together, they make a great mix for a wonderful album. I still like it a bit better than their latest album \\"Supernatural.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Good music. Good message.","review":"This is the kind of music I as a teen can relate to. It's upbeat, exciting, and reasuring. For me it's kind of a pick-me-up when I've had a lousy day at school or I'm mad at a teacher or my parents or my sister. It's also a lot of fun to listen to. \\"JESUS FREAK\\" ROCKS!!! Another one of my favorite tracks is \\"What If I Stumble\\". Another cool thing that took me by surprise the first time is that there's a hidden track. track 13. It actually starts about 2 min. after track 13 begins but it's realy cool. This CD is a must have. If you like this CD you'll probably like the Supernatural CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very, very good!","review":"This is excellent music no matter how ya slice it. Christian or not, I think all can appreciate this music, and the passion and inspiration from which it springs. To me it sounds like a very honest and positive message. If you're somehow annoyed by wordy evangelism I suppose you may find it hard to get past the band's premise, but if you are either like-minded or open-minded I suggest you give it a chance and be rewarded."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent","review":"Dc talk has endured alot of hardships, trying to be a good Christian rock band and not selling out to secular music. This personally might be my favorite CD of theirs, it has Jesus Freak, Colored People, and Just between you and me. The lyrics personally are what got my attention, they praise God and also attract teens to know more about Him. The first time i heard a Dc talk song was on the radio, and i swear i thought it was a secular band, and told by dad to change the channel but has it turnrd out i was listening to Dc talk and it got me hooked and it will you too if you listen!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An answer to the critics....","review":"DC Talk is entirely committed to the presentation of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. I don't know how anyone can look at these three men and not see the Holy Spirit which works through them. How can you listen to \\"What If I Stumble\\" and think that these guys aren't sincerely committed to ministry? Those of you who rate this album 1 star because you think their music is anti-Christian: you are spitting in the face of Jesus Christ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dc Talks BEST!!!","review":"Ok when I was younger I was looking for a band that was positive and stood up for the right things in the world and DC TALK fits that bill really well. This cd is quite possibly one of the best of the 90's and forever! The cd has positive lyrics and an awesome lyrics! Some of there best songs ever written by this band are on this cd w/Jesus Freak, Mind's Eye, Colored People, and So Help Me God. Compassionate songs like Just Between and Your and Me, In The Light, and Like it love it need it. THIS CD ROCKS!! Get it today!! If you want a positive cd then this cd is for you! Now that I'm older I love this cd even more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This One Grows On You!","review":"On first listen, I was surprised at the diverse sounds on this album... it went from hard rock to grunge to rap to pop. I really thought it was rather ecclectic. The more I listen, though, the more this album grows on me. It has substance, both in the lyrics and the music! \\"What If I Stumble?\\" and \\"Between You and Me\\" are the most melodic tunes on the album, but I love the driving \\"Day by Day\\" and \\"Jesus Freak\\" also. The music really grows on you, so give it a listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally some Christian music I can groove to.","review":"I like to dance and have a good time to music, but being a Christian, a lot of the music out there is so negative and I find myself torn between wanting to hear music that gets me going, which most often is secular, and having to pick Christian music which can be quite limited in its sound and representation. DC Talk wonderfully changed that. I can blast their music throughout the house, knowing that God is being praised as well as dance to my heart's desire. For someone who really likes the rock, pop, and R&B sound but not the negative lyrics, DC Talk suits me well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jesus Freak Jesus Freak Jesus Freak Jesus Freak","review":"Awesome CD the best these guys have put out yet! Now this is a classic CD. Jesus Freak, Colored People, Between You and Me, What if I stumble?, In the Light, and What have we become are great!Supernatural is a great one too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazon needs more than a 5 Star rating system for this one.","review":"For some reason, this album has been compared to Nirvana's \\"Nevermind\\" since its release three, four years ago. I don't know why - except maybe for the fact that Nirvana's was the best secular rock album ever, and dc Talk's was the best Christian album ever? I'm not sure about Nirvana's album being the greatest ever, but \\"Jesus Freak\\" is by far the best Christian rock album ever released, and probably will be. The band strayed from their traditional hip-hop/rap and turned to a rock/alternative beat. Uh, the change was incredibly good. I never get tired of listening to this album; it's greatness never ceases to amaze me. Musically, awesome - though, probably not as good as \\"Nevermind's\\", but close. Lyrically, much better than Nirvana. Buy it, you won't regret it. A spectacular album with spectacular songs that should be played on secular radio stations nation-wide."},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally Amazing","review":"This is one of the best cd's of all time. dc talk mixes their music so well. From \\"So Help Me God\\" to \\"Mind's Eye\\" this cd rocks. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing!","review":"This group has made a major difference in my life. I had never heard of them until they came to my home town for a concert. My cousin made tapes of their music so I could know what to expect. I was amazed to see all those people with a love so deep. The entire place got quiet as we sang Awesome God. They have a great influence, and I hope that they touched as many people the same way as they touched me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still one of my favorites","review":"What a classic CD! After all this time This CD is still one of the best I can think of."},{"rating":"2","title":"Making it cool to be a Christian!","review":"DC Talk's \\"Jesus Freak\\" is probably one of the most influential albums to come out of Christian music. By crossing over and reaching out to audiences who haven't been blessed by Christian music, \\"Jesus Freak\\" mixes hip-hop, pop and alternative flavors to bring us an album that makes it cool to be Christian or better yet a \\"Jesus Freak.\\" Perhaps one of the best reasons to buy this album is for their rendition of Charlie Peacock's \\"In the Light.\\" It sure to have you singing along at the top of your lungs. An added bonus - Charlie joins the guys on the end of the song. This is a great album to buy for any teen struggling with their relationship wtih God or those who need to know God. The music alone with capture them and the lyrics will change them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rockin' songs, one hit after the other!","review":"Excellent songs, one hit following another. With the exception of \\"Mrs. Morgan\\" (which I really like, by the way), every single song on this CD has had radio play.Part rap, part soul, and all rock-n-roll, these are great songs, clever lyrics and an album that tells a story of racial tolerance, love and living the life."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Rocks!","review":"Dc Talk surprised everyone by coming out with a Rock cd after being a rap group for a long time. Every song on it will uplift your spirit. I recommend it to anyone who likes to rock hard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not an album just for the kids! This one talks to everyone!","review":"I'm an \\"over the hiller\\", in my 40's and I think this is one of the best albums out. These guys have such a unique concept of God and and a handle on the issues facing our youth today. \\"Colored People\\" is one of my favorites and their play on \\"HUE-Man race\\", as in the \\"colors of mankind\\" is extremely thought provoking. \\"Jesus Freak\\" really rocks, freak... meaning ardent enthusiast. These boys ARE ardent enthusiasts of God. Their Supernatural album is just as good. dcTalk gives the youth of today a music they can relate to and that carries a wonderful message."},{"rating":"2","title":"DC Talk Rocks!","review":"I have been a fan of DC Talk for a long time and I have always been impressed with the amount of talent they have.

Once you begin reading you are tempted to \\"rush through\\" to get to the end. I HIGHLY suggest following the recommendations and doing the lessons as they come to you. Even though I am only halfway through I have discovered that my skeptical mind is being set free. As a VERY SKEPTICAL person in this area, I have been very surprised at the results. I am also reading Out of Body Experiences \\"how to have them and what to expect\\" by Robert Peterson as well which I recommend a read before you go to sleep as then this puts into your subconscious the real possibilities.As for the many books I have read on the subject as part of my Psychology studies for school, this is one of the best, no...this is the BEST book on the subject and the How To is outstanding."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not an astral projection book.","review":"I think it is about the time, someone should find out this is a meditation book, but not an astral projection book.

Author admitted himself, he is doing meditations. Astral projection is not meditations, author obviously cannot tell the difference, and misled many of his followers. Author cannot see his own astral body, and does not believe in astral body, and does not believe in higher dimensions.Astral projection is a way to exit your soul from your human body, and 'NO'. ..you cannot project while you are standing nor working in the office and project the same time. The book is totally misleading.There are the actual astral projection books out there, awaiting you to explore. Then you will realize how unrealistic this book is."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little better than Astral Dynamics, but...","review":"Author is from Australia, they have different ways of day and night compare to the America, this could explain why Author has tendency of dragging the pages and making it extra long, but basically same words kept repeating.

Words included in this book are: cloudy, gloomy, make-believe, painting, scream, and busy.Still, for beginners with a little bit more experience it makes for nice practice. The story is simple, dealing with the fact that children can have fun regardless of the weather.Four Stars. [B-]. One sentence per page.

I was not so lucky. What the description doesn't tell you is that in order for this talkbox to work at all, you need a speaker head and cabinet, as the HT-1 lacks a built-in pre-amp. This, understandably, ruined my day. I assumed at most I would need an instrument and maybe a small amp. There are other talkboxes out there, like the Rocktron Banshee, that has a built in pre-amp, meaning all you need to use it is an instrument and speaker cable. I now have an HT-1 that I can't use and, because of whatever reason (the distributor won't respond to my refund request), can't refund... A great waste of no small amount of change.

I gave this book four stars because I thought it was humorous. Joshua had a very twisted personality. One minute he was furious and the next, he was as happy as a clown. After a great summer vacation, Joshua finds out he has to repeat third grade.

Pleasant SC's East Cooper Disco in 1985). It came out in 1983, one of the last good R&B albums on the edge of the \\"dark ages of Black music\\" when synthesizers and voice enhancers ruined the genre until very recent times. In either case, \\"Johey\\" and \\"Miracles\\" are really good ballads and show the breadth of young Stacey's talent. \\"Million Dollar Babe\\"'s beat sounds suspiciously like Hall and Oates' \\"Maneater,\\" but it's still a pretty good song. At the used price, it's well worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Help Wanted","review":"Diana Garcia displays a comic touch in this light, fun tale of a second chance at love. Rosa Osario wants to hire a housekeeper so that her two sons can be home over the summer while she works. There is no good candidate--until Brian Torres. Rosa never expected a man to respond to her ad and certainly not such a devastatingly attractive man. Brian also comes with three-year-old Gracie, his daughter. Gracie fits right in with the family, and Rosa feels that Brian fits, too. But she fears dating an employee. She is afraid that the kids will be hurt when he leaves. She fears that she will be hurt, too. But what if he doesn't want to leave? Diana Garcia has a gift for sprinkling comic scenes in among the tender ones, as Brian fights to break down the walls of his lady fair."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVELY","review":"This dragonfly teapot pairs perfectly with the gold trim butterfly teacup (available separately) but know that there are no dragonflies on this teapot--just butterflies, etc. I'm not disappointed since I love butterflies.

SHe blunders through telling about a young lady who is suffering after a boy friend's suicide and then celebrates the inappropriate relationship that the pedaphile track coach creates with her.We have young women making the assumption that an older guy is more mature but what they forget is that his lack of maturity is why he cannot date women his age, he has to go for wounded and weak younger girls. The problem is that the way this book celebrates the situation makes it seem okay.The chapter in which he tries to rape her is rough. She gets away too easily. This is not how the situation goes down in the real world. The author needs to worry less about making it seem okay and candy coating the issue - this is REAL and by writing it with a simple solution, it normalizes the issue and paints a false picture of a horrible reality. I hope that no one will read this without discussing reality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Darkness Before Dawn","review":"When I started reading this book it sucked me in right away, because it started talking aboutwhat a girl named Keisha was going throgh.

She was kind of upset, but she got over it. Then the next day one of Andy's friends went it his house and found Andy laying on the floor dead, blood all over and a gun in his hand.I really like this book because it was realistic and I can't wait to read some more of Sharon.

The book had way too many charicters to keep up with. It could have been better if Perry limited the amount of charicters in the book and get more action instead of the begining and the end.

I picked it up at B&N one day, started reading it on the way home, and proceeded to finish in 4 hours. Mr. Perry has a genius for writing; I especially enjoy his hyperbolic analogies(would bet ten years' pay against a toenail comes to mind) and he does a truly excellent job of developing the characters without becoming too sappy.

Before I read this book, I knew that Crownover's company had won the Baldridge award, and I had read other articles on some of the programs they adapted to do so. I largely expected this book to explain how they adapted quality principles in a small company to win that award. What I received was a somewhat brief, shallow treatment of the history of the company and the current president, and personal insights that seem rather topical. As compared to other business books I have read, or even compared to other \\"Personal journey\\" stories I have read, this book comes up short in the \\"useful material\\" department."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiration at its best!","review":"The inspiring true story of how a company rose from the doldrums of near bankruptcy to a level worthy of the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award.

These authors are spreading around alot of manure in the subtle hope that somethig beautiful will grow. When interviewed about the book Jack Larson, who played cub reporter Jimmy Olsen in the series, actually referred to the tome as Hollywood Kraptonite. While the book does paint a vivid picture of Hollywood in the 1950's, the conclusions drawn simply are not supported by the evidence. The simple truth of the matter is no one will ever know what really happened the evening of June 16, 1959. The principals are all dead, and the evidence destroyed. If the reader takes that into account and treats the book as a fictional account of Reeves' death, it is a quick read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The death of Superman","review":"An enlightening point of view about THE DEATH OF SUPERMAN. How true ,I do not know."},{"rating":"1","title":"No plausible solutions here","review":"If you are not familiar with George Reeves' life and death, this book is interesting and provides quite a bit of factual background. Even after this book, the question remains: did Superman die by his own hand or was Reeves murdered? The scenario the authors present for the \\"murder\\" of Superman is hardly plausible. They suggest that the hired hit-man entered Reeves' home, while there were people (at least 4, besides Reeves) in the house, and that his plan was to use Reeves' own Lugar to commit the crime. Why would the murderer risk entering the rather small home while people were up and about? How could the murderer be sure that the gun would be on the nightstand, or that it would be loaded, or that Reeves wouldn't get to it first? Superman may have been murdered, but the version presented by these authors still leaves the mystery unsolved."},{"rating":"1","title":"A repudiation of Hollywood Kryptonite","review":"I have spent nearly twenty years researching a biography of George Reeves. I am one of the people Hollywood Kryptonite is dedicated to. And though I admire the authors' other works and their ability to crank out a book on this subject in almost no time at all, I must repudiate virtually every claim they make as to the circumstances of George Reeves' death. Their conclusions are not borne out by the true evidence, and the evidence they use to support their conclusion is, at the most generous, questionable. My opinions do not matter; the only thing that matters is truth. And Hollywood Kryptonite does not present the truth about George Reeves' death"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very entertaining, but the final conclusion far-fetched","review":"It is always interesting to read a period piece on recent pop culture. Although I was a fan of the Superman show, I do not understand the cult-following that Reeves has achieved. His personal life was nothing like the character he portrayed, and its unfair to his memory that people try to portray him as a super-person. Whether you believe the book's conclusion or not, the life that Reeves led was probably typical 50's Hollywood, and he was a victim of those times."},{"rating":"2","title":"a real \\"warts and all\\" book that you'll either love or hate!","review":"Hollywood Krpyonite really fills in the background questions about such characters as Lenore Lemmon, Eddie Mannix, and Helen Bessolo.

HOwever, they are sending one half the size as a replacement until the design flaw is fixed. Hmmm, considering the other customer reps told us the larger pump, the one we bought and paid for with our own hard earned money, was being sent out 'that day' I won't hold my breath on this one.

I saw him in Houston on Meat's \\"Friends\\" tour in December 02, and this CD provides wonderful flashbacks to that show. You can hear the influence of Todd Rundgren and Jim Steinman. After that, the debate should be whether artists like Joan Jett, Ronnie Spector, and Celine Dion influenced him or he influenced them. This is the kind of music you can put on and close your eyes and just drift along with, or allow to become the background soundtrack as you go on with your life activities. To date, Kasim has been under-noticed, but for those who take the time to listen, he provides a listening experience extraordinaire."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet package deal.","review":"The anniversary special is just as great as I remember it!

The author brags about how much he made by buying such-and-such a book and selling it across town for three times as much. In one case (he refers to it twice, actually) he made enough on one book to take \\"a vacation to Europe.\\" If you love books, this is not for you.

Ellis is a fine and engaging writer, and I really enjoyed his attitude and respect for books. Alas, his book feels dated, mainly because the Internet and the recent recession forced the closing of so many used bookstores in my neck of the woods. The idea of making the rounds of used book stores, patiently looking for diamonds in the rough to trade up between storekeepers who specialize in one genre or another seems so romantic that it's from another age, one long ago. Still, I appreciated his discussion on what to look for in an old book (hint: condition, condition, condition) and how to care for old books. Those sections alone make Book Finds worth buying.

Kimber West, Lynn Thomas, Nadine Chanz, and Kelly Monaco all are sizzling. The others aren't bad either, even if not as hot. BUT, as far as Playboy videso go, you can expect the same old fast-paced editing to raise the annoyance factor to an extreme. As soon as you get a good glimpse of the model, they cut to another scene. The movement of the cameras and the costume changes are TOO MUCH. If only they cut out half of the editing, reduced the number of costumes, and lengthened a few of the scenes, this would be a 5-star video. And what's with all the shots that don't even show the model?Get it only if you like these particular models (which I do). Otherwise, perhaps a Penthouse video is better advised."},{"rating":"1","title":"Take a dramamine","review":"The girls are fine, so why don't I like this?

She's been working toward it for years, but all she gets is rejection. So she goes in another direction and auditions to be a backup singer in a band. The leader of the group is Quinn Scarborough. Neither one of them thinks much of the other initially, but they become band mates. They fight an inconvenient attraction for a long time, but they finally succumb to each other's charms. But Quinn knows he'll lose Mercedes as soon as she gets her big break. These are complex characters encased in a very funny story. Mercedes is a unique heroine that grows up through the course of the novel. At first, she is young, brash, and a bit arrogant, letting these qualities hide her vulnerability and insecurity. As she grows and matures, she endears herself to the reader. The secondary characters are marvelous too. For surprising depth in a small package. Pick up this 4 1/2 star book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"To Each His Own","review":"It is useful to note that an earlier edition of this excellent novel was published under the title \\"A Man's Blessing\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice and brief social commentary","review":"I'm a big fan of other Sicilian novels, especially Lampedusa's the Leopard and Riotta's Prince of the Clouds. The island's tragic history produces a rich backdrop for painting a nuanced set of characters and emotions.Sciascia's short novel is wholly Sicilian, centering around his anti-mafia frustrations. The characters are nicely sketched and the writing is brief and exciting. It's a short book that reads quickly and lively.I appreciated the story and its quick moving plot. It's a good book and the introduction is helpful for understanding it's context. At the end of the day, the work is more commentary on Sciascia's times than it is a complex wrought novel. I'm glad I read it, but I didn't find it as fulfilling as I thought I might. Look to the Leopard or the Prince of Clouds if you're looking for a full fledged novel. Otherwise, you'll be very pleased with this nice work."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT PURCHASE THE iAUDIO!!!","review":"Don't be fooled by the bells & whistles, the iAudio is the worst MP3 on the market!!!

Once the memory board falls out over the normal course of use, the device becomes inoperable and must be shipped back for repair. After returning the device once, it stalled again just 30 days later. The second time the repair dept hassled me for shipping costs and wanted another copy of the warranty info they had on file. Don't waste your time w/ this.

I made a mistake it was in I will always know what you did last summer for 20 years. But it doesn't matter, this is the same kind of movie with murders of teenagers with a lot of humor (involuntary humor). This movie was perhaps marvellous (for some people) when it was released, but in 2 or 3 years, I don't think that we will know what they did last summer. Don't worry !, you could enjoy at this time Friday the 13th part 20 with a similar plot. Evil never die !

All I have to say is, BORING! Same thing over and over! But with Scream, everything is changed. Scream isn't just a horror movie, it's also a spoof of the old slashers, like Halloween. Some parts are pretty intense, others funny (especially how goofy Dewey acts, or at the party). This time it's also fun to watch Neve Campbell [and some of] Drew Barrymore get chased around by the killer. This is a great DVD with great features. Scream is the best of it's kind."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's not funny","review":"Scream is very suspenseful and makes Scary Movie look like a chicken in a basement playing a styrophome piano.

They're all the same. It's always about a killer attacking a big brested chick can't act who runs upstairs instead of out the front door so she can get cornered. It's insulting.\\" Needless to say, that very same character does just that while being pursued by this films killer. But that's because SCREAM is making fun of all the overused (not to mention totally illogical) cliches of horror films, and this is what makes it so fun. It may not be possible to film a more horrifying scene than this films opening 10 mins.And as for the women in the film, yes, there is a blonde with a huge chest that gets knocked off here, but it's cool because it makes fun of about 2000 films with the exact same situation."},{"rating":"2","title":"A GREAT HORROR, SUSPENSE MOVIE!!!!!!!!","review":"I love this movie!!! It starts out with a murder, which you don't hardly see in horror movies. It puts you in suspense from start to finish. You don't know who done it untill the towards the end of the movie.

The first sequence taps a lot of raw nerves: prank calls, being home alone, scary guys in dark cloaks with spooky faces, etc. Later scenes of the killer flailing up the stairs after Neve Campbell are suitably chilling.\\"Scream\\" not only winks at slasher S.O.P., it adheres to it effectively--you can laugh at the fact that you're falling for all its tricks, but you fall for them nonetheless.Most disconcerting of all: seeing Matthew Lillard without Freddie Prinze Jr. anywhere nearby!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just another stupid teen slasher flick","review":"No big deal.

For those who are not aware, about 10 cuts were made (most obivously in the 'disembowelment' scene) to ensure an 'R' rating, now if you found Scream disturbing enough in the cut form, this looks like a decent-enough DVD, but personally I'm waiting for Miramax to release the *whole* movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is armageddon....","review":"Total trendy tripe from the WB. We get stupid TV actors that every brainwashed teenager loves, and we get a flick that causes 12 year old Nsync fans to come to horror movies. Scary Movies? BAH!

I used to have little respect for Craven, and after this, I have none. This film only promotes overrated Hollywood yuppy trite like The Exorcist or Halloween, acting like those are the only horror movies ever made. This is the beginning of the end of horror.

But it's really nearly impossible to get past the oh-so-hip \\"look at us; we're spoofing horror films\\" attitude which is amply in evidence throughout. It's not a total waste of time, but that doesn't mean it's worth seeing. And really, the best way to see it is on Friday night in a theatre with a bunch of screaming high school kids. THAT'S certainly an interesting cultural experience. And...be sure to avoid the sequel like a cholera epidemic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excuse me, did I miss something here?","review":"Iam sorry, but I really didn't get the point of this film. Was it meant to be scary? Was it meant to be at times funny? Well if it was to do either one or both, it fell extremly short. As a matter of fact, I really don't understand it period. The music.... horrible. The acting.......O.K. The dialogue.......primitive. The plot.......completely unsatisfying. And the biggest mystery of all is that people actually loved it. Mostly teenagers, which is understandable. The film is such a ridiculous attempt to revamp the horror genre. However, the movie could have been a lot better because it started out good but then became repititive and boring near the end. I guess I was expecting more but this film is so lame. Try out a better film I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER, which turns out to have one thing that Scream and its sequel does not. A PLOT WITH A FEW GOOD EFFECTIVE TWISTS AND TURNS THAT'S ACTUALLY SCARY!!! Read the book also."},{"rating":"1","title":"SCREAM WILL MAKE YOU WANT YOUR MONEY BACK","review":"SCREAM with NEVE CAMPBELL, DREW BARRYMORE and COURTNEY COX was a totally awful movie. There's a really lame plot to it all I mean you pretty much figure out who the killer's are early on, also there is too much emphysis on gory effects too which in my opinion was totally unecessary as well. My advice is too skip this movie and see Halloween instead which in my opnion was a horror classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"I never, ever get offended by a movie, yet Scream did it.","review":"Scream is a movie which, I must admit, is often rather funny, and has a nice cast of fresh new faces. However, this movie was not only completely unscary, but it has some of the worst sexism and violence against women that I've seen in movies in a LONG time. The references to other horror movies feel more like rip-off than homage. And we can all blame this film for the next wave of pseudo-\\"hip\\" teen slasher horror flicks which will be coming out for the next several years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Packaging issues!","review":"Worst packaging I have ever seen.

There are hints about Halloween, Elm Street etc which are quite fun to spot if you're into that. But the story on THIS one is very thin, the acting humdrum, and the whole experience rather pointless and boring unless you're a 14-year-old horror fan.Sorry to be so negative, but I had trouble staying awake. Not at all scary."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a Scream!","review":"If you have never seen this movie you have missed a good one. Though it is not especially \\"scary\\" it is definitely addictive, bloody, captivating, fun, and innovative. I believe that is why the movie has been such a classic for so long.

If people are tired of waiting for the U.S. release of the blu ray, this set is great. I have read other reviews and the only complaint people have is of the packaging, but there is a solution. The get scream 2 and 3 out of the packaging, there are two prongs at the bottom of scream 2, just push them down and break them, and the movie comes right out. There are two prongs at the bottom of scream 3 also, and you can do the same with that movie. There are no special features, but I have enough special features from the regular dvd editions of the movies, so that doesn't bother me. So, I recommend that if you are a scream fan, then you must buy this set."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic for Any '80s Baby!","review":"Wes Craven's masterpiece is just as good as I remember from my Jr High days!

Great performances by Neve Campbell, Courteney Cox, David Aqruette and Drew Barrymore. I highly recommend this movie, it's a real scream!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good movie, bad presentation","review":"Just an FYI about this VOD version of \\"Scream\\": it's not in the movie's original aspect ratio (2.35:1). To some, this might not matter a bit, but if I'm going to pay money for a VOD, I'd prefer it be the same aspect ratio as the DVD. And if it isn't, it should be labeled as such.(Two stars for the presentation. The movie itself? It's great.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Blend of Horror and Comedy","review":"I really liked this movie. It mixed laughs with murder really well. It is about a teen, Sidney(Neve Campbell), who's mother was murdered and she is still having trouble deciding if the man jailed for the murder really is guilty or not. Soon, she is put under more pressure and trauma when tons of people in her town are getting murdered by a man in a Halloween mask, and when the killer also pursues her. It's quite an entertaining movie, and a good scare. If you haven't seen it, you're missing out."},{"rating":"2","title":"it needs more stars, I give it a 100","review":"I absolutly love this movie! this movie sceared me half to death the first time that I saw it.When my sister was home from college this summer, we used to watch it every night, sometimes as much as 3 times a day. I know the movie so well that me, my bestfriend, and my sister all memorized the words and could brobably tell the whole movie, begining to end withought any hesitation.I defintely feel that this is one of the great horror movies ever made, and I recomend it to anyone who can handle the scare and does not mind a little or a lot of blood.I just cant express in words how much that I love this movie, and have it be enough. you just have to see it to believe it.

Lots of scares, laughs, suspense, in-jokes for horror film buffs, red herrings, and a few cameos (Linda Blair, Henry Winkler, and Wes Craven) as well as memorable characters.

Anyone scared by this movie should go out and see a real horror movie like the original Psycho. But this movie's so funny it earns 2 stars. We've got the principal who keeps scaring himself in his office before he is killed, we have the stupid blonde bimbo w/ the fake... being stupid enough NOT to run away from the masked man in black, and overall all of the poeple who die in this movie are pretty idiotic. How much of it is a good idea to chat with a guy who's asking you about scary movies, honestly?

The main reason I didn't like it was due to the pathetic attempt at humor. The scene where he says his mom is going to kill him because he has been murdering people is not funny! I thought the actors did a good job, but the writing was not to be applauded. Humor needs to be more witty, less pathetic. Horrow alone though, the movie could be given a 4."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's great it will have you on the edge of your seats","review":"What is there to say about this movie other than it rocks. everyone is going to try and guess the killer and unless youve seen it you wont know who it is.

The worst thing about this movie is the flood of imitations and sequels it will/has spawned.Anyone who thinks that this movie has suspense should rent some Alfred Hitchcock flicks like 'Rear Window' or 'notorious'.

It's not scary one bit, and some of the characters are so annoying you'll actually be cheering for them to meet their bloody demises. All that aside though, Craven does manage to put some ingenuity into the film by attempting to deconstruct the teen-horror genre outline and instilling some of the main characters with actual intelligence, something in the later installments of film series' like Nightmare on Elm Street and Friday the 13th was lacking. Scream has a few quick moments of brilliance here and there, but all together it's pretty much predictable mainstream shlock horror. The second film managed to be better than the first, but the third and final (?) film was the worst of the series. The cast features Neve Campbell, Courtney Cox, David Arquette, Skeet Ulrich, Drew Barrymore, Jamie Kennedy, Matthew Lillard, Rose McGowan, and Henry Winkler."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheaziest slasher film I have seen.","review":"The things I didn't like about it is the screneplay. The story was corny. I was surprised of all the people that got scared watching this, because it is not meant to be scary instead it is meant to be entertaining for movie gorehounds. The second scream is a little better. I was 16 when this came out, and it didn't scare me, because it is not meant to be scary.The best slasher films I have seen that are well written are the Halloween movies accept part 3, the Friday the 13th movies accept part 6, Maniac, The elm street movies, the Maniac Cop movies, and Martin."},{"rating":"2","title":"I must say it was good","review":"It was kind of more than your run-of-the-mill slasher movie.....oh wait no it wasn't.

This movie was good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't watch it alone","review":"You'll hear people say that Scream is not scary. Don't listen. It's chillingly scary. True the killer is an accident-prone teen making him more stupid when the chase comes, but the mask is really creepy and the phone calls make you wanna stop the movie then and there they are so scary. Be careful when you see it, though, because the ending is very dark and gory. Even worse because TEENAGERS are doing this.

It is the hightl;ey original story of a small California town brought to the edge by a series of grusome and mysterious deaths. A group of horror film fans find themselves in the center of the mess as their friends and classmates fall victm to a masked killer. Yes it may sound familair (Halloween, Friday the 13th etc.) but it its one, its more realistic then the otehrs and so clever and hip. As a young girl named Cidy Presscott finds hereself connected to the gruseome killer she stops at nothing to survive yet eventually find whosebehind the mask. Teh opening sceing with Drew Berrymoore is possibley one of cinema's most feverishly scary and horrific moments. Due to Scary Movie and otehr parodies they scence has lost its full 100% scare but it'll never lose all of it. Even a die hard hoor buff can't denie how scary movies.

It's full of trivia and self-aware clichés as well as some genuine thrills and a well-planned surprise at the end. The whole cast is very good, but Matthew Lillard as an obnoxious high school boy and David Arquette as a deputy sheriff stand out.

When she got out of the house, she should have ran like her life depended on it, which it did. But she didn't fight back and she got gutted.

I think it's time Wes Craven does away with boring, predictable conventions and gives us a real scare."},{"rating":"1","title":"I screamed but not for the movie.","review":"This movie is very representative of the use of gratuitous violence by Hollywood for targeting people with a commercial product. Wes Craven himself said that cinema was another way for making money. I agree with him, but in that case, does it mean that cinema became useless as a medium of creativity and imagination? Teenagers are in a age where contestation is a way of asserting their personality, this is normal, but Hollywood producers are aware of that fact and insert gratuitous violence in that contestation because they can make a lot of money. This commercial process leads to movie like Scream where there is no plot, no acting, but a lot of gore and violence used as meaning of expression. The characters in that movie are very weak, are they really representative of the young generation of the United-States ? or are they only caricatures of young people trying to convince the real young people that in the USA the life of a student is so delicious and violent ?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A little lame and over done.","review":"I don't what they were trying to get at with this movie, i guess putting Drew Barrymore in the movie was trying to grab a certain audiance. All I gotta say is she was dead in like the first 20 minutes which doesn't seem like she was really a main character at all. The only reason I would have wanted to see the secound one was because she was in it, but, OPPS! shes dead before it starts. The plot was see through and the leads of \\"who done it\\" were really obvisious. You had to know that it was more then one person because everyone else was placed somewher else. I think this move was made with the money in mind, not real horror. 2 and 3 are just an insult to your intelligents."},{"rating":"2","title":"About a pshyco killer.","review":"Well for starters, drew berrymore is making popcorn and waiting for her boyfriend steve to come over and watch a scary movie when she recieves a phone call from a sicko, he asks her questions and then turns it into a test, if she gets it right steve can live because the caller has him hostage, and if she gets it wrong, well, bye-bye steve.

Unfortunately, it\`s not that great either, presenting a decent plot with a couple of convincing twists.

At least, \\"Scream\\" is still better than most of its clones that appeared everywhere during the late nineties, offering a competent and watchable entertainment.

I rank this movie out of 1-10 with a one."},{"rating":"1","title":"whisper","review":"not only one of the stupidest horror movies ever made, but also it is the film that ushered in hordes of other mindless horror flicks that have brainwashed the \\"teen\\" crowd. i remember when wes craven had excellent ideas. ten years ago this film, and all of it's ilk would have been straight to video or late night USA movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scary, Clever, and Fun!","review":"I found Scream to be an enjoyable spoof on the horror genre. In Scream, we meet Sydney, a young girl who is being hunted down by a horror-movie obsessed killer. Keeping the \\"rules of a horror movie\\" in mind, Sydney is determined to keep away from this psycho-killer, but can she? With clever dialogue and thrilling sequences, Scream is a winner, MUCH better than Wes Craven's next movie, Wishmaster...ugh, don't let me get started on that one! So my advice to you is to get this funny, scary, and highly likeable flick from the creator of \\"A Nightmare on Elm Street.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"What a shame","review":"Scream was a great movie, probably the best documentary on other horror movies ever made...what's that you say? It's not a ducumentary about other (better) horror movies? Oh. Well then it was pretty lame. When a movie spends more time quoting other (better) horror movies than making its own lines, you know something is wrong. Aside from all the referenced copies of other movies (the Halloween music plays during the end in the house, for example) this one also copies about every horror movie ever made without saying so. The beginning is a huge rip-off of \\"When A Stranger Calls\\", which was in part of a rip-off of \\"Black Christmas\\". The characters are card-board cut-outs of every kind of clique imaginable and have no real qualities. Yes, the cast was very good, and there are a couple suspenseful moments, I just with those moments were the movies own, and not taken from others."},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought the ending sucked","review":"The video had me terrified. It was a good concept because the killer really scared you when he talked on the phone to his victims. The mask was scary. Even though he looked like he was in a dress at times. It was very frightening up until the end. Which really really REALLY sucked. It was the stupidest ending I have ever seen, just like in Scream 2, but they might have written it that way, to make people realize that it was just a movie. It was still scary up until the end though."},{"rating":"1","title":"A SO-SO HORROR FLICK IS ALL I HAVE TO SAY ABOUT SCREAM","review":"I saw SCREAM and I expected to be scared out of my seat when I saw the previews but when I finally did see it I was dissappointed and here's why. I found that NEVE CAMPBELL was a little shallow in her role who she plays I'm not giving away just watch and see what I mean. I felt she didn't compare to JAMIE LEE CURTIS in HALLOWEEN or SISSY SPACEK in CARRIE now they did a great job with thier roles which I felt NEVE often didn't she seemed to me almost bored and it showed in her performance. Also the supporting cast left something to be desired too. They seemed to me to be too plastic and dull espically COURTNEY COX and DAVID ARQUETTE they did'nt make want to rally behind them at all. Also I felt you saw who the killer was too early in the film and that in my opnion took a lot away from the suspense that this film could've had. So all in all I wish I could recommend SCREAM but I find I can not."},{"rating":"1","title":"blondie14_88@hotmail.com","review":"I would have to say that scream is one of the stupidest movies I have ever seen.

After finally renting it, I wanted my money back. There really isn't any point to the movie, accept that this pyscho goes around killing every teenager. The only part worth seeing is when Henry Winkler, (\\"Fonzie from HAPPY DAYS kids), plays the principle. He eventually falls victim to the killer as well, and I'm surprised he didn't just cut up the black sheet with the scissors and tell the kid to go to class. This movie is another one of those that is aimed at teengers. Well, I was a teenager at the time, and I hated it.

Granted, I believe Madalyn was a complicated and sometimes difficult woman, but it seemed that Seaman could not find one single attribute to praise in the woman. I found myself researching the author to see if I could find her religious affiliations.

No games on it if you care for that thing just sort of putting it out there as this is a review for the entire product. The only problems that I have had with the said phone is that occasionally you might lose a call or the volume isn't high enough on a call even a full volume.

Im just now starting out with my first serger and i can honestly say i absolutely LOVE it. and wish i would have done this sooner. its true at first they can seem a little daunting, but when you use one for the first time youll wonder how you ever got along without one and see your creations go from amateur to professional looking just like that. i love love love my new serger. no regrets :D"},{"rating":"2","title":"Haven't used a serger since the 7th grade","review":"My husband got this serger for my birthday. I must admit that sergers intimidate me. I'm not a professional seamstress but do okay when it comes to making the simpler things. I will say that this particular model does come with an instructional dvd for a different serger. I watched it anyway and the instrustions were perfectly fine for this one. I found the serge easy to thread as it has detailed instructions in the manual and pictures on the serger itself. I LOVE this serger. I would recommend this model to anyone looking for a serger."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sergers are time-savers","review":"This serger replaces one lost in Hurricane Katrina. It is not the most expensive one you can buy, but it definately has most of the features of the high end sergers (well it isn't self-threading) and works smoothly and easily. The cutter works well, and the attachable container that catches the cut edges is in a good position - in front - so that edges do not fall to the floor. It detaches for emptying with ease.The price made it a real bargain, and free shipping made it even better. I would recommend it to anyone who sews - especially with handwoven fabric. Its features are really time-savers."},{"rating":"2","title":"SO EASY TO THREAD","review":"I heard a lot about the hard time people had to thread serger machine. This one is very easy.

So my issues with this serger has got nothing to do with incorrect threading or tensions. This serger worked just fine for 2 -3 months and now i cant get to serge even 10 inches of length without having to re-thread.I am never going to buy machines from Amazon even if they are 10% cheaper on Amazon. In the last 2 years, my serger, sewing machine, 2 cameras and printer all have had problems although I bought them all \\"new\\" and had seen good product reviews.

Boy was I mistaken. After I watched the demo (which ran fine on my Vista x64) and read the instructions I set it up and tried it out. The first thing I noticed was that the machine's motor ran rough and felt and sounded really poorly made. That is a big strike for me. The next thing that I noticed was how awkward the placement of the controls were. They were not intuitive to use if you have ever used a regular sewing machine before. In a nutshell, I didn't like the feel of it, I didn't enjoy using it and I didn't think it would last very long before breaking down. I returned it the same day I received it. I know this is a budget serger but even so I was quite underwhelmed and will be looking for a different brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazon disappointment","review":"I have received this machine and now don't know what to do since the CD was not enclosed.

It was not compatible with my Windows Vista and when I asked Brother for a copy of the free instructional Video Tape they advertised in my packaging materials, I was told that it was only a promotional item and was no longer available. They gave me a 900 number to contact for help. I will not call a 900 number as you must pay a large sum to use those numbers. Therefore, I have not been able to use my machine at this time. I am having my first grandchild soon and was hoping to make some baby things utilizing the serger. Looks like I'm stuck with a machine I cannot use.I am not happy."},{"rating":"2","title":"No need for fear","review":"I'd always heard that sergers were hard to learn, and hard to thread - but once I got over my initial fear, it just wasn't so. Threading is mostly self explanatory, though it's hard to distinguish blue from green for the looper paths.Experience is the best teacher. Experiment with scrap fabric, using the same stitches, thread and tensions as for your finished product. You'll soon love what this serger can do!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great quality, easy to use.","review":"My wife loved this serger. It is very well made, and does any job she's tasked it with thus far.

I couldn't beat the price or reviews. The reviews are right. It arrives threaded w/ color thread to show you how to thread it. I re-threaded the machine and it worked perfect first time. Very easy to thread. I have used it now for a few weeks and my projects look so much more professional! Just love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke, now it clunks","review":"I purchased this model in 2008, and have used it occasionally. It was having problems this year, so I took it in to a local shop, who charged me a hundred dollars to fix it, but told me this model just plain wears out faster and that it was a poor purchase. Seems like it would be worth it to spend twice the price on a better serger (NOT a Brother) and maintain it half as often. I am very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Tool","review":"This machine is a great addition to the sewing room. If you are a sewing person that makes active wear or expensive garments, this a machine to have side by side with your sewing machine. It makes seams and hems so perfect.

I was intimidated by it at first. But now that I've learned to thread the monster it's not so bad. Took me about 6 tries to get everything in there correctly, I would forget one step and have to start over, but once I got it threaded it worked great. So then I unthreaded and rethreaded 4 or 5 more times and it got easier each time.It sews great and is easy to operate. I would recommed this serger."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent machine for the money","review":"I have been an avid sewer for years. I have always balked at the thought of spending the money for a serger. After reading the reviews here, I decided to take a chance on this machine, and have been delighted. It is truly easy to thread (for a serger). The directions are concise and the thread path is shown on the machine.Recently I was in a shop selling a well known, high end serger. I asked for a demo of the threading on it. This $600 dollar machine was a nightmare to thread compared to this simple Brother. It does not have all the bells and whistles of more expensive machines, but it does what it advertises very well. I feel it was an excellent investment for the price. I gave it a five star recommendation on the capabilities of this machine. I am sure there are more expensive machines that may do more, but for the cost, this is a 5 star purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"My very own first serger","review":"I have used in the past an singer serger.

Easy to use.","review":"I've always wanted one of these for a long time. After reading the reviews about this model on Amazon, I felt confident enough to take the plunge. I received it on time as promised. It was all set up and ready to go straight out of the box. I was a little frustrated the first time I had to change threads, but my hubby talked me through it and now I can do it myself. I can see it's important to clean/brush out the threading/cutting area after or before each use, which is no problem to do. Brother is an excellent brand with a good reputation, and I'm glad I bought this model."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fantastic product for the price","review":"This is my first attempt to use a serger.

She point out all the potential pitfalls."},{"rating":"2","title":"quiet little worker","review":"This serger is a little quieter than my other machines. Easy to thread, non-standard levers and knobs, but they work great and it's easy to get used to.

However, when I took it out straight from the box and turned it on, the serger light came on but when I pressed the serger foot to serge, nothing happened.

I would highly recommend this product to those who are new to Serging. I was able to use it right out of the box after reading the instructions and watching the video with no frustrations. The price was very affordable for all the machine offers, and I doubt I will ever be a Master Sewer to the point where I will need to replace this machine with one that offers more options."},{"rating":"2","title":"great product","review":"I love my new Brother serger!

I figured this would be a good starter machine since it was offered under $200. It arrived quickly, and I tired to thread it by tying the new thread onto the existing pre threaded spools. It didn't work, and I had to rethread. That was not a big deal as this machine is color coded, and for the most part simple.Working on the first project this machine broke 3 needles, and I was sewing a very thin knit fabric. Thread on it breaks constantly, and the thread tensions are all over the place.

I just got it a few days ago and whipped out 28 superhero capes for my son's bday-no problem.

If you wish to pass this test I would strongly recommend purchasing another study tool."},{"rating":"2","title":"At last - perfect for AFTER the test too!","review":"I wish more people would follow the example of this book and write things that I could use AFTER the test - rather than just writing to the objectives and leaving me cold afterwards. This book is relatively short, and covers all the exam objectives. But better than that, I can keep it to hand for use afterwards!I really liked the TCP/IP stuff. I took the TCP/IP MCSE exam a month ago, and this book had enough information to pass that exam - all in less than a 100 pages! I can't imagine you'd fail the Microsoft Networking Essentials either! The way I look at it - this book is one you can use for three tests. Well written, lots of pictures. Great!Well - on to another test. Recommend this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A work of Art","review":"Truly a work of art. This book contained everything I found on the exam and put it in a really well organized and easy to read manner. There was a awful lot covered but it held my interest which is more than I can say about most computer books. The exam covered a lot of stuff too but I didn't find anything that wasn't in the book. I passed with time to spare. Pay attention to the practice questions, you see a lot of them on the exam. If you wan't to pass , this is a can't miss."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Certification Book I've Read","review":"This turned out to be a really great book. At first I was a little intimidated because I'm a little knew and it seemed packed with a lot of information, but it reads smooth and I started to understand a lot more concepts that I didn't get in the Network Essentials book I've read. Now I'm finished and I really think I've gained a lot of knowledge and confidence. This is a real good book if you plan to take the test or just learn about computer networks. BTW:I passed the test with time left over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, Well Written, and Error Free","review":"I was a hoping I didn't need to read this big book to pass the test. But things were explained well and it was easy to understand. I actually enjoyed reading the whole thing. This book turned out to be one of the best computer books I've read and the best one on a cert. I haven't liked too many certification books, they seem shallow. This one had depth and a lot of good hands on tips. You can tell the writers have been out in the field. Buy it for the info. When you're done with the test this is the book to use on the job. Thumbs up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book, the only one you need to pass the test!!!","review":"this was the only book that i used to study for netowork + test. i also used practice tests from exam cram series, which i also recommend. however, this is really the only book you need. it has a lot of usefull information which might be useful in the future, when you are, for example troubleshooting a network. so don;t get rid of this book, after you pass the test, because, if you plan to work in networking, this book might come in handy again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Book to Add to Your Collection","review":"This book was very well written and was my primary study tool.

Today, 2009, almost every single vision she spoke about has come true. So I figure, if what she has spoken about has come to fruition, I expect every thing else she prophesied about will be coming true in time. It's time people get their act together and find their inner spirituality and get ready for the transition into a higher spiritual frequency. Thank you No-Eyes for your wisdom and your willingness to share and prepare us. See you in the afterlife!"},{"rating":"2","title":"More relevant today","review":"Phoenix Rising written by Mary Summer Rain as dictated by 'NoEyes' is more relevant today than when first written years ago.

This could have been written in 5 pages to get the information across. But it was stretched out in novel form over 150 pages.

In a later book she included more information that was not included in this book - such as the magnetic shifting of the poles."},{"rating":"2","title":"this book is not fiction","review":"in the back of the book there is a list of the things that are supposed to occur. have you ever noticed that an awful lot of those things seem to be occuring?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Phoenix Rising","review":"This book will have you quivering at the thought of destruction of life as we know it.

This book will make you stop and think about the way our world is changing and the predictions of coming events."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Book, bad author.","review":"Mary Summer Rain hasn't written anything that hasn't been said by about a zillion other new age authors. However, Summer Rain does bring a whole new level of creepiness and general feeling of mental instability to an otherwise repetitive and plagaristic genre. Seriously folks, this woman gives me the creeps. In several places in this book she's shown: irrational hatred and violent urges, smug superiority over those who don't share her views, and an utterly disturbing fawing posessiveness for this No-Eyes. This book isn't worth reading...I'd suggest buying a book about earth changes and doom from someone less mentally unstable.The only reason I gave this book a star is because Amazon doesn't allow you to NOT give stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vision of Death","review":"I have contemplated deeply about this book since my reading it several times years ago. None of the \\"prophecy\\" ideas in this book are new, all have been taken from the Book of Revelations in the bible and extrapolated on. This book twists the end time events into a more glorious representation than what they truly are. There is no mention of the true cause of these events nor the real outcome. This is not the book to be reading if you really want to understand the devestation and restoration that is coming. By the way, if you do read it... you'll love the 'prophetic wisdom' from Mary that GM will be the only car manufacture you should buy from."},{"rating":"2","title":"Refreshing!","review":"This album brings a much needed harder edge to swing style/rockabilly music. Swing tunes, slow tunes and surf tunes are explored in this work but the band is also not afraid to rock! These guys are definitely artists.

The author, an Englishman, apparently tries to be \\"popular\\" in America by being clinically dirty. His \\"shocking\\" revelations have no references, and he seems to be a grand master of the \\"he undoubtedly said...\\" school of research. The book certainly does not belong in a family library, and as far as university libraries go, it has no scholarly value."},{"rating":"1","title":"Howard Hughes' \\"Secret\\" Life","review":"Of all the Howard Hughes biographies that are currently available to tie in with the recent film, this is easily the worst. The book is filled with hearsay and speculation on the author's part and attempts to bring his subject down and make him less than human. Higham attempts to get into Hughes' head in order to put a 'dirty' spin on just about everything. Some of the claims the author makes concerning Hughes' sexuality are incorrect-- the FBI report on Hughes never found evidence of homosexuality-- and some of the 'stories,' such as his relationship with Cary Grant, are truly ridiculous in how they are described and are insulting to both Hughes and Grant. This is a revisionist biography that does more harm than good; its sole purpose is to titilate rather than inform us with the facts."},{"rating":"1","title":"If it was his \\"Secret Life\\" it should have stayed that way","review":"This book is not really a biography of Hughes, but instead appears to be an expanded tabloid article that alleges that Hughes had sexual relations with just about everyone, and the burning question is--- \\"WHO CARES?\\"It also has a very enlightening section on Hughes' problem with irregularity.This book is worthless garbage. It's not even a good wheel chock."},{"rating":"2","title":"In recongition of the singer...","review":"I know that as a Garth fan, I am not quite objective in my opinions, but I must tell you, I bought this record wondering what change may be made by the writers and co-writers of Garth's hits. I must tell you, I was surprised I liked the CD very much, but think about it as a moment to share with friends and maybe a small bar where you are sharing memories with close friends, ofcourse is not Garth, ofcourse is not a lot of production, but simply listening to \\"Wolves\\" worth the record.

I pointed out the poor quality to the seller and they wrote me an email blaming the quality on their Asian supplier and offered to send me documentation for a refund but I never received the refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another useless title","review":"There isn't anything new, innovative or interesting in this book. There are glaring errors bordering on misinformation throughout (don't get me started on the 'astrology' and backwards logic around it) and the actual magical sections are reproductions with the author's own attempts at poetry tacked on.

But bought it anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"Plus a multitude","review":"Using \\"Pet Sounds\\" and \\"Summerteeth\\" as sonic templates, this latest assemblage of the Minus 5 has constructed a monument to baroque pop. Every melody is adorned with all the bells and whistles a modern recording studio could offer. And really, I do mean bells and whistles, as well as tambourines, shakers, Moroccan horns, kalimbas, marimbas, and crotales (no idea what that last thingee is, but it's right there in the liner notes). In short, \\"Down With Wilco\\" is 13 melancholy pop songs hung with enough audio ornaments to either rule your world or leave you cold, depending entirely on your predisposition towards ostentation. It helps that Minus 5 mainmen Scott McCaughey (the Young Fresh Fellows) and Peter Buck (REM) have surrounded themselves with \\"A\\" level talent like Ken Stringfellow (the Posies), Sean O'Hagan (the High Llamas), and the members of Wilco (Wilc... er, nevermind), and if that doesn't account for a \\"supergroup\\" then I'll torch my Blind Faith dog collar."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great music!","review":"Being a longtime fan of Wilco, but not knowing much about the Minus 5, I was intrigued with this release by the combined band members. The album opener, \\"Days of Wine and Booze\\" is simple and melodic. It is reminiscent of Pink Floyd's \\"On the Turning Away\\". The album continues with power pop gems that feel influenced by a wide range of artists such as The Beach Boys, The Beatles, The Byrds, and Harry Chapin (yes, Harry Chapin). With Minus 5's Scott McCaughey on vocals (with additional vocal help from Wilco's Jeff Tweedy) the supergroup covers a wide range of musical styles. From the spacey Grandaddy-ish gems \\"What I Don't Believe\\" and \\"View from Below\\" to possibly one of the greatest 60's pop gems ever recorded, \\"Life Left Him There\\" (albeit 35 years late), this album does not disappoint. Only several less than spectacular tunes keep this one from five stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"do-wop-do-wop, oh no, yeah!","review":"this album is the beatles put through the grunge grinder of disillusionment with 50s rock'n roll playing shoe-lah-lah do-wop-do-wop, in spite of the prospect of nuclear armagedon. In this melodic maligned maelstrom, musical molasses comes out on the other side with a cheery bitter sweet smile of trite lyrical contradictions, sluiced together with clichéd tonescapes which pleasantly border on cacophony, leaving the listener with the pleasure of dissonance and yet the paul mccarteny feeling that everything is really going to be alright somehow, oh yeah..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good survey of McKay's work....","review":"I first read \\"If We Must Die\\" in a Literature class in college. Not knowing anything about Claude McKay, I saw this asan almost \\"athletic\\" speech from a coach to his team. It had that kind of a feel to it. In doing some research, I found that McKay was speaking of the injustice African Americans felt in America in the early 1900s.This collection is not just the selections about racial injustice. There are also poems about his home in Jamaica, his job in the constabulary force there, and love. Through these diverse poems, you will get a better picture of McKay and his time. There is not a lot of biographical information listed in this book.I would recommend the book. The first few poems are written in a Jamaican dialect which may make it difficult to read the first time. I found that reading it out loud opened the meaning and pronunciation for me. It is a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest performance of perhaps the greatest symphony of all time","review":"To those in the know, Anton Bruckner's symphonies are among the very greatest, rivaled only by those of Beethoven, Mahler and Sibelius. And the 8th is in my opinion his greatest (he never completed his 9th, which maybe woud have taken 1st honors instead). Now, this recording is an ADD, made I think back in the late '60's but it is digitally remastered. There are better-sounding performances out there, but Bruckner demands the very apex of sensitivity and understanding of what he is trying to say, and Eugen Jochum has never been excelled in that dept. And directing the Berlin Phil., probably the finest orchestra in the world, doesn't hurt either.I know there are later recordings with him and a couple of other very fine orchestras. I haven't heard them. I'm sure the fidelity is better and the orchestras wholly capable. But I had this performance on an LP and I missed it terribly. I'm veery happy to have it on a CD, and so would you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible performance","review":"Jochum\`s Bruckner Symphony No. 8 from 1964 is stunningly beautiful.Not a single flaw in this 75 minute musicfest.

He also quotes, \\"What if he had not lost The True Faith? How would history then have read?\\" Why not ask What if he had lived and succeeded? Maybe there would have been no Christian Crusades, no Inquisition, etc.Really, if you want to more about Julian and his attempt to restore balance to the way people worshiped in the 4th Century, CE, try Gore Vidal's \\"Julian\\" and/or Adrian Murdoch's \\"The Last Pagan: Julian the Apostate and the Death of the World\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Christmas Gift.","review":"I gave this as a gift to my mother for Christmas and she fell head over heels when she opened it!

However, it is well deserving of a place within the collection of anyone who listens to the likes of Steve Earle, Townes Van Zandt, Doug Sahm, Uncle Tupelo or any of their spinoff groups. The title track asks the questions :What's God got against rednecks? How come tornadoes love trailer parks? - A question I've certainly asked myself in the past. Ballads, all out rockers (Burnin' Down), country crooners - there's something for any alt country fan on this CD. Curtis Burch (Newgrass Revival) adds tasty dobro and slide throughout.

When we cook recipes out of this book we know we are eating good. Like with most cookbooks, I've picked a few favorites and pretty much ignore most of the book.

This is the perfect cookbook for busy, working families who want to be assured they are serving up healthy meals.

It took me a long time to finish this, and I didn't get any sense of completion when I did.Although this is supposed to be book two of a four-part book, I think perhaps Crowley has gotten a little bit too ambitious. This book has the speed of a snail, though given its weight the inertia of it along with that of \\"Aegypt\\" may cause the series to move more quickly towards the end!Crowley is such a master wordsmith that I can't give any of his books a BAD rating, but I certainly don't see this as one of his best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing sequel to Aegypt reveals insufficiency of magi","review":"I loved Crowley's Aegypt, a wonderful compound of life, art, and magic (specifically hermeticism.) Although written in Crowley's beautiful style this novel was a severe disappointment. The lyrical life-affirming optimism of the preceding novel was wholly absent, replaced by a dismal elegaic pessimism. The book's structure is kind of clumsy too - it's a loosely related set of chunks of stories which while interesting in themselves don't flow well together. It's interesting to speculate that the novel's grim tone is related to the murder of Crowley's friend and professor of hermetic studies Ioan Culianu, who was assassinated, evidentally for political reasons, in 1991. Giordano Bruno, the Renaissance hermeticist, is a principal subject of Crowley's novel and his life bears parallels to Culianu's."},{"rating":"2","title":"New information on the tribulation period","review":"I read the galley proofs on this book and was impressed by the information and knowledge brought forth by this book. I have been close to the author and have watched the progress of the book over twenty years. It is really worth reading and would provide a great comfort to the loved ones of those who don't choose Christ before the Rapture of the Church. In the days when the Bible itself may be banned, this book would provide at the least, an overview of the events the Bible tells will happen to those left behind. The reason I didn't give it a five is because I would have liked more information, but the writer told me that the size of the book was intentional because of the nature of a handbook. If purchased now and read along with the Bible, it should be a valuable book in the coming days and years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointed","review":"I think the pendant is absolutely beautiful but I also agree that is does not sit properly on the neck because of the large back on it for the chain.

I took it to a jeweler who said they had never seen anything crafted with such a poor design! Such a beautiful necklace, it was to match earrings I gave to my sister. Now they won't even take it back because it was a Christmas gift, but I bought it so early that I wasn't able to return it within the 30 days required. What a HUGE waste of money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at all like the picture","review":"The celtic knot on the pendant is not as delicate as it looks in the picture, it's more pointy and skinny and I prefer the one in the picture better. The pendant itself doesn't lay flat at all due to an over-sized loop on the back of the product. Everything comes off as rather cheap and not worth the cost at all. Don't be fooled by the picture! (However, the topaz is lovely and catches the light.)Edit: I snipped half of the loop on the back with a nail clipper and flattened it- now it works fine. A more delicate chain would suit the necklace better but at least now the necklace is wearable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Celtic Knot and Topaz Pendant","review":"This pendant is well made and is large enough that is shows up well when worn.

I'm an elderly 39 year-old who grew up on Celtic Frost & Slayer, but, admittedly, not very big on the modern black metal scene other than some laughable videos on youtube. Needless to say, I was expecting the worse (especially from the cheesy cover image), so when I popped this into my truck's CD player, I was pleasantly surprised that it was actually a damn good thrash/death metal album and lacked a lot of excessive symphonic goofy-ness of some of the bands in the genre. Plus, it seems these guys appear to steer away from being overtly satanic & just stick to \\"we're-vikings-kicking-ass-in-a-snowstorm\\" kind of themes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stop using that stupid make-up!","review":"This is the second best black metal album I have ever heard (the other one is Lord Belial's Enter the Moonlight Gate). It's an exquisite piece of work and all that. I don't feel like repeting what has already been said about this album, so I'll jump on the issue that bugs me so much. Why on earth do they have to use that cartoonish make-up? The whole thing about the make-up and the fake medieval weapons is nothing but ludicrous. And this is a shame, because they can't ask people to take their music seriously as long as they look like characters from D-rate horror movies, and still this album is simply superb!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm Abbath the sailor man, toot! toot!","review":"although this band is a shade slower than many other black metal bands, it still is cool. the lead vocalist, Abbath sounds like a demon-possessed Popeye.

I have a minor complaint, and that is the lyric booklet is not in order. bottom line is, if Abbath wants to sound like Popeye, he should eat spinach and then the band will really smoke. too bad this band broke up.

When you listen to it you can almost feel cold winds in your face, especially on the masterpiece \\"Beyond the north waves\\". That song gives the cd an extra star. It's the last song, so at the end of the album you're going to feel like a true viking. It's gonna make you wanna grab a sword, make a ship and go crazy! That's not the only great song, but it's definetly the best. This album seems to be a little more influenced by traditional heavy metal than we are used to, but it's still black metal. It's faster than lightning, and with the manic pumping drums and the blizzard of guitars, this is the best release of 2002. GET IT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Food-Mood-Body Connection - Gary Null","review":"I had hoped to see a clear definition between mood and food.

The author's story shows how our world today is tangled with the past, and that we drag the past along with us, whether we know it or not.

I can relate to his relationship with his father, which resembled my relationship with my mother and her volatile temper.

It frivolously interjects physics (at least, bits and pieces that fool the ignorant public into thinking it's physics) here and there so as to vainly attempt to sound learned, but then goes off on irrelevant tangents that shoot whatever forthcoming developments in their respective feet. This work, after ten minutes' perusal, went straight into the trash. Please save your money.

This book is superficial to say the least and primarily focuses on his personal behvior.I get the feeling the author tried to write a book along the line of \\"The Great Beast\\" by John Symonds.Even that hostile book is a better read than this inept attempt at biography.No new information is given and his philosophy and magick are only mentioned in passing. The book you should read is\\"the Confessions of Aleister Crowley\\" Although the book is self serving in many respects it is still an outstanding book and difficult to put down.By far one of the best books I've ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Superficial, weak and boring","review":"Tells me very little about the man. I knew very little about Crowley before reading this book, I know even less for having done so.The title of the book perhaps should have clued us in to the omission of any analysis or explanation of Crowley's mystical beliefs. It's probable that the intention was to present Crowley 'the man'. The problem being that this makes for only slightly more interesting reading than discussing Pete Sampras without discussing tennisThe author seems to regard Crowley as such a thorough fraud, that he does not even bother to debunk most of Crowley's tales and instead ignores them completely.This is only an 'autobiography' in the loosest terms.

Truly,it is apparent, \\"no bad book shall go unpublished\\". And no more truer, when it happens to be a dreadful, pious and nauseatingly moralistic account of the late great Master Therion (Aleister Crowley).Where are we as a culture if all we have to offer as insight into our more stellar and grandiose lives than the type of unimaginative, establishment propaganda and pablum as concocted here?

If you search Amazon for works by and about Roger Hutchinson and do the same by Aleister Crowley, you will see Crowley beating Hutchinson about 100 to 1. And this is 52 years after Uncle Al's death. Hutchinson makes Crowley out to be a complete sham, and doesn't take into account the fact that Crowley is the most often imitated and quote source on occult subjects in the 20th. century.

While the book designers made the text a bit hard to read in places (particularly the black-on-black paragraph on p. 94), it gives an excellent day-by-day breakdown of the movie and makes you feel like you were really there, without the tedium.

Oh, I didn't mention that if you increase the volume past a certain point, the thing just quits working. Maybe I had a defective unit, but I wound up taking the thing back within an hour of buying it.

Speaking of \\"Tetsuo\\" - Kei Fujiwara, the director and actress in \\"Organ\\" had a part in that movie.Well I don't know what to say maybe I'll have to watch it for the second time so everything becomes clear.

Ben Schrank knows what it's like to be twenty years old, doubtful of your upbringing, and determined to do good for others, and his writing is honest and true to life. He is, thankfully, unafraid to tell everything like it is, and I can't wait to read his next novel. If you've ever dreamed about New York City, questioned your parents' values, wanted to take from the rich, loved someone but were afraid -- or even if you haven't -- you've got to read Schrank's novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"From the Los Angeles Times.....","review":"An impressive first novel...With Kelly, Schrank has created an appealingly reticent rogue who--for all his good intentions and distaste for phoniness--cannot escape the contradictions of desire, class, altruism and blowing money on shoes at Barneys."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved Miracle Man.","review":"I loved Miracle Man, and recommend it to everyone. The New York setting is authentic - both high society and low are portrayed perfectly. Schrank takes us inside the minds and motivations of these characters, so we can identify with them, even though we might despise them. Finally, the writing is superb. In sum, a highly recommended novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Miracle!","review":"I love Ben Schrank's writing, and his intent. The book starts out very promising, and the reader soon becomes interested in the main character, Martin Kelly Minter, and his life. Many questions are brought up in the early chapters which we hope to learn more about later in the story. In the later chapters, however, rather than answer these questions, and tie the concepts together, Schrank leaves too many loose ends. He changes the entire story in the middle, and what started as a refreshingly real look at a young man's life, soon becomes a non-realistic rambling story. This book could have been planned a lot better, and seems like an unnecessarily elongated short story, which should have ended about 250 pages earlier than it did. I hope that in the future, Mr. Schrank can use his talented writing style to write a coherent novel that keeps the readers interest from beginning to end."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved it!","review":"I was reading some of the reviews and it said something about Marxism. Maybe so, but it is an excellently written book, that you can't deny. I love the way Ben Schrank writes. Also, a big part of it is a love story. I'm my opinion, that's the core of the whole story. So, if you are into love stories, don't hesitate! Buy it now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice start...","review":"Thoroughly entertaining first novel.

Sasha is a beautiful doll, but she provides a difficult standard for adolescents to measure up to. While many 12-year olds would love to look like her, many are just beginning puberty, making it next to impossible to look like this. I don't think that Bratz dolls promote good body image for kids or teens. Not only that, but her dress is painfully short for a doll. Some of the Bratz dolls have acceptable outfits: I will not complain about the formal collection or the \\"nighty-night\\" collection. The formals are fine, and the pajamas are.. well... pajamas. However, this outfit is not appropriate.

In the earlier two books, Captain Geoffrey Frost was almost heroic to a fault; in this book, he becomes a somewhat darker, more complex character with a streak of violence in him. Most of these naval series seem to have a few volumes that are set on land; much of this story involves Frost's efforts to transport some supplies overland from New England to Washington's troops in Pennsylvania. Perhaps it's because Frost is now \\"out of his element,\\" but he comes across as a more interesting, and somewhat more flawed, person.It's a nice bit of character development for an exciting series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"This book is great.

I've been through both expensive ones and cheap ones and none last very long, so anymore I tend to buy cheap because this family is hard on them and just because they are on my computer or MP3 player it doesn't mean they won't get used by someone else. However, I'm betting that these will last forever because no one will like them.Other than a free pair that came with my cell phone, these are hands down the most uncomfortable headphones I've ever tried. They actually make my ears ache after about 10 minutes. The ends are made of a softer material, but not soft enough and they are huge which is probably the biggest factor in their lack of comfort.They also do not block out any other room noise. At all. So if you have difficulty hearing with other background noise, definitely skip these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money - again","review":"As I've found too often, these lightweight type of headphones are just too inferiorly made, and the result is poor wire connection with the the jack, causing crackling whenever the cord moves.

Seeing I need a lightwieght pair of headphones for exercising, this simply won't do. I've tried several other pairs and brands and haven't found one that's consistantly well-made, I don't have an alternative to recommend.I'm sending this pair back to Maxwell, under the terms of the warrenty, for a replacement, but I don't have great hopes they'll send me a pair that's any better."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Design And Comfort Is Way Better Than The Sound Quality","review":"If I were rating this product merely on the design and comfort, I would have to give it 5 stars.

And if you like this vertical design, I recommend buying a few while you still can. (The design has yielded favor to hip-hop styles and earbuds, so Maxell seems to be discontinuing this model. It's disappeared from all the drugstores where I used to see it.)Face it: no mfr.'s compact headphones/earbuds last very long under normal use. A cord gets tugged once too many, you permanently lose one channel or the other, and then you can't access the connections to re-solder them.At least with these Maxell's, you minimize your upfront investment. They're comfortable and sound almost as good as the corresponding Sony models, but they cost only 1/2 or 1/3 the price.

Walsh sets out to debunk many of the misunderstandings about opera, and shows how delightful opera can be, as it combines drama and music. He also shows that many of the themes in opera are basically the themes we still see today, in pop culture and so forth (love, really in love, kill for love).

When that's the exact opposite of what this album is. This album is an invocation to his Dedication to the guitar and music, before he ended his life. HAIL JON!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome! Hail Dissection!","review":"My first entrance into Dissection music and I found it fantastic. Love the black metal sound it his music and lirics. Since then, one of my favorite black metal bands, I do recommend this DVD 100%!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pathetique with a difference!","review":"Giulini's unique account of Pathetique Symphony will stand alone apart from mainstream recordings, just like his equally original rendition of Mahler 9th (DG).Giulini puts more emphasis on elegiac and comtemplative aspect of the music rather than dramatic representation of passion and despair. Yet, that does not mean it lacks fire and energy in climaxes.I listen to this Pathetique once in awhile when I feel tired of all-consuming fire type of interpretations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"This is a sturdy, awesome product.

I've had these almost 5 years. They've never been great. I get double-imaging even at 10x. Once you zoom, forget it. It's like looking thru a Coke bottle. I understand that I may be able to collimate them, and I will try, but I thin they should have been adjusted @ the factory! Even my 16 yr old nephew with teenage vision says they aren't good. He prefers the 50 year old set of Bushnells. They are sharper. 50 yrs old and clearer. I'll adjust them best I can and keep them on the boat. If they fall into the lake I won't shed a tear.UPDATE: This weekend I collimated them as best I could. @ 10X I got rid of most of the blurriness/double-imaging. So they're usable at least in this state. However once you zoom, everything becomes distorted again. If you need zoom binocs buy a high quality pair. I should have just bought a fixed zoom set and saved $20."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor product- I would not buy","review":"The focus between both lenses don't work together - have to use as a monocular - not a binocular.The zoom lever is poor- very choppy and not easy to zoom smooth.Poor product, and will return."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow; Blown Away. Update;","review":"I was completely blown away with this set of binoculars, \\"its like,\\" where have I been? This set exceeds my expectations. The clarity is fantastic even at very long distance, the zoom feature is great. This is truely the best set of binoculars I've had the pleasure of owning; as a matter fact I have already ordered another set, the Upclose 12x25 model for in the woods viewing. Thanks Celestron. Update; After owning these a few weeks the zoom broke, so I sent them back after being told that there would be no charge, well then received an email stating there was a charge, so I just sent a copy of the first email and no charge. Poor customer service and the binoculors well there still broke when you zoom. There fine for long distance but very poor zoom feature. That was my main reason for purchasing these binoculars. So disappointed with my purchase and the way they delt with the repair. They charge 25 dollars just to send it back. Not very professonial. Thank you."},{"rating":"1","title":"ARRIVED OUT OF ALIGNMENT","review":"The binoculars arrived out of alignment (you see double). Adorama Camera said no problem to return.

They were okay at 10X but as soon as you zoomed, double vision occurred. I saw through the other one star reviews it was more than half the original cost to send them back so I opted to just use them 10X. Recently I started to look for a fix online and found a so-so one on YouTube but a comment in Amazon to one of the one-star reviews gave me a link and I was able to fix the binoculars myself... woo woo! It appears that Amazon will not allow me to post a link but if you just search \\"binocular collimating\\", some helpful sites should come up. The little adjustment screws are just under the rubber armor. There is no need to take anything apart. You will need a sturdy micro flat blade screwdriver and a lot of patience. The screws are hard to get started but they will move."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I got this thinking that it can be used during vacation but this is no good.

He has been whacking all sorts of things and it seems to hold up fine so far. He loves to flick the handle and watch the telescoping sections jump into place. What power. I am glad other reviewers noted that this one doesn't light up so we weren't disappointed. My boy has sensory processing disorder and needs practice with modulation. This toy is perfect. He can practice gentle hitting and learn how much power is acceptable. The sensory feedback from hitting is good for him and satisfies his urge to hit in an acceptable way."},{"rating":"2","title":"great toy for anyone","review":"This lightsabre is the best toy i own i play with this more than i play gamecube. it is very durable you could whack a wall your hardest and it wouldent dent ive tried. me and my bro make up mini movies and i always have new ideas. if you have the extra cah buy this toy"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT FOR STAR WARS FANS","review":"Ok, this lightsaber, i firsr got the green one, but this light saber is awsome!

I have to put the camera down and look through it once again to get a green \\"ready\\" light. Otherwise, it won't let you take the picture.

The case came with a pick-and-pull foam that allows you to customize it to fit whatever it is you want to store. It is a great case, but my only complaint is that I find it very hard to open and close. About two weeks after I purchased this brand, I came across a very similar case (different brand) that has a much nicer opening-closing mechanism. I wish I hadn't already picked the foam out.

(Last I checked, Amazon had it listed for $115.)The book runs only twenty pages long, and most of the last half of it is nothing but padding--full of whole, not-that-relevant newspaper articles in their entirety.The book does contain some good information and some interesting facts, but if you'd really like to read a thorough history of Red River, I'd recommend reading THE RED RIVER-TWINING AREA, by Jim Berry Pearson instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"I bought this for my daughter's Christmas gift and one of her wish for Santa.

Often this runs counter to superhero philosophies - maybe because in comics and other visual media, fighting stronger makes for more interesting visuals. A benefit of superhero prose, like Gen13: Time and Chance, is that the written word can make the character's internal processes and thoughts as involving as the action sequences.

I found the songwriting to be no where near as insightful as on previous albums (with one or two exceptions) and the music lacks the emotive elements that I have come to expect from Ron. Having been a huge fan for many years, I await any Ron Sexsmith release or tour to Australia with great anticipation and expectation. Unfortunately this effort has not delivered.I surely hope that Ron is not under some contractual obligation where he is required to release a new album every 18 months or so - If that is the case, I also hope that his record label becomes more receptive to the notion that quite often, less is more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Satisfying!","review":"I listened to nothing else but this album for the first month I owned it.

Previously \\"Dandenion Wine\\" was not quite in the top tier for me but today it reminded me so much of my marriage and divorce. It rings so deeply and so true.

This story of long-held rivalries and the futility of outsiders in controlling change, reminds me of Joyce Carey's Mr. JohnsonMister Johnson (Revived Modern Classic)in its mix of ironic observation, joyful capture of the zest and paradoxes of African life, and, the ultimately tragic pull of destiny and tradition - albeit with a modern tone and sensibility.

Some basic concepts that could have been spelled out in the first two chapters end up taking 12 chapters.

From themes surrounding the relationship of Vignola's art to religions to essays which consider his international influences and reputation, The Art Of Bill Viola is a 'must' for any in-depth art collection strong in video and installation works and artists."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for any Pink Panther fan","review":"This CD was used, but it is just as described and plays beautifully. It arrived quickly and was shipped safely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap, breakable, and grounds for dismissal.","review":"There are far nicer and better performing devices on the market. This one cracked while washing in the sink. It had no secondary filter (usually near the spout attached to the lid) so some pretty large coffee grounds came floating out. It also had a poor fitting plunger. I ended up with the BonJour Hugo 8-Cup Unbreakable French Press, sold here at Amazon. If you don't like the plastic, go for any metal press by Bodum, but avoid the glass models-- again, they will break given handling during cleaning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good.","review":"The CD gets off to a good start and continues with the great solos. 'Ten Digits to the Future' has ths very fast double bass/guitar chugging combination that just compliments the song so well. 'Judgement Day' continues with an awesome solo, and by the time you thought the CD hit it's highlights... it busts into the instrumental track 'Bloodshred' (clever title? strange title?). Overall it is worth its money in one Metal Fan's opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better off DYI","review":"I was VERY dissatisfied with this product.

There was a bit of predictablity to this movie, but it was still very sweet and carried a great message. It speaks the truth that just because you have faith and follow God things will not always be easy, but in the midst of hardship there is comfort and a chance to make a difference. I found it to be uplifting and enjoyed it. I even recommended it to others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful","review":"This movie is excellent for families.

However, this has to be the first romance movie--based on a book--that had me absolutely bored to tears. I kept thinking it would end any second, and then it just kept going, and going, and going. I think if it had ended earlier, it might not have been so bad.Also, when the grandmother was trying to get her granddaughter to stay, the story she told didn't seem to have any relation to the granddaughter's situation. So, I don't know why she was telling it...It was a very depressing movie. One that sort of says, \\"All God gives us is destruction, but keep on going anyway...\\" I don't think God's like that. He may give us strength to continue on despite circumstances, but He doesn't make bad things happen in our life.I think perhaps the book might have been better (I've never read it). If you haven't read the book, don't watch the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Mixed Review","review":"I thought the acting was BAD; no one was believable.

Trust me you do not have to see this first before you purchase. Excellent, Storyline and Acting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christian Family Friendly","review":"This was a movie the entire family enjoyed watching together - no sex, violence or swearing. Good message for everyone about not giving up even when everything seems to be falling apart all around you. I was hoping for another outcome in the movie but this was more like real life which made it still good because it wasn't all fairytales. My two young children also sat through the entire movie glued to the screen. Will watch many more times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good family film-great story!","review":"I really enjoyed the story line of this movie.I haven't read the book...so I wasn't dissappointed in them changing the story line. Sometimes that is a plus. I was sorry to see a swear word in it...which I felt was totally uncalled for in the movie and just didn't fit. I just add that for those who prefer to buy movies without them. My mom even loved this movie...has watched it about five times. THis is a really good movie with a nice story.

I loved the location and descriptions having recently visited the area. However, I disliked the plot just couldn't hold my interest. Felt that Michael's personality change was never explained to my liking and wanted to see the development of his character continue. I belong to a lot of discussion on line lists and have recommended the first and second books, but have not recommended this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely wonderful page-turner!","review":"This is the third in the series that began with \\"The Strange Files of Fremont Jones.\\" And it's amazing! It does everything you want a mystery to do. It's even better than the first two of the series, which I would have thought were impossible to top. This hard-to-put-down book is a superb read. Fremont's and Michael's characters continue to evolve, as does their relationship. And the ancillary characters are so much fun! Dianne Day absolutely sets up a world of time and place and mood and drops us in it. This has instantly become one of my all-time favorite reads -- mystery or otherwise. I'm not kidding! More!

In addition, I get one fuzzy but watchable channel, FOX, due to the station being 1.3 miles away. And, if I adjust the angle just right, I can sort of make out what's on TBN.Antennaweb conservatively predicts 14 channels recieved from my street address. In contrast, my new Magnavox Mant-400 delivers a total of ONE channel, or 7% of the conservative estimate.It can't even pick up the ABC station that is just 3.5 miles away. All I see I see is black and white noise- not even a glimpse or hint of any recognizable image.

Get one now while you still can. This fan has average power, but still better then the plastic box fans being made today. I use it to circulate the AC in my room. The noise is average for a metal fan. Put it on any of the speeds and fall asleep. The blades are as shiny as a mirror. I have nothing left to add. With the oil ports and proper care it could last years and years to come unlike those new plastic fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT a Lakewood P25 - not even close!","review":"UPDATE: I ordered this product and it is definitely NOT a Lakewood P25. The original Lakewood, now aka Airking and Lasco, had a really heavy duty motor and 3 large aluminum blades that really moved a lot of air. This 9723 is a very poor made-in-china imitation with 5 wimpy little plastic blades that move about half the air. If you are looking for a real P25 you will have to find one in inventory somewhere because Lakewood went out of business (filed for bankruptcy) a while back and now Sunbeam has purchased the brand names. You can bet Sunbeam will morph them into even cheaper products so if you do run across a P25 in inventory somewhere you should buy 2."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware","review":"The Model they are selling is different than the other reviewers described.

Expensive but worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A complete waste","review":"I expected to hear rock songs sung in German to help improve my grammar and learn some new phrases. Big disappointment. The tape consists of individual words *spoken* over a very annoying, cheaply synthesized back beat. Furthermore, the vocabulary words seem to be random -- there is no building to the phrases on the last track. The musical background is so cheesy I couldn't even make it all the way through the tape. It comes with a small booklet that gives an overview of German grammar; if you've never studied it won't make sense and if you have studied it's redundant. There is a children's series called \\"The Lyric Language\\" which does this much better; I was hoping for a more mature version of that, but this is completely worthless."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Last Oasis","review":"This book was writen for young teens; and is very good; I read it every year; now my grandkids want to read it but only have one copy; ordering another copy to let grandkids read; alot of thought went into this book and hope the author writes another."},{"rating":"1","title":"Old model","review":"Dish Network couldn't activate it even sent me new cards,but no dice.

Lots of swearing if you don't like that. I enjoyed some of the characters especially Indiria Varma who I would like to see more of. I liked some of the locations they visited too.But don't get carried away with the liner notes comparing it to 22 Day Later. Not in the same league. This one is humourous throughout and the connection between the dog virus and the main story line is very weak.

Once it came off the first thing I noticed was just how thin the eyepiece support is.These might be good if you only plan to use them on vacation, you might consider them disposable because they are so cheap.

However, I'm writing this a few hours before a Chanukah party, and I've just tossed out my second try at Dreidl cake, which my little boy is dying to have for our party. I've followed all the directions, but the cake falls apart after it's inverted after 15 minutes of cooling (as directed by the recipe) If it falls apart, it can't be cut into a dreidl shape. The first time I let it cool 15 minutes; the second time, 20 minutes. Now I'm going to try to let it cool completely before inverting but it may not be ready by party time. So I'm baking chocolate chip cookies as a backup. If there is some special trick to making this cake, I wish the author would have written it into the book. Whatever it is, it's not fast and it's not easy if you have to figure out the trick by trial and error."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Converts' culinary guide to Judaism","review":"Last year my sister gave me Fast and Festive Meal..as a Chanakah gift as I was converting to Judaism and had little knowledge of how to cook jewishly.

They are that terrific. The chocolate chip cookies are so delicious that my Mom could not believe they were Pasidic. I also enjoy the ritual information, and table setting ideas.The dreidle cake was a major hit at Chanukah.The is the ONE book that you must have for holiday cooking.It should be in every household.

He served with distinction. He served his state with distinction in Congress. The only reason he lost his seat was the unscrupulous gerry-mandering of Congressional districts by Willy Brown.Bob was a tall, rangy quiet person, a real life John Wayne figure with more natural athletic ability. He was well liked by people from all walks of life. We will miss him greatly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bob Mathias: Athletic/American wonder!!!!!!!!!!","review":"When one speaks of Bob Mathias onlt one word comes to my mind, incredible!!!!!!! How many athletes can say at age 17 they got into athletics, and just a few months later won a gold medal in the 1948 decathlon in London, England? Then Mr Mathias came back in 1952 to win his second Olympic Decathlon in Helsinki, Finland; and that same year (1952) he also played for Stanford in The Rose Bowl!!!!!!!! He wom 11 decathlons (undefeated) in AAU competition and set 4 decathlon records. Bob Mathias was also elected to 4 terms of Congress from 1967-1974. If this does not declare or make Mr Mathias one of our country's greatest athletes and men; then I don't know what does! He was just a great athlete, man and American! I can go on and on forever naming his great athletic and humanitarian achievments. One in ten million is the only way I \\"best\\" know how to describe Bob Mathias, just one incredible human being for his time; and for all-time!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"a mixed pakage","review":"the mp3 player is ok in general when you first get the DMP310 it works great but over time and a little abuse and i do mean a little abuse it starts to randomly freaze, freaze when the batteries are low, or when you bump into something. for something that has no moving parts why does it freaze?the good aspects to the DMP310 is that it has a good battery life and good audio quality, but these things dont fully make up for the draw backs and flaws that i previusly stated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent MP3 Player - poor hardware","review":"As an MP3 Player, it works well.

The L-plug looks sturdy enough to withstand extended use. (They don't include foam earpads.) So they get points for construction. The sound, on the other hand- not so much. They aren't quite the worst sounding I've heard, but close. The sound isn't unbearable but it is tinny with virtually no base, and has a little reverb, like a radio playing in a shower. That isn't fatal for me as I'm not using them for music but rather for talk stations, and the speakers' voices are clear enough. The Amazon price of $2.99 is closer to what they are worth as back-ups that wouldn't get you upset if lost.

It's a live recording, reminiscent of the famous Argerich Rach 3 recording and Zimerman's plays with outstanding clarity, a unique brilliance in his sound and virtually flawless technique. The fact that it is a live recording adds a vitality to this performance that you rarely hear in studio recordings and Zimerman's interpretation of Chopin is wonderful. The Concertgebouw Orchestra is at its best and, to my mind, has the greatest Russian conductor at the podium in Kondrashin (look out for his Dvorak symphony recordings as well). Truly the best Zimerman performance out there and certainly amongst the greatest recordings of the Chopin 1!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Scope, Poor Application","review":"I recently purchased this scope to put on a 7.62 X 54 Mosin Nagant M44 Rifle that I because the way the gun is set up you have to use a long eye relief scope such as a pistol scope unless you get the gun drilled and tapped for a special (expensive) scope mount. The scope itself is a very nice scope except the recoil of this rifle is so much, that it knocks the scope loose. Every time i get it sighted in, a couple shots, and all the allen screws, scope mounts and rings are loose and the scope is just rattling around. So to be fair, the scope would be very nice for other applications i'm sure, but for mounting it on a rifle of high recoil, it appears to be absolutely useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed in Rubbermaid","review":"My husband and I bought this storage shed because it was the size we needed, and the Rubbermaid label made us think it would be a quality item. It took us four hours to assemble it, and it was extremely difficult. We've assembled lots of things before (to save money)and it's usually no big deal, but this was the absolute worst. Some sections of this storage unit -- particularly the roof and the door hinges -- required a lot of brute force to get the parts to fit together, and it would have been impossible for one person. We plan to caulk various sections because we have no confidence that the storage unit's construction will keep out the rain or snow. Also, a drill is required (but not mentioned in the instructions) because there are no pilot holes for some sections. We are disappointed in this Rubbermaid product.

In part to give a concrete feel to the analysis of allocating effort.Another important aspect covered is how to deal with cost driver changes. Where the rates of different factors can increase (rarely do they decrease!). You are also given multiple measures of performance.

The hero and heroine did very well but the over all x rated one is not our expectation. I bet most of the people expected a lot more but in vain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really Bogus","review":"Fake studio scenes with vulgar language and beginner modelling type people who seem to purposely speak Hindi with an affected French-Canadian accent. Even the facial expressions and background music sounds remind us of techno clubs. The story is rather poor with more emphasis on prostitution and rape rather than true love-making secrets prescribed in the original Kama Sutra. Don't get it for the name -- it has no connection whatsoever to Kama Sutra. The casts are far from sexy -- maybe rich and ugly enough to woo Mira Nair to give them a role. They hired Rekha (from Utsav) but that boring mama simply fails to uplift the mood of the movie. Mira Nair did a lousy job using a camera with a heavy reddish yellow lens when this movie could never even qualify to be a timeless collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"kama sutra A tale of Love","review":"Unable to play this dvd on my dvd player because it is for a different zone to european.

Though some of the love scenes are a bit cliche for my taste, the director does a great job of bringing out the beauty of these women and the beautiful setting in which this movie takes place. The script is somewhat insipid, and the story could use some creativity.

From there she meets a handsome carver, and is taken in by a woman who is famous for teaching the art of Kama Sutra to wives and cortisans. The rest is history. Throughout the movie the women wrestle with their life changes, their friendship, and their ability to change their circumstances in a patriarchal society.The story is well told and keeps your interest right through to the end. The scenery of India, the colors, and the culture are fascinating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lush, visually stunning film, but weak story line","review":"Mira Nair's \\"Kama Sutra,\\" is a visually stunning and lush film. Each frame of this film has been beautifully and visually composed. However, the film has a weak story line and fails to grab your attention. At times I found my attention straying, but what brought me back again and again was the visual imagery on the screen.This film is thinly based on Vatsayana's \\"Kama Sutra,\\" which translates into A book of love or a treatise on pleasure. Other than that the film has no reference to the book at all.It is worth renting the film and watching it once, but is definitely not a collector's item."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful reproduction of the Real Kama Sutra.","review":"It is not a porno movie.

So I had little to compare this with. While most who are watching this movie for sex will be greatly disappointed, I thought this an excellent film. The Cinematography was very good... The music I must buy the soundtrack very soon. The music turned me into a fan of the film. Actually the basic storyline (the love interest story line) echo's a little of the storyline within Titanic.

I sure dis appreciate this vision into Indian culture and life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't stand up to repeated viewings","review":"The colors on this DVD are washed out. On the big screen they were sumptious and epic but something has been lost in the transfer, as if they used a bad print or didn't spend the money to guarantee a worthy digitizing. That said, the movie itself was very good on its first viewing and less interesting with later viewings, because it wants to be epic but in truth illuminates very little about love and sacrifice. What would save it is how wonderful looking it is, but like I said -- the colors don't stand out on the DVD, which is a sad loss."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tantrically, a great film","review":"This movie was a boon to those of us who understand tantric yoga and to those of us who know there is more to love than just sex."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crossed up Cultures","review":"This movie in my opinion is much more in sympathy with hollywood than the culture it claims to portray.

It's the same great music I remembered, but the production quality of the MP3 files is just poor. The volume levels vary wildly from track to track. Going from \\"Shepherd Of My Heart\\" to \\"Love In Any Language\\" is a particularly jarring experience. The orchestral and choral bits on tracks like \\"Let There Be Praise\\" and \\"Unshakeable Kingdom\\" have an extremely flat/lifeless sound. Perhaps the studio masters had been damaged before they were able to digitize things, but it seems that a modest amount of time spent with some basic audio editing software would have been appropriate prior to offering this for sale in the new format."},{"rating":"2","title":"4 stars - Only One Poor Song","review":"This was in top100 CCM's greatest albums.

I don't understand how a company can take away something that I already had on a previous version. I plan on uninstalling 9 and reinstalling 8 to see if I can get all my original transitions back.

The fact is many people out there are trying to edit large digital productions with far less than is necessary to do so. The minimum system requirements are just that! If you want to produce a 20 second commercial, that's great! If you want to work with a feature length film, try upgrading your system. And keep a clean dedicated system just for video editing! Stop running all this garbage in the background. Some people expect miracles though and simply don't understand how to problem solve.

I found dozens of minor bugs the first time I used the software.Pinnacle's idea of \\"customer support\\" is e-mail, usually 24-48 hours after the request. It's often a form letter referring you to their online help.There are other PC video editing packages that work much better and cost about the same. Please don't take my word for it either!

I use transitions and menus and add music and it all comes out just fine, with a little patience. I've even created streaming video.

Five years on though, they've taken the idea forward and constructed a whole new album of songs based on the concept. What makes this album so brilliantly original though, is that the majority of songs sound like they were written specifically as melodious dance tracks, with the repetition of catchy phrases at the core. But, aside from the odd finale or chorus, there are no beats, few synths - not as we have come to know them on Sparks albums anyway - and only the odd guitar. Instead we get lush orchestrations, some of Ron's most fluid piano, and whole choirs of Russel. Once again, Sparks prove that pioneering doesn't have to be hard work, for the listener at least."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent resource for fellows and technicians","review":"This is an excellent and comprehensive introductory text in pediatric echocardiography.I missed the following sections:1) 2D imaging of coronary arteries, in particular with respect to Kawasaki disease.2) 2D imaging of pulmonary veins.

The biography was a decent rough sketch of Austen's life and writing compressed into about 30 minutes worth of reading.The included summaries of Austen's works were hasty and thus vastly oversimplified, to the point of uselessness. They contain several minor errors as well, stupid things that the editor should have caught. Anyone new to Austen could get a better overview reading middle school book reports.The critiques are at least thought provoking although not exactly to my taste; the one by Brian Wilkie in particular was a magnificent piece of specious sophistry.If someone needs a quick source for a paper due the next day, the material in this book might be sufficient to make a C, but reading the real thing would be much more satisfying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Save yourself some trouble and buy this one!","review":"We tried at least five expensive bird books and this one is tops.

Her cueing is pretty easy to follow and she doesn't surprise you with changing direction without notice.- tries to get your whole body with hip pops, lots of arm movements.Now the bad:- really strange music, not the kind that makes you want to dance.- the modified version isn't really modified, and they hardly show her, instead they focus on another woman just about as much as they focus on the instructor. (there are 3 women + instructor).- Several of the moves were difficult on carpet (funky feet, scissors).- Some of the movements hard to follow.Not a strenuous cardio routine, maybe good for an off day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely NOT a great cardio workout!","review":"So, I tried really hard to like this workout since I think that the Elle Glam Fitness Toning workout is relatively good. First of all, the warm up lasts for 10 minutes of the toal 50 minutes of the DVD. The actual cardio section is neither well cued nor exciting. It lasts for approximately 35 minutes. It felt as if the instructor was developing the moves as the workout was being filmed! Also, I wore my heart rate monitor and I very rarely got into my training zone. I added a lot of movement (i.e plyometrics) to make myself feel like I worked out at all. I would skip this workout, even for light days!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too academically preppy for me...","review":"This book may prove valuable if the reader has little or no background with self development and leadership as it relays a lot of truths from those areas with respect to mentoring.However, this book is just not my style.

The beginning caught my attention but then my interest quickly faded. The writing is dull. Strangely, this book is about discovering your own hidden desires but the author is maddenly secretive and emotionally retentive. This could be a uselful book to some. I can see how this book would appeal to those who were brought up in really restrictive home/times. It's a good effort but if you really want to read a book about deepening the love of love read Thomas Moore's book 'Soul Mates'. And if you're looking for something to heighten your appreciation of the senses read Diane Ackerman's 'The Natural History of the Senses'."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classical atonement-a different view","review":"This book takes the classical approach to atonement-Christ died for our sins and to conquer death, and illustrates what that looks like in contemporary life through great stories. This book would probably be of the greatest interest to pastors/priests who are in the pulpit each week illustrating atonement theology.

It is. (Take your pick which setting supplies the title to the disc.) Mr Ainsley's French is superb, and his singing elegant and beautifully nuanced. Unfortunately, sound engineers seem to have difficulty getting the settings right for his voice, and the first track echoes as if he is singing into a tin bucket. It makes the piano sound like some dreadful old church hall hack, too. Hence four stars. The rest of the disc is much, much better.Graham Johnson's accompaniment is not his best work - he sounds a little tired these days.Nonetheless, this is a beautiful disc of some gems of songs, and a well-planned programme.

Long has the heinous Mr. Macdonald been surrounded by a bizzare cast of true believers, now Ms. Malcolm joins their ranks.

This book, which I guess is a widely read book in journalism schools gives a riveting and honest account of her covering the slander trial of the murderer, Jeffrey MacDonald against McGinniss. Malcolm is extremely self aware, and seems to be able to make some real observations about the relationship of a journalist to their subject while not coming across as judgmental or beyond fault as well.

The book starts off kinda of slow, but about middle of the book a unique plot starts develops - then it is a pretty smooth read to the end. The characters are a little single-sided. Every male that appears in this book could be future love interests for Georgina which makes me leery of future books.

I bought it on a whim at the grocery store of all places because I was bored. I read a lot and love sci-fi/fantasy and figured it couldn't be that bad so I bought it.The story is about a Succubus who has doubts about who she is. Not an altogether unhead of story. Those who watched Buffy the Vampire Slayer will remember her love was a Vampire with a soul and one who wanted to do good and fight evil. The way in which the author plays out the story though is unique and refreshing. The fact that the main character is a female has a lot to do with that.I won't give any spoilers here the book is worth reading for any who like sci-fi/fantasy.

I loved VA and therefore decided to give this adult series a try. I wasn't disappointed. Adventures of Georgina Kincaid, a succubus who \\"sucks\\" life energy out of men during sex are quite engaging. The fantasy world of angels, demons, vampires, etc. is interesting and imaginative. A bit of romance and steamy sex is thrown into the mix. All of this makes a great entertaining book. I will definitely read the rest of the books in the series.P.S. It reminded me a lot of Sookie Stackhouse series that I love. Enjoy!P.P.S. I just read book 4 in the series. Looking back, I probably wouldn't recommend to read these books until all installment are out, simply because pretty much every book ends with a heartbreaking cliffhanger"},{"rating":"1","title":"So disappointing","review":"After reading the glowing reviews on Amazon I bought this book, wanting to like it, thinking it would be a wonderful new paranormal series to become addicted to. Yes, it is a fast-paced read and while the premise of a succubus and her demon/angel friends was refreshing, the characters were way too bland. She barely touches on sexuality (infact, the main character seems afraid of it, like she doesn't know what she's doing.. so much for being a succubus). Georgina is entirely unconvincing, she acts like an ignorant, naive, whiny modern girl rather than a centuries old succubus. Give me a break. I kept hoping someone would kill her off and another character could pick up the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Writing But Very Unrealistic Outcome","review":"Shy Introverted males are not attractive to females in real life, and especially not in fiction. Mead spends the whole book showing what an incompetent introverted socail \\"loser\\" Seth is, with little redeaming qualities other than he is a good writer and does have some compassion. After a whole book of seeing mostly flaws in Seth, along with \\"God-like\\" qualities in Roman, we are asked to believe that Seth is the winner of the feisty, brainy, beautiful Georgina, who could have any man. This huge flaw totally takes away from otherwise very good writing, and I was sorry to buy the sequel before I found out Seth and Georgie would become a couple....big let down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh . . .","review":"I really wanted to like this book, I really did. But it just didn't click with me. Obviously I'm in the minority, but the names of all the people she introduces confused me for a couple chapters, and then the long narratives between the action that I tended to skip over, I just couldn't get into it. Usually when I start a series, I keep reading, just to see what happens, but with this one, I don't think I have the desire to start the 2nd book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Paranormal romance for the smart girls","review":"An unusually well written romance novel that crosses into the genre of mystery. With Succubus Blues, Mead has created a witty and darkly humorous world of demons, imps, angels, and vampires populated with complex characters who defy the stereotypical hero/villain dichotomy. As an added bonus, Mead's sex scenes miraculously avoid the pat drivel that appears to be all but ubiquitous in the romance genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun read","review":"I whipped through this in a day and found it to be a light, fun, entertaining read. The characters are quirky and goofy, making them quite memorable. I'm still laughing about Jerome the demon who makes himself look like John Cusak and secretly owns all his movies - hilarious!

It also seemed a little immature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blurring the line between good and evil.","review":"One of the more interesting aspects of this book was the way that the author, Richelle Mead, makes employees of hell: a succubus and her buddies, an imp and a vampire, into the good guys. Mead somehow manages to make Georgina likeable, even though the first time we meet her she's helping to steal the soul of some poor hapless 30+ year old virgin who's still living in mom's basement. Further blurring the line between good and bad, Mead inspires such sympathy for the \\"villian\\",, who on the brink of chosing to be redeemed by love, ends up only with more loss and betrayal.I really enjoyed reading Succubus Blues, it was smart and entertaining and amazingly for a book in this genre, I found myself really thinking about it afterwards. I am looking forward to seeing what Richelle Mead does as an encore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Though a large part of the cast is evil, they all have heart.","review":"All the esteemed authors' endorsements on the cover are not just for show...this book is AMAZING! Richelle Mead is one helluva storyteller. Where to begin- ah, the characters. Lovable, funny, deeply flawed, immortal, and interesting. The romance between Georgina and her paramours is hot and yet riddled with complications due to her tricky job description. The plot is twisty turny and quite satisfying. It is rather rare to see an author touch on the Christian Bible in urban fantasy/paranormal romance genre, but Ms. Mead taps into a wide frame of reference with the deft touch similar to how Rachel Caine taps into weather. After reading it, I thought to myself - why hasn't anyone thought of that before? Never pornographic or ridiculous, the story's power relies us on caring about this small group of immortals and the people they love."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love Richelle Mead, but not this series","review":"I love the Vampire Academy series by this author, so I decided to give this series a try. I wasn't very impressed. For an evil and old succubus who has lived since the 5th century, the protagonist Georgina is very immature and stupid. I couldn't really get into it. Considering a succubus lives off sex, the main character has a lot of sexual escapades and there are many sex scenes. Honestly, if your job has been having sex with different men in order to corrupt their souls and drain some of their energy to live, it's kinda hard to sympathize with you. Not my cup of tea."},{"rating":"1","title":"didn't enjoy","review":"I honestly got through a few chapters of this book and lost interest. It wasn't my thing, I guess.

There is only one drawback: All of the photos are plain b/w shots; not always looking as good as could be.

My only complaint is that orienting the chisel precisely in the rounded corner is not foolproof, sometimes resulting in corners that are not quite square. You have to eyeball the chisel in relation to the existing mortise to correctly position it vertically and horizontally before striking it. The chisel housing should be molded in a way that makes it a no-brainer to firmly register both sides of it against the existing mortise to guarantee perfect 90-degree corners.

But he did write about things in other chapters that I wish I had know about 40 years ago so that I could have started fighting the effects sooner. Especally the education effects. The way it has been handled in the school system especially with the lack of input from the parents has been so subtle. After reading that chapter alone I have been talking with the teenagers I know, next is the Junior College students. This has to STOP.

I don't want to have to squint and concentrate and rush reading so I can understand the storyline. It just gave me a headache and I was instantly turned off. If I want to read I will get a book. On top of everything else the narrator's voice(male - creepy old man) sounded so dam annoying.

Who knows, maybe when I get patience or desparate I'll give this movie a 2nd chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amelie WILL change your life","review":"Jean-Pierre Jeunet, the brilliant director behind \\"Delicatessen,\\" \\"City of Lost Children\\" and \\"Alien: Resurrection\\" comes back in 2001 with a fable that's as close to reality as you'd ever want it to be. \\"Amelie,\\" also known in French as \\"The fabulous destiny of Amelie Poulain\\" takes place in Paris, the city where an innocent and angel-like girl grows to become a good-doer, much in a style similar to the movie \\"Pay it forward\\" from 2000. However the storyline is totally unconventional, filled with her daydreaming depicted in very original and fun ways, and with unexpected turns as she goes about her good deeds. At one point she finds herself caught in pursuing what's best for others, while being afraid to pursue happiness for herself.In times of uncertainty and was such as these, where everyone is in dire need of a positive message, this movie is it. You will love this movie, and as its poster reads \\"she'll change your life.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"one of my favorites","review":"This has to be one of my favorite movies. I love everything about it. The cinematography and colors are beautiful. I also love the music. The story is just so charming you have to love her."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite films","review":"When I first started watching Amélie, I, like many ignorant people, was somewhat put off but the idea of having to read my movie. I soon got over that fact and was encaptured by the movie's aesthetic beauty. The characters are all portrayed wonderfully. Audrey Tatou is a perfect match for such a quirky character. Mathieu Kassovitz is handsome and a great love interest. The colors jump off the screen, and the music is enchanting. I even bought the soundtrack (a great buy as well.) I don't have the capability to convey the amount of pleasure this movie gives you, not to mention laughter, love, and hope. This is one of my favorite films ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amelie","review":"I just enjoyed the move Amelie so much. I thought that the Cinematography was wonderful. All the vivid colors brought the world of Amelie to life before my and the rest of the viewers eyes. I liked the way most of the story was told out of Amelie's thoughts. This technique helped us understand Amelie. Amelie is a must see for everyone whether the understand French or not the subtitles are easy to read and understand!P.S. The garden gnome was the best!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment.","review":"After reading the endless rave reviews here I was eager to experience this charming, delightful film. Well, I managed to watch the first hour and fifteen minutes before giving up on it. Yes, it looks beautiful, that's why I gave it two stars instead of one. I guess I'm a Phillistine or something, but wow, this is one *boring* movie. I dozed off several times and had to rewind the DVD to see if I had missed anything interesting, but I hadn't. Even after over an hour I still didn't care the slightest bit about anyone or anything in the movie, so I just took it out of the player.My recommendation: if you must see this, rent, don't buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Why not a 5-star movie?","review":"Simple: there's no French subtitle. Although I don't speak French but my french speaking friend told me that the dialogues are a lot more than the simplified English translation. Watching this movie makes me want to learn French and what better way to learn it than from learning what they are saying in Amelie?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why not for everyone?","review":"I rented this movie with high hopes. And in many ways it did deliver. The cinematography is fantastic. The storyline is certainly fanciful and charming. Audrey Tautou is gorgeous and well cast for this film. It had everything I look for in a movie. For all of these I give 5 stars.The disappointment for me is the fact that this is not a movie I can share with my kids, (ages 17,15,12). This is the type of film I would like to foster an appreciation for in my kids, but I can't own it. Why?... The sexual content is extreme by even liberal accounts. Over the top... the most sexual R rated movie I have ever seen. There seems to be no need for such extreme sexuality in this storyline. I would love for film makers to understand the importance of making artful presentations for everyone. I think our society could benefit greatly by such imagination, and good hearted humor. Give me the PG version of Amelie any day."},{"rating":"1","title":"So dang cute I can't stand it","review":"Well, I suppose the people who love this film about an impish gamine pixie and the ones who don't will just have to agree to disagree. While many feel that director Jean-Pierre Jeunet displays a light, joyful touch in this film, I felt that he was trying to cram his sense of whimsy down my throat and I couldn't help gagging on it. When I feel that my life is lacking in cuteness, I have some pictures of kittens sitting in baskets that I can look at instead of spending a couple of hours with this film.But then, I don't like \\"E.T.\\" either, so clearly I am out of step with what warms the cockles of most movie-goers' hearts. So bear that in mind when you are deciding whether to pay attention to this review."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kinda dumb","review":"I really didn't see what all the hype was about. This was way too cutsie for me. There were some funny parts, not that many."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm not 100%","review":"But I think this was a copy of a DVD. I'm probably 90% sure.

If you are afraid of subtitles, you don't have to worry with this film, the charm and beauty of this film sweeps you right to the heart of the humanity and love Amelie opens her life to! Very Charming!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better every time I watch it","review":"I've seen this movie three times, and it's interesting to note what I thought of the movie each time. At first viewing, I thought that this was one of the strangest films I had ever seen. It was beyond different -- it forged an entirely new trail in moviemaking. At the end I thought to myself, \\"well, that was interesting.\\"Then I viewed it again on DVD. This time I began to appreciate the subtle storyline, and the brilliant colors on screen. I began to relate to the character(s) more.The third time I saw it, I finally understood why this movie got such high reviews and praise from critics. It is a work of art, a classic, that should adorn the shelves of any DVD collection. If anything, get it because it's in French, and you'll look more intelligent than the average one-language-only American."},{"rating":"2","title":"The movie that makes you HAPPY","review":"Everything is in the title of the review, this movie makes you the happiest person in the world. A formidable example of movies made in Europe. You'll love the actress, you'll love the story, you'll love the whole atmosphere... 5 nominations for the Oscars, a lot of rewards all over the world (France, England, Italy, Spain, Germany, Japan ....). 2 Hours of pure happiness, simply."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"Amelie was a big disappointment to me. The story started off very strongly and I was looking forward to seeing the rest of this film. However, after everybody telling me to watch this film, I did and thought that it is vastly overrated. Maybe, I thought this film and the main character would be 'deeper' than it was. This film is basically a film about how a boy gets to go out with a girl - as simple and as predictable as that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much visual images that actually disintegrate a story","review":"What I wanted was to relax and enjoy a thoughtful French film, but felt confused and deceived by visual politics.But greatly relieved from reading comments with one star. Yes, I'm not the only one who is critical, but I truly agree with the comments.Is this a film related with an idea such as POSTMODERNISM?Maybe the director's ambition (and competence) would be actualized more successfully in making advertisements but not telling a story."},{"rating":"1","title":"YAWN!","review":"Now I am ready for beddy bye. I gave it 45 minutes of my time. I was bored from the start. Very odd movie. One of the first irritating things about the movie was the constant narration. I suppose the movie is supposed to be funny. I did not laugh!I did not find anything enjoyable about the film. I also could not watch the Royal Tennenbaums. Although the stories are different the films both have the narration and odd characters. Just not my thing I guess!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why put a movie on DVD?","review":"There are a number of reasons for using the DVD format... They allow for all types of features to suit all types of viewers...One Feature that is a MUST for foreign language films is to have a language track for the intended audience... This DVD lacks that basic feature and made initial viewing less than enjoyable... I guess, once I learn French or am able to retain the written dialog for the entire movie, I will enjoy the movie upon further viewing...The makers of \\"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\\" Did their DVD the right way and I recommend that all makers follow that example..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amelie is a psycho","review":"She's not cute, any twenty-something girl that would act in this way is clearly psychotic. I suppose we, the audience, are supposed to think she is an adorable, free-spirit type...but she's just completely insane, and should be thrown into prison.Some of the rapid-fire comic bits were a bit funny...but VERY few. I never for a second cared about where the plot (haha...plot) was going, or about any of the \\"kooky\\" characters. I couldn't bring myself to watch this until the end. That's my definition of a one-star film."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best movies ever!","review":"This is a fantastic movie: fun, bright, humorous, fast-paced, romantic, and fantastical. The main character is a sweet girl who lives in a world of dreams. During the journey of this movie, she learns to live in reality by helping others live their dreams. It is a beautiful movie with a lot of heart. This is one of my favorite movies!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Surprised","review":"I'm not a fan of foreign film or any kind of \\"artsy\\" film in general. I like movies where things blow up, killers with hockey masks wield machete's, or elves, dwarves, and men take on the ultimate evil from Mordor. Not to mention the boy who lived, the one who must take on Mr. Smith, or heroes in spandex.So when my wife all but twisted my arm to watch this film for our movie night, I wanted to hate this film. I frowned and nearly threw a tantrum prior to cueing the movie. I'm glad I did!This movie was awesome. No explosions, no heroes, and no horcruxes or elves, but funny, full of charm, and capable to convert even the most ardent slasher film nut into a fan.I can't imagine a soul on Earth who wouldn't like this movie once they make the decision through choice or spousal force to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's all good ....","review":"This movie is beautiful in every sense of the word . After I watched it , I found myself wondering why Hollywood can't make more movies like this one . While all of the blockbuster films here are centered around killing , drugs , and sex without love , Amelie is an incredibally moving story about a young woman who truly desires to help people . It show us how a single act of kindness can change lives . Isn't that something we should all keep in mind ? Oh yeah ,... Audrey Tautou is the cutest star in cinema and you can't help adoring her ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good international movie","review":"I was really happy with this movie. I showed it for an international movie night and the cinematography was different then what is seen in American movies and I really like that."},{"rating":"2","title":"different, happy, and fun","review":"The ups and downs of Amelie made a interesting story. It ignores a traditional movie format, with whimsey, and a good balance of magic in a modern world. Light hearted and Fun, I was entertained and pulling for Amelie the whole way.A movie which might have been overlooked by many, which makes it a great addition to a dvd collection, you'll always have something people haven't seen, and it's appriote for most company.AO"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kookie Masterpiece","review":"Ive only rented this - so on dvd features i cannot comment.

All my other blu-rays play fine.It's a shame because I was really hoping to appreciate the beautiful cinematography in high quality. I got it on sale for $9, so it's not worth my time to return. Very disappointed, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sacre Bleu!","review":"\\"Amelie\\" is fun and sweet and entertaining. There are some nice touches, but overall, it's too just too cutesy. The film is this year's \\"Chocolat.\\" In fact, although this is a 'French' film, it's more like a mainstream film with subtitles."},{"rating":"1","title":"The most overrated movie I've ever seen","review":"I had expected this movie to be great, given all that I'd heard about it, but it goes nowhere. Not every movie has to have a plot, but every movie should have a _point_. (Am I supposed to be happy that she winds up with the porn-shop guy? How sweet.) What really ruins it for me, though, are the pointless references to Princess Diana's death that seem to be there only to make fun of people who were upset by it and Diana, for not being \\"worthy\\" of their grief.One star because I can't give it zero."},{"rating":"2","title":"You don't have to be a fan of foreign movies","review":"Wow. This movie was so unusual, the visual style was so lush and gorgeous, the story was so captivating. Even my husband, who won't sit still for subtitled movies, liked it and chuckled a few times as I saw him watch the movie over his newspaper! (And, not to take anything away from either actress, but Audrey Tautou reminded me of another famous Audrey. She had that same \\"je ne sais quoi\\". That's the limit of my high school French!) The movie has what is missing in so many American movies and that is multi-layers-- mini-stories that don't detract from the main story but add a lot to it. The only bad thing I can say was I had a heck of a time accessing the subtitles and getting them in English. Maybe the DVD (a rental) had a glitch in it but it wasn't a very friendly menu and unfortunately, I don't understand French well enough to follow it in a movie. Liked the music, too. And what a city Paris looks like in this movie! Check it out and give it a chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enchanting and Gorgeous","review":"Amelie is yet another example of how bland movies have become. Not only is the film funny and engaging; it is also gorgeous, an artistic masterpiece. The use of contrast and color, the filming and camera use, and of course the digital filming to bring it all out...it shows just how much dullness and monotony fester in Hollywood. The acting was excellent, especially Audrey Tautou's charming performance. The movie was great in so many ways, especially since I am a French student."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy the soundtrack too ...","review":"Missed this film somehow in the cinema. Bought the DVD because someone told me of the beginning with the fly and it's 14,000x beats per minute being squashed by a car, so I thought that can't be a bad film ;). The gnome is priceless ...I won't go over the cinematography or story, the MUSIC in this film alone makes it's worth buying. Beautiful soundtrack, this always completes a great film."},{"rating":"2","title":"As good as it gets","review":"American filmmakers should take their cue from this extremely well made romantic comedy which makes almost every Hollywood project look formulaic and trite. It is beautifully realized with imaginative writing, exquisite cinematography, excellent direction, and perfect casting. Jeunet has reached a pinnacle in his style and storytelling, creating a brilliant work teeming with art, poetry, comedy, and love.Even if romanic comedies generally stick in your craw (as they do with me) this one will make you realize that it can be done sucessfully and beautifully. SEE IT!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"MISS ADVENTURE","review":"I WASN'T SURE WHAT I WAS ABOUT TO WATCH BUT AS IT PLAYED, I BEGAN TO LIKE IT A LOT AS THE MOVIE WENT ON. AMELIE WAS VERY FUNNY IN MANY DIFFERENT WAYS.

I assumed it to be one among the plethora of must see foreign movies that have come into the spotlight in more recent times. However, I was proved wrong.Amelie is a simple story told in a unique and stylish way. I am inclined to think that at least a part of its charm is to do with the fact that it is in French but this is just one little thing. I like the attention to detail in the film, the way the narrator introduces characters telling the audience his or her likes and dislikes.Tautou does a very good job, she is very comfortable in her character and is very well cast."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really really tried to like it","review":"What is up with all the fuss? The fan-club reviews here have me all excited before I watched it. It did nothing for me. Didn't inspire me. Didn't make me laugh. Didn't make me think. Didn't entertain me. I did like the green and beautiful scenery and the cute girl. Except for that scene where the little girl kept messing with the tv antenna to get back at the person who made her believe she was responsible to all those car crashes by taking pictures with her camera, the movie did not have any other funny moment. It's not for me. Please wake me up when it's over. Thanks."},{"rating":"2","title":"C'est tres bon!","review":"J'aime ce film ! C'est le meilleur film que j'ai vu dans un long temps.

The main reason why it's great: it focusses on the details of life. The joy of skipping stones. All the other little things that make life worth while. It's a great fairy tale about the way in which you can manipulate your life in a subtle way. It's a shame to tell you more, except that we are talking about a feel-very-good-movie.It's a bit warmer then Delicatessen or The City of Lost Children."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites!","review":"I can't say enough about this movie!

I have seen it only once, and must go back. It is a movie that one cannot completely take in at one viewing.Audrey Tautou, the actress who plays Amelie, seems to have been born for the role. Her portrayal reminds me of Audrey Hepburn, in \\"Roman Holiday.\\" She has the ability to become a legendary performer.This film captured my total attention, and took my mind off present concerns and the world situation. The film is masterfully done, with the special effects complimenting the story of a very shy young woman, who gets pleasure from helping others, but ignores her own needs.This is a must see. The English subtitles do not detract, because this film speaks the universal language of human fulfillment in loving others as we love ourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful acting and the main female character","review":"The filM askS you to love it and you enjoy it but I got the the mistrust to the situaton when it is so sweet intentions of youth got into unbelievable conclusion, which is in real life possible and did happened to me in the past but I felt that it is for the mystery of Life to play God not for the movie producer.

Do not let the American marketers ruin this film for you. It is not a \\"chick-flick\\" or a sappy romantic comedy. It is wonderful on many levels; smart enough to be brilliant without being depressing. This is, in many ways, the \\"feel good movie of the year\\", but it is such without being flighty or dumbing. I can watch it over and over, and besides the film, there are the wonderful and rich special features--not just outtakes or bloopers. They can tell you how they made this movie and you will still be amazed."},{"rating":"2","title":"This film makes me feel better about life!","review":"Amelie is a very cute and charming character, with whom I feel a affinity with. And it is as though this love story mimics my own. It is a very touching story, and truly does make me incredibly happy about the world. It makes me think that there just may be some goodness in it. Its the one of the mot uplifting movies I have ever seen. And the french look, and sounds make it all the more better and more enjoyable. A look which is truly unique, colorful and beautiful.

This is one that will be seen throughout the century and, if we're lucky, will inspire a new generation of film makers....I can hardly wait."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heavenly!","review":"I don't know, but after seeing \\"Amelie\\", I just suddenly had this overwhelming craving for strawberries with cream. The stylized imagery of \\"Amelie\\" is simply delicious and lush, from the opening credits to the end. It is nothing like real life; it is reality that could only happen in film. And only in film as only the French could do it.Wide-eyed Audrey Tautou is wonderful as Amelie in this storybook-like story. Amelie is a 23-year-old waitress working in a Paris cafe, but she might as well be Madeline, that popular little denizen of Paris, for all her mischief and her child-like eagerness to make things right for other people. A very unlikely story for a very jaded world. But director Jean-Pierre Jeunet is a genius for pulling it off , and the score by Yanni Tiersen is a gem ( a must-buy--just listening to it conjures images of Paris sidewalks and cafes).See \\"Amelie\\", and helplessly fall in love."},{"rating":"2","title":"french beauty","review":"hauntingly beautiful. it's probably the best movie of the year. and, if it isn't that good for you, well, it is one of the best movies I VE SEEN. it spreads like a disease in your soul. but don't be afraid, because it just maybe amelie somewhere, sending you messages with a mirror, or throwing some stones in the river.and for me, that is a really nice thoughtthis is one of the few movies you'll find (i've only seen 4 of them in my life) that really makes you wonder and say \\"this is what movies are made for\\" or even \\"this is what life is for\\" ... forget about \\"a beautiful mind\\" and shrek and all that stuff. when you see this you will find you need nothing else. this is true, and just like everything that is true, it is truely beautiful."},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie is adorable! Much more than a chick flick!","review":"I think Audrey Tautou is an amazing actress and her abilities transcend language barriers. This film is sweet and is so touching that you find yourself losing track of time and believing so much in everything that happens. Even having to read the translated dialogue tag at the bottom throughout because my French isn't the best, the whole thing flows so well you forget you're reading along. I highly recommend not only this film but also anything Audrey Tautou does - she is simply charming. This is definitely one to own and have in your library. Plus that, any film that can integrate a garden gnome into the plotline should get two thumbs up!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The angelic waitress","review":"Amelie Poulain, a waitress at a Paris cafe, grew up with \\"a neurotic mother (who committed suicide) and an iceberg father,\\" so she withdrew into her imaginative and shy self. She finds her gift, which is to bestow joy and serendipity upon the least suspecting people through creatively contrived circumstances--her apartment concierge, a blind man, and even her father. At first whimsical, light hearted and winsome, the film takes a final, poignant turn when Amelie must learn to accept love and joy for herself. Amelie earned five Oscar nominations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Movie","review":"We enjoyed the movie about overcoming fear and embracing life and its attendant messes immensely and found it life-affirming, lovely and charming."},{"rating":"2","title":"Subtle, at times hilarious and touching. Great entertainment.","review":"A film about the anomie and search for meaning and happiness in a modern urban setting. Many excellent character studies by supporting cast and the tale of Amelie at it's core. Audrey Tautou is remarkable and possessor of probably the most mischievous grin in captivity. Great Parisian locations and a plot that moves along nicely. I chose Blu-ray version for better picture detail and durability because I will probably watch this film many times. There is more to this film than just the humor but even on that level alone it is exceptional."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favourite movie of all time!","review":"Wow! It's amazing to see a comedy that doesn't slip into two dimensional characters and toilet humour days (the new Austin Powers movie leaps to mind). 'Amelie' shows an intellegence and maturity in it's humour not seen in American movies, and you come out of watching this movie with a lust for life and feeling the magic of being alive. Arthouse films aren't my key area of interest, but trust me, like the Italian film 'Life Is Beautiful' you'll forget your watching a subtitled movie within five minutes.A wonderful film that has no faults, and will make you laugh whilst not making fun of anyone. Every person in this has his/her own story and eccentricity, and the movie oozes richness and wealth of character."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's the greatest movie of all times","review":"I lived in France last year and I was able to see this movie about 10 times. It's storyline is so good and realistic that everyone should see it. The story about Amelie deals with realistic fears and depicts the real essence of the French culture. The DVD is really good and I'm glad that it wasn't totally dubbed into english (otherwise it would have lost it's original interest). I could buy it with spanish and english subtitles to share this touching story with all my friends and family!

It did more than that, it also broadened my horizons as a writer. I didn't know anything so unique was possible. This is a masterpiece!

Why did \\"Amelie\\" lose the Oscar for Best Foreign Film over the boring \\"No Man's Land\\"? Nobody knows."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charmed!","review":"A very charming movie with a charming lead. Made me think a little of the early Holly Golightly. But, this is a very French movie, filled with engaging situations carried along by a light, affecting story.

It is a movie you can watch over and over again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Favourite Movie","review":"This is my favourite movie ever. Amelie is the sweetest person and her good deeds are inspiring.

What a waste of time it turned out to be! Don't get me wrong, Audrey Tatou is an awesome actress, but this movie was awful! Half the time the movie made no sense and was filled with awkard moments that left you wondering \\"What the heck was that about?\\". The one good lesson the movie seemed to want to convey was to not let life pass you by, but the movie went about it in such a roundabout way, it made for a terrible movie experience. If you're into foreign films, skip this one; it's not worth the time to watch it."},{"rating":"1","title":"too sweet","review":"This is a romantic comedy (aka chick flick) with extra sugar added in. By the virtue of being foreign, it is more interesting and refreshing than the usual Julia Roberts movies.Yet it is even cuter, and much more childish. It has some sickly sweet quality that is hard to describe. It is a long movie where tiny little cute things happen, and Amelie just blinks with her huge eyes. This is like a funnier version of the movie Magnolia - but still there is something not-so-subtly depressing about those childishly naive and one-sided characters.I went to see a movie that I had hears was good, but neither me nor my date liked it. What astounded me is that later it grew more and more famous and hyped up, and all of my friends like it!By the way, camera work, colors, imagery are very good.

It is very annoying when you play it the second time or after."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Dream Worth Watching","review":"Though redundant in some aspects (many times throughout a point is driven home repeatedly), this movie is a great way to spend a rainy sunday afternoon. Typical love story with some new twists. In a word, cute."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cooky and Funny","review":"Amelie is a cooky, funny and entertaining movie. The various subplots help the entire movie come together and make it special and sweet. If you don't speak Frencch you must pay attention to the subtitles otherwise you can miss important points in the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stereotypic French film","review":"Are all French films the same? This plot was predictable and not that enticing. I didn't find this uplifting (If this is uplifting, I don't want your life.) either, but was amazed at how many people there are with no life. If this is the French idea of sex, how boring! If this is a typical French life, ditto!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cookie-cutter Chick Flick","review":"If this was a US movie it would have been lost among the other chick flicks but because its French we are supposed to act like its above the rest. I thought they tried too hard to make Amelie likable so it ended up making her really annoying. The love story was totally Hollywood style pipe dream take on love but based on two freaks finding each other, both of whom I couldn't care less about.On the other hand, the supporting characters were interesting and provided some funny scenes so I'm giving it two stars for that. But otherwise this was rubbish."},{"rating":"1","title":"French cinema for the MTV Generation","review":"Yes the visual style is interesting though overdone but far more time was spent on the look of the film than the actual content. I'm not so sure what is charming about Amelie or her eventual relationship with the porn shop worker, the bad comedy about Princess Di or sneaking into someone's house and making them go insane - the director spent so much time trying to make everyone \\"quirky\\" that they are just caricatures."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely charming","review":"A larger then life, comical--yet charming--movie with the same sense of life as movies like 'Chocolat' and 'Life is Beautiful'. The colors in this movie are spectacular."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic !","review":"One of my favorite movies of all time.. This film gives you hope, happiness and joy to your heart.

If you like the simple pleasures in life this movie would be perfect for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"An enjoyable modern tale of discovery","review":"If your not the type to rent horror videos,and you have seen the same formula action movies over and over, this is for you. Amelie is a delightful story of how one young girl makes a discovery, becomes a do-gooder, and blossoms into adulthood. Splendidly cast without a single hollywood regular to skew the experience. No crime scene investigation, or blood and guts. A movie for those who like a good story."},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie does for good deeds what Chocolat did for candy..","review":"This was one of the sweetest, most whimsical movies I've seen in a long time! Audrey Tautou (The Venus Beauty Institue) is absolutely beguiling as Amelie, an extremely shy and eccentric young woman. When Amelie sees the delight she brings to a man after she anonymously returns his long-lost box of childhood treasures, she devotes her life to helping others find this same joy. While Amelie is doing all of these good deeds, she discovers a young man as charmingly eccentric as she is, but can she find the courage to bring herself the same happiness she has brought to so many others?"},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT!","review":"This is a beautiful movie that I can't stop watching. The story is so unique and heartwarming and the cinematography is AMAZING!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb!","review":"This is the best movie I've seen in a long time. This is the kind of movie that's going to leave a smile on your face after seeing it, and every time that you think back to it, the mere thought will make you smile. Tautou plays a child in an adult's body, the mentality and wonder of everyday life are brilliantly executed. How could you not love this movie?"},{"rating":"2","title":"a modern-day fairytale","review":"'Amelie' is probably the sweetest film I have ever seen. Although I usually like movies to have a bit more of an 'edge' (a film such as Jeux d'Enfants, for example, Yann Samuell 2003 - I consider that to be sort of the perverse counterpart to Amelie), I simply loved this modern fairytale. It has a nice story, beautiful images, with beautiful colours, and one of the best soundtracks I know. All this blends perfectly together to make a very romantic movie, you should definitely watch while being in love, or something."},{"rating":"1","title":"too long and boring","review":"I fell asleep when I was watching it.

There were subtitles, but my DARN TV wasn't formatting the video properly so the subtitles were partially cut off.

Highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amelie","review":"I love love love this movie! I saw it first on Hulu and immediately fell in love with it!It is a sweet story and I play it quite often to boost my mood.And did I mentioned it is French spoken with English subtitles? Sometimes I play it just to hear that beautiful language. All together I am very happy with my purchase,it was delivered within a time frame that I was given by the seller and in a perfect condition!I have already purchased quite a few items from this seller and have been always satisfied with the condition and speedy delivery of all of the items.

Hamlow's review of Amelie resemble Mario's review of amelie saying about the star of chocolat???..personally i prefer Marios! Amelie is a movie that pulls on your heartstrings,plays with your emotionjs and leavers you with a feeling oif happiness and pride. Like mario, said the lead actress does everything right! she is so cute and perfect for the lead of Amelie Poulan, who takes us on a journey of love, revenge and taking a deep look at our lives and souls...one of the best movies ive ever seen..whats next Jean-pierre-jeunet?????"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my fave movies...","review":"I don't have a huge DVD collection because I am very picky about the movies I purchase.

She finds a box with old mementos and returns it to the rightful owner. She then decides to embark on a mission of doing good things for people.. Will she find love in the process? You'll have to see it.

I loved it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Magical","review":"Breathtaking cinematography, amazing acting and a fabulous story. Utterly enchanting. After each time I watch this movie I am determined to see things I don't normally see in my every day life.

After this movie, you will become a regular \\"do-gooder\\" yourself.ENJOY!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The only reason I saw this movie was for extra credit in my French class. The plot is interesting (and weird) but was very poorly executed. The acting is very bad, because it is poorly written. I would advise against seeing this movie; in theaters or when it comes out on video. It is a waste of time. Definitely overrated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amelie is a dog.","review":"The only thing to recommend this FLICK is some cute special effects. Which is like recommending a restaurant because it has colorful table cloths. It has no story line, no substance, and unless you speak French it is very hard to follow. Don't waste your time, there are too many 'good' movies out there to see. I wouldn't even recommend this movie for 'rent and take home' for a dollar."},{"rating":"1","title":"a stinker like the streets of paris","review":"What could be more irritating than a shy busy body who's idea of happiness is manipulating peoples interaction with each other. God help us if Amelie was a male, any number of stalking laws may be seen as violated. If you want want you French movie experience to be all quaint streets, homely cafes, street markets and bagettes then enjoy all the cliches this fantasy has to offer. My jaded memory of Paris is still the smell of dog poop on the streets and $6 coffees (and that was in the 80's)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"This movie should never be watched by anyone.

It's thoughtful, charming, and emotionally realistic. For once a movie has a refreshing character such as Amelie, who falls in love but never loses her independence for the sake of a hackneyed romance plot. By giving this movie a five-star rating, I mean that this movie is flawless in every way. See this movie by any means necessary."},{"rating":"2","title":"C'était vraiment un bon film!","review":"J'ai vu ce film tout à fait 2 fois au cinema - à ce moment, je l'attends sur DVD. Si vous ne regardez pas un autre film cette année, allez très vite au cinema pour voir \\"Le fabuleux destin d'Amélie Poulain.\\" (Le titre a été coupé aux pays dehors de la France).La cinematographie est si belle et les personnages sont emotives.Allez-y, sans hésitation!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Most Interesting Movie","review":"I loved this movie. It was really strange and awkward which kept me interested in it the whole time. It's a very sweet movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny","review":"I have seen this too many times. It is so cute and funny. Amelie is an intriguing character that draws you into her world and leaves you wanting more."},{"rating":"2","title":"A well made film","review":"I found this film witty and intelligent, encapsulating French culture and humour. It shows the beauty and joy that can be found in helping others, as well as the benefits of courage and coming out of your shell. It's a nice break from typical hollywood films. A film is not a bad film because it fails promote American idealism. I think it's a great film, even if it doesn't try to capture the audience by big explosions, sexy women or popular culture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"If you like foreign films, you will love this. You can watch it over and over and see something that you hadn't seen before. I can't say it is a comedy, but it has its moments."},{"rating":"2","title":"Do you like quirky fun?","review":"Audrey Tautou is totally irresistible and irrepressible in this extraordinarily funny French film. Comparisons with \\"Run, Lola, Run\\" are in order, and anyone who enjoyed \\"Run\\" must not miss this movie. No surprise here that it has received a nomination for Best Foreign Film. The plot is full of delightfully unanticipated twists and turns, and stellar contributions from an all-around excellent cast keep the wheels turning without a single lull."},{"rating":"1","title":"cute kitsch","review":"a cute film, worth the price of admission but not that much more. It was irritating to see my city shown in such kitschy form. You just cannot walk around these neighbourhoods without seeing a substantial portion of the population as black or arab... many other such minor details that irritate a parisian."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lolo - a brainless maniac underneath a bridge on Sekwana","review":"If this movie was so typical so many French people would not go and see it.There is no doubt that this is the best film of the past year. There hasnt been a movie like that with the story so simple but also so beautiful told. It is a 21st Century Fable. If Lolo wants to find essence of humanity I recommend Martin Heidegger."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites!","review":"Amelie is one of my favorite movies! It is about life, love, attitude and going out of one's self to make a happier life for others. Audrey Tautou is perfect as Amelie... besides being adorable, her facial expressions do much to add to the feel of her character and the comical quirkiness of the movie. It is a celebration of mysteries and little miracles within the magical essence of Paris, with scenes of extremely unique and charming cinematography.I also very much enjoyed watching the additional disc with Audrey's screen test and cast interviews."},{"rating":"2","title":":D","review":"It is a fantastic french movie!it arrived in no time and I can now watch it as many times as I please."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amelie","review":"Sent it to me right away after it was the wrong item the first time! Thanks for excellent service."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didnt like this one, but someone else obviously does","review":"I like quirky movies and I am an open minded person. However, I thought this movie sucked. Maybe because I was reading French for two hours at one o clock in the morning. I thought that the characters were very bizarre, and Amelie couldn't seem to make up her mind about some things that were quite obvious to the viewer. I heard that this was a romantic and fairy tale like movie. If that is what youre looking for, I'd check out chocolat. The characters are wonderful, johnny depp is totally hot in it, and it has a nice story line."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally overrated French art flick","review":"This is a movie that will solve anybody's constipation. Except for the traveling gnome, and a few funny moments, this movie is overrated. If you like the director's other films (City of Lost Children, Delicatessen, etc.), then you'll like this. For me, it felt like hours to watch this thing. Yes, it was beautifully photographed, but the story, attempting to be cute and engaging, falls short."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amélie","review":"Amélie was recommended to me by a French girl as a truly magical movie. Now, I've seen more than my ration of French Movies. Generally French movies meander aimlessly for 90 to 120 minutes then end abruptly. Script seems to be written only after the consumption of copious amounts of wine. And distilled water would make a far stronger plot. This is not simply my opinion, it's a proven scientific fact. Amélie was no exception. Absolutely typical of the French ideas of love and romance. The neurotic and frankly insane methods, which she uses to TRAP her romantic interest, were so ridiculously contrived that I just wanted to hit the television with a baseball bat. Oh GOD, why didn't I listen to my own gut and avoid that festering pile of garbage! From now on I'll think very carefully before approaching another mainstream French movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Matilda for Grownups","review":"Wonderful, whimsical, and funny with brilliant cinematography. Eccentric yet universal story of a lonely girl, Amelie, who finds love and purpose in the most unexpected way. I couldn't help but think of Roald Dahl's Matilda. Brilliant work from the man who gave us \\"City of Lost Children\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"the mundane has a magic all its own","review":"Director Jean-Pierre Jeunet is a master of his craft--pure and simple. His ability to make even the most mundane situations and twist and turn them into something magical is beyond fantastic.And if this movie doesn't want you to hop on a plane and go to Montmartre in Paris to experience this world of Amelie, then there is no hope for you.As far as the DVD, it's well worth it for the extras (and fret not, most of the stuff is in English). The \\"Look of Amelie\\" shows how precise and prepared the director was and the cinematographer actually steals the show with his explanation of various shots and scenes. There is more--funny outtakes, screen tests (hey, why don't more DVDs thorw those on?), a couple of Q&A;'s with the cast and crew as well as a nice face-to-face with Jeunet himself.The entire package is well worth having."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quirky and Adorable! Love It!","review":"This movie is so quirky it'll make anybody happy. It's artistic, stylish, cute, fantastical and grounding all at once.It's a must-see for any quirky artist, or french-loving person.I'll admit on the cover her picture kind of scares me, but she is Audrey Tautou adorable :]"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"If you are depressed and want to refresh your mind with some positive thoughts and energy, watch this movie.

Enjoy..."},{"rating":"2","title":"a beautiful, quiet story of lives intertwined, love and destiny","review":"The story of the traveling garden knome is shown here.Audrey's very cute in this movie and it introduced American audiences to her before the whole Da Vinci thing. At least they got a french actress for the role - although I envisioned someone older and with red hair for that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magical Movie","review":"No doubt we'd be more suspicious of a good-natured film like this were it not made outside the US by people who can make us believe. Audrey Tatou is the prettiest and most expressive female face to make an entrance on the international scene in a long time. This is a beautiful, whimsical, and yes, quirky (yet not irksome) movie about loneliness, imagination, love, and courage.The lush, glowing red, green, and blue of Montmarte creates the kind of Parisian fantasy and fantastic Paris everyone conjures in their dreams. Only talented (relative)unknowns can get away with performances like this one, and they make waiting for them worthwile. The art direction, editing, and effects are also first-rate.The DVD has the usual set of goodies like director's commentary, interviews, and other junk. Widescreen version was crisp and vibrant. So see this movie and allow yourself to be seduced by its charm."},{"rating":"2","title":"Be Happy!","review":"To get this out of the way, yes, 'Amelie' is a French film, complete with subtitles and a slightly different set of goals and priorities for director Marc Caro than would be found in a blockbuster from Hollywood. That said, 'Amelie' is a stunningly magnificent film focusing on the happiness that may be found for the protagonist for which the film is named, played perfectly by Audrey Tatou.Caro and Jeunet have teamed up before to bring such magnificent films to life asThe City of Lost ChildrenandDelicatessen. In 'Amelie' the team brings another serving of their visual stylings that are easily described as a painting brought to life through film.The soundtrack, coloring, filming techniques, characters, and set design combine to forcefully and gracefully portray the simple life of this waitress from Montmarte and what little things are necessary in order for her to become a happy person."},{"rating":"2","title":"I adore this movie","review":"I was skeptical about this movie knowing that it was in french so I needed to watch it with English subtitles, but after watching this, it is my new favorite movie. This movie is so delightful and I feel like I can relate to Amelie so well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enzyme cleaner for hummingbird feeders","review":"Sure beats using vinegar and salt or a soak in water with a little bleach. Still requires a little work with a bottle brush to knock the black junk off in most cases. But overall I would say a very effective cleaner with a pleasant smell - no residual odor left behind. It is pricey unless you check out your sources on the internet for better deals. Don't buy the first time you see the product come up - shop around. Most sources I checked were a whole lot less expensive than the manufacturer's web price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Old item sell as new","review":"It is an old item but the seller sell it as new. And it does not work, does not charge the batteries, I have tried it for several batteries. None of them are charged. Very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A remake of the classic, but with less durability","review":"I loved the game in its original form, and do not think it has improved because of its modernizations. However, since the original is not generally available, this game serves its purpose well. It's fun, it does not take long to teach. My ten year old learned the game well after a couple of run throughs.A good strategy game aims for a balance between realism and playability.

I had to enlarge the slot and now it works fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"RV Breaker Box","review":"Couldn't find this locally when I decided to set up a dedicated supply for my RV. Amazon had this and at a very good price. They offer another box without a breaker but this setup is my preference."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good intention, so-so results","review":"This film probably received criticism that was slightly more scathing than it deserved. I am not certain that viewers recognized it for the slapsticky satire that it was meant to be. Nonetheless, I found it gasping for consistency through most of the movie. Unlike the Naked Gun or Airplane, this film often concealed the director's satiric intent. And the satire that did shine through was usually a bit too blunt and obvious, and just plain lacking in humor. Anyone who did not laugh at the scene in which Lovitz and Carrera posed as restaurant waitstaff towards the end of the movie, however, needs to have their funny bone examined! I was in stitches! I would still not necessarily recommend a viewing of this movie for this scene alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jon Lovitz sizzles.","review":"This erotic thriller takes you from the classroom to the bathroom with Jon Lovitz's steamy sultry exotic body and Tia Carrera's dramatic reprise. This is a must see for anyone who likes thrilling films such as \\"Skyscraper\\" and \\"The Godfather\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie is WAY too exagerated","review":"Like I said, this movie is the worst. The overexagerated sterotypes of High School are almost insulting. I think what happened is that someone saw National Lampoon's Senior Trip, thought it was good, and made a bad opposite of it. If you liked Senior Trip, you will probably hate this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best movie ever created!!!!!!!!! HILARIOUS !!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Just to say right off the bat, this has definitly got to be the greatest movie ever. A definite keeper. This movie is totally worth buying or renting.

Absolutely the worst movie ever made. Mekhi Phifer is one of my favorite character actors, and to have him cast in a movie of this low caliber is just regretable. The stereotypical humor was insulting and was not funny. The only thing keeping me from rating this film below a negative five is the fact that the sound and picture quality are good."},{"rating":"2","title":"DJMasterK - This movie is NOT Widescreen!!!","review":"Yes, it is true.

Tia Carrerre did a wonderful job playing an talentless teacher. After such wonderful performances as the bad girl in True Lies, and the naked chick in Rising Sun, I was surprised at how little cleavage she showed in this movie. If you find stupid humor funny, than this movie is for you.

I had a friend read a paragraph from one of the loves scenes and she literally laughed aloud, it was so ridiculous. The plot was painfully slow to develop and was really barely touched on by the author. It could have been a great book, but the author didn't delve nearly enough into the mystery of the Trace's past or into her former fiance's involvement in her dad's sudden passing.

Pascal's famous \\"bet\\" does not fit well with this born again account of evangelical revelation and certainty.

Mann never made an uninteresting film to watch, and neither did his frequent collaborator Alton. The other film, \\"Amazing Mr. X\\" (aka \\"The Spritualist\\") is one I was unfamiliar with. More minor in its craft and story (directed by Bernard Vorhaus)--but once again, there's that gorgeous Alton cinematography.Films from a minor studio like Eagle-Lion are unlikely to be rescued and elevated to demo material, but VCI has done these two justice. They're more than watchable--the versions to beat. Thank you, VCI. And keep up the great job!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD RESTORATION OF MR.

It seemed to be the best alternative to the tandem strollers. We were completely fooled. Once you put the carrier on the one side it basically spills into the other seat! My son was so cramped! The safety belts are complicated and you have to open and close them 75 times or oil them to get them to open/close easily. The carriage basket is way too small to store any sort of diaper bag. Also - buy a cup holder. There is no where to store a beverage for the parent. It is however light and WILL fit through doorways. In saying that, if I had the ability to return this stroller/carrier and get all of my money back I would do so in a heartbeat. Spend your money elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"In theory this would have been perfect...","review":"This is the only side-by-side double stroller that has the option of attaching an infant car seat while leaving the other seat available for another baby/toddler, and it is very lightweight... This was my dream come true UNTIL I actually tested it in the store!The stroller is incredibly flimsy. It shakes and wobbles (without a baby) and wasn't sturdy. It seemed to me like a piece of plastic junk. I was VERY disappointed in this stroller.I tested the other higher end double strollers- Peg Perego and McClaren. My recommendation/choice? Go with the McClaren Rally Twin or McClaren Twin Traveller... it's slightly cheaper than the Peg Perego and about the same price as the Combi. It was very sturdy, folded compactly and was overall my favorite - my daughter really enjoyed her test drive in it too. The only thing I didn't like about the McClaren was it doesn't come with a snack tray for the kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stuck with a heap of jumk","review":"After months of research, I thought I was purchasing the best double stroller out there.

I found the book inspiring but cannot imagine walking as much as she did through her pyrethrum plantations. It was especially interesting to me after visiting Rwanda."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fantastic piece of work!","review":"What an extraordinary piece of work by an extraordinary woman. I loved this book! I have read countless books about Africa and the people who lived there...and very few can compare. To think that Carr still lives in Rwanda today is incredible! It is a definite page-turner with detail so vivid, you feel like you are either experiencing the beauty and wonders of Rwanda, or unfortunately, the horrors of war. My intent in selecting this book was to learn more about the 1994 Genocide that occurred in Rwanda, which I did. But I also had the privilege of being taken into Carr's private world as well. Her description of her friendship with Dian Fossey was haunting and memorable. I highly recommend this book, and plan on reading it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love the look, but fell apart","review":"I received these under 60 days ago.

I wanted to avoid having to stir so much.As is required with this device, after I brought a pot of soup with quinoa in it to a boil on a burner without this device, I then placed it on a burner turned down to on low/simmer with this device on top of it. Unfortunately, I had to remove the pot of soup and put it on a regular burner after 45 minutes, because when sitting on this device, the quinoa inside the soup refused to cook! Normally it only takes 15 minutes for it to cook on a regular burner. It seemed as if it was never going to be anything but hard and uncooked if I left it on this diffuser.This problem, unfortunately, essentially renders the product useless to me for the main purpose for which I purchased it.I don't make pudding very often, so I can't say if it works for that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Item","review":"I use the heat diffuser daily for cooking on small inexpensive non-stick cookware.

In fact, one of the first uses she had started re-heating something and we went off and got distracted and she rushed back when she remembered only to find that the sauce was fine -- no issue with burning. Previously, she would have had a charred mess in the bottom of the pan.The only down side is that the handle \\"locks\\" in place and where it mounts is fairly flimsy. She couldn't figure out how it worked when it arrived, but that was because someone had opened the handle up and then folded it closed, without releasing the lock. The metal of the diffuser folded. The locking mechanism is fairly aggressive and a bit hard to deactivate with one hand.It does smell a bit when first used, the shiny coat burns off.

I was a bit disappointed in how the Robert issue was dealt with as well as the story with Joan and Edward- Joan was too trusting. Brianna was too staunch in some cases. Ms Henley really has a very graphic talent- I swear i was at Brianna and Christian's home.

This book is one of the first to try a dual romance and succeed. Well worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Only a Steamy Romance, but History Too","review":"\\"Desired\\" has something for everybody--fans of steamy loves scenes will find them in plentiful supply; fans of medievals will find tournaments, battles, and plenty of political scullduggery; fans of historicals will find some plausible (if not 100% accurate) information on that great English house, the Plantagenets. The love story, of course, takes precedence, and it has all of the misunderstandings, the longing looks, the fights and reconciliations, and the intimate wranglings anyone could ask for. So why don't I rate it a 10? For one, I found myself laughing during some of the sex scenes (I won't go in to details) and for another, I found the heroine a stubborn brat for most of the book. It's all well and good for a heroine to be stunningly beautiful, extremely talented, and kind to animals, but when she is annoyingly dense and rude about a perfectly good hero, I feel nothing but annoyed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Prince charming was less perfect than this hero","review":"I didn't like this book.I agree with previous reviewers who said the hero was too perfect and Brianna was too immature.The hero can do everything he has no weaknesses even superman is susceptible to kryptonite.I didn't like him reading the heroine's mind at all.Brianna was a little too dumb for my taste I don't know what else Roger could have done to make her realize he was evil.The supernatural thing was overdone as other reviewers have pointed out.This is my least favourite V.Henley that I've read so far.I like my heroes to have feet of clay."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE WORST BOOK I EVER READ!!!!","review":"This is the worst book I have ever read.

She compresses the events of a decade into two years and comes out looking like a rank amateur in the process. Her hero is an obnoxious beast without respect for the heroine, a young lady much too easily overcome by hormones to think in a coherent manner. Several historical innacuracies were enough for me to be disgusted overall by this incredibly bad book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unhappy Reader","review":"What was the whole point of this long book? If I'm still asking myself this question after reading 400 pgs Henley has not made me happy! Brianna was unappreciative of all Christian was offering her and I did not feel that she truly loved him. In most books love conquers all and if she was willing to marry Robert because of her guilt - then she didn't really love Christian.

It gives you an introduction to computer hacking, phreaking, etc. The book also talks about some of the people involved in such crimes and what they did.I would recommend this book to someone really young that wants a general overview on the topic. The only reason I read it is because it's the only book that my school library had."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd like a salami sandwich on wheat please.","review":"One of the first computer crime books I have read (freshman year in high school).

I started thumbing through it soon after it arrived, and couldn't stop reading. I've read books about music history before, but Mr. Nuzum has done a great job of making sense of music censorship. I was surprised at the number of music censorings throughout history and at how people didn't learn from the PMRC in 1985!

The problem is that there were too many fairly egregious factual errors. For instance, when he talks about nirvana's In Utero, he refers to it as their \\"second studio album\\" and references the \\"multiplatinum success of their debut album, Nevermind.\\" I know that doesn't have a lot to do with his argument, but it's not like Bleach is a particularly obscure or hard-to-find album...nailing basic facts about his subjects' histories would do a lot to add to the credibility of the rest of this book.

Thai food is nutritious, low in fat, and you just plain \\"feel better\\" after eating it. In this chapter, author John Ryan provides readers with a wealth of research documenting the relationship between Asia diets and health; and American meat diets and disease. A couple important points he makes: \\"Agriculture is the leading source of water pollution and the biggest water user in North America\\" (p.47). Eating less meat, more fish, rice and veggies can keep you healthier and help preserve our environment. And to those who think all thai food is \\"hot and spicy\\" - wrong! Take Ryan's advice and try a thai restaurant near you (there are many in America). You'll be glad you did.Even if you only read this one chapter of Ryan's book (complete with a Pad Thai simple recipe), you'll find it worthwhile.

The ingredients listed on the package include goat's milk, but the main ingredient is tallow--in other words, animal fat. It might or might not be tested on animals (I don't know), but it is definitely MADE of animals. I ordered this based on its good reviews and Amazon's categorization of it as cruelty-free. Since the ingredients are not listed in the product description as of this writing, and because repacking and returning items is a pain in the neck, I am mentioning it for those who might, like me, want to know."},{"rating":"1","title":"wrong product was sent","review":"I have been happy with all purchases I have made except this one.

What the PA person ahead of me in her review doesn't understand is the animal fat is from the milk itself.Not directly from the animal so it's benefits are plentiful and I would tend to agree with the properties this company claims. Works great after multi workout days in the hot MN summer. In the winter when the wind and cold just sap the mositure out of my face it is so refreshing. This past winter was the first one I have not experience the dry pathes that occur on my arms.Another benefit - the soap doesn't get mushy and if you have hard water it helps counter the affect of that water.

However, a dry winter gave me dry skin, and sparked my search for a better soap.Canus soap does a good job of combating dry skin. It didn't completely remedy the condition, but it certainly helped a great deal. Anytime I would use another soap my skin would feel like sandpaper. The soap has also done a good job of removing the little bumps on my upper arms. The bars last me about one month, and provide a good lather. I rather enjoy the scent, though some might find it slightly masculine.All things considered, I am sure there are superior soaps, but this is a good buy with good quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Do not buy this cd","review":"This is a really great cd, but just so everyone knows, it is not supposed to be for sale.

Kat Jones is a snarky, feisty, funny heroine who will keep you laughing until the end of the book. Great twist on taking a classic tale and making it fresh and new in a chick lit voice. The first person really allowed the reader to know Kat and walk alongside her through her adventure...and oh, what an adventure! This book is a fast-paced, fun read that'll have you cracking up. Kudos to the author for making it an adventurous ride. Definitely pick it up for summer beach reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"First of all, this book was written in first person, and it really needed to be in third. First person made the language feel awkward and I felt detached from Katy. There were also a lot of flaws with the writing in general. I got so tired of hearing designer brand names being dropped, and it ended up making Katy look stupid and self-absorbed.I wasn't impressed with Lancelot's character. I also hated how everything wrapped up neatly. All of a sudden Guen and Katy are BFF, and Katy gives Guen this ridiculous makeover. I don't even think that chapter was needed. To be honest, I didn't even want to finish reading the book. The only reason I did was because I felt guilty.I thought the ending was just as bad, and it obviously reads as a sequel--but no thanks. I'll pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terribly jeuvenile","review":"It seems like you either loved this book or you hated it. Unfortunately, I fall into the latter category and this was one of the few books that I put down without finishing. Kat seemed to be terribly immature for a 29 year old fashion editor : so much so that the title should have been \\" A Connecticut Valley Girl in King Arthur's Court, or Bill and Ted's excellent Adventure in King Arthur's Court. \\" Sorry, but I just couldn't get into it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much of what I expected","review":"I enjoy a good fun read, it's entertainment after all, and I expected this to be one. It is a good idea, and started off pretty much what I expected. But not to be too harsh, it soon became too much of what I expected. Too much pop culture references, although they were good ones, and too much selfishness on the part of Kat. An honorable man who bends the definition, and a queen that is too innocent and sweet to really hold the position. I know it's fiction and a time travelling one at that, but a little realistic behavior from the characters isn't too much to ask. I think once started I must finish it however I was glad to reach the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny Easy Time Travel Read","review":"So I got this book from my mom because I volunteered for a few years at a Renaissance Faire and I love humor and Romance Novels. It was right up my alley, its fun, funny and an easy quick read. I would not recommend this to folks who want some kind of true representation of King Arthur but lets face it there is so much legend mixed into those stories that I am not sure anyone can really separate the fact from the ficton. But I will say not to expect to feel you have exactly entered a previous time period, if you expect more of a historical fantasy experience than you may find it more enjoyable. It made me laugh which I really like....don't miss the sequel I think \\"A Hoboken Hipster in Sherwood Forest\\" is even better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment in Camelot","review":"This sounded like such a fun book but I became so annoyed with Kat that I couldn't finish it.

I thought only 14-16 year olds and basketball players still \\"like.\\" Please tell me they grow out of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I did not like this story at all and did not find it very funny. I could not stand Kat, did not get much insight into Lance or any other character for that matter. I was so bored or annoyed with the plot that I skipped through the last half to the end which some might find cleavor but I found to be another annoying element of the plot that leaves the reader without any resolution so the whole story becomes a big unfunny joke.

My mistake, it was just a ridiculous farse on the Camelot tale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly Terrible","review":"Kat is one totally annoying chick and Lancey was whipped, no redeeming qualities whatsoever.

When I looked closer at the gun, i found that this was the mag was not working. On any airsoft mags, there is a button, that when the gun automatically presses it, bbs are discharged into the gun. I pressed this button, without the gun attached, and no bbs came out. I then turned the mag upside down and pressed it, and all of the bbs fell out due to gravity. So, I put the mag on the gun, and shot. No bbs came out. Then, like I expected, I turned the gun upside down and shot. The bbs came spurring out perfectly. Yet I might add, it would look a little weird carrying an AK47 upside down, in airsoft or anything.

I asked him to continue looking, but he had his heart set on this particular one because none of his friends had it. When he received the gun and charged it, the gun would not shoot. However, when turned upside-down it did fire. This made me believe there was a problem with the magazine. I purchased a another magazine from the same company that was half the cost of the gun itself (my son lost the packing slip and I am out of the country which explains why I didn't try to return it). When he received the new magazine, it was the same old problem. So there goes $70 dollars down the drain.Browse and compare (especially for reliability) before you make any purchases.

I guess he is close to becoming the next Bollywood hero. He is not bad for another muscle-puffed Bollywood actor. These actors need to decide if they are going to spend time building muscles or getting to the business of acting and doing it well. In this particular case, Shahid Kapoor comes through and does a good job of playing the dual roles of twins - one bad, the other good. It's the story that does not connect the dots for me in a way that makes it understandable or coherent as to how the brothers' personalities are different and why one of them chooses a life of crime. It's not fluid. The dark theme of the film supports the premise of the story I suppose. But again the story and its narration has no substance. It's too bad because this film could have been a lot better. I like Shahid Kapoor by the way and look forward to his next film with Rani Mukherji."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap Scottish Immigrants","review":"Meet Some Folks is the single most boring collection of words ever published.

However, for anyone who has been in the 'Nam (3 years, in my case), this book promises a good deal, but does not deliver. Although Kelley put a lot of time into compiling some basic facts, overall it is certainly not worth the money.The \\"lists\\" of combat bases, combat areas, villes, etc. are less than a thumbnail in length and the maps are of poor quality and difficult to read. It is nicely packaged, but beyond the cover there is just not much there. Maybe Kelley took on too much, going from 1945 to '75.If you want to actually LEARN something about Viet Nam and why we ended up there, I recommend Stanley Karnow's \\"VIETNAM, A HISTORY\\".Bottom line on \\"Where We Were...\\", save you money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what was expected","review":"I purchased this book as a Christmas gift for my son who is a real Vietnam war buff.

It would also have been nice to have additional information about the conditions our soldiers had to live in while in Vietnam.

With all the punctuation errors, it was obviously not edited for copy--let alone content.In this book, Dialogue is so unnatural as to be very distracting. While the plot may have potential (I don't know, I had to put it down to repackage it for a return), the prose was so clumsy that I couldn't get past page 50.

It's the only book I know that actually shows the derivatives of energy functions necessary for writing efficient MD code. Unfortunately it does so in a hard to follow way. This is typical of the rest of the text. The example C code is hideous both in format and style. Missing from the book are essential formulae for calculating macroscopic properties from MD simulations. It is probably the best practical guide to writing MD code, but that isn't saying much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book for beginners and even experienced users.","review":"This is a recipe book.

Many techiques like linked lists are simple and clear in C but confuse when translated to Fortran (77 or the new 90/95 variants)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very usuable","review":"The code seems to me unclear ,unelegant and slow. Code of the book on the web is unnecessarily complex and hard to understand.This is a book of simplistic recipes without formal explanation. So is not usable to learn or understand. Obviously because it was not written in C originally and translation to C was made in a rush.If you are learning buy Statistical Mechanics by Rowley , Understanding Molecular Simulation by Frenkel or Computer Simulation of liquids by Allen."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed for two reasons","review":"The picture of this leather rug is very misleading...you would never know by looking at it on-line that the back of the rug is entirely black, which shows through when placed on the floor, and black all along the sides, as well.

It looks nice when it comes but it is guaranteed to cost you more than you spend on it. The cost to replace a phone is very expensive and this will definitely damage your phone. The phone case doesn't hold the phone well once you put it on the clip and hook it to your belt. All it does is hit the floor and your phone goes into three pieces: phone, battery, and back. I didn't let it hit the floor no more after the first four times so now the case is on the floor of my vehicle. Still laying there in two pieces: the front and the back. It is nice if you want to wear it for a day of if you want your phone to have a little bit of wear and tear."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great phone cover","review":"I love my phone case because it never slips out of my hands.

His historical rewriting about Mantle complaining that he \\"failed\\" his draft induction physical is laughable at best. Mantle was selected to the all star team that year!

It suits the room perfectly and is sturdy enough. She had used it about 2 months when I bought another for my pre-teen daughter. This bed is sturdy and fairly easy to put together. It is particle board for the most part, but is made more sturdy by the supports. They have used the beds for a few months now with no complaints."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent for the cost","review":"Having a memory foam mattress, I've come to appreciate how difficult it can be to find a solid platform bed frame.This is probably the best quality for the price. It's a sturdy frame and once it's all put together looks nice. It's not very difficult to assemble, and although the instructions say it's a two person job I was able to build it easily with no help.This is the 2nd one I've purchased. I loved my first one, but after 2 moves it was nearly impossible to reassemble.Draw backs - extremely heavy (100+ lbs), needs to be completely disassembled before moving."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap Bed","review":"This is the first time I have been disappointed by something I have ordered on Amazon. It looks very nice in the picture, but I guess you get what you pay for. Not a big deal since I am just going to be using it for the next two years for college, but if you're wanting a nice bed I recommend looking for something else and spending a little extra money. The material is cheap, the boards don't line up, and if you try to move it, it just falls apart on you. So when setting it up, make sure you put it together right where you want it!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This time with a twist.","review":"There are passages of this book that are so wonderfully sketched out that they seem to play as black and white movie clips inside the reader's head. No mean feat, the author has a real gift for transporting his audience. And of course, what's not to like about Hank Fayette? Yowzer. I'm not too familiar with the author's work, though I did read Surprising Myself when I was in college, but I bet he has a great American gay novel inside him somewhere. (Insert Richard Gere joke here.). Nice work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Invalid assumptions, poor logic, avoid at all costs","review":"What a disappointment! The author clearly had an agenda, which was focused on the christian influence on Celtic Crosses. Many of his assumptions are self-serving, and I was tempted to put the book down halfway through in disgust. Other reviewers have noted good artwork, which I'll concede, but photos would have been better. I purchased this expecting some enlightenment into what the pre-Christian crosses symbolised, and was sorely disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Needed this","review":"I've gotten in the habit of carrying this book around to show all my friends who ask me why I wear a cross when I'm pagan... like the way this book points out (as so few do) that crosses DID exist before Christianity"},{"rating":"1","title":"The one side of unrequitted love","review":"This book is pointless. It's a simple result of surveys with author's suggestions. Put yourself into position of a would-be lover and a rejector, and you've read the whole book. If you're heartbroken and looking for understanding, this book will disappoint you. It mainly focuses on the other side of unrequited love, the rejector, and seems to defend (using the data) that position as more hurt by the experience. At one point it even compared the would-be lover to a criminal! That definitely does not reflect the whole society. The only thing this book helped me realize is that romantic love is very much a selfish thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Something changed","review":"I have loved Pecan Sandies for many years. Since late 2008, they didn't seem the same - either I changed or they did. My family agreed there was something wrong, we exchanged some at the store, bought a few weeks later from another store... they're different. They used to be kind of buttery soft and 'sandy,' but now they're cruncy hard and the flavor tastes like something was left out. I was hoping it was a bad batch, but now it seems like my favorite cookie is no more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keebler Pecan Sandies","review":"When I was growing up, my mother used to buy these cookies for us.

They are just flat out not as good as they used to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"easy peasy","review":"This was so easy to put together. Plus, it looks really nice.

I figured that I would try the Schwinn bike trailer. Knowing that Schwinn is the name in bikes, I figured I'd try this one! I did a lot of research online and needed something economical, yet not cheaply made.I have used the bike trailer twice now and can honestly say that I love it. My two children fit comfortably in the trailer and there are even sippy cup holders for each of them. There is a nice big area in the back of the trailer for snacks, blankets, or whatever else we need.It is tough going up hills with this on the back of the bike, but as long as you are on a flat surface, it's no problem! It is the best exercise I can think of pulling them behind me. And they LOVE it...have such a blast in there!!! I would highly recommend this bike trailer to anyone looking!"},{"rating":"2","title":"handy ride for the little one.","review":"I like the bike trailer a lot it's just that I'm not in the greatest shape to pull it..so I have to really take my time and hopefully I will build myself up to pulling a 30lb trailer with a 23 lb toddler in it. The pull really works my thighs. I could not take it up a hill. It's very spacious, cute on my red schwinn bike. Too big for a car unless you take the wheels off. Perfect to travel in a truck or SUV. I was having problems with the small wheel dragging as I pulled it on my bike so I just took it off. For me it's not too easy to collapse but my husband does a better job. Overall I'd recommend it. It's sturdy and the price was good compared to others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short on details - safe your money","review":"Either there isn't much new in Office 2003 (probably not the case) or the book was rushed to market.

Save your money until more books are available."},{"rating":"2","title":"disturbing but thought provoking","review":"I agree with the other reviewer. There are disturbing parts to this book. For example, Evola's take on the Marquis de Sade is that the Marquis was bad not for what he promoted but because he didn't actually live the type of life he describes. I guess I just don't buy into Evola's underlying metaphysical scheme. It is important to note that this book is not a \\"Tantric sex guide.\\" It is closer to a scholarly investigation of different sexual issues from the perspective of Evola's esotericism. Like Evola's other works, it is well-written and interesting.

I almost finished it in one sitting. This book is not only well-written, it's also chock full of great advice. I found it much more accessible than Deborah Roffman's Sex and Sensibility. It was as if the author knew me and wrote the book for me -- I want my children to grow up with a good attitude about sex, but even so, I feel a little squeamish about these topics. As a mom of a pre-teen and a toddler, I'm glad there's a book out there like this that isn't exclusively focused on teens, though they're well-covered here too. This one's a keeper. Now I've got a great new shower gift idea!"},{"rating":"1","title":"no research cited","review":"I got this book hoping to use it as reading in a graduate course. The authors fail to provide sources or notes on any of the research they supposedly cited. I don't think I can find even one footnote in the whole book. I worry for those who may not be able to take the time to research the 'research studies' the authors reference to see if they are accurately reflecting and interpreting them. I would be very wary of trusting what these authors have written in this book as far as any of their conclusions based on 'research studies.' I expected more from medical doctors and professors.

You get the best of their studio and live acts. Bret and Jemaine's vocals compliment each others so well. John Mayer wishes he could sing as soulful as Jemaine Clement. \\"I'm Not Cryin'\\" is so great, everyone's been there when you fool yourself that its just been raining on your face. I can't wait for their full length album, and hear great tracks from the show like Sellotape and Inner City Pressure. The live tracks are hilarious, they make up for the cd only being 23 min long, especially the \\"banter\\" track, when they talk to the audience, and the \\"Robot\\" song, with the binary solo, too funny. I have no idea why these guys aren's selling out stadiums."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look elsewhere","review":"It's simple. Don't buy this album. It really isn't worth it. Most of the songs are live, and despite that, not much additional content is provided to each song. They're really similar to the studio recorded songs, only with a few not-so-funny tidbits thrown in. Don't get me wrong, the Flight of the Conchords are awesome, but this album does not capture their best performance. I recommend buying the Flight of the Conchords original album (self named album/no name album). It's cleaner and clearer, better worth the money, and has a lot more content. Not to forget, most of the songs on The Distant Future album are also on the other album. So, it's a clear choice. You have two albums with overlapping song lists, one of which has more content (songs) and is a lot cleaner and clearer to listen to; buy Flight of the Conchords' original album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shut up and sing","review":"The songs are funny, but oddly (as the shows are funny) all the in between banter is horrible.

I love him on TV, and I will forever picture him, Chris Carmichael, and Lance Armstrong spending a week in North Carolina in 1997 (maybe early 98). They did long rides every day and Bobke basically convinced Lance not to drop out of road racing. We all know what happened after that as far as Lance's career goes.I wish he'd write about that week.

And if you really, really love Bob Roll, you might like this book. But be advised of its contents.The first thing to know is that the first half of Bobke II is a reprint of Bobke (I), which is funny because all of it (I believe) is reprinted from cycling periodicals. The journal entries are full full full of jargon and nicknames that you may well not get, and they are not developed enough to provide much entertainment. There are a couple of pearls and laughs in there, but you have to look pretty hard for them.If you are interested in the book, grab it at the bookstore or library and read chapters 22 (the one about training with Lance), 21 (the one about the euro cyclist who wanted to buy a Harley), and 8 (Lost in the Jemez). It will only take you about 20 minutes, and you can keep your $17."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning!! Bobke Triple Regurgitation Fraud!!","review":"I am a big fan of Bob Roll, ever since watching him face plant in a NORBA race at Big Bear. After enjoying his column in Velo News, I bought Bobke when it was published. Amusing read. When we got back from France in a TdF frenzy, I ordered his Tour primer, and thought my wife might enjoy more stories, so I ordered Bobke II.I didn't mind re-reading his columns in B-I, but to be sold the same stories twice, with minimal value add was insulting. The few new bits have such a 2004 speculative orientation, I am sure this book will become instantly dated.If you DO NOT own the original Bobke, and discovered Bob on OLN, perhaps Bobke II is of value. I just feel ripped off and ignorant for having been taken this way.I still love Bob, and hope he has continuing success. OLN's coverage would suffer without his knowledge and funk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had to be there to get it","review":"I was disappointed with this book. I really enjoy Bob Roll on OLN - his comments and insight are truly funny and I was hoping for much of the same from his new book. The book is just a compilation of his diary and articles. The diary entries from different races are impossible to follow since he uses nicknames for everyone and most entries are short. At the end of some chapters they give a \\"Dictionary of Bobke Speak\\" to help with interpretation, but it doesn't help much.If you are a pro cyclist I'd buy this book - you'll know the people in it and understand what he's talking about. If you're not, skip it. Too much rambling non-sense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stuck on stupid","review":"I don't know if Bob Roll thinks it is still funny after all these years to say \\"Tour DAY France\\" or if he is just stuck on stupid. Whatever the reason, I can not get over this imbecillity to have any further concern with whatever else might be sloshing around inside his skull."},{"rating":"1","title":"I couldn't finish it","review":"I never thought that romance and sex could bore me so thoroughly. I felt as if the main character kept repeating herself. It just got old. The feelings expressed were often redundant and without much depth. Usually this does not bother me because I anticipate at least some hot romance and good dialogue. This book just didn't deliver it for me.

Because I do not move around much with this case, there is minimal risk of my equipment being damaged. Highly recommended for photographers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for your equipment","review":"Got this case for a projector I received that didn't come with its own case. Pelican products are always very high quality and backed by a full warranty. I received the case quickly and it was perfect for my needs. The pluck and pull foam insert is very easy to use to make a custom fit for your equipment. Took me less than 10 minutes to make separate cutouts for the projector, the cord and the remote.

I love mine!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing...","review":"I thought this book looked just great. And reading the introduction increased my enthusiasm. The discussion of common causes of disaster is both fascinating and educational.Unfortunately, the brevity of this book has resulted in a lack of crucial information. The staggering magnitude of the rock faces at Yosemite means that a lot of pages of topos are needed, and this book seems to have over-economized. We set out to climb the North Buttress of Middle Cathedral (DNB), and wandered back and forth for hours trying to identify the route from the scanty description. Nor was this the only disaster: we then wandered up the valley and repeated the sorry experience looking for another route.Verdict: very pretty, but if you are going to do any climbing, look for a more comprehensive guide instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"keep shopping","review":"This book is not good at all. I lived in the valley for 2 months this summer and have learned to hate it. Despite the previous rating, Don Reid is DEFINITELY no master at getting you to the climb itself.

But even after multiple conditioning cycles, they required over 24 hours to fully charge.This one fully charges in about 3 hrs, and doubles the usage time of the stock OEM battery.

This is a translation and not a commentary, but with the clarity of the translation a commentary is not needed.I would recommend reading the English translation first, then move on to the Sanskrit to get the sense of great poetry and rythm of this work.Chandi herself will blight the asura of \\"too much\\" who is charging $45.70 for this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A short, concise and easy to read book, about a failure","review":"Here in Brazil, many years ago, I read this short, concise and easy to read book.

In short this book is about this subject: Factories in and around Schweinfurt accounted for a great amount of Nazi Germany ball-bearing production. United States had great resources and complete will to bomb these factories. Even so, this effort became mainly a failure.This book has dozens of B&W; photos; in fact, more than half of it are B&W; photos. And this book was writen when persons linked to this bombing were alive and did interviews. In this book, I read all that I wanted to know about this bombing.

That way you can see if they look like they were glued together. The only reason I'm not returning it is because the shipping on it would be INSANE (like $13) and I'm just covering it in paint and it will be more a decorative item."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coleman 48-qt.

The illustrations are full of interesting things to explore in repeated readings. There is a page at the end of the book that tells Seeger's story of how he wrote the song and how it was first recorded. The compact disc is a delight--it has Seeger's very simple, self-accompanied banjo rendition performed in concert, followed by the Byrd's rock rendition. I bought this for our Lutheran church library and I know the kids will enjoy it. My husband, a Jewish baby-boomer also got a big kick out of the compact disc.
