This frightening experience touched me in many ways because It made me realize how realistic becoming pregnant is, and the consequences that come with it.

This book will speak loudly to birthparents and adoptees of the circumstances that lead to so many children being given up in some decades ago. Her pain will help us see why so many fewer young women choose this route if they have any choices at all.

She loves people and can always see the good in everyone. She is one of the few people who is really at peace and understands her spirituality. Marjorie Corbman tells her story with a rare grace and intelligence. It is so uncommon these days, when most people are busy struggling with their own lives, for someone to look beyond their daily travails to seek a greater meaning to life. She does that through her telling of her spiritual journey and how she found God, how she found Jesus, and how he captivated her.

I really didn't feel much of a relationship ever got started between hero and heroine(they were too busy groaning and gasping to talk for long enough to get to know each other). The best part of the entire book was a glimpse into the lives of Beau's parents that contained emotional impact enough to carry the book if they'd had another scene.

It takes real talent to weave a plot and story with depth and substance as well as romance and senuality. This was the 1st and probably the last Susan Johnson book I will ever read.

Oh, it started out okay, Serena's situation and why she had to leave her position as governess was believable. Beau seemed like the typical flawed, warm-heart under a cold, seductive shield type. I muddled through it till Serena got on the ship, and they jumped right,and I mean RIGHT into bed. Then, after another 10 pages or so of nothing but sex, and unimportant talk, and that whole cake scene, I just gave up.

Briefly, our \\"heroine\\", who is running away from her position as a governess to avoid the unwanted affections of her employer's son, stows away on a ship belonging to Beau St. Jules, well known rake and all around scoundrel. They fall immediately into bed, where they spend most of the rest of the novel.

I decided to opt for the all stainless knives since they look more professional, even tho the orange handles were very soft and comfortable. The knives are very sharp and I feel like a professional chef when I use them. I like having two sizes to handle different jobs, and the bamboo case keeps the knives sharp and protects against cutting yourself from leaving them in the drawer (but you wouldn't do that with your best knives anyway, right?). Overall an excellent buy and I think the case is very sturdy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Lid for my Wok","review":"Bought the Lid , works and fits great on my 12\\" wok ..

Not only is it compact enough to carry with you everywhere - at 3.75 x 6 x .5 inches it's small enough to carry in a purse or coat pocket, and if you're traveling really light, the accompanying phrasebook is even smaller, not much bigger than a folded up sheet of letter-sized paper - but it covers nearly every conceivable situation. I used it, along with the companion cassette tape, on my recent first-time trip to Italy and got along fairly well, whether I was buying a train ticket, asking for an all night pharmacy or trying to decipher a menu. In addition to the phrases and a small dictionary, the book also has handy little sidebars on stuff like tipping, sightseeing and selecting Italian wines. Throw in the travel tips, maps, guide to road signs and grammar guide, and this book is an excellent value and well worth the (miniscule) space it will take up in your luggage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Passport Companion","review":"I gave this book 5 stars because when I was in Sicily visitng my best friend, it really helped me tremendously. I was fortunate that the staff in Rome and Catania airports spoke English. In the neighboring towns I had to use it frequently. Later on I remembered certain phrases and used it with ease. I couldn't believe that this book was sectioned well with the food descriptions,emergency medical,pharmacy, and in case of auto accidents. At the end of my trip, I was reluctant to give away this book, but she being in the service, I knew she needed it more than me. No sooner than I returned home, I bought a new one for my return trip back. I took this little book everywhere with me along with my passport.

Of Mosaic And Muse continues the band's exploration of midieval music, blended in with some slightly more modern sounding pieces.Frontman Daniel Crommie has penned half the tracks on this disc. Some are instrumentals where his beautiful buche (midieval dulcimer) leads the charge, while on the vocal tracks, his Ian Anderson-like tenor voice is a perfect compliment to the music.Fans of authentic medieval music will lose themselves in this disc. This is not merely a modern twist on a old musical style; this band truly recreates the delicate beauty of the music from the age of Camelot. Haunting melodies where dulcimer, oboe, flute, and viola coalesce into delicate gems.This is a superb Sunday morning disc, to be listened to while savoring a cup of hot java and letting time stand still for a moment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome time and wear saving device.","review":"The best thing I ever did (besides installing the dust collection system)!

Several of the titles in the series, have until fairly recently, been considered lost forever.Each disc has detailed information on the titles and every film is presented with either the original vitaphone sound on disc (again recently discovered) synchronised with the picture or with a composite vitaphone soundtrack.Even for those who don\`t normally view \`silent\` movies these are astounding prints of what is now the historic formation of one the most inventive and forever lasting comedy teams ever to grace the silver screen.Each disc deserves five stars for content, quality and value."},{"rating":"2","title":"This DVD series is a MUST for \\"The Boys\\" admirers","review":"I just want to say I have just received my ninth installment of this must have DVD series Hal Roach Studios Lost Films of Laurel and Hardy.

Only knowing Laurel and Hardy through the talkies and TV. This DVD series brought to me a new level of enjoyment watching the golden age of comedy. I have even joined a \\"Sons of the Desert\\" tent so I could group discuss and see the other L&H movies (105 total). I just wanted to say here on Volume 1 that it is a great beginning and an introductory synopsis was necessary for this L&H DVD series.

For me, one of the central themes of the novel is coming to terms with familial, and, ultimately, personal fallibilities--a timely message. The forty-seven year-old protagonist progressively learns to forgive her parents, her lover, and, finally, herself for reactions to the events of half a lifetime ago.This novel draws from several literary genres--the romance novel, coming-of-age story and cultural study."},{"rating":"1","title":"Infallibility was Flawed","review":"The book is very simplistically written. It is a good read for the younger set, but I caution you. I kept trying to find a redeeming quality for the story. I firmly believe that children's literature should be uplifiting and enlightening. Life is tough enough. The message was if you get pregnant when you are young - your life is over. I don't want my children reading this. The struggling heroin goes no where in life, her child is on a fast track to destruction, and there is no light at the end of the spiraling tunnel. The author has worked out her personal demons using the public as fodder.

It is very easy to install, it fits perfectly, including all ports, DVD drive slot and airvents, and it looks great! The added protection is great when you're travelling and they make you take your laptop out of its case and drop it in a bin.The only drawbacks I've found are ones you will see mentioned around: the screen does not open quite as far as it normally does and sometimes, because of the added width of the case, Firewire cables don't get to plug completely in, leaving them a little loose.

You have to be really really careful with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"only great at first","review":"I bought my macbook a little over a year ago. I immediately purchased the case to protect it and it seemed like a great idea at first. It does however create internal scratching on its own and bumpy rough scratches end up appearing on the cover. If you're willing to remove the case ever so often and wipe it down, maybe it would keep it looking better. Plus, removing the case is such a frustrating process.

The fact that it's not Speck brand needs to be way, way higher in that description, before you have to click \\">> more\\".

I would not recommend this item to anyone trying to keep their computer looking new."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE BUY","review":"I got my brand new white macbook and I wanted it to be protected from wear and tear. I bought the Speck case, thinking it would help protect my laptop, but it definitely did a lot more damage than protection.Before buying, I thought it was expensive, but figured it was worth it. I was SO wrong! This case is a piece of junk. Like other users, the rubber feet fell off, which left nasty sticky stuff on the plastic which accumulated dust, hair, and dirt. Disgusting. Also, the dirt that got between the case and my laptop scratched it up. When I first put the case on, I thought it looked cool. It scratches so easily that now I just want to rip the thing off, which is nearly impossible. So far, I've only been able to get the bottom off, and I'm scared I will hurt my computer trying to get the top off. This product is a complete rip-off; it was probably made in some foreign country and is worth a couple bucks, though it is sold for nearly $50.Take my advice: DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!"},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible.","review":"i wanted to protect my mac from the obvious scratches the soft outercasing would get, so i bought a speck case. BAD IDEA. this thing scratched up my macbook so bad. the case itself also gets really scratched and nasty really easily. the rubber feet fell off of the bottom of the case, and this case makes my macbook so much heavier and bulkier for some reason. you're better off just buying a large decal to put over the casing to protect your computer from scratches, and tote it in a neoprene sleeve."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT","review":"I purchased the Speck cover for my macbook and love it.

I treat my computer very well and the only 3 places it is are on my desk, my school desk or in my book bag inside a neoprene case. After a week there were some bad scratches on the case and looked really bad. The plastic they use to make these is really soft, so it gets scratches easily.

I did thoroughly wipe down my mac and the case prior to putting it on to make sure nothing was already there that could scratch."},{"rating":"2","title":"MacBook See-Thru Hard Case","review":"This is an excellent product; easy to fit and use. I like the fact that it protects my laptop, but provides full accessibility to the computer and ports without undoing any zippers, buckles, or velcro.

Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't fit all 13\\" macbooks","review":"this product, unlike it's advertisement claims, does not fit all versions of 13\\" macbooks. the bottom was much too large and plastic made obnoxious noises every time i opened my laptop. the plastic holes cover most of the power, and usb inputs so it is virtually impossible to connect any plugs to the latest version of macbook. within two days of owning this product during airport travel (which isn't particularly grimy the way that camping or road tripping would be) dirt got in between the laptop and cover and scratched the computer. if you have the new \\"green\\" version of macbook i would strongly advise against purchasing this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Horrible","review":"I've had this product for much over a year now but only used it for 3 months.

I wanted to share my awful experience with this product with potential buyers. Not only is it not worth the price, it's not even worth 1 stinkin dollar!

All ports are accessible.I carry my computer between the office and home. Originally recommended by the Mac store guy (not this specific product) because I had a minor crack on my case at one of the ports. This provides the protection I needed and I believe it will protect my Mac from the small cracks that can happen over time at the stress points when one travels daily with their Mac..As known from other reviews, only negative I see is that it does limit the screen as to how far it can bend back.

Sure, my computer still works, but the once-pristine laptop case is now scratched, far more than it would have been had I NOT purchased this cover.I am currently in negotiations with Speck to get my money back and damages.

I just popped it off to clear out a little bit of debris that got caught between the cover and the Macbook and find that all along the cover has been scratching my Macbook.They should at least have had the foresight to make the plastic in contact with the Macbook of a softer material, or created a design where it won't rub against the laptop.Really stupid design. It may have protected against some very minor scratches,but likely I'm worse off for using this cover (scratches on the outside of the cover are more evenly dispersed than those now on the macbook but both are of similar severity). I don't think in the long run it was worth $40, and I feel very misled by the marketing for this cover.

Not only is it kind of a pain because once you put it on, you can see dust/dirt on your unit collect in it after a few days, but when I removed it to clean it, I saw it scratched up the sides and back of my computer. You have to use a credit card to remove it off the top and bottom of the computer because it is such a tight fit. So basically I have some protection for my computer but now my pretty new MacBook has ugly gray/black scratches on it. I read that other people have had the same thing happen to them. What were you able to do it fix it? I have tried wiping the scratches down with a wet cloth but nothing.

My cover seals well, but I can take it off, by hand, in less than 2 minutes. (Back right corner, front right corner, slide off) I don't know why so many people are having trouble removing them.

(Just think, if you were an orphan child (Billy Batson) and were suddenly given amazing powers by the wizard Shazam, wouldn't you be smiling too?)Overall this figure is still a keeper. A good value.

A storage pouch makes up the difference.","review":"Good price for 2 pairs of sunglasses. They are nice and dark and look good on. They are light weight, so not heavy on the head, but can be a little fragile if you aren't careful with them. The wire frame is really thin. I was glad that a soft fabric pouch came with each pair to protect them - that made up the difference.My only real issue with them is the nose pads. I am sensitive to ANY glasses if they are not sitting on my nose just right, so this is nothing new to me. They are very easy to adjust . . . I'll just keep adjusting until I get them right. This is another good reason for them to be light - less pressure on the nose pads.I gave the second pair to my nephew to wear with his 'bacon strips & bacon strips & bacon strips' t-shirt from EpicMealtime.com so he can dress up as Muscles-Glasses for Halloween.

It becomes an expensive alternative. The filter isn't particularly more sophisticated to make than a coffee filter. I also had trouble finding these anywhere. So now after I dropped all this cash I'm looking at other types of personal protection equipment for dust.The mask/respirator works great and you need to replace these filters frequently.

Laura wrote her diary with too much detail, making the story drag on very slowly. She refered to trends that were popular in her era but hard to explain now. One of the examples is the song, Ta-ra-ra Boom! de-ay! Also, the book mentions fire mats. Putting the book on the required reading list for middle school students is forcing the student to read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"On the way to a bad review","review":"On the way Home by Laura Ingalls Wilder, should not be read by anyone at any age because of its lack of overall fun. It was one of the most boring books ever written. Laura Ingalls Wilder did not explain anything about where she was, what she was doing, and what was going on at the time. For example: She did not explain very well about how they got food and water out in the meadows and deserts of the midwest. She also didn't give much detail about their transportation and what they would do if it failed them. the strory line trailed off into nowhere many times leaving the reader at a confusing endpoint. Overall this book should be thrown out of every library in the United States."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Little Different","review":"This book is written in a much different style than the other Little House books. Laura kept a journal of the trip and these are her day-to-day entries. It can sometimes be dry or confusing.

We enjoyed it, but not as much as the others."},{"rating":"2","title":"On the Way Home","review":"For the children who love Little House On the Prarie, this book is for you.

The seller is a reputable dealer."},{"rating":"2","title":"The revolution that changed everything","review":"Despite the short length of this book, Wood was able to cover various different aspects of the American Revolution in a satisfying way. Wood walks the reader through the origins of the revolution, through the revolution, to the establishment of the Federalist constitution. What I found to be the most interesting is the rather big emphasis that Wood put on the nature of politics during and after the revolution, and how the revolution transformed the entire nature of politics. The only drawback I can think of is the neglect of the military history part of the revolution. But taking into account the length of the book, and since the political and ideological aspects were covered so thoroughly, this can be understood. Overall, if you're looking for a highly readable and very comprehensive introduction to the American Revolution, this book will serve you just fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty darn good for its size","review":"Wood has managed to capture the key events and personalities surrounding the causes, conduct and after-effects of the American Revolution in a succinct manner.What I found most interesting was the specific details one does not frequent across except in upper-division history classes or scholarly articles. For example the settlement patterns and growing populations on the \\"frontier\\" (Appalachia and the Ohio river valley in the 1760's) and the role this played in the growing scism between the Americas and Britain. The importance and legacy of the Northwest Ordinances in the settlement and\\"opening\\" of the continent.

Amazon did not securely ship these fragile crackers. The package comes in a case of 12. When the box arrived to my home, ten of the trays where completely crushed into tiny cracker fragments. Amazon did not make the effort to enclose the crackers in a safe shipping box. And when I looked into returning the crackers, the website informed me that this was a non-returnable product. After further searching on the Amazon website, to find a way to return a damaged product, and not having any luck, I gave up. I ended up using the crackers as cracker crumbles in soups and such - This was not my initial intent.

It's always on the store shelves.Never mind whether it tastes like regular coffee, or a coffee latte, it instead tastes like ground up chalk--and possibly chalkboard!Such product composition doesn't motivate most adults to start our day off on a nourished note. The after-taste has you rinsing with water afterwards. It takes forever to completely elimate.Either minimal R & D went into the flavor. Or the tasting team was paid off really well just to tell the company what they wanted to hear anyways. This is definitely not a winner. I am not buying it again.And for the price paid (even with coupon) I want something pleasantly edible. Finishing just one bottle felt like a chore for needing a breakfast on the run."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best value I found","review":"I had been searching all over for this flavor in a case but could only find it in the 4 packs.

The ideas the author puts forth are so original and obvious that after you read them you wonder, \\"Good Heavens, how come we didn't think of this before?\\" It is so logical! And as a bonus there is humour and irony too. It is very clearly written and suddenly you know why we are what and who we are and how we got there. I enjoyed it immensely. It must have been very thoroughly researched! I strongly recommend it for people who want new and original ideas."},{"rating":"2","title":"AN EXTREMELY INTELLIGENT READ","review":"Joseph Wechsler presents a well written, very erudite explanation as to why some societies have grown, while others stagnate. He's researched civilizations back to their beginnings, examining their societies, their inventions (or lack thereof), their politics and their religions. He examines why some groups of people progress while others remain static. His continuous timeline approach even examines those societies which grew, but at some point went backwards in their growth. Wechsler provides very plausible explanations which, even if you don't agree with his theories, will certainly provide lively debate."},{"rating":"1","title":"5 Stars for Music. 1 Star for copy protection.","review":"This CD (and all published by Edel since summer of 2002) use copy protection.

I had to buy a more basic instruction manual to cover the details that this one takes for granted. But once you get past that, there's some great material here. The attention here is not on the mechanics of graphics creation (hence the need for prior knowledge), but on how to make graphics look good. As such, the author uses extensive examples from his own and others' experience. The 160 full-color glossy illustrations are nice, too. And if you don't like the examples themselves, they do provide plenty of ideas for things you can do on your own. There's also a lot of material on how to use graphics to improve Web sites, which was useful as well. My main problem was that it could have been a bit longer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intelligent, In-depth and timely information !","review":"Mr. Aaland has provided us with an excellent and very detailed analysis of using Photoshop to produce web pages.

In view of this, her capacity for banal friends, conduct, and conversation is truly amazing.

She also spends a lot of time assuring us that it's a burden to be both Very Beautiful and Very Intelligent. If only her intelligence were allowed to animate any of her actions, thoughts, or dialogue, this might have been workable satire.

Several synopses of the book have already been written so I will just mention what I enjoyed. Mr. Eames helps to sort out the cultures and countries from the once Yugoslavia. Traveling through the various Middle Eastern countries was also very informative. I really feel as though I learned a lot from reading this book and can imagine what it would have been like to travel through these countries in 1928.As another reviewer wrote, additional pictures and maps would have been an improvement.

The sliding foot does rotate a bit, so parts aren't perfectly parallel and in symmetry with the frame.

Very inconsistant, and often times, incorrect use of terms, which can really throw you off when you're trying to learn a programming language. The worst part is that the author does not explain many parts of the code that for some reason, he assumes you already know. One thing I've learned from these reviews, is to not just look at the rating, but also reviews that cover aspects that are important to you. The high ratings from this book came mostly from more experienced programmers that just needed a reference or some quick scripts. The bad reviews came mostly from begginers who quickly turned away by the author's vague tone.

Also, I'm not confident that all methods and properties are covered without a reference section.The good news is that all I needed to know so far is given in solid examples, which for the most part are more valuable than boring definitions for the RAD community.

I'm glad I did. I have had the battery for a month now and it works great.The only concern I had initially was having to put acid in and charge it myself, since I have never done this. Using common sense, following instructions and being careful is a recipe for success. I already had the correct type of battery charger, so that was one expense I wouldn't have to add. Just make sure you note that you need 54.1 ounces of battery acid that you can buy at most auto supply stores. Battery acid comes in different density of electrolyte which for this battery is 1.260 (1.280) for temperate climates and a little lower for tropical climates (1.240). It can vary by a small amount.My next purchase will be a Yuasa Smart Shot battery charger (trickle) 12v, 900mA to maintain the charge during winter months."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works *shrug*","review":"I'm not an audiophile.

Even Mother Theresa would be a war criminal by selective argumentation.The majority of the people, that I know, that have taken the Landmark Course have perhaps followed up with one or two courses, and that's it - there is no cult, or place to hang out.

I know from personal experience that some of the key information in his book is simply incorrect. Several hundreds of thousands of people around the world clearly benefited from Erhard's extraordinary work - and anyone, however sceptical, must admit that it can best be described as extraordinary.

Its awful, it makes long stretches to \\"try\\" and make a connection to the writings of the sumeritians to that which our current science fields theorizes but has no way of actually knowing...a hypothesis of many varieties that none even make sense or a connection. And, mind you, very little ancient sumerian text or comparision to text is offered. Really, this book is nonsense, only sad I bought another of his books, I'm sure it is as un-enlightening as this one is. People, write reviews after you've read the book because I'm telling you, the majority of the reviews are complete bogus- after you read the book you will feel like somebody is taking \\"selling- artistic liberties\\" and have not even opened a page in the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of Sitchin's work","review":"This is probably the best of all Sitchin's work, since it essentially summarises the 5 Earth Chronicles books. The basic hypothesis is the same - Earth was probably visited in the distant past by extraterrestials who genetically engineered Man as a mining slave. Sounds whacky yes, but Sitchin's scholarship is unchallenged by most. For those who don't have the patience to read his 6 or 7 other books on the subject, this one will do nicely. Read it with an open mind and remember, what he says at least presents a scientific alternative to blind acceptance that Man was divinely created. And for those who want to pursue more about Man's past, read \\"Forbidden Archaeology'' by Michael Cremo and Richard Thompson. Your worldview will never be the same again"},{"rating":"2","title":"Genesis Revisited","review":"This book changed my life. Sitchin writes with authority and insight and provokes a great deal of questioning about the origin of our species, what we know of god, the geological formation of the planet and the essence of human nature. Very powerful. I would give anything for the ideas put forth in this book to become widely recogized and debated. This book will open your mind to a truth that will astound you."},{"rating":"2","title":"It makes you wonder","review":"I have to admit at first i was sceptic, but i like to think about myself as an open minded individual so i read it. I couldn't put the book down. Granted some of Mr. Sitchin's ideas are to say the least, provocative, but what if he's right? If you are religious individual it will make you reread the bible time and time again searching for the things he talks about, and if your are not it will make you pick up a the bible and do the same thing. In any case it was and still is a good book, as are all the Earth Chronicle books."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT BOOK","review":"Besides loving the contents, of this book.

I enjoy expanding my mind to alternative theories, espeically ones that seem reasonable. The 'traditional' views of religion and science as they see the beginning of our world and society have long dominated humanity's psyche. This is yet another alternative to the questions of how humanity started - and the bigger question of how our solar system and earth began. Not being able to read ancient Sumerian myself, I of course, cannot verify Mr Sitchin's interpretation, but he does weave a very plausible and logical scenario."},{"rating":"2","title":"Genesis Revisited","review":"A real eye opener for the open of mind. Sitchin has certainly done his homework in bringing these books to the world; however, those readers who have developed a belief system which is unshakable. dogma carved in stone, his revelations are admittedly controversial and has the potential to challenge, even upset, many notions about Creation. Nonetheless, the theme is one that is supportive of the Genesis version of the Old Testament and one in which Sitchin simply provides greater detail and depth for inquisitive minds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting and stimulating","review":"A very thought provoking book.

And I think Lee Remick was a most desirable woman. However, Lee's demure beauty gave way to pity for the part she was given to play - a woman who takes it laying down.

I could not put this book down. While there is a gay theme that runs through this engrossing novel, it is most poignantly a coming of age story and the very delicate relationship between a father and son. Berlin doesn't seem to feel the need to make his characters likable so the effect is that they are more realistic, and their love for each other that much more real. I would never typically say this, but this book would make a great movie! I will definitely be reading this writer's other books."},{"rating":"2","title":"This powerful book will leave you breathless.","review":"I highly recommend this thought provoking book that explores a myriad of complex issues through a simple yet gripping tale of a father and son who face life together. A fast read, rich in vivid descriptions of emotions and actions, the story is one of conflict, confusion and confrontation. Love and indifference, passion and hatred, fear and loyalty, reality and fantasy, right and wrong, revenge and retribution are woven throughout the plot in such a way that the emotions evoked remain long after the final page is read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book for children","review":"Double Dip Feelings is a wonderful book to help children understand the concept of ambivalence.

It can be read by parents to their children to initiate a dialog about mixed feelings & the common situations that may elicit these feelings.

Rioting has beena popular mode of expression for the common manfrom the beginning, and no doubt will continue tobe.Gilje carefully traces the phenomenon from ourearliest roots to the present, finding four broadhistorical phases, with differing causes and,perhaps most importantly, differing levels ofviolence.

I took one look at it and sent it back. It's absolute junk - mostly plastic. It's really poorly balanced because the handle part is cheesy light plastic. The forward/reverse switch is a plastic lever the size of a matchstick. It just doesn't have the feel of a quality tool - for a hundred bucks I expected something with at least a hint of quality in the design and workmanship. Maybe you younger people don't know that at one time tools like this were made to last. This piece of junk is disposable.

The writing style was insultingly simplistic, the descriptions mundane and at one point I began to wonder whether in fact I had picked up a book aimed at children. The most unanswerable question was not 'what is the meaning of life?' but how a 13th century 16 year old boy who had never left Venice managed to talk fluently with a Northern Afghan woman living in a remote village. Perhaps he'd done an Open University course before leaving the city. Or the Afghan village had an extensive Linguaphone library.

It is also convenient to store any leftovers and reheat in same pan. The nonstick coating means the pan rinses clean with no effort.

The one huge exception -- because it's a modern piece, not because it's not great -- is Ashokan Farewell by Jay Ungar, which served as the haunting theme for Ken Burns' documentary series on the War of the Rebellion. The various songs are not particularly rendered in period style, but that's no matter to me. My favorite track, besides the Ungar piece, is Ronnie Gilbert belting out Lincoln and Liberty, though Fiddle Fever's Marching Through Georgia manages to come in a close third. For a truer period feel, though with largely different material, I'd recommend the Union and Liberty! disc from Dorian. Still, this release from Sony is, as another reviewer wrote, quite evocative on its own. It's one of my favorites in this vein."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for every Civil War buff.","review":"This was the best. The music is spot on. Well done.

This normally involves knowing what you want the program to do and researching existing literature till you find how to make it happen. Graphical Applications with TCL/TK made the job of creating custom GUI's relatively easy. The book is well written with working code modules for generating various widgets. The later chapters tie these modules together into standalone working programs. The CD has a contributions directory with programs from different authors that was helpful. It would have been nicer to have a few more Windows based contributions but I believe that is a symptom of TCL's UNIX ancestry.

And just a note, contrary to previous reviews, for a relativiely low price ($ 30 or $ 40 I think), you can get a daughter card that connects easily to any Audigy or Live card that includes 2 SPDIF Input and 2 SPDIF Output, as well as an Adapter for TOSLink (Great for digitally recording music to your MiniDisc).

Linux' base for sound-card drivers is so far behind it's sad. If you're planning on running this card on a Linux system, you better be familiar with compiling your kernel, and making sure you have the latest driver downloaded (which is NOT provided by Creative).With the Audigy card, if you pick and choose what you want to install at the start (Usuaully, I skip things like the IMtuner, oozic player, and Demo package as it really just takes up space for me...) it doesn't take as long as it would otherwise.

Apparently Burns is a failed philosophy professor, because he has infintely more interest in his own mind than in what goes on in the courtroom. It is books like these that astound me--how can anyone think this is good enough to publish?The prose is clunky, and Burns finds endless ways to make trials utterly dull. His ideas reduce to no more than the generalities one learns in Trial Practice classes--tell a strong story; every element of your case should reflect the theme; juries are unpredictable.This book is awful. But then, Burns is probably a poseur--no trial lawyer can be as dull as Burns is and still survive. If one really wants to study the essence of trials, try reading Vincent Bugliosi."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look elsewhere...","review":"This book is so bad I don't know where to begin. FIrst, it fails to be an adequate description of, or encomium for, jury trials. (For that, see Jeffrey Abramson's book, WE THE JURY.) Second, it fails to apply real jurisprudence (like Lon Fuller or HLA Hart) to this \\"new\\" area of thought, and it fails pathetically to mix in critical theory. (Why is Hannah Arendt thrown into nearly every paragraph?) I regret that I didn't click on the \\"look inside\\" feature of this website. Two pages of nonsense would have been enough. Save your money, save your time, by ignoring this brain-dead drivel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Litigation for people who don't litigate","review":"This book is what it is -- an attempt to talk about trials metaphysically. As a trial lawyer, I thought I would get some insight into how to think about my job from a different perspective, but I was disappointed. This book isn't very deep and all the name-dropping that goes on isn't really explained. (Did the author really read all those philosophers, or just steal their quotes? I can't tell.) The work stinks like a dissertation, maybe the author is just out of grad school and is trying to prove himself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as expected","review":"I did not care for this book.

It is very thorough and very detailed, but also very understandable and readable. (If you disagree, just try reading through A. T. Robertson's grammar to compare!) It is full of illustrations and charts and contains detailed explanations and offers many examples of syntactical categories. He also discusses many debatable and exegeticaly significant passages, giving the eveidence for different positions. To make it even more useful, there is an index of subject, one of Greek words and one of biblical passages. It is by far the most user friendly advanced grammar in print.

One tablespoon per day is a perfect dose. However, with the stated quantities of vitamin A and D in a capsule, this product couldn't possibly be straight, unadulterated cod liver oil. It must be fortified or concentrated to contain 1250 IU of vitamin A and 135 IU of vitamin D in a minuscule softgel.

Apparently there is an undisclosed defect with this model.(Just check to see how many refurbished units they have for sale on the web) I still have not heard back from Klipsch regarding fixing or replacing the unit.Since I have little or no hope of hearing back from Klipsch, I have purchased the Bose unit and want to tell you that it blows the Klipsch unit away in the sound department.

I use the iGroove with an iPod mini which is pretty secure in the adaptable base - I believe there are adapters for all of the iPods.The iGroove comes with a tiny remote which provides power, volume control and advance through tracks only. It's a bit on the heavy side despite it's relatively small size, and does not run on batteries which makes it not entirely portable.

I couldn't see asking her to plunk down all the cash for a Bose system, and I was really swayed by the customer reviews for this Klipsch system (check out all the people who say it sounds better than Bose). She bought it for me, and it is phenomenal! Very clean sound, projects fantastically through a room and even outdoors, easy to move from room to room -- and did I mention that the sound is phenomenal? At the time, I think she paid around 150 for it, but I see the price has come down again. It was a steal at the price we paid, but now, I'm considering buying another, just because I love it so much! Not only does it sound better than anything I've ever owned of similar size, I think it has better sound than anything I've ever owned, period. If you're an amateur audiophile on a budget, you can't do any better than this system."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terribly Dull","review":"First off, I immensely enjoyed Donoghue's historical novel Slammerkin. Room was a good novel by her, also, in my opinion. Those two books were why I elected to try some more of Donoghue's works. This book has let me down in the worst way. To be fair, I read over half of it and I was bored out of my mind the entire time. The stories have no set plots. They just simply seem to capture various themed moments in different types of individual's lives - very, very dull moments. There were maybe two stories which I enjoyed the least bit: The Cost of Things and Touchy Subjects. As I was reading each story, I was just waiting for something - anything - to happen. But nothing ever did. By the end of each story I just felt as if I might as well have not read anything at all. Huge disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Swedish thriller","review":"Who was behind the murder of progressive Swedish leader Olof Palme in 1986? More than twenty years after the deed, the crime remains unsolved. This movie avoids naming real names behind the murder, but it suggests an international right wing conspiracy. The movie is shot as a thriller and the main characters are a Swedish police officer who suspects something big and ominous is going to happen in his country and tries unsuccessfully to prevent it, a mysterious but strangely charming British contract killer ready to pull the trigger, and a beautiful Swedish journalist whose choice of lover ends quite badly for her. I found this movie quite interesting, even though I know very little about Swedish politics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing, poorly written","review":"After reading positive reviews on this book I was looking forward to reading it.

A romance develops reluctantly between them, and this is done very well: lots of advance & retreat by especially Field, which makes it all believable and interesting. But her ex shows up before long, and in her doubt Field allows him to stay - until he shows his true rotten colors again. Garner, of course, is right there for her. Though there are no big surprises here, the restraint that director Martin Ritt used in developing the romance is admirable. Worth a watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Romance","review":"Sally Field, James Garner, Corey Haim and Brian Kerwin star in this comical romantic romp.

Tragically for her, her ex-husband (Kerwin) shows up adding stress, strain and enough tension to support a tightrope walker on.

In many ways, starting with awful co-stars. Her lead man is waaaay too old for her and that right there kills the chemistry/romance part that everyone looks forward to in a romantic comedy. The other lead man, her son's real father, may be closer to her age but isn't cute at all. Besides all that, I found this movie boring, and without a solid plot flow.

She finds love where she wouldn't expect it, and with someone she wouldn't have imagined.

Together these two seasoned pros are pure magic, and every precious moment has thankfully been preserved on widescreen DVD.So if you and your significant other want to take a break from the currrent crop of bad buddy pictures, boring biographies, slasher sludge, chick flicks about rich guys picking up poor women, or those endless prom films where 27-year-olds regularly play 17-year-olds, then this one is the ticket.Murphy's Romance is the kind of stuff that pleasant (movie) dreams are made of."},{"rating":"2","title":"Murphy's Romance","review":"This is my all time favorite video.

I have always liked Sally Field and James Garner. It is a wonderful movie, a good love story, and well acted. One night last week, I happened to catch the end of this movie on TV and was reminded of how much I like the music. Not just the song sung by Carol King, but the instrumental part too. I will never understand why this kind of music is so hard to find. I am also having a hard time finding the instrumental piece used in Gumpy Old Men. Why is this so difficult?

It worked just as advertised and was not hard to set up. This year, however, almost everything stopped working and it developed leaks that were hard to fix. Sometimes it rotates - sometimes it doesn't, and the range is greatly truncated, partly because the control seems welded in place. Sometimes, there really isn't even a spray, but just a fountain - and the system pressure is fine. Perhaps, we didn't treat it right - it was left outdoors in the fall and spring - but you'd think a 65.00 sprinkler could tolerate that. Not something I'd recommend, but perhaps with more compulsive care it would last longer.

There is a slight political manifesto to some of the material such as on 'struggle' but it's tracks like 'certain ratio' and 'eyes wide open' where they blend disco funk with punk attitude to create a blinding rythum that places them ahead of their peers.

Except for the energetic song \\"New Disco\\" that finishes the album, nearly every track is relatively dull electronic rock that gets old pretty quickly. Radio 4 can also be criticized for using a sound effect that sounds strikingly like the bass for Nine Inch Nails, yet does not impress me nearly as much. Only near the end of Gotham do the real gems emerge, such as the song \\"Certain Tragedy\\". Although the uninteresting vocals are somewhat of a hindrance, joy can be obtained from this song's energetic guitar and addictive rhythm. The aforementioned \\"New Disco\\" is also a really good track for its noisy atmosphere, featuring the occasional cry of \\"New Disco!\\" and a series of electronic squeaks which never cease to entertain.

Should have listened to the bad review.This music is painfully forced, like watching a group of your not-so-rockin buddies trying very very hard to rock. The lyrics are embarassing to anyone over 17.

Other examples of misinterpreted words are so prevalent that one loses faith in a convincing argument. Also, really important maps are such low resolution that they are unreadable even when enlarged.

Of course the author brings up the hoary chestnut of the ancient copper trade between Indians in Michigan and the Phoenicians, which perhaps is an interesting idea, but nothing that has be borne out by actual evidence, and the statement that the ancient Indian site of Aztalan (Wisconsin) was a major copper refining center, which by her description sounds like heavy industry in Pittsburgh in 1950. However, when I got to the part about the war between the Sauk Indians and some group (I can't remember the name as I started laughing so hard) in the Near East!, I had to put it down.

The problem is the magnetic latch. After a week or so I decided I was tired of my treo700p skating across the pavement. It had a tendency to lose it's battery in the process too. I would like the same case with a real latch. For now the little pouch that came with my computer backpack is filling the niche.Update Jan 2013: I found that this case does work well for the original Motorola Droid.

When traveling interstate highways both GPS systems are identical in giving directions, with a two mile get ready message for the next manuvere. So far I have found several weird directions-- such as sleight right turn ahead when the map itself shows a streight road through an intersection. Another strange direction--make a legal U turn when coming toward my house that has grass median strips down the middle, apparently the 360's logic couldn't figure out how to reach my house at the median breaks. Like I said for the most part it does fine, it got us in and out of central Philadelphia without a hitch. It would be nice if their website had a way of giving them map corrections so that they could be incorperated in the next software update."},{"rating":"1","title":"Magellan 360 -not so great","review":"This unit is not nearly as simple to program and use as they lead you to believe.

Waste ur money & time!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Returned 4 hours after opening","review":"Thought it was a great deal. It worked great for about 30 minutes. Then froze. Then wouldn't reboot all the way. Froze again. Rebooted randomly. Returned the product ASAP for a refund. I personally wont go with this brand again. Their higher end units might work, but I am a little upset the lower end unit didn't work. I expected a quality product, just with fewer features. What I got was a product riddled with defects."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall a good product, good return for the price","review":"Overall I liked it. However, initially I found it a little bit tricky. There are few things that I thought were little bit less user friendly, such as, the way the maps are grouped. I.e. it says in the description that the unit comes with all US maps preloaded. Well, that's true, but then, they are grouped in different zones, such as North-eastern, South, and Western etc. (I didn't expect the maps in zones, so initially I was a little bit surprised) I usually travel between two zones and initially, it was hard for me to figure out how to use it, but now it's easy. Overall, I think it's a good value for the price I paid.The delivery was quick, the package contain everything (the manual, CD, the GPS system, power supply (both for car and at home), windshield mount). If you don't want to spend lot of money, this is a good one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Magellan GPS","review":"The unit worked, but the maps were outdated. The windshield mount was very awkard and had one part that was prone to break. The one part did break and the customer service from magellan was AWFUL. The unit was still under warranty but they kept putting me off. I called six times over two months and they said each time that they were mailing me the new part. When I would call to follow up after not receiving the part they would say they just got them in and would mail it that day. I will never buy another Magellan product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality and HORRIBLE customer service","review":"My unit worked well for a short while then broke. It suddenly stopped turning on. Sent in for service under warranty. Their customer service is HORRIBLE! So far they have had it for 2 months. There is no communication about it, and every time I call I get their call center in India and the people there have no idea what the status of the unit is. They read from a script and are entirely unhelpful. I am never buying another Magellan product ever, and I recommend no one else does either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Magellan 360","review":"It stopped working after using it about 10 times , can't find any help on their web-site, and no one answers their phone numbers in their manual.

At least that is what I think they said???!!Frank Malowski"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overpriced junk - cant update the maps","review":"I have had this product a little over a year under the premise (as stated by magellan) that the maps could be updated. They even sent a data cable for connecting to a pc. Unfortunately, they have discontinued the product and there is no procedure to update the maps. I never would have bought this had I known the unit could not be updated. I don't believe I will ever buy another Magellan product."},{"rating":"1","title":"ROADMATE GETS YOU NOWHERE","review":"THIS PRODUCT IS HORRIBLE.

The MIO worked perfect and never froze and had all the POIs, plus the menus were easy to use and understand, very nice display. This one on the other hand, froze all the time, wanted to take me in the wrong direction, and the menus and ease of use is very confusing and clumsy, not to metion the unit is bulkier and you cannot take it out of the car with you. The price is good, but I was able to buy my MIO on sale for the same price, so it is a much better beagain. the Magellan went back to the store."},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty close to ideal","review":"The most important thing the roadmate 360 needs is an external antenna (about $60.)Without the antenna, my roadmate would take between 2-5 minutes to lock on to a signal. With the external antenna the roadmate locks on to a signal between 10 seconds and 1 minute. 10 seconds being more common in an open area, up to 1 minute under heavy tree cover. Yes sometimes the unit is annonying when driving down the highway telling you to keep left, then stay to your right. You get used to that pretty quickly. The mapping on the screen makes it pretty easy to figure out which way to go.I was able to figure out the input interface without the manual, so this is a pretty easy unit to work with.I agree not having an internal battery is a weak spot. It would be nice to have the unit stay on for up to 10 minutes or so when gassing up etc...It is great using the unit when you don't know where you are, or how to get where you are going."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had potential, but didn't live up to it","review":"I bought this unit a week ago, and put it right to the test. Overall design, look, and feel of the unit is nice. Unit began to have problems with freezing up during route navigation, and the only way to reset it is to unplug the power source. Often times, when powered back on, it will shut itself off 3-4 times before working again. This is generally not a good thing to do while you're driving on unfamiliar roads. I e-mailed tech support, but then decided that I shouldn't need to be e-mailing tech support about a product I've owned exactly one week.Good quality and engineering is something that should be an expectation that companies are held to. For my money, I'm giving Garmin a try. As a pilot, I often use their aircraft GPS units, and hopefully their vehicle navigation units will live up to the same reputation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will return the unit!!!","review":"I was looking forward to getting a GPS unit, and I had seen the Roadmate 360...it looked nice, with a good size screen. It arrived, and I was eager to use it. I tried to enter several address, all have existed here for at least 50 years, and the unit would not let me enter the correct name of the street!! The when I could get a street name in, the unit put it in a different state, or could not locate it at all. So I used the 'contact technical support' via their support e-mail to ask for help with my problem...but after more than 2 weeks I have not heard any response from them. I have just written them again but do not expect any response anyway. I will be returning this unit to Amazon, and will get a Garmin GPs unit. Recommend that anyone who wants a good GPS system NOT get the Magellan Roadmate series!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good basic unit","review":"The Roadmate 360 provides excellent basic information and routing, as its price indicates. Configuration is very simple and intuitive, although I wish the username feature allowed more than 6 characters. The display is perfectly readable even in bright sunlight. The voice prompts are clear and concise.Negatives:-The power connector is on the left side (as you look at the unit). Most vehicles' accessory outlets are to the right.-When you connect the unit to a PC, it tells you to start the Roadmate Manager. This program is only available up to the 300, not the 360, and is not needed on the 360.Note: The \\"What's In The Box\\" information doesn't mention an AC adapter. However, one was included with mine. I'd ordered an adapter directly from Magellan on the assumption that I wouldn't get one with the unit.Overall, this is a good basic GPS package for beginners. More advanced users or those with a need for weather and traffic information might want to consider other options."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many limitations","review":"I tried the RoadMate 360 but I had to return it. Although it advertizes maps for all of North America, the mapping of the city of Toronto was very incomplete. I called tech support to be sure I was avoiding user error, and even they couldn't find some addresses in Toronto, so it was of no use to me. Disappointing, to say the least."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I expected","review":"While the system came very quickly, it wasn't as advertised (Very good condition). The power cord is ify and randomly shuts down the system if positioned at the wrong angle. It also takes about 10 minutes to find satellite signal so is not practical for in-town trips. The car charger did not work upon arrival. I tried replacing the fuse in it and it blew right through it, so I was forced to buy a new one. While the exterior casing of the system itself was in 'Very Good Condition,' nothing else was."},{"rating":"1","title":"dead after 60 days of light use NO SUPPORT","review":"This was my first gps purchase. The unit worked ok for the first 6 weeks with the same slow performance and qwerks others complained of. In the last 2 weeks it began to turn off and restart itself randomly. This problem became progressively worse and now the unit will not stay on for more than a few seconds before it restarts, making it impossible to use.I have found the \\"support\\" at magellan (thales navigation) to be abysmal. After 3 attempts and 2 weeks of Correspondence they have yet to provide me with a return autorization number needed for repair. I would highly discourage anyone considering doing business with this company.

The author seems to have been unable to engage in editing. While Kenton's life is interesting, the biographical information is buried in an avalanche of verbatim news reports, press releases, concert announcements, and reviews. Was it really necessary to include the complete text of some many concert announcements, including contact telephone numbers? Do we really need full text reviews of so many concerts?Although some of the quotes from fellow bandmembers are illuminating, it appears that William F. Lee merely wanted to talk to all former bandmembers- some of those quoted only appeared with Kenton a few times. In addition, many times Lee only lists information, providing little context; there are almost day-by-day accounts of various tours, listing personnel and pieces played. With all of this information, it is too difficult to follow the thread of the biography."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Stategic Bond Investor - Disappointing","review":"Although this book contains good information on types of bonds, yield curves and things that affect the bond market and interest rates, I found it disappointing. To me, it was overly wordy and sometimes repetitive. At times, I felt that I was slogging through molasses. My biggest disappointment was that it did not get into the specific bond investing actions that an individual like myself would take using the information presented. There was nothing about things that I was interested in i.e., bond laddering, bond mutual funds, convertible bonds, when to buy or sell short, intermediate and long term bonds, etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not an easy read","review":"I got this after a friend, who is a day trader, recommended it to me.

I have an MBA and another business degree, but not a lot of investing knowledge, so others may like this approach.

But there is no way even an average business grad will absorb what is said. This is unfortunate. IT need not be so complex.

The little pager is nice because it lets you know something is going on, but my pager has cut itself on and off at times. The smaller key fob works consistently. I also have a solid disc lock so this is a good combination! Takes more than 20 minutes if you install the red warning light and hide the wires (I used a loom) behind the fairing to the alarm. You also need to find a place to mount the alarm which can take awhile to ensure it does not get wet but is not totally enclosed. I'd say install time should be 30 minutes to an hour.

Even her much publicized (and much maligned) \\"psycho-babble\\" comes right out of Bernard C. Meyer's Houdini A Mind in Chains (1976). Indeed, this excellent long out-of-print book seems to be Ms. Brandon's Deep Throat. Her chapter relating the events leading up to Houdini's death is taken almost paragraph for paragraph from the Meyer book.

I bought it specificly to mount in a Bosch router station, unfortunately the hole pattern in the tool did not match any of the pre-existing holes in the mounting plate. It was a minor challenge but I did get the plate modified to accept the tool. That being said, the tool performs extremely well. It seems to have an abundance of tourqe and power.

I took it to both authorized Milwaukee repair shops in Denver and they couldn't figure out what the problem was so they ordered a new router that had the same problem, even before any use. I was told by a Milwaukee repair agent that despite the advertising and built in above table height adjustment, this router really wasn't designed to be adjusted from above the table using the supplied wrench because of it's weight????Milwaukee did do the right thing and refund my money but it cost time and frustration dealing with an apparently poorly designed tool."},{"rating":"2","title":"just listen to the quality","review":"I bought the Milwaukee router for use as a dedicated table machine. I've mounted it with a woodpeckers lift and consider it a cadillac operation. The router gives plenty of power for all table operations, including raised panels and its controls/adjustments work well, something I can't say for the Hitachi I owned.Like others, there was a problem with the on/off switch, but a replacemnt from the service center (under warrenty, at no charge) has taken care of that. You can tell just by the sound of the machine that it is one high quality unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT PURCHASE THIS ITEM","review":"The attractive selling feature for this particular router was the \\"above table height adjustment\\", but the screw shaft is poor designed, and depended on plastic parts which fail when used frequently.I purchased this router because it provided a built in above table height adjustment. The router by itself has a good motor, but if you plan to use it mounted under a table while making adjustments from above, it will fail in time, while parts slip out of place.The local service center has already replaced the button once, while they are currently in the process of replacing the plastic hex nut that sits on the top of the screw shaft.It is an expensive tool that does not do what it is supposed to. If I were to do it over again, I would purchase a separate router while additionally purchasing a lift mechanism."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Happy","review":"This machine is a dream. For a 3 1/2 hp router it is surprisingly light and quiet. I've used it in both my table and handheld and was really happy with both. Handheld was very comfortable.

Height adjustments from above the table are easy although you will have to drill an access hole in your table or mounting plate for the adjusting tool.

The option of mounting on vertical or horizontal railings is a real plus - who has ever seen a margarita glass hovering in mid-air. (... well, except for that one time in San Antonio.) I put mine on the deck railing, close enough to the house that rain water would be less likely to get into the holes and dilute the food. To be completely candid, I was skeptical, but the birds have found it and come on a regular basis.

I can't contribute all the success to Ensure, of course, as she is also getting round-the-clock care in a nursing home. But the simple fact that she will drink this is the key to everything.

It received the presidential signature which was all that was required.

Once every year or so, they die. The low speed setting barely turns the blades (that was the first fan's fate). Then the gear (a cheap plastic disc) that controls the oscillation died (the fate of fan number two) which made it ratchet noisily at the terminal ends of each pass of the fan.This fan has the appearance of quality, but the reality of junk.

The slide switch is much nicer to use than the usual knobs found on modern fans. The sound is perfect. You can't hear the motor, just the low-hiss of the air.

This is the nicest fan I've owned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Fast","review":"The construction, quality, and design are excellent. The fan is much louder than most fans... too loud. The fan runs smoothly, but it is loud due to the amount of air it is moving. It seems to have three speeds, the slowest speed being turbo-jet.

Amazon currently lists it as 'unavailable'. To encourage Amazon to carry the more comfortable one, add that one to your wish list. Or once it is available, purchase the 400 sheet one instead.The 500 sheet variety will remind you of being in a gas station restroom.

I never expected it to be plush or even close to Angel Soft but I thought it would be tolerable. I'll continue to use it of course-until it's gone for good.

Compared to Scott TP, it is thinner, and I only buy Scott if its an emergency or a huge, almost giveaway sale. It is too thin for any business but pure fluid and not very absorbent for that either.

While it is good to have a roll with 500 sheets, somewhere along the way they lost the softness. The rolls that are individually wrapped and sold by the case do not feel as soft and are thinner than the store bought ones. I would have to use an extra square to make sure, so to speak, which used up more paper.The people who work here noticed the difference, as well, and so I won't be buying cases of this again. I ended up finding a similar product (a case of 500-sheet rolls) by a different company that was much softer and had the same Post Consumer Recycled Paper content as Seventh Gen., so I have switched.

But the price. . . . really?","review":"We've been using Seventh Generation TP for a couple of years. It's a great product; it's somewhere between super-soft and the cardboard-like TP you may find at a public restroom (more on the soft side than the rough side). Over time, we developed a preference to it over the plusher varieties.I ordered 48 rolls in October 2011 for around $50 on Amazon Prime. I went to re-order this month (December 2012) and the price is up to $100 and is not Prime eligible. How does that happen exactly??

I used Scott 1000 sheet single ply in college and this stuff makes that feel like Charmin. Literally, every guest in our home who has used this has teased us about this incredibly rough toilet paper. Another reviewer branded it \\"interstate rest area toilet paper\\" and I completely agree.The only thing this paper has going for it is that it is environmentally friendly...but gone are the days where we must sacrifice function for lower impact (for example, Ecover Dishwasher tablets are actually better performing than their less environmentally-friendly counterparts).Do yourself, your family and your guests a favor and keep looking for a better alternative."},{"rating":"1","title":"Marcal's is better and cheaper","review":"I'm not sure what changed, but the price went up and they started shipping the TP wrapped in plastic.

It's definitely not like a Charmin Ultra Soft roll, but more like the Charmin Ultra Strong roll. Softness wasn't a problem for me.The main problem is that it's weak and not that absorbent so I end up having to use 3-4 times more paper than usual and it's still not as good as the Ultra Soft roll. It's not as bad as gas station bathroom TP as someone else described, but it's not a premium product either.Get it if you like that it's from recycled material, but functionally I'll order a more absorbent and stronger paper next time.Summary: average product, breaks easily, poor absorption"},{"rating":"2","title":"It Feels Good","review":"I like this toilet paper a lot!Here's why I like it:- It is the perfect thickness for me- It is recycled and good for the environment- It doesn't smell like recycled paper- Absorbs pretty well"},{"rating":"1","title":"Passable quality.

I'll definitely use these but won't buy them again. For the same pricing Costco is better quality and larger rolls. This toilet paper is VERY crispy and reminds me of the paper towels a person finds in the gas station rest rooms (I kid you not). Unless you want to scrape your sensitive places with something akin to fine sand-paper, this isn't for you.

My daughter and I dubbed this, \\"self-destructing toilet paper\\" because it weakens the moment it touches anything wet. It is thin, dissolves a little too quickly and is harsher than the most cheaply made toilet paper I've ever used (think early elementary public school bathrooms). Its more expensive and you need to use more just to get the job done. I love green products, but I won't sacrifice quality ALL the time in order to get it. I will keep using other seventh generation products (and method, etc.) but there's no use in buying something if it doesn't work.

The routine was particularly useful in helping me identify and correct problems in posture and flexibility as I recovered from knee surgery.Of particular appeal to this DVD are 1)the encouraging, non-stressful approach of creator Suesan (even as she performs the routine with you) and 2)finding you scarcely need more equipment than a chair and some light weights (which your wife or girlfriend probably has laying around.Guys: show these women you too can be your best body.

I am investing in another because our pages have become a bit battered by the many uses (including one page that she accidentally tore many months ago.) At the very beginning where it shows the sun setting on the farm and the animals heading toward their sleep areas, we would talk about what they were doing and how they got ready for bed (just like we do.)

In the majority of cases the cheap little button switch is the cause of the failure, but the whole assembly needs be replaced.Use some clear silicone caulk after connecting,(AND testing), the assembly to seal the rear of the switch, and to seal the housing to the wall.

It's romantic, suspenseful, heartbreaking, and the ending is absolutely transcendent. I loved all the gritty details, such as the lives of the indentured servants, and I especially loved Adele, the shadow catcher's daughter from Martinique. All these historical details woven together made for an unforgettable read. I am recommending this one to my book group and all my friends.A lot novels these days are a chore to read, but this one sweeps you away and you're immediately immersed in its world. It's a beautiful, haunting story that kept me thinking and reflecting after I read the last page.

Each \\"plot twist\\" was practically accompanied by a blinking light alerting you to it. The relationships felt awkward -- I don't buy that the sisters were all that close -- and the voice shifts less than convincing. I don't want the characters to be 100% lovable, but I found few redeeming qualities in any of the main characters -- in fact, my favorite people were the \\"whoremonger\\" and his family.

I almost put it down I was so afraid to continue at one point, but I was rewarded with characters I cared for during a time that was not romantic but enduring. Sharratt developed characters with courage and resolve. I loved all of the main characters, May, born in the wrong time; Gabriel, an independent frontiersman; and Hannah, wise, smart, both innocent and courageous. Powerful and haunting.

The Vanishing Point has potential, and I think the author writes well - keeping it descriptive and interesting - but the overall flow of the story just doesn't work as well as one would hope.I think the basics of the story are a bit simplistic and honestly the story itself is incredibly depressing.

That's pretty good. This is a very strange follow up to that. I'm surprised they load so much of the 63' live with Sonny Boy Williamson album. That music is O.K. but not really the Yardbirds or what they're about (they are a medioce backing band for a mediocre blues act at the time) The backing traks without vocals are pointless. The rare early live crawdaddy club performances and some of the other alternate takes are very good but only make this worth having if you have the other two CD set. However, it's a bit shocking that there's nothing from the Page led 'Little Games' album which is a great record. They mention it in the liner notes FOR GOODNESS SAKE!

Worse, several tracks are repeated from Sony's earlier SMOKESTACK LIGHTING (again rendered superfluous by ULTIMATE). Sony clearly didn't care much about the band, one already notorious in collectors circles for its confused catelogue. To top it off, Bruce Eder's liner notes are dull and uninformative and chockfull of middlebrow disdain for his subject.

The back of the book says she was \\"forced to marry the brutal Russian General who enslaved her people\\", but you never know more about her life before Khorsakov entered it. What was her life like before her people were conquered? What made Khorsakov so cruel? He was nothing more than a stock character-one with the word \\"villain\\" printed on his forhead.

He's not Douglas Adams, even though he seems to try desperately. He's not dry and witty like a Monty Python skit (his writing might be more tolerable if it were the length of a Monty Python skit).His writing reminds me of a high school sophomore's attempt to be cool.Based on the book blurb, I guess I was expecting something edgy and fun-- kind of a Hunter Thompson meets Chuck Palahniuk meets Warner Bros cartoon.

Very British. If you do not like British humour stay away...but if you can embrace that this book is 'as good as'.I gave it only 3 stars because I save 4 & 5 for works of genius or those that blow my hair back with some new twist.

It was an ok read, but defnitely ot up to par with what I expected."},{"rating":"1","title":"I do not get Rankin.","review":"And I do have a finely tuned sense of humor. I love to read, and manage over 65 books a year. I like new things. I like British writers, usually more than I do those on my own side of the pond. So I am simply baffled that anyone recommends a book such as this.Yawn. Someone please tell me just what it is I'm missing with his books. Comparable to Jasper Fforde? No way!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Well-written but unlikeable","review":"I wanted to like this book. It is in a style and genre that I generally enjoy a great deal. But... there isn't one single character in it I liked. Eddie Bear is probably the nearest it comes, and he's sweet but one-dimensional. Actually ALL of the characters are, including Jack, the main character. Most of the characters in the book are toys and nursery rhyme personas, so it could be said that they ARE one-dimensional, but that doesn't make me like them any better. Language is used beautifully in this book and the style is unique and challengingly interesting. Unfortunately it cannot overcome the unlikeable and flat characters and rather gratuitous grossness that crops up from time to time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nursery is no place for kids","review":"Behind the mask of this hilarious book is a revelation known only to a few people in the past. Just as Toontown has its dark secrets and evil Toons, Toy City - where nursery rhyme characters reside - has its share of Looniness that would lead the Brothers to wish they'd written all the nursery rhymes, and not just the Grimmest ones. This book points fingers like no other brave soul has dared. (For example, despite a blatant attempt to make it look like an accident, it has always been well known among insiders that Humpty Dumpty was indeed murdered.) The Apocolype may be coming, as the title suggests, but I have advice for all my loyal Bunny-Eating friends: do all the wabbits a big favor and bite off their heads first so they don't see the rest of it coming!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as clever as the title...","review":"I bought this book because of the clever title and blurb on the back from SFX: \\"Buy this book\\", but found it almost unreadable.Maybe I would have enjoyed it 25 years ago -- it's full of sarcasm, wordplay, references and literary conceits, but these days I just find that irritating, although I tried to like it.The basic problem (for me, anyway) is that when an author creates a fantasy universe, he has an obligation to create a believable universe with natural laws, believable social customs and some kind of compelling narrative. It's too easy to say 'Well, this is my universe and since I make the rules, so I can do anything I want\\". The result of that attitude is usually an incoherent mess, as is the case here.I know this book will appeal to some people, and there's no accounting for taste, but it doesn't do anything for me. YMMV."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unable to Read","review":"I suspect you need to already be a fan of Robert Rankin to read this book.The blurbs for this book indicated it was funny and had nursery rhyme characters. I'll grant that there were nursery rhyme characters in the part I was able to read - the first 5 chapters. Funny, amusing - very subjective words. I was not amused.This book did not draw me in with characters or plot. The pacing was too slow. The \\"amusing\\" writing style was repetious, dull and heavy-handed. The dialogue? Silly but not funny.I was looking for something more along the lines of the Jasper Fforde books - silly, witty, fast-paced. Alas, it was not to be.After 5 chapters, I just can't go on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant, hilarious, thought provoking","review":"On the surface, this is a hilarious romp through toyland. Dig a little deeper and the social commentary emerges, in the form of biting satire on consumerism, social heirarchies, and society at large.The magic is in the dialogue, with each character providing some of the immediate story. The background leaks out slowly in these conversations, with each new revelation a sudden delight.In short, I loved it. It makes the reader work a little harder than when reading a Douglas Adams or Tom Holt, but it's more rewarding too. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short Lived Portable Ice Maker - Continental","review":"Purchased Aug 06,began leaking water underneath first month??

It is not complex information, and I would rather have a book with simple diagrams instead of watching everything slowly unfold. Filming for the DVD seemed secondary to the running of the clinic. It seems that the 60 boys and girls are bored.I bought this video for my wife who is a high school lacrosse coach. I knew before purchasing that this item was likely overpriced, but after viewing... I would say it is worth maybe 1/4 what I paid, $59 I think. My wife does already use many of the concepts presented in the video. She is familiar with the phrase \\"dynamic warmups,\\" which make up a large portion of the video (different terminology). Buy a book instead that covers speed drills.

First and foremost, it is a REFERENCE BOOK--it sits on your desk or in your department library for quick reference. The reason I love this book is the succinct explanation of the A3 lean methodology--it is perfect. If you want to continue to have a quickie ref to keep people on track with lean principles plus sustain and improve your processes after your initial events (kaizens or kaikakus)--keep this book in your library and use the A3 methodology."},{"rating":"1","title":"And Now a Lean Dictionary","review":"This pricey little (5\\" x 8\\" spiral bound) listing of lean manufacturing terms (Lean Enterprise style) is a good (and the only one that I know of) compilation of the Japanese lanquage terms of lean manufacturing replete with diagrams.It is a great reference for all the lean wanna be's and is great for settling lean terminology bets, but it is far too shallow a reference to appreciably improve your knowledge of lean manufacturing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A user-friendly lexicon which is a great tool for teams","review":"This spiral-bound book contains many graphics, and contains easy-to-understand examples of the concepts that are defined. Having worked with various teams, this is the type of lexicon I would put in everybody's hands because it is user-friendly.A couple of examples: the A3 graphic in the A3 report entry will help all team members understand what an A3 report can look like and how it can help with the success of a lean project.Value-Stream mapping: another great graphical example with good explanations and reference to linked concepts.Keep it simple... A job well done."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Tripod","review":"I give this tripod five stars overall because it has performed well and has performed well in diverse and rough environments. It's had many things placed on it, from MiniDV camcorders, to somebody else's heavy dSLR. When I let the person with the heavy dSLR place his camera on my tripod, he even comented on how good and sturdy it is. One little piece of advice though: if you're letting someone else borrow your tripod, teach them how to use it so they don't wreak havoc on the tripod's Ball Head. Overall, five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Option For Hikers","review":"I bought this because of the extremely low weight. Took it on long, grueling hike,and it held up great. I had tried the Carson (TP-200) previously, but it kind ofdisintegrated under tough conditions, and weighs an ounce more. Initially I was alittle wary of the Sunpak's ball head, but quickly came to prefer it...it takes asecond to screw the camera on (vs. a standard quick-release plate) but the ballthen allows for lightning quick framing of the shot...faster, overall, in my experience.I liked it so much I bought a second one as soon as I got home...I don't want to bewithout one after I eventually lose or wreck this one. Why Sunpak doesn't marketthis as a lightweight hiking tripod is a mystery to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very sturdy","review":"It's good for a very light cam and that's all. I use it as a fake steady cam. Works good for that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't get me wrong...","review":"I like Mark Leyner, but this book (his first) is way below par. It's obviously juvenilia, dressed up by Vintage after Leyner's success, and recovered from the tiny press (the Fiction Collective, Boulder) who took this unformed, trivial, pretentious book on in the first place. There are a few funny lines and some evocative moments in here, but overall it's not worth the time or money. Work your way back to this one from the books published since Leyner learned how to write."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware","review":"Don't misunderstand: everything Leyner's done after this first collection is brilliant writing and mandatory reading. But ESTHER WILLIAMS is the most godawful hodgepodge of literary conceits and pratfalls you may ever be unlucky enough to read. Obviously, some episode of satori marked the time between this and his next book, the now-classic MY COUSIN, MY GASTROENTEROLOGIST. I'm being harsher than I should be, perhaps, considering how great a satirist Leyner has become. But even he probably wishes this book would crawl off his resume. Take a pass on ESTHER and go straight to his other four collections."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the smart satirist and absurdist he would later become","review":"Leyner is more often than not a solid 4-star writer (My Cousin, Et Tu, Tetherballs), but his first book offers little pleasure beyond the fun of its title. A number of years passed between this debut and the much more worthwhile \\"My Cousin\\" and it was a healthy period of artistic growth, evidently. There are a few flashes of cleverness here and there, but this is overall a soggy and underdeveloped effort that makes you realize how delicate and precise his unique style is: in later works, it's a marvel of pop culture satire, rapid fire wit, and intriguing arcania. Here, it's a sophomoric dud that too often reads like really bad Barthelme. Or really bad Leyner."},{"rating":"1","title":"There's Nothing To \\"Get\\"","review":"As I was reading (and not at all enjoying or understanding)this, I thought of all the people who probably deem this \\"brilliant\\", and would suggest that I just don't \\"get it\\". Well, maybe not. But if someone would like to explain to me even one redeeming quality of this, I'm all ears. It's just random nonsense. I actually suspect it's Leyner being subversive, and putting out the worst thing possible and seeing who would be fooled into thinking that its on another level. I have now read three Leyner books, and I know that there is brilliance hidden in there somewhere if I keep looking. It came out inThe Tetherballs of Bougainville: A Novel, which I enjoyed very much. My Cousin, My Gastroenterologist, um...not so much. Based on Tetherballs, I'll keep trying, but so far Leyner is 2/3 pure literary hoax, 1/3 brilliant.

They assured me that once the Cougars came in that I could swap the top of the unit while retaining my canister and filter. Well, after several months of follow up calls this place says they have never received any Cougars and even wondered if they were still made! I wish I had checked this site first!

I use it to clean my new pellet stove. I do not recommend it at all. The 2 filters inside the metal bucket clog after just 4 uses. There is less than 1 inch of ash on the bottom of the metal bucket and the filters clog and there is hardly any suction from the hose. I feel like I got ripped off because I paid $229.00 plus tax for this vac. I am not looking for a vac that does anything else besides cleaning the pellet stove and this one is not it. I even purchased extra filters for the inside ($39.95) and the new ones still clogged after just 4 uses. You don't need that big of a metal bucket to hold ashes if this thing is going to clog and have no suction after just a few uses. I would say look at another manufacturer because this product is definitely defective. Not just this vac because my neighbor got one after I did and she is experiencing the same issue. It clogs right away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of crap!!","review":"All I have say is DO NOT waste your hard earned money on this product. I've had it for about a month now, using it for my pellet stove. It clogs in about two minutes and the suction is horrible. I bought an extra filter pack and thought it might be that but within two minutes it did the same thing. It does have the rod to knock off some of the dust off the filter but the suction is already lost at that point. I don't usually complain about products I buy but I just had to on this one. DO NOT BUY!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not great for woodstoves/fireplaces","review":"Well, it sounds like pellet stove users are having an overall good experience with these ash vacums.However, I am not convinced this product works well for woodstove and fireplace cleanup. I have had a heck of time keeping mine from clogging up on the embers. Embers are common in the ashes of both woodstoves and fireplaces. No matter how hard I tried, they kept geting stuck in the inside the hose. I even removed the steel nozzel thinking that might solve the problem. Now they seem to get stuck where the hoze meets the chamber. As such, I do not recommend this product for woodstove and fireplace cleanup.I found a lidded shovel scoop and use that instead; it is not perfect against creating ash dust, but is quick and easy.Good luck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"The vacuum cleaner arrived with a huge crack in the housing.

I also dislike the filter which is not washable."},{"rating":"2","title":"HelpfulAshVac","review":"Considering the work that we're asking the Cheetah II Ash Vacuum to do, I think it performs pretty well. There are always a lot of larger pieces left in the wood stove that will clog the end of the hose so I've found it best to shovel those pieces out and then vacuum up the ash afterwards. That's what really I wanted it to do anyway since the real pain in cleaning the stove is getting the ash out. I've been please with the amount of ash the vac holds so I don't have to empty it every time I clean the stove. It does a great job of picking up everything so the stove is really cleaned out. The design is pretty simple making it easy to set up and care for. The assembly instructions were a bit vague so it took a little bit to figure out what the designer was trying to accomplish so I could figure out how the filters were attached.The product is not a solve all solution for cleaning the wood stove, but over all I think it's a good value."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible craftsmanship","review":"We wanted a vacuum that could handle at least \\"warm\\" coals. Not this one. Our fireplace had been cool for 2 days and the junk hose connector (which is plastic and makes no sense...) melted the first use! I understand that there are hidden embers, but this vacuum should be better suited to handle them. It was unbelievable. We sent it back the next day for a refund. We have an old Loveless Ash Vac from 20+ years afoot and it works great. That's why we chose this brand. But I suppose the changing times and economy have caused everyone to go cheap. Real disappointment, to say the least. I wish you could rate zero stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Purchase","review":"I have a wood burning stove as my main heating sorce for which I was cleaning out the ash the old fashion way with a pail and a shovel. Ash would get all over the place including me inhailing it. This ash vac is not meant to collect peices of left over wood or coals. Used instructed I have not had any clogs after 4 uses. It takes about a minute to clean out the ash instead of 5 or 10 minutes and I have to dust less frequently.

The Hard Press edition transliterates (but does not translate) all the Ancient Greek text included in the original, which is deeply annoying, and in no way helpful to those who couldn't read it in the first place -- since I could, this is a step backward. This edition omits all Newton's marginalia. There is no front or back matter, so the editor is anonymous. The beautiful illustrations of the Temple of Solomon that are so crucial to the original are missing without explanation in the Hard Press edition.

Gilbert must be the sort of racist who thinks all African American noses, ears and eyes look alike if he thinks Obama resembles Davis in the slightest.

It also lists the agenda the socialists and the communist community has in place to take down America. It also reveals who is his real father. It is surprising how many of the tasks they have completed working silently and under the radar. They do not have many left to go. To me this is more revealing than the 2016 movie.

This film does that.We may never find out who Obama's real father is, and while this is certainly a hook used to draw people into the film, Gilbert convincingly, persuasively, and conclusively documents the movement in which both Obama, Davis, and a large cast of other operators moved, and continue to move, the socialist agenda forward in America.It's an essential thread of knowledge that all American's must know as soon as possible. The battle may be already lost."},{"rating":"2","title":"Obamas Real Father... Another Narrative","review":"I ordered the book but got the video. That was disappointing because a book has sources and references and the video is..obviously..visual.

This DVD is better than the movie \\"2016\\" because it reveals the associations and influences Obama recieved in his most formative years and the relationships he continues to maintain with the far left progressive liberal socialist and communist ideology.This is a must see documentary before you vote in the upcoming November Presidential election!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow...","review":"Horrible fictitious account of Barack Obama's life.

I've read the one-star reviews, though, and looked in vain for a decisive refutation of the claim that the Dunham family lived in Lebanon during the 1950's. That claim is oddly pivotal, though, because it runs entirely counter to the narrative about Gramps being merely an oddly peripatetic furniture salesman. So I give this two stars, instead of one, because it left me with the sense that the many lacuna in the Obama biography are intentional, and that the orthodox narrative likely embodies some intentional falsehoods."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nope","review":"The only thing missing from this video is a Birther Tool kit.

With all the tact and accuracy of \\"The Innocence of Muslims \\" video and the scholarship of Georgio Tsoukalous from \\"Ancient Aliens,\\" Amazon should be ashamed that they even contribute to the distribution of this garbage.

It's clearly illogical to believe both.Before rating my review as unhelpful, please go do some NON-partisan fact-checking on this documentary.

Obama even confirms this fact in his autobiography. White America had better wake up.The Democrats have being flooding America with third world people over the last 40 years who have no education,no money,and hate the white man.They will vote for anything Obama does so long as he gives them some free goodies.Of course, Obama will rob you with high taxes to pay for these bribes while he destroys our country."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Real Barack Obama","review":"It's always been apparent to those who cared to look into his past that Barack Obama has been groomed from childhood as a Marxist. This film provides the one missing piece of information about his background: his real father wasn't a Kenyan goat herder, but a lifelong, fire-breathing, white-hating Communist named Frank Marshall Davis.Obama spent a great deal of time with Davis and was profoundly influenced by his Communist and racialist views.This film convincingly documents Obama's journey through the most radical organizations in the United States and his 30-year association with Bill AyersThe movie also provides keen insight into Obama's adherence to the teachings of Saul Alinsky about how to use social agitation in order to destroy the middle class and, eventually, transform the United States into a socialist country."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trash- disregard unless you are a birther","review":"Typical wing-nut anti-Obama screed.

To me, it doesn't really matter who his father is. What is important is, who and what were his influences in his formative years and his associations thereafter.

If guessing what someone thinks Barack Obama is thinking about is a fact, then this is your docudrama. It's far, far away from being a documentary. It's cheesy Flash graphics, make it look like it was created by a 10 year old, with his daddy's old Pentium 4, Windows XP computer. Welcome to the continued dumbing down process, that is passing as a documentary. Total Junk! EDIT, Many of the reviewers of this junk are obvious shills, that have one review on Amazon.

What's ludicrous is the creepy idea that Barack Obama inherited his political outlook like an unalterable genetic trait from his father. You know, like his skin color. For a crypto-communist, Obama does an amazingly good job of acting like a moderate conservative, which probably explains why this film is about someone else entirely and their imagined relationship to Obama."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was a horrible buy for me and i'm REPUBLICAN!","review":"I dont like President Obama not one bit at all, but i must say that this was a horrible film it didnt give legitimate proof that Frank Marshall Davis is Obama father.

Come on people this is our strategy to take back over office and get the House back. This made no sense and the guy that made this Doc is an idiot. We waste our time on dumb shit like this.

There is no evidence of it because it was so successfully shrouded. Shhh... But the notes of the trilateral commission give hints from which we can divine this god-sent truth, and page 2012 of the Warren Commission report, footnote number 4, presents additional and irrefutable proof.

The only question I ask now after seeing 2016 and the part where D'Souza was interviewing Obama's brother in Africa is that his brother looks like his twin.

Some aspects of the video were a little difficult to follow, but that may be my fault since I was a little fatigued when viewing it. The problem with this and all similar documentaries is that they are essentially preaching to the choir: those who buy it probably weren't going to vote for him anyway, and those who drank the Kool Aid and blindly follow would not even be aware there is any controversy, would not buy the video, and would vote for Obama.

But not to worry--they are so desperate to score some dope that they'll buy garbage like this anyway.Like any addiction, the first step is admitting you have a problem. For people like Gilbert and the Teabaggers, their problem is that, despite all evidence to the contrary, they invariably resort to calling President Obama a radical Maoist/Marxist/Communist/Socialist/Leftist/Fascist.

Some of Obama's plans are socialist but you also have to remember the president is one of 3 branches of federal government. No one would allow him to change it into a communist country.

I understand a documentary with a slant but you can't include whole-cloth lies and speculation using words such as \\"I think\\" and sell it as actual factual truth. This is more in the category of the shows that try to prove that Jesus was an alien...

More importantly, this movie was clearly produced by people who don't know much about history, Marxism, socialism or any other ism.

I was handed a DVD of this and got through about 10 minutes of this before I couldn't take it anymore. This is utter nonsense. Conspiracy junkies might think this is fun, but it's just absurd.

The included CD with the whole text in PDF format, electronic flash cards and exams all sounded great until I realized how many errors the text contained. As I worked through it, I noticed many errors both in the text and with the end-of-chapter review exams. When I would take the exams and get a question wrong, I'd read the answer's explanation which was erroneous, and then I would have to spend time drudging back through some erronous and contradictory text in a futile attempt to find the correct answer. I finally got so frustrated I went to the Sybex website and looked at the errata for the book, and there was quite a bit (about 6 pages worth). In fact, I even found two additional problems which I emailed them about. This text is simply a laughable attempt at a reliable study material."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is pretty much worthless.","review":"Do NOT buy this book for A+ study!! It is full of erroneous information. For instance, it states that the WIN2000 CD is not bootable but it is. It stated that the switch for installing accessibility options with WIN2000 was winnt.exe /h. This is wrong as well. Those are just a couple of examples. I passed the tests but it was in NO WAY from any help from this book. This book would be good for a beginner to learn more about computers but not someone who is about to spent [some] of their hard-earned money on certification exams. Avoid it like the plague!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Misses the boat on 60% of the info on the exam.","review":"Although this book was packed with good info, much of the exam I took was not covered by this text. I did pass with an 82% on the first try, but this book doesn't deserve the credit for my passing score. This book should be used along with others to ensure adequate coverage."},{"rating":"1","title":"A long read with minimal value","review":"From the size of this book you would think this is a \\"Complete\\" reference for the A+ exams but indeed it is not. It covers older technologies too extensively, and spends many pages not covering newer technologies on the Adaptive Exams in sufficient detail. The author seems to enjoy reciting legacy computing lingo more than providing useful information. As noted by other reviewers there are obvious errors in the book and CD practice questions. Also many of the CD questions relate to terms and topics that are no longer even relevant. Daisy wheel printers? Planar board? Punch cards?If you want to know the history of computer technology then buy this book. Otherwise go with a book more suited to the new Adaptive exams like A+ Adaptive Exams by Christopher Crayton. This book is a much better study guide, and the OS section is vastly superior."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many errors in this A+ Complete Deluxe Ed Study Guide","review":"This Sybex A+ Complete Study Guide is really poor in the content and quality of practice questions on CD. This book contains a lot of errors in both the content and practice questions in CD. In some areas, it even contradicts itself. For example, the book says Win2K CD is bootable, but the practice questions on CD says no. I spot many errors because of my past experience in IT field. For those beginners, it will be a problem.In conclusion, I will not recommend this book for anyone for any purpose."},{"rating":"1","title":"A+ Complete Study Guide - Not Enough Information","review":"I bought this book with the hopes of preparing me for the new A+ certification exams (220-301 and 220-302). This book fell way short. The information in the book is good and informative but most of it is not on the tests. If it weren't for the fact that I've been in the IT business for over 15 years and because of my experience from this line of work, I would have failed the tests miserably! Also, there are MANY typos in the book. So many, in fact, that I quit counting. It was somewhat distracting. It's apparent the book was not proofread well before being published.If you are wanting a book to study that will prepare you for passing the A+ exams, this isn't the one you want to buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Think before you waste your money!","review":"This book has a really good looking cover. That's where it all stops.Although the A+ course is covered in reasonable detail, This is not a book for beginners. A lot of background and important detail is left out and it is all presented in a confusing way.My copy is now a doorstop.Do yourself a favour, look at the A+ books by Micheal Meyers or Charles J. Brooks. At least you will get the full picture and will have a reference manual for the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended for the A+ Exam","review":"I cannot recommend this Book for the A+ Exam.The A+ Topics are discussed in a hard and unpleasant way. After reading 350 pages, i had to stop reading and had to look for another A+ training Guide. It is not as easy to learn for the exam with the book from David Groth as with other books.During the exam, i realised that most of the discussions in this book haven't anything to do with the real A+ exam. So this Book isn't very Exam related.Don't waste your time with this book, there are other, much better A+ Training Guides out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible","review":"book is terrible, also, one of the CD's included in the book will not install properly, its the sybex e-trainer cd. i think its because i run the real JVM from sun micro, and not the counterfeit JVM from microsoft. suggest spend your money elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helpful Book!!","review":"This book helped me pass the A+ exam with flying colours (90%). Very comprehensive coverage of exam objectives with some useful video clips. The cd tests were good practice before the exam. I would buy this book plus the Mike Myers A+ book to keep your bases covered. I found having two different authors explaining a concept helps alot."},{"rating":"1","title":"OS section is good, but this book is lacking","review":"OS section did a good job covering Windows 2000/NT/98/95 and DOS. The hardware section was lengthy, but studying it alone would not allow you to pass the hardware module of the adaptive A+ certification test. I passed, not because of this book, but experience.There were several gaps left unfilled between the actual test and this book. For instance, I was asked a question on the difference between ATA/66 and ATA/33. Neither cable is mentioned in this book. Another question delt with the difference between an AT mobo and an ATX. After looking back in this book, the answer was not there. There are several other examples like this. My advice...look elsewhere, especially at this price."},{"rating":"1","title":"A+ Complete Study Guide, Deluxe Edition (Exams #220-301/2)","review":"I have had my MSCE+I and CCNA certifications since 1999, and I am an experienced Windows network administrator. I purchased this book when I decided to round out my resume with an A+ certification. I just want to voice my agreement with those who have given a similar rating, especially with respect to the O/S Technologies Exam and networking in general. This text is full of errors and emphasizes legacy technology. Regardless of whatever potential value it might have as an aid to pass the certification examinations, this text could very well do more harm than good as a general training tool for a novice technician working in a real-world production environment due to its many errors and a novice's inability to tell a good text from a bad. In my humble opinion, one should simply not buy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A \\"Complete\\" Frustration","review":"I had the same experiences with the other reviewers in that the review questions were occasionally inconsitent or outright wrong. The included CD mostly had tests for exams other than the A+. The book gets two stars because of its sheer volume of information, but who really cares how DOS 6.22 manages memory? I haven't had the need to use those techniques since Win95, and I haven't encountered a Windows 3.1x machine in over five years. Find another book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Informative and interesting","review":"The book arrived on time (as always) and in perfect condition. The photographs are breathtaking. The cheese and wine pairings are informative without coming across as snobbish or too basic. I like the heartwarming photos and stories featuring real people and their lives. The recipes are easy to follow but not so basic, and they are delicious. A lot of thoughts put into this book such as the metric conversion chart, wineries and cheese companies listed by state, and a dictionary of terms. Great buy!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A beutiful cheese book","review":"It is a beutiful book with which a cheese lover will be delighted. The photographs are wonderful.

This is close to getting a Xmas present and then watching it break a few days later.So I will try to order a new plastic handle from Gilmour but meanwhile, I will continue my method of ordering just one nozzle from another source until I find the right one. But maybe Gilmour will stand by their product and redeem themselves!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good book, bad CD","review":"The content provided by the book was great. Unfortunately my main reason for buying it was the accompanying MeasureUP practice test. The publisher should have definitely chosen a different vendor for the practice test. The MeasureUP exam utility is so poorly designed that unless you are running default regional settings it will not be able to provide a timer or a score. I had my PC set to use 24 hour (military) time instead of AM/PM. This one minor setting caused their application to die. Anyone who has ever written a single line of Visual Basic code knows that you should always format the incoming dates and times. To trust that every PC in the world has the same regional setting is foolish. If you like using practice exams for Microsoft products that would not even make it through first round of testing at Microsoft, then buy this book. Otherwise, we should strongly encourage the publisher to choose a better practice test vendor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good if you want a guide to what you should remember","review":"I previously studied and aced the 70-228 exam and obtained a wealth of information from 'Microsoft SQL Server 2000 Unleashed' (ISBN 0672324679). It had enough information for both that exam and this exam. I've never used an Exam Cram book before and have to say I was disappointed. While it occasionally passed on some specific info, it was more like a guide that tells you a topic is important and that you should study it! If you want to learn and understand how/why you are to do something, this book doesn't cut it. If you want a guide to give you a few quick facts and then tells you to study other materials, then this guide is fine. I was expecting something along the lines of a concise listing of what you needed to know without delving into non-exam topics (which was fine by me after reading the exhausting 1500 book I mentioned above); but, this is anything but concise."},{"rating":"1","title":"This kinda stuff gives garage rock a bad name","review":"Remember the Fuzztones?

I watched The Grand Chef Part II on Netflix first. Netflix did not have Part I, so I bought the whole thing here on Amazon. My wife & I really enjoyed seeing the entire series. Afterwards we bought The Grand Chef movies that came out before and after this Drama. Note: The Grand Chef movie #1 is hard to find and only available in Region 3 DVD (Korea), you need a Region Free DVD player to watch it here in the USA. The Second movie is available in Region 1 DVD (USA). Enjoy the drama and the cooking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another winner from Ya Entertainment","review":"This is a very interesting series. It teaches a great deal about Korean cooking and business in a huge Korean restaurant. Rivalry abounds. Sinister plots take place. Love blooms and love challenges. Love between a step parent and an adopted son is beautiful. Between stepbrothers turns into painful jealousy and spite. When I received word that Ya Entertainment is shutting down, I decided to purchase as many of their series as I am able. Amazon does a good job with availability and prices. This is the best production company. It is sad to see it go. I hope the other companies improve their translations. I always felt safe buying from Ya and Amazon. I would recommend this series.

These are great for meals on the go, but I find them very useful when I suddenly realize my blood sugar is low - maybe I had a very light lunch and then ended up working late, or was out running errands and did not plan my meals as well as I should have. The Glucerna meal bar is apparently formulated to take longer to convert to blood sugar than other snacks and meal replacement bars. They are also nutritious, especially compared to what is in the vending machine at work! I can feel my blood sugar stabilize, and it stays that way for at least two hours - often longer. So I feel a lot better about this than if I grab some unhealthy snack just to keep my blood sugar from plummeting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glucerna Chocolate Peanut meal bars","review":"These bars are great for a diabetic on the go.

I used it with my kindergarten class when I taught a unit on animals that hatch from eggs. The children loved it and so did their teacher. Mr. Reasoner has a winner here!

I enjoyed his character style and got a laugh over the crass sense of humor, but highly disliked the theoretical blabber, the \\"people should be like me\\" mentality, and lack of practical application that was not elaborated.

This book has also opened my eyes to the fact that most people are unhappy, and try to cover up their unhappiness with lies and \\"fronts\\" about themselves. This book strips you down to your core, and rebuilds you from an honest center. I highly recommend this book for anyone wanting to add more enlightenment, creativity, and love in their life.

But the honesty here seemed defined extremely broadly, something more in line with honoring your whims/impulses. By contrast I would like to know something different: how to be honest without hurting people; how to know when the impulses are wise and when they are not.You will wonder why most reviews are more positive than mine: I can only speculate that the excitement of other reviewers comes from others having a strong affinity to his philosophy. I also speculate that many may love the very confident and extremely energetic writing style, but unfortunatly I personally found it overdone, and not nearly as plausible as I would like. At the risk of being too blunt, I am not persuaded that the author has thought carefully about his positions. In any event, you may not agree with my rating, but I think you will agree this book is about something more than or different from honesty."},{"rating":"2","title":"smart book","review":"This book is lifechanging. Its message is simple. See reality exactly as it is. Once you do that you become much smarter in different areas of your life.

I still think it's funny. If you watch it on DVD, I recommend leaving the \\"bleeps\\" on (so you can't hear the swearing), because otherwise the show looses much of its charm and cuteness. With the swearing in full-force, it seems much more like a dysfunctional family with way too much money and time on their hands. I only wish I also had the second, third, fourth seasons on DVD, too. But the first season is definitely the best. The bonus features are pretty funny. I recommendthe blooper reel! Pretty funny stuff. Also, the menus on the DVD are really creative and involve the family dogs (not Kelly!) doing some pretty funny stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Lovable Loon!","review":"I always knew Ozzy was a very funny man, but this new series is a knock me down - falling on the floor - total laugh fest. I can't wait for it to come out on DVD to watch over and over again.

Not only that, but his family are annoying too. Kelly is fat and ugly but she thinks she's a model and Jack thinks he's the most funniest guy on the planet. I hate Jack the most; that guy represents everything I hate about poser metal fans. I would like to smash his face in with a hammer. Note to people who watch this: THIS SHOW IS NOT FUNNY!!!! All they do is lay around all day complaining about stupid crap that only dumb MTV viewers will find funny. Support Ozzy for his music, not for this dumb show. The man created heavy metal and spawned the likes of hundreds of legendary metal bands. Now he is just being laughed at by the teenybopper drones of MTV. Ozzy should be remembered for the rocker he once was."},{"rating":"1","title":"SAD!!","review":"It's sad that Ozzy has gone from a music legend to a bumbling clown for MTV to expoit.

(I tried to watch the second season but I hated it after watching the first episode.)So why the negative score? Well it was when I realized just how much money they were making by doing nothing! I wouldn't have a problem with that if they gave some it back in some way, but they kept it all!Anyway, its not that OZZY doesn't deserve it its just the rest of his family dosen't deserve it.Kelly is a brat, Jack should be dead right now(drug overdose), and Sharon is a money sucking leech of a wife.I'm not going to say the show wasn't funny. But I would feel better about it if I was laughing with them not at them!!!!!!!!!To finish of I'm glad that the show is mostlikely dead. And I hope it is never tried again!(HAS ANYONE ELSE NOTICED A PATTERN IN THERE LUCK LATELY? JACK ALMOST DIED, SHARON ALMOST DIED, AND OZZY ALMOST DIED!! SO STAY A WAY FROM KELLY. lol)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ozzy sold out.","review":"First of all this isn't a DVD that reflects ozzy as an artist. This is a DVD which shows Ozzy as he normally is, an old drunk who once were huge. Who wants to get to know his psyched family and their pathetic envirement. Much of the material seems faked and the whole project is just stupid. Ozzy should have taken the chance to end his fantastic career with the live and loud dvd. Now he is just a circus atraction being shown public because that he is so stupid and so very doped. And what about his bitchy daughter, she is famous just because of her name. Go and buy everything sabbath and ozzy made until 1993. This is a waste of money and a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS IS GETTING VERY SAD!!!","review":"I cant believe an artist that I have so deeply admired has sunk so low as to completely sellout in this embarrassing way.I dont place all of the blame on ozzie since sharon is the one who is wearing the pants in the family.This old and terribly greedy woman has made this show only to make more money off of stupid people who would buy this nonsense.Im tired of seeing ozzy act like an old decrepit man who babbles like an idiot.Im tired of seeing their bratty kids cuzz and argue over stupid things.Im tired of seeing their little stupid dogs crap all over the house.Why would any family let the whole world see their private lives?The show is obviously fake and I hope it ends soon.DO NOT BUY THIS GARBAGE!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE OSBOURNES TAKE ON THE WORLD!!!!","review":"The Osbournes have been massivly popular over europe, north america, australia and evrywhere! i can't wait for this DVD to come out!

So, hopefully the DVD will also include in closed caption."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Thanks","review":"I can't understand how anyone can enjoy this. Any true Ozzy fan wouldn't have anything to do with this. This show is a disgrace to his legacy. The man has been used. He was the prince of Heavy Metal, now he's a doddering old codger. I would much prefer my memory of Ozzy's legacy not include this goofy show. The only reason I will waste my money on his upcoming album is Zakk, that's all.

Back in the days of 2002, when they were actually funny, & imature, Now, they dont do much anything, The kids are pretty much grown up, & Ozzy has a broken neck, + this new Robert kid doesnt make it any better!! Any ways The Osbournes I knew 2-3 years ago are fun to watch, because Jack is always yelling at his nanny, Kelly is whining, like any 16-17 yearold girl would, Sharon is trying to hold the family together, & Ozzy is getting pissed about the dogs making messes on the floor!! If you watch the new episodes, you will probably agree with me, The family we once had fun with... just isnt there any more, The kids are growing up, I think Kelly got her own house, but comes back to this one for taping, I think she got it in like 2003 or something, Jack is learning how to drive, which is OK, but hes not that imature kid any more, Sharon's definetly changing, & Ozzy's just dying & getting more boring, but get this DVD, Its the one true really good Osbournes season."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pile of dookie down a muddy slope.","review":"This is when Ozzy sold out and became a soft pop flake, great job sharon."},{"rating":"1","title":"PREVIEWED DVD","review":"I recently was allowed to view an early peek at this upcoming dvd.

However, once they hear the crunching noises from your spine getting back into place, friends realize the value of this product.I've only had it a short while, but I bought it, because my gym has these foam with a hard core, where I use them regularly. I work it, as described above, on my back: spinal erector, latissimus, and deltoids, as well as lower: gluteus, hamstrings, IT-bands and quadriceps. Stretching my IT bands can still be hurtful, but one has full moderation of the threshold, and I did notice that they loosen up over time, the more regularly I remember to stretch them.Once I am on a more regular schedule stretching, I will review the other exercises recommended for the roller. So far, I am doing what was shown in the gym to me, and it provides a great relief."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what we needed","review":"Our trainer uses these at the gym all the time.

Please beware of the potential for damage given the cardboard packaging and the way things get thrown about in transit. My view is the $70 is a lot to pay for a bike that turns up looking like some one has crashed it. Amazon need to work with their shipping service to ensure products are better transported or change their shipping agent. The Frame was scratched down to the metal and the anodised wheels had been dented and the purple anodising badly scratched and dented in two places. Just one other warning - the assembly is a little more tricky than suggested on the box when you get it - the nuts and bolts are provided with Torque specifications which requires a torque wrench rather than just a wrech and screw driver as they suggest. Once its together its a nice bike."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted it to be a good book . . .","review":"This is a subject I really love, and a writer I usually enjoy. I just couldn't get into this one. Too much information, too much depth, just a heavy, heavy, exhausting read that should have been an enjoyable book.

I won't do that with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, very long","review":"The book is great and the detail is something most books lack however it could have been shorter that's why there are 4 stars.As for right wing wackos and those who believe everything written in a school books (Indians as savages, black people are inferior) go right ahead, if you truley read this book you would see these amazing sites for what they are worth. If these theories make you feel like your the only sane reviewer....check out Carl Jung, I'll stick with theories like Orions belt and obvious man made structures under the water than what someone tells me is fact. With authors like Hancock, Bauval, Daniken they present another side of the story and it's up to the reader to seperate the wheat and the shaf. If you can get through this book you deserve a medal!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Underworld","review":"I love Graham Hancock's adventurous soul, and the vision he brings to our world. Here, he goes diving in the oceans of the world to discover lost civilizations, and comes up with evidence, but even more with projections about our world that shift our view of reality profoundly. He's a terrific writer, with an amazing mind and imagination and a brave heart. My only impatience with this book is its length - way too long - but he had no choice because in order to be credible, he had to back up every single fact with masses of data, more than the average reader wishes to wade through. But perhaps I am not so average, because I slogged through every single footnote - that's how fascinating I found it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too long!","review":"I agree with the reviewers who say this book is too long. For example, he goes on for dozens of pages about a controversy about what era a tooth found in cave belongs to. The minutiae of detail can be excruciating . At times you forget what the point of the book is as he trails off into various tangents, such as Indian culture and religion. The thesis of this book is interesting, and certainly worthy of exploration, but this should have been about 200 pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"More noise and less...","review":"I'm an avid reader and ancient history is my favorite.

Hancock takes the reader on a global hunt for sunken civilizations that were inundated during the melt off of the last great Ice Ace. A melt off, by the way, is still taking place today. Provocative reading and spellbinding. Read this book and glimpse the ancient world as it was twelve to twenty thousand years ago!

Graham Hancock has attempted to rewrite the history of the world with this endeavor. OK, he feels there's an ancient, lost civilization underwater-- but does he need almost 800 pages to prove this? And the underwater photographs? Please!Fingerprints of the Gods was truly brilliant and a pleasure to read but Underworld is long, tedious, and boring. He loses his true focus after the first chapter and the book reads like a personal diary of Hancock'e adventures. The first chapter is the eye-opener, the rest of the book lacks direction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Underworld: The Mysterious Origins of Civilization","review":"I enjoyed all Hancock's previous books and his premises. But this one is horribly written, badly edited and it rambles, taking several detours then returning to subjects without warning, never thoroughly discussing what is promised. As other reviewers have noticed, this one is frustrating to read. I never got over the feeling he either had an intern write it and didn't check it over or he had a two week deadline. I finished to the end, because I couldn't believe how bad it was. Because Hancock has always obviously bright and intelligent in the past, this book really makes one wonder WHAT WENT WRONG!"},{"rating":"1","title":"More Baloney from Graham's Butcher Shop","review":"I guess you could enjoy this as you would science fiction, but it can't be taken seriously as legitimate research.

Any books whose titles include any of the words 'mysterious', 'secrets', 'Templar', 'alien', 'code', 'supernatural', 'mythic', 'cosmic', are just giving away the fact that they are unscientific rubbish.

Mr. Hancock has made an exceptional study of \\"pre-civilizations\\" in areas that are rarely if ever covered in the common media. He makes a great case for the possible and probable origins of our civilization in areas not relatively acknowledged in \\"mainstream\\" publishing.As you read this work you will be accompanying him on his trips, not just reading dry facts as to how he derived his opinions and theories. As previously noted in the reviews of his other works, he is an excellent and interesting writer. He writes in great depth so you can understand the; who, what, when, where, how and why of his research and opinions. This book is typical to his writing in that regard. Good comparisons of the various opinions of how our cultures have mysteriously come from \\"nowhere\\" to a heavily advanced state \\"overnight\\". It is definitely another pass around book! Well worth your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another amazing book from Graham Hancock","review":"Graham Hanock continues to blow my mind with his brilliant deductions, make you open up for possibilites outside the box.

His book has inspired an international conference on Problem Oriented Policing held each year by the Police Executive Research Forum. Law enforcement agencies attend to hear examples of successful and unsuccessful attempts at problem solving. Using the concepts identified in this book and applying the problem solving approach to real world problems, agencies compete for the Herman Goldstein award honoring the very best in problem solving efforts. Goldstein advocates a best practices approach to analyzing police problems and applying effective solutions tailored to individual communities. Other authors have expanded on this problem-oriented approach, but Dr. Goldstein is the original and pioneer author in this field. Another recommended book expands on this topic, \\"Beyond 911, a new era for policing\\" by Malcolm Sparrow, Mark Moore and David Kennedy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic in the field","review":"If you study criminal justice or homeland security, you likely know all about Problem-oriented Policing.

Cook and Moore are just as perfect together as Martin and Lewis or Laurel and Hardy. My only complaint is that there is so much footage out there that is NOT on the DVD. I know that most of the series was recorded over, which was the BBC's policy at the time, however, I know that John Lennon was on the show several times. They do have ONE of his scenes on this DVD (the classic \\"Deaf Ted, Danoota and Me\\"), but \\"Dan the doorman\\" is nowhere to be found, nor is \\"Good Dog Nigel\\" and several other poems of Johns that I believe were even on the same show that they featured him on the DVD. I know the footage wasn't recorded over because it's on YouTube, so why isn't it on this DVD? I think it's time to put together a new package.

The DC locales are depicted with a neat folding in of history and the contemporary scene. The locales hum with etched characters and sharp dialog. The writing has restraint, dark humor, and a relentless complex and ultimately satisfying plot. The lesbian sex scene is a classic, anti-erotic but pinging on male and female sexuality and aspects of relationship that invoke something deeper.

However, on the bright side, you can use it for heater in the winter as the bulb is extremly hot that you can feel the heat two feet away.

He can depict the clothes well enough, I suppose, but the figures on which he drapes them are awful. He has chosen a preternaturally clunky broad shape for arms, and even legs; and the faces look like bad vintage dolls at best, and misshapen abused dolls at worst.

For example you will read the technique of copy/paste in almost every chapter!! You read it when refering to chapters about word, excel, access, powerpoint etc. The same happens with many many other aspects such as saving a file. I found it really bothering to read in every section that to save a file I have to go to the File menu and then click on Save!! OK. You told me that when I read about word. Don't repeat it for every application. This is what I was asking myself when reading each chapter. This book doesn't get into much detail, rather it stays on the surface. I would recommend it only to people that are very beginners and need to recall the same stuff every 1 hour or so."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellently written as is true of all of Montgomery's books","review":"Doug Montgomery is an excellent instructor and author. I have taken short courses from him. He teaches statistics in the Engineering School at Arizona State. He is known for his books on engineering statistics and has written some excellent texts on design of experiments, response surface methodology, linear regression and quality control. He is well acquainted with the Deming philosophy for quality , Taguchi designs and the six sigma concept. This book on statistical quality control introduces control chart methods and all the other tools of statistical quality control with the expertise that few have.The book is very accessible to statisticians engineers and others with good mathematical backgrounds but not necessarily strong trtaining in statistics. A virtue of Montgomery in all the books he has authored or coauthored is the clarity of presentation and the ability to reach a wide audience of non-statisticians."},{"rating":"2","title":"A college beginner's SQC textbook","review":"This is a typical college text book which serves very well on the subject,SQC.

Even if I do find the answer in another book, it's always easier to understand in Montgomery's. The book is written in a way that makes seemingly incomprehensible statistics understandable. And there are plenty of examples.If you're looking for a book to help you implement quality control in a small business, Montgomery's book is a bit too much, so you might consider my book on the Small Business Guerrilla Guide to Six Sigma or Six Sigma Simplified."},{"rating":"1","title":"RIPOFF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Don't buy this item.

I simply could not get past the first few pages. It seems like every other sentence in this book ends with an exclamation point. Drove me nuts. This author's exclamation key on her keyboard must be worn to a nub. It may be just me, but books that contain this kind of punctuation seem cheap and poorly written. This may not be the case here, but I couldn't bear to read it. I think good writing doesn't need help from endless exclamation points or other overdone punctuation. This type of writing reminds me of overblown, farcial stories written for humor and satire.

This book was a disappointment for me, however I do recommend A Compromised Lady and His Lady Mistress."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't finish it","review":"Unfortunately I did not like this book, although I had read a different one of hers and enjoyed it quite a bit (His Lady Mistress). Maybe this one was one of her earlier ones, before her writing became more polished? I thought it was simplistic and juvenile, the dialogue was trite, and the scenario was not believable. The use of exclamation points was very annoying. After reading some of the more positive reviews I gave it another try, but just could not get past the simplistic writing.

(The others were: A Compromised Lady and His Lady Mistress.) All three have rated 4 stars on my rating scale. I read for pleasure and am not a typical \\"guy\\" because I love romance novels. Oddly enough, graphic sex scenes turn me off because they trivialize a very sacred act. Really great romance authors have the skill to convey the message without resorting to such vulgar tactics. Though Ms, Rolls use of such scenes was minimal, the inclusion cost the 5 star rating on my scale.Her characters were bigger than life and the plot was a little unusual but well developed and executed. My most significant criticism was at the end when a blow to the head reversed the heroine's disability. Her disability was a major reason for the depth of character she displayed. It seemed a shame to take it away.I award Ms. Roll a very weak 4 stars for this work."},{"rating":"2","title":"EASY LISTENING PLUS","review":"This CD was recommended by a friends and I'm so glad I followed through.From the poignant \\"I Just Can't Make It Alone\\" to \\"I\\"d rather dance with the Devil than argue with the woman I love\\", this is just one of the best for singing along in the car.

This is typical sports fair where a group of people get enough people together to create a team and from there learn to play with one another as a team and get better through a series of trials. What makes this series different is it's very short at only 12 episodes and it takes place in the 1920s so everything is just starting to get westernized. Not as good as Touch, H2, or more recent ones such as Cross Game and Princess Nine but at only 12 episodes there's not a lot they can do. If you like sports anime, this isn't bad.

At my age, 60, I feel I have learned most of what the author is so clearly and eloquently expressing in this audio version. But I still enjoyed it and took inspiration from it.

I mean, it was simply terrible. Then Bono trying to pull off \\"Beat on the Brat\\" was simply embarrassing. Metallica? Yeah, o.k....All in all I could not find too much to salvage on this album. Rancid is good. I didn't listen to the Offspring track, so maybe that one's o.k., but the rest is terrible, so why buy a whole CD for one or two good tracks?A proper tribute would have at least had X, Iggy Pop, Jello Biafra, Henry Rollins, Social Distortion, Bad Religion, Bad Brains, Frank Black, and many other people who actually wrote music that either inspired or was inspired by the Ramones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth It","review":"When i first heard about this CD i thought it would be interesting, which can be good, but this CD is horrible.

Rob Zombie's effort was also dissapointing. Still worth picking up."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's the thought that counts...","review":"This \\"tribute\\" solidifies what many fans of the Ramones have known for years. The only people who should play Ramones songs are The Ramones. I am sure that the participants of this tribute, with the blessing of Johnny and under his supervision, mean well enough. The problem is that on the surface those who chose to alter the arrangments to put their own stamp on these songs have missed the mark trying to be different and those who remained faithful to the bands original version can't do them justice. True fans will want this album to support the band and the legacy they left behind but it will not be something they will listen to more than a few times. Fans of those artists participating and casual Ramones fans will be greatly disappointed. There are too many missteps here to go track by track to discuss but the novelty of this tribute is that it will be perceived as just a novelty. Leave the Ramones songs to the Ramones."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not a punk rock album","review":"The only good cover is made by Rancid, because is the only real punk rock group on this album.

Manson's \\"The KKK Took my Baby Away\\"... one of my personal favorite Ramone tunes). If you find this used for around $6 or under (like I did)... it's worth it. Otherwise there are better ways to spend your time and money (I guess that's why there are about 53 used copies for sale here), especially if you do not have the original Ramones recordings of these cuts (classics!!).

As it turned out, only four of the seventeen artists(Metallica, Kiss, Peter Yorn, and Garbage) play any inspired tributes to The Ramones that would be enjoyable to their fans. Most of the tracks are such ludicrous reinterpretations that their departures from the source material approximate the tongue-in-cheek satire of \\"Mefirst and the Gimme Gimmes\\" or \\"The Flying Lizards\\" but without the loving respect or creativity of these cover bands.

Beyond a few repetitions it is quite well written. Although I generally prefer biography in chronological order (and, for the most part, this one is), I did not at all mind the breakdown of Davis's Civil War years into topical sections rather than calendrical.

This vacuum was designed for pellet stoves not log burners!

I would not recommend this for anyone with a wood burner. If I could send it back - I would."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made an ash of myself buying this...","review":"What a disappointment. It works extremely well in removing the ash from an ash tray. Does a superb job. Try it in a woodstove, however, and the hose clogs in about three seconds - not even counting the chunks which clog the entrance to the nozzle, which is waaay too narrow to be useful. Even a modest quantity of cool powdered ash chokes the hose requiring disconnect and clearing of the plug. Sorry to say, it does not begin to do the job. It might work if the hose diameter were doubled."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's OK for fine ash but anything bigger than a 1/2 inch nugget of wood.","review":"I've had the Cougar MU405 for about 2-3 years now and the vacuum works OK for fine ash. But a small nugget will either block up the hose or the entry to the vacuum requiring you to stop and unclog it. I have a double sided wood burning fireplace and this happens consistently even after taking significant amount of time to pull as many pieces out by hand as I can. Also, the metal flexible hose comes out of one end of the rubberized endings and can be a pain to get back in. I've had no problem with the motor thus far and it does a good job sucking up the ash. But the cheap connection of the hose and the continuous clogging keeps me from recommending the vacuum."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cleans up some games, but not others","review":"I tend to play lots of games. I build many model ships, am an avid train collector, and have worked on many wood-crafts with my 2 year old son. Most of the games leave big messes. Plastic pieces, wood chips, etc. I work on a rubberized garage floor so I figured this vacuum would be perfect for picking up the scraps. It's good for some hobbyists, but for someone who plays as many games as me, this just cant handle my mess. It clogs easily, breaks down after just a few games, and once sucked my son's foot into it and I had to break the machine to get it to turn off. I would recommend this machine for novice game players, but if you're at the intermediate, or advanced level (I should know), you'll want to avoid this."},{"rating":"2","title":"What to do with all the ashes...","review":"I got a Wood pellet insert for my Fireplace 2 years ago and with oil prices being what they are I have actually recouped the costs sooner than expected.

I got the Cougar Ash Vac in the hopes of making this a less tedious chore and was pleasantly surprised with how quick the job became and really surprised by the capacity of the vac, making disposal of the ashes far less frequent (once a month instead of once a week). It's not perfect, being pretty loud and easily clogged by pellets and bigger clinkers but still so worth it.Now if I can just figure out what to do with the ashes..."},{"rating":"1","title":"It sucks like a dustbuster","review":"I bought this vacuum to clean the ash out of my wood stove. Well, it will clean the ash that is burned to a dust and nothing else. I thought when I read the other reviews that people were complaining about large objects not being sucked up, but what they are talking about is the small peices of wood that are not burned to ash (1\\" or more). I had to stop evey 20 seconds to unclog the nossle, what a p.i.t.a. I wanted to return it, but that is not that simple after you try it or 3 days passes.

At best it's got enough suction for picking up feathers. Even trying to remove old ash from the stove, it is painfully slow, even small chunks stick in the nozzle and hose which necessitates you removing them by hand. The filter has a shaker that is supposed to remove internal dust from the filter. It does NOT work as advertised. The filter cloggs with less than an inch of dust in the bottom of the can. You then need to take the unit outside and create a mini-dust storm to get it working again. After that you are good for another fifteen minutes before it clogs again. On top of that, it's LOUD.

I used it only three times. I bought this to use with a pellet stove. Even new this has little suction compared to shop vacs. I bought it for the special ash filters which did seem to work. If it only had good suction. But shop vacs with a good HEPA filter work just as well in that regard with a lot more suction. I used mine only a few times when I decided to use a shop vac. What a difference. I was going to sell it on ebay when I noticed the inlet mount for the hose was cracked. So I kept the couple of big filter clamps and threw the thing out in the trash. Those were expensive clamps. You can't suck up hot ashes with either vac so the Ash Vac is unnecessary for 3 or 4 times the cost.

However, that revenge is just a digression of a plot that stretches back to an Austrian monastery at the time of the Black Death. Batman has to solve this mystery before Gotham dies screaming. Grant Morrison does a good job with Batman; nothing as arcane and twisted as Arkham Asylum but some interesting glimpses into Bruce Wayne's childhood and his feelings towards his father. Klaus Janson does the art and it's very good in a Neal Adams style. Very tight and moody.

When Gotham's mob scene members start getting wacked, they look to Batman for help! Why should the Dark Knight even care? Well, for one, there may be a connection to his childhood involved here and Batman has been having some very odd nightmares as of late.

I, however, did not. The story was barely mediocre and I personally did not like the art. Frames where characters were close up were pretty good. The defacto half-page or more shot of batman that is in every book was pretty cool, but when the frames had characters far away it seemed very sloppy.Also, the main villain had an above average back story, be he himself was not very interesting at all.

One minor issue of note is that the paper the book is printed on is not exceptionally high quality, and I occasionally found it obnoxious.As far as the story goes, I believe Morrison did an excellent job. He managed to tie the villain in to an extremely important incident in Bruce Wayne's pre-Batman, pre-death of parents life; an amazing feat considering how much of Batman's past has been accounted for. Morrison very much made this story monumental to Batman's life, instead of just another villain with another agenda.My only quibble lies with the ending. I felt Batman got off too easily. I won't give anything away here, but I do not think the ending was worthy of the importance of the story itself.Overall though, an excellent read. And the ending is not bad, per se, I just think Batman didn't have to try very hard.

As it turns out Mr. Whisper was the headmaster at the school Bruce Wayne went to before the death of his parents, and shocking secrets about Bruce's past are revealed. The artwork, by Klaus Janson(The Dark Knight Returns), perfectly compliments the atmosphere of this story, and the ending is unforgettable.For fans of comics, and haunting tales of the supernatural, this is a must-read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bog Standard dance album from the late 90's","review":"One of the better fantasia albums, but not the best in the genre.

Her mother starts up an affair, Vanessa avoids school... the world gets smaller and smaller for her, as her life moves into greater and greater chaos.Amazingly written, but definitely not a light read."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"i had bought these crackers at the store and loved them. they were so crispy. when i began eating the ones i purchased on amazon.com, they were not crispy. so, i emailed the company with the date code and it turns out they were manufactured over a year ago and were outdated in 10 days! 12 packs of expensive crackers that were outdated in 10 days!

If you like his works then this item is perfect for you, but as for me, I couldn't care less. Over-sized cards are shiny and look sort of cheesy, the paintings (?) are simple and abstract. When I saw the package image with typed letters I thought this would be perfect for my collection, but I was wrong... the worse thing is that a friend of mine also bought this boring card box and sends those cards to me!

My 7, 4 and 2 1/2 year old sat still in front of the tv watching this entire video(which is rare). We have always associated them with fairies and not butterflys, however. I was somewhat saddened that my 7 year old began to feel that fairies weren't real but I was hopeful again at the end of the movie when they all ran outside to build a new fairy house in the rain. They all even put on their fairy wings to build it! So even though they were familiar with the idea, it still sparked their imagination.

The author needs to develop better writing skills. One of many things that annoyed me about this book is the author's bizarre habbit of putting words in caps lock. Throughout each page certain words are in caps lock which is not only annoying, it is distracting. It would seem that at some points in this book the author gives up on trying to further the plot by making long lists, sometimes half a page to a page long.

He brings along Statik Selektah and DJ Premier to host. And what a great idea that was. Royce sounds as good as he has ever sounded, maybe even better. The song \\"Royce Is Like\\" shows how hungry he still is. The production is (of course) perfect. The only parts that aren't flawless are some of the recycled beats, but they all still sound good. Royce brings along solid guest spots with Termanology, Black Milk, Guilty Simpson, and Rell. But why does he need to include Kid Vishis? If we take the Kid Vishis verses off of this album, it would easily be a classic. Oh well, everyone makes mistakes. This is still one of the best mix tapes I've ever heard.

Although the author does reference several classic films and stories, these detailed descriptions of other, better works are the best part of the book. In addition, there is a strong subtext throughout the book of the author's narrow opinions about what a \\"feminine\\" woman should be like- artistic and creative only. One is left with the impression that she views any sort of logical, analytical nature in a woman as pathology, or at least unnatural. She offers little in the way of true description of maladaptive behavior patterns, preferring to refer the reader to fictional characters, and very little advice about dealing with those issues beyond offering more flowery passages. Basically, if you want to sit around and pet yourself about how cultured and wounded you are, go ahead and waste the money. If you want genuine help for genuine issues, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"I think my time would been better spent doing the laundry.","review":"I found this book to be not only wordy but also unsatisfying. It was written on a level far above the average reader's vocabulary. The most complex subject can be explained to a very small child when sufficiently broken down. However, distraught daughters don't get that luxury in this journal. Instead their serious, heart wrenching troubles get likened to characters in movies, myths, and legends in words and phrases that are not familiar to the average person. The reality was left totally lacking. Then, as if to add insult to injury, there was little, if any, resolution to the breach and resulting vacuum felt in the hearts of many women. I was left feeling very unsatisfied after reading this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great short book for wounded woman insight:","review":"This book was recommended by a friend and I'm so glad that it was.

After listening to earlier and subsequent albums, I can say the artistry of the lyrics on this album, imbued by the music, is not only one my most coveted Cockburn records but one of my most coveted albums ever -- alongside Michael Hedges \\"Aerial Boundaries\\" and Bob Dylan's \\"Bringing It All Back Home.\\" There are other great albums, but let me not digress into a long list of comparisons.\\"Humans\\" is such a biblical record -- ripe with tragedy, hope, human longing, and exploring each shade of a 64-gray scale. What about the bond? Bruce, tell us more about our problematic marriages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cockburn's Masterpiece","review":"Coming as it did after Dancing In The Dragon's Jaws this was met by high expectations. It delivers wonderfully but don't look for many similarities. There is less joy, more pain - like Bob Dylan's Blood On The Tracks album. Excellent acoustic guitar playing but the focus again is clearly on the song and the lyrics - and what lyrics! More Not More, You Get Bigger As You Go, and What About The Bond follow each other after the first two songs and seem to deal with Bruce's breakup with his wife Kitty. Incredible and poignant emotion flows through each. But then there is humour in How I Spent My Fall Vacation to lighten things up. Bruce has assembled some great musicians here and makes use of some different rhythms, especially on Rumours Of Glory, that will get you dancing.

I promptly returned it. Obviously they do not use high quality magnets in the Doodle Pro as they do in the Magna Doodle because the lines are not nearly as dark or as satisfying to make. The stamps are equally disappointing and leave only faint marks. The eraser bar is also very hard to drag across and does not fully erase unless you drag it back and forth. I love my Magna Doodle it is obviously a much higher quality of toy, dark rich lines, easy erasure. My only complaint is that the stamps fall out, but we always manage to find them. I would also mention that the age range seems too high to me.

I have only given this book four stars because THE BIRTH OF THE BEATLES, by Sam Leach is so much better. Not only was Sam Leach the Beatles first major Promoter (before losing them to Brian Epstein) but he is much more objective in his observations and his book places you into the \\"Beat scene\\" of 1960-1962 Liverpool with such force that after reading a chapter it leaves you exhasuted and wanting more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Sharra's Exile?","review":"I can't believe I'm the first to review this book.

Which is why I never bothered with Sharra's Exile, shoot read The heratige of hastur and this one and your all caught up. I like this one because it doesn't go to far into the characters, cause they always have the same problems no matter what family they come from, which actually makes me read more to actually find out what is going on.

Not being one of my favorites, this album had seen little play. Now however, with the addition of the two bonus tracks ('The Coldest Night of the Year' and 'The Light Goes On Forever') this record is in frequent rotation in my player. 'Loner' is a look into Cockburn's mind with gorgeous violin embellishment by Hugh Marsh. 'Justice' is as timely and pointed now as it was when it was written in the 80's. 'The Light Goes On Forever', dropped from the original record to trim length, is the 'new' gem here. It contains some of Bruce's best poetry of his entire career. It is sung rather than spoken, as much of his more recent stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"third in a powerful trinity","review":"Bruce Cockburns most powerful works are Dragons Jaws, Humans, and last but not least, \\"Inner City Front\\".

My only complaint is the suction cup window mount keep falling. This is a overall steal if you utilize all the features. *update* You can also load Iguidance on it which uses Navteq maps.

I love that it's sturdy (ours has been in our house for four years and gotten plenty of play) and, comparatively reasonably priced.

When you look into it, you can only see an area the size of a single face in it. They should make this wide angle view. It is too hard to find and see anything, like looking for a tiny airplane up in the sky using a peephole. Not really worth it.Construction is fine.

As with a lot of books in the series, it climaxes with hostility & shouting, and it ends with Little Critter falling asleep, shown ultimately that his strong feelings were pointless.The lesson: it's funny to act out, but a child's grand conception of things is foolishly wrong. That is the opposite of how our family sees childhood and parenthood. I get the point that this series validates a child's sometimes antisocial feelings, but this one (especially) also validates bad behavior on the part of the child and the parent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Sleeper.","review":"There are other books on the subject that capture a child's interest better.

This was is about the little one doing just about anything not to go to bed by pretending to be and do various things, with the father just replying \\"Just go to bed\\", nothing more. I felt it was very outdated in that the father just barks orderes and no explainations or further communication. I guess I expected the book to have the parent explain or demonstrate in a crafty way why it is important for wee ones to rest or prepare for bedtime. Nothing of the sort here. This book is a dud in my opinion with so many missed opportunities to educate and amuse children and parents. You can find much better books out there to help with bed time rituals."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get it if it's on MAJOR sale","review":"This gift was given to my 6 month old as a Christmas gift. The Fold and Go Kick Gym is rather awkward to opperate, and if your baby figures out where to kick, she may kick it clear across the floor since there is really no traction with it.

Here's what I submitted to the Consumer Product Safety Commission about it: \\"What happened is one of my son's feet (he is 12 weeks old) would slip underneath and to the side of the spring board, while the other foot would kick the spring board, crushing the first foot between the board and the side of the gym and floor. It caused no lasting injury, however he would scream out in obviously intense pain that would subside after a minute or two. This happened on two consecutive uses of the gym before we figured out what happened (First use we just thought something just scared him - didn't see the incident. Then we watched him closely on second use and discovered the problem).\\" This toy should be completely recalled!"},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of money, waste of time","review":"We bought this toy a couple of years ago when all of the foot toys became popular. We put our daughter in front of it several times and she didn't want anything to do with it. The green kick pad is very hard and difficult to work. It's difficult for a baby to kick it hard enough to trigger the sounds. Once you do get any sounds, they're pretty annoying. The lights will light up, however, they're so small that they don't get the baby's attention.The toy is durable and easy to clean but not much fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Baby's favorite toy","review":"My niece loves this toy. She just turned 4 months and has been kicking away since she was 2 1/2 months. We found that placing a play mat over the legs, and laying her on top, keeps the toy stationary.

It was a complete waste of our energy to put it together and a total waste of money. Our daughter loved to kick so we thought this would be perfect since it was easy to store and take with us. It is so light that she would kick it over. We tried putting a blanket over the legs and laying her on it, but it still came up under the blanket. Then we tried putting it against the wall, but we got nervous when it would hit the wall and start to fall forward. We were afraid that it was going to fall on her. We used it for about a week and only under strict supervision. Please don't waste your time or money on this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding!","review":"Had the pleasure to see this guy busking while I was on vacation in Boston, waiting for the ferry...amazing thing to see. Utilizes bass, acoustic rhythm guitar, banjo, lap steel, harmonica, fiddle, and percussion all at once, using a foot-operated mechanism of his own design. This wouldn't mean a thing if it sounded terrible, but if you closed your eyes it'd be like listening to 4-5 piece bluegrass band with killer chops. Comes across perfectly on the CD, in which he rips through 17 bluegrass standards and one original using the described instrumentation, all in one take.

This is probably the craziest of the bunch but it is still one of the best. When Harry is sent on an assignment for some rest and recreation he finds himself involved with some really repugnant and vile seaside creeps that define the meaning of scum. Under the direction of Clint Eastwood this movie takes on some strange and weird twists on the morality of justice and law and order. This is a very entertaining film yet it plays out like an allegory to the first \\"Dirty Harry \\" movie. You'll think twice about going under the boardwalk after you see this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry Hits Dead On","review":"From the now signature line uttered in the coffee shop by Harry, \\"Go Ahead.

It's ok, but lacking the Dirty Harry style","review":"Sudden Impact was released in 1983 and Clint Eastwood is a little grayer and slower in this film. Still has the Dirty Harry charm but it's the 80s and doesn't have that 70s touch like Magnum Fore, Enforcer, and Dirty Harry. Sondra Locke co-stars with him in this one and her characater is lacking and scary? Dirty Harry is tracking down some killers who raped her sister years ago. Very boring plot. I gave it four starts because I like Eastwood."},{"rating":"1","title":"Go Ahead and get rid of Sondra Locke and make OUR day (forever) Clint","review":"(Two-and-half-stars out of four on normalrating scale) [Really, the rating may seema bit harsh, as I do like Dirty Harry(more even than the real man behind him,Clint Eastwood, who by the time I typedin this review, 2006, has long since soldout to big brother, unfortunately)Storyline is good and \\"Make my Day\\" sceneis one of best ever in Eastwood film, butstupid subplot of Locke's character and sis'rape story saps plot. Albert Popwell back forfourth consecutive D.H. picture, this time as'Horace', Callahan's partner. Cute bulldog,too. Dirty Harry movies are either too longor short. A Pity... Pat Hingle is good too,until he's \\"offed' by some of the worst punksever to cross Dirty Harry Callahan!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Before Clint Learned to Act","review":"It's a good thing that Clint Eastwood learned to act. Unfortunately, he did it after this movie. He is capably assisted by other terrible actors. Everyone is either wooden (Eastwood, Sondra Locke) or over the top and chewing scenery (several bad guys; the sheriff). One can't blame the actors too much, however.The script is deadly; worse still, the pacing is GLACIAL.Also, the plot is laughable. A rape victim turns serial killer to avenge herself and her sister. She systematically--BUT VERY SLOWLY--kills her tormentors one by one. Eastwood decides this is a good thing--though it does tend to put him out of a job.Sondra Locke's hairstyle deserves special mention. She is apparently wearing a wig made of mylar. This becomes clear when they show her in flashback, and she has her real hair on.Even the dog (a charmingly horrible bulldog) can't save this dog--although the pup's acting beats that of the humans."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst of the \\"Dirty Harry\\" movies","review":"I found this to be long and drawn out as far as the Dirty Harry movies go. I found it to be too graphic, and too violent for my taste. I actually found myself falling asleep watching this movie, and when I woke up it was still on. I wouldn't even recommend this to anyone who was desparate for a movie. Curl up with a good book instead. I know the one thing I couldn't stand was the fat hag who encourgaed the rape in the first place. The movie is standard \\"Dirty Harry\\" faire, but it was just too long, and violent."},{"rating":"2","title":"WHY DID SHE WAIT SO LONG?","review":"One can't help but understand Sondra Locke's obsessive desire for revenge on the scumbags who raped her and her sister...but why did she wait ten years to do so? Oh, well, anyway...SUDDEN IMPACT is the fourth Dirty Harry movie and Clint's first direction of such. It is brutal, and while not a classic film, it does pack an impact. The villains are some of the worst, with Audrie J. Neenan and Paul Drake standing out. One has to wonder how Bradford Dillman has kept his job over the years. Eastwood continues to epitomize vigilante justice, and his direction keeps the movie interesting when it shouldn't be. To the movie's credit, when it appears that Locke might be charged for her murders, we really are on her side. Perhaps the second best of the series, I enjoyed the impact of SUDDEN IMPACT."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my Fav Clint Eastwood movies!","review":"This is \\"typical\\" Clintish material and what a GREAT plot!

This movie was almost like a gift for Eastwood's then girlfriend Sondra Locke. He cast her because this is the first and only Dirty Harry movie that Clint Eastwood directed. Locke is a woman who was raped years ago by a bunch of creepy men and one messed-up lesbian who is back and is looking for a little classic movie revenge. Eastwood is called on to solve these puzzling murders that Locke is doing. Eastwood then starts falling for her and he doesn't know she is the killer that he wants to bring to justice. Funny, violent, and well thought out are the best words to describe this classic movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good","review":"I loved the book with one exception - The author drones on and on and on concerning the blackout.

Literally.Every time we have used it it while cooking, even with light use on recently cooked hot pasta, it let off a noticeable smell of burning or melting plastic. We no longer use this item while cooking for fear we are contaminating our food, and have switched to wood or steel forks for pasta, depending on the pot being used.We get some use out of this now and then for cooled foods which is why I left this review at 2 stars, but for the little use we get out of it, it's not worth the price we paid.I would suggest taking a pass on this item. Nylon and vinyl cooking utensils are rapidly falling out of favor for safety reasons. If you are using steel pots for your pasta, just use a steel fork. If using non-stick pots, try out bamboo or silicone."},{"rating":"1","title":"HUH???","review":"Never Received! This has been from many years ago, all this is from long ago!

The flow of sentense in the main text book is not organized well. The author puts too much verbose, unnecessary, words to explain objects; what is that light-minded, lazy description about USB? As well, the book is not technically witten; it even does not differenciate Low, Full, and High speed mode of USB. What is worse is that the optional book \\"Practice Questions\\" has full of wrong answer keys as you can see in the other customer reviews.

My idea of an exam cram is just the information you need to pass the exam. I'm not interested in a history lesson of PC technologies or in-depth discussions of signalling that isn't covered on the exam and isn't used except by hardware engineers.Secondly, there are many errors, particularly the wireless section which has some serious errors. For example, the book says that 802.11b uses FHSS and 802.11g uses DSSS. This is clearly false. 802.11b uses DSSS, and 802.11g uses OFDM. There are no excuses for these types of errors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Avoid Mistakes With this Book","review":"As a person who works with musicians alot (and a musican myself) I have seen people make the same mistakes over and over when it comes to releasing a CD. This books helps you avoid those, and many I had not thought of. I've enjoyed every title from David, and HEARING the book gives it even more of a personal touch.In addition, David interviews the head of a CD manufacturing plant, and I found that VERY informative as now not only can you avoid the mistakes of releasing the CD, you can avoid the mistakes of manufacturing the CD.Not that he left out any details, but David then spends some time at the end of the CD answering questions from his musician clients. This was awesome as many of them were questions that I might have asked.I highly recommend this to anyone recording a CD.

Terrible episode."},{"rating":"2","title":"A unique episode, random, but unique","review":"What was entertaining about this episode was the effect Charlie has had on Megan, in that she has begun to use (or at least it is most obvious in this episode) concepts out Charlie's book. I could definitely see her thinking paralleling Charlie's when he tackles problems, but her approach was more systematic, more like the average person would approach it. Charlie seems to go from 0-60 in his thinking and while he is exceptional at explaining his ideas to a lay person, it is nice to see a slowed down approach to the problem. It was also fun to see Megan seeing the patterns when Charlie doesn't.Oh and Charlie and Don talk about everyone's love lives. As if we watch the show for their love lives, or lack thereof.This was just an off beat episode that partly turned the standard Num3rs formula on it's head."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best show ever","review":"My friend and I just saw the season 3 finale last night. I showed him the season 3 finale because he's already seen season 4's first episode and I wanted him to be able to tie it together. The season finale made it seem like it was the end of the series, but then they come back in season 4 and blow everything away. Tony and Ridley Scott really did a masterwork for the entire Numb3rs series. The series ends too soon in my opinion, but all good things must come to an end. After this series ended it was as if my tv wasn't good for anything anymore, because all shows that follow this can't ever dream of comparing to Numb3rs in any way. Long live the Epps brothers.

I bought a copy for myself and a friend and found both copies had a bad fist disk, the menu wouldn't play on either DVD player and I would get a preview for Twin Peaks and SOMETIMES the first episode of Numb3rs, if it didn't freeze at the end of the previews, then it would jump to the first episode. It never played past the first episode, just giving me a black screen.I could watch the whole disk on my computer by bypassing the menu and going directly to the episodes, something my DVD player won't do. So buyer beware, once is accident, twice isn't. I own seasons 1 and 2 had no problems with them. I loved the show and even with the defect in the disk, I recomend this series strongly.

The genius of the main character is found in his desire to remove himself from mass humanity, yet to become fond, even highly respectful of that unique example of a hard-working middle-class builder and a great father. After living in the Hamptons for many years, but, happily on the outskirts of the very famous and the very rich, I have had the opportunity to view some of the characters found in Rosenblatt's book first hand, and they are re-created with precision and hilarity. This is a book to read and to read again-- each time finding new humor and satirical nuance at every turn.

I've visited the Hamptons (a cousin lives there), have seen the mansions and shopped the shops. The dinner party was one of my favorite parts of this roller coaster. How can someone as honestly rude as Harry be so desirable? I really wanted Harry to keep the pool girl around a bit longer. But, that's just the romantic in me.

John Williams comes through with a delightful, light-hearted adventure score that really does remind one of Peter Pan. The main themes are all good, and the CD includes a pretty good amount of music. My only complaints are the two tracks with annoying vocals, and the track \\"Banning Back Home,\\" which does not seem to fit with the rest of the score. But these are minor quibbles. If you're a Williams fan, or just a fan of good movie music, this soundtrack is highly recommeded."},{"rating":"2","title":"About as good as the movie was....","review":"If you enjoyed Hook the movie, the soundtrack will be equally entertaining. The score is fun and light most of the time, with a few \\"dramatic\\" (more like poking fun at dramatics if you ask me) parts, such as \\"You are the Pan\\" and \\"Remembering Childhood.\\" My favorite tracks are \\"Introducing the Hook\\" and \\"The Ultimate War;\\" they are a lot of fun, with Peter's and Hook's themes going back and forth at each other."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best, most complete, soundtracks available","review":"Hook is a classic John Williams soundtrack, and definitely one of his best. The myriad themes are wonderfully wrapped together, creating a listening experience that teaches most soundtracks a lesson. Having had so much practice, Williams has become a master of creating character themes and milking them for all their glorious potential. The songs in Hook are not his best, but the album on the whole may very well be. A pleasure to listen to for fans of Williams and soundtracks alike, I highly recommend this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very exhilerating","review":"This is a really great cd to own and I listen to it constantly. The first track is my favorite and I had wished that that theme showed up a little more throughout the rest of the cd. Also sixteen is a bit too in your face and loud and goes on for quite a while as the same strength. Tracks two and three are very out of place with the rest of the cd and I had wished they weren't included in the soundtrack. The other tracks are very good, but like I said, I had wished that the caliber of the first track had carried over with the others. Still very recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful present","review":"This DVD was the only one my niece requested, I am so glad you had it.

Schaeffer provides insightful analyses of major thinkers and how they have contributed to the modern age thinking. However, the author seems to generalize things quite a bit. It is almost impossible to shink thousands of years of history and comment on one small book, obviously, many things are being left off. Nevertherless, Schaeffer's commentaries and thoughts are worthwhile reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is highly thought provocing.","review":"Schaeffer has unlocked the thought proccess of western society. His understanding and research is tight. He has traced how man has tried to erase God out of History, and how that bold endevor has left man hopless and searching for something to fill the void.

It remains true to Twain's story, though does not incorporate the entire book, for time constraint I suppose. However, enough of the book has been adapted to give the viewer a very good idea of what the book is all about. Patrick Day is by far the best of all the Huck Finn's I have seen, thus far. The actor who portrays Jim is outstanding; as is the acting from the Duke and the King. Also, the scenery is breathtaking. It is truly a joy to watch this movie version of Huck Finn, though apparantly it has been edited, and some of it has been taken out. If you can, buy the version that has the complete four hours - I gauruntee you will not be sorry. I strongly recommend this movie for everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Been searching for this movie for years!","review":"Looked everywhere for this movie. Found it on Amazon.co.uk!...on dvd!

I guess my mistake was that I hadn't actually read the book in it's entirety, which I intend to do now. When my husband and I finished the movie we decided not to keep it. It is not the wholesome movie we thought it might be. Of course we realize... how wholesome is a life like Huck Finn's to start with anyway? We aren't blind to that fact. We just know that if we had children of impressionable ages around wanting to watch movies and they said, \\"Hey... The adventures of Huckleberry Finn... can we watch that one?\\"..... that we'd say... \\"NO!!!\\" Anyone considering getting this movie should really think about what values you personally are trying to instill within your family, and hold to them. This movie certainly does not do that for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good novel","review":"Author has an unusual voice. Good characterization.

For the new listener this is music that is reminiscent of Kurt Weill, of strolling players across the continent of Europe and Asia, and of some down home American sounds. Stojka is an incredible technician with faster, cleaner fingers on the struts than most anyone else around. He is accompanied on this selection of thirteen tunes by Heimo Wiederhofer on brush snare, Claudius Jelinek on rhythm guitar and banjo, and Eva Berky on violin.

Compared to the US version, the Limited Edition Box Set also has, in my opinion, a better selection of tracks--my favourite so far being 'Watchin'' by The Freemasons. Plus, if nothing else, the DVD contains the music video, 'Star to Fall' by Cabin Crew--that makes the album worth purchasing in itself--why can't flying be more like that lol..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy This!","review":"Microsoft no longer offers the code that is required in addition to this DVD.

I tried to sit through the entire film to give it a chance, but found it too painful (due to the presentation, not the subject). DVD went straight into the garbage. The fact that this film currently ranks 4-stars in Amazon, and won a Boston film festival award, reflects poorly on both forums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sex-Trade Drama","review":"This film was not critically praised (27 on Rotten Tomatoes), but despitea melodramatic second half, the film was informative, disturbing, andfor me, riveting. Like \\"Pay It Forward\\", Kevin Kline again stars in a movie with a serious social message. A 13 year old girl is kidnapped bya ring of sex-traffickers, who sneak her and a few others, out of Mexicointo America and other countries, to be sold to pedophiles, often forvery large sums of money over the internet. Since the movie is meant tobe educational as well as entertaining, some realism is sacrificed. Butit is intense and riveting, and the performances are good. While it wasmade by the maker of \\"The Motorcycle Diaries\\" which was considered a farbetter film, having seen both, I would rather watch this over againdespite its rather obvious flaws."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing movie","review":"Loved it.

The little you will find come very close to the end of the book. The book reads very slowly. There is nothing dramatic going on. No passion. Just waiting until the heroine trusts her patiently waiting husband enough to consumate their marriage. If 60% of the book was taken out, you wouldn't miss anything at all. The hero and heroine don't have chemistry at all. They remind me of an old couple who lives together/makes small talk/ and has comfortable silences. Like The Wilsons from Dennis the Menace. Admittedly, the 2 love scenes weren't bad, but you have to read 90% of the book before you get to them."},{"rating":"1","title":"booooring...","review":"I had read the reviews that stated that this book was a little slow, but I hadn't expected for it to barely move at all. Forget the actual sensuality...this book has a teeny tiny story that is somehow (and at times painfully) spread out into a normal length book. I kept waiting for the scandals of his father and her father to come out, but when they did come to light it was just brushed over (and after so much build up too). I think this will be the first in a series. This is my first book by this author and was passed on to me by a friend.

When I played this CD for the first time, and in the beginning and end of the first track heard a child's voice interrupt the music and say \\"I love you mommy, I love you daddy\\" I couldn't believe my ears. I know the track is called,\\"Innocent Child\\", but I still see no reason for music that many of us use for contemplation, meditation, or just gently flowing background music, to have a child or any other voice saying anything.

The content is easy to use, easy to read, so if somebody had a kid in need and they didn't have enough background to use other educational materials (which would be more flexible and adaptable to an individual kid's needs, but would require teaching experience), it would probably help.

Dylan also expected special treatment from her aunt, who is a riding instructor at Chestnut Hill. But her aunt is too moody to pay attention to Dylan.

However, his customers, employees, and family treat him like dirt because of the nature of his work. I guess that is supposed to be funny, but I found it quite sad. I think you will only find this humorous if you enjoy laughing at others' debasement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Common Sense Wisdom","review":"\\"Kenny\\" is a mocumentary about a Melbourne Aussie (Kenny) who's a porta-potty guru. As you learn the business of waste management you soon realize there's more to Kenny than meets the eye. As he battles the oddities of dealing with people and their waste needs, you are treated with some of the best common sense wisdom. He covers everything from divorce, fatherhood, family conflicts, to death, and employee relations. He is an honest, straightforward, simple guy who just wants to do a good job for people and be treated with respect. \\"Kenny\\" is a hilariously funny movie with a heart. This is a movie you will think about for a long time after. English subtitles are provided for the \\"Aussie-Impaired\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just saw Kenny at Traverse City Film Festival","review":"Just saw Kenny at the Traverse City Film Festival and Michael Moore was right!

This movie really hit home for me.See the movie, You'll feel better about yourself after."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious must see","review":"By the end of this film, you'll love this guy. Kenny appears to be a bit rough around the edges but he is a funny person that leads a unique lifestyle installing port-a-loos. The humor is mostly toilet related humor but it's understated and mostly revolves around the way people stereotype him and the strange situations that his job gets him into (saving the port-a-loos from Nascar fans).The interviews with Kenny are very candid and his support cast are great. I especially liked Kenny's relationship with his family and how they give him so much strife about \\"not having a real job\\" and he just takes it. It certainly makes his romance with the flight attendant who accepts him for who he is, more genuine. Overall, this is an uplifting one to see."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite movies","review":"This little gem is just an awesome movie! Kennie will endear anyone, I'm quite sure. He is a man with a sincere, gentle manner and he puts his heart into his work--even though almost no one (including his father and brother) respects what he does for a living. Kennie delivers some hilarious lines in the most deadpan serious way. You'll be surprised by the wonderful story line woven into this mockumentary on the porta-loo business in Australia. I don't think it's suitable for children. The language is pretty colorful along with a few surprise scenes that I wouldn't let my children see. Still, this is one of my top favorite movies of all time and it's one I can watch again and again (unusual for me). Be sure to watch the Extras on the DVD after the movie. I was amazed about the cast, where the story idea came from, and how they pulled this small budget movie off in such a professional way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really funny, true account of a man's life in the industry.","review":"I work in the portable toilet industry and maybe I found it funny because I can relate to his story.

The feature set is great, but- callers reported persistent echo unless I turned down the earpiece volume rather low.- callers reported an annoying, loud, beep every so often. This couldn't be tracked down - it's not call waiting and it's not the messages waiting notification. Neither of these conditions occured on another 2.4GHz phone I have. A friend of ours who saw that we had this phone said he had had the same problem and eventually returned the phone.- shortly after the warranty ran, 2 of the four handset's displays gradually got scrambled and now are completely unreadable.- The company's toll-free number wasn't working and they never responded to e-mail support requests.There are good deals out there. This phone is a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good","review":"When it was new, the annoying features were:-The available ring tones are all piercing and obtrusive.-The answering machine is counter-intuitive, its automated voice is unnatural and unpleasant, and it's had to navigate from message to message.-The date/time is lost every time the electricity goes off, even if it is only for a fraction of a second.Now that I've had the phones for over a year, the jack for the headphones is not working in either of the two receptors.I wouldn't buy this model again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I bought one of these phones with the base station, which includes the digital answering machine and one additional handset. I originally liked it, but after several months to a year the sound quality on the answering machine went way down. Sometimes it is difficult to understand messages received. The digital answering machine does not work properly and you cannot skip messages anymore. As well the display panels on both units have burned out, so the caller ID function has been rendered entirely useless. Given the option I would definitely choose a different system and plan to replace this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"This one eats tapes!","review":"After reading the mixed reviews on this VCR (some say it's wonderful; others claim it eats tapes), I decided to purchase it since it was potentially a great value.

I have to give Amazon props for providing their customers with outstanding service. What about that VCR? Well, this Toshiba is a thing of beauty. Not only from an aesthetic standpoint, but in ease-of-use. Very simple to set-up and program. It is also accompanied by an easy to follow owners manual just in case you need it. The on-screen programming is a brilliant white on baby-blue, and I find myself programming my VCR for the pure enjoyment of it. The first tape I put in was Bjork's \\"Volumen\\" (ASIN 630522336X), a masterpiece in of itself. The picture was so clear and crisp and pause looked like a still photograph (no messy lines). This is a high quality Hi-Fi Stereo VCR at a great price.

It also confirmed a suspicion of mine, namely that anti-Semitism was a lesser obstacle than bias against women.

As synonymous phrases this book lists: bias, biased judgment, favoritism, green-eyed monster, jaundice, partiality, warped judgment. Is jealousy (green-eyed monster) really the same as biased judgment? I don't think so. The former is envy, the latter favoritism. And does \\"warped judgment\\" fit into the same category as favoritism or envy? Again, I think not.

Many of the sub-plots seemed rushed to conclusion \\"it's the end - quick - slap something together to wrap these up!\\" We even have people miraculously show up that were killed off. The conclusion of the main plots was, in my opinion, a flop. It's as if there were two episodes missing between the final two. Or that the final episode was just so badly edited.

It is very simple with beautiful illustrations. It is a board book, perfect for small children. My 22-month-old grandson frequently requests that it be read to him. It has brought tears to the eyes of some dads I know who have read it.I have often given this book as a gift."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I wanted","review":"I bought this book for my husband for his birthday to read with our son.

I'm convinced Brits dont hear the same way Americans do. Because while all of cd 1 is good about half of cd 2 are tracks sung my singers who are out of tune or cant sing. I admit I've never heard of most of these artists so I have no nostalgic connection to any of the songs.

Very dissatisfied!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is not who Nicole really was","review":"Nicole has and continues to have a major impact on my life each and every day. This book is not needed to make Nicole more real to us. To make Nicole more real listen to what her family has to say about her and look within yourself. Nicole is watching over me and I know she would be dissapointed if you looked at this book and thought that it typified her life. Nicole was a beautiful, vibrant, caring, very real person who has a spirit that still lives in all of us when we look deep enough to find it and identify with her. She is not the person this book portrays."},{"rating":"1","title":"The lifestyles or the rich and idle.","review":"Poor Faye Resnick. I really feel sorry for this lady. It must be a hard life, being a Beaverly Hills socialite. At what restaurant do we eat? Who do we have affairs with? Can we go to Cabo San Lucos next week? Such are the mighty questions Faye asks in her book. All that stress must have forced the breakdown of her marriages and the cocaine and alcohol habits.As the previous reviewers have already noted, there is not much sympathy for this kind of lifestyle.I read this book for the simple fact of gaining some insight into Nicole's husband. O.J. is indeed a great actor. His facade has masked what he really is. In this, the book suceeds in giving some glimpses of a very troubled person. At the same time, it gives a poor view of the lifestyles of the rich and idle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Trash","review":"\\"Lovely\\" Faye jumped on the bandwagon after the murders to publish this trash as soon as possible to gain notoriety and profit. She sure did not do her so-called best friend Nicole any favors.Part of this narrative is spent in praising herself, at the same time she paints a picture of promiscuity, lesbian encounters, drugs and party, party, party. Where are their kids when these damaged and selfish women are out partying, sleeping around and drinking, and she has the nerve to paint herself as a good mother.This book is disgusting and so is Faye Resnick."},{"rating":"1","title":"what the (bleep)?","review":"I thought this book would be a chronical of Nicole and OJ's relationship from the get-go, and how things eventually devolved to the sad state they were in at the end, but instead, it focused more on Faye Resnick's scatterbrained rantings about restaurants, clubs, sexual partners, vacations, and utterly soulless, vapid \\"friendships\\"...all provided in non-chronological order! There was relatively little information about the relationship between the famous couple: strange in a book that purports to be about that very subject. I feel sorry for Faye and Nicole, because I come away from reading this disjointed, rambling, bizarre account of seemingly disconnected events with the impression that both of them were seriously emotionally damaged women. So at least that was conveyed well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than I expected","review":"I wasnt aware of most of the facts that the author wrote about in this book. It was very insightful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoughtful, engaging","review":"Having tried and failed to finish Consider the Lily, the book written by Buchan just before Perfect Love, I was pleasantly surprised to find a story full of engaging characters. Buchan is a talented writer, and her descriptive powers are demonstarted in both books, but Consider the Lily is depressing, with no characters to capture the reader's sympathies. This book reminded me of Joanna Trollope more than Rosamund Pilcher, but readers of either will enjoy this story. I look forward now to reading Ms. Buchan's later books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chocolate High Heel","review":"The high heel shoe candy mold was a fun challenge to use for special gifts for family and friends. I studied a video about making chocolate shoes and tried to replicate the technique of evenly coating the shoe mold. It takes a little practice to get the chocolate candy melted, but the results are amazing when you remove the plastic mold and see the finished product. Then fill the shoe with wrapped truffles or chocolate kisses for an added touch."},{"rating":"2","title":"FABULOUS!!!!","review":"I have owned one of these pop corn poppers for years. It is the best.My favorite recipes are to add about one (1) tablespoon of sugar to the oil and pop the corn in the sugar and oil. A sweet treat.You can also do the same with Salt. About 1 to 1 1/2 teaspoons of salt to the oil. No need to add salt at the end of popping. All kernals have flavor.Add melted butter before you dump the popcorn into a bowl, spin it around in the popcorn popper, again, all popcorn gets a bit of butter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great","review":"1. The popper works as advertised in 3 minutes with almost no unpopped popcorn.2. I used several of the movie theater pouches. The result was disappointing.3. The corn was chewy.4. The taste was adequate but not special.5. The popper is of very lightweight aluminum and bends easily..it warped a little out of shape at the lid after only two uses.Maybe I received stale pouches, but this was a big disappointment considering the huge number of positive reviews.Note that the secret ingredient in these theater pouches appears to be an oil blend with coconut oil. Note that the saturated fat per serving is 42% and per bag is 210%...gigantic and hardly average.I find PopSecret Homestyle actually to be superior and certainly comparatively healthier."},{"rating":"1","title":"These reviews are false","review":"I maintain that these positive reviews are advertisements. This is a thin, cheap device that makes average popcorn and a mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"The most over rated item on Amazon.com","review":"The popper is flimsy.

I have read the Huckelberry Murders first and now more of it makes sense. This is a light read and the plot is not overly complicated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bo and Pap make for a delightful read","review":"Bo Tully is a widower and the sheriff of Blight County, Idaho, as was his father. Bantim Scragg's and his sons are not known as law-abiding citizens so when a call comes in that they are reporting a body on their fence, it gets Tully's attention. When more victims are found, clearly not locals, the crime takes on a different focus.Patrick F. McManus is a well-known author of humorous outdoor adventures and a columnist. To his repertory, he now adds mystery writer. This is a delightful book in a different setting and interesting police work. Blight is a very small Idaho town where everyone knows everyone and the weather is an element not to be ignored. All the characters are wonderful, particularly Bo and his father, whom everyone calls \\"Pap.\\" There is gentle humor, a good mystery and an unexpected ending. I liked that the mystery included both locals and outsiders. I've not read McManus before, but I shall look forward to reading him again."},{"rating":"2","title":"McManus the mystery writer?","review":"Patrick McManus has been one of my favorite humor authors for many years. I remember reading his stories in Field and Stream and then starting on his books. This is the first full length fiction I have read by him. While it didn't blow me out of the water, I did find it interesting, funny, and well worth the read. I am looking forward to the sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Someone's Kidnapped Pat","review":"I like the author's short stories as much as anyone. However this book proves he should stay away from full length books. First of all this book has none of the usual humor of his other work. It just a flat dull read. The main character is a smug little twit. He's apparently dated every woman in his county, which just goes to show how desperate rural women with no options can get. His lawman job is a sinecure he inherited from dad. The dad is also a character in the book and a living legend in the county. We know this because the author tells us, not because old pop ever does much. As our hero was preparing for a date with yet another unlucky target of his desire I just reached my limit and called it quits. I'll finish the book when I'm as starved for entertainment as the average resident of the book. No on second though I'll never get that starved."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short and skimpy","review":"This small booklet is really much smaller in content than it first appears, because it is composed of multiple articles and speeches given by Ezra Meeker, many of which are essentially duplicative of the others. The story is an interesting rendition of Ezra's attempt to stimulate interest in marking and memoralizing the Orgegon Trail, which he first traversed as a youth. It's quick, easy reading, but doesn't give much depth of detail. It appears like a Readers Digest summary of a bigger book. Suggest you look elsewhere for more complete works by Ezra. However, the very low price may make it an interesting and worthwhile bargain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too High Maintenance for my Taste!","review":"It works as advertised, and if you want a quick way to downloadyour work, this will do the job. The trouble is getting it startworking! Took awhile to get everything installed correctly and then I had to keep popping the floppy out and back into the drive so the software would be reminded to look for the presence of the special floppy! Probably does this to save the battery, but it is irritating. I have a 450Mhz Pent III, I hook the camera in direct and have no problems. I could have done without this pricey accessory, but I may be glad when I am trying to save stuff on my clunky old company issued laptop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Temperamental at best","review":"I bought this adapter because of concerns over how long it took to download directly fromt the camera.

Also, if you need to find a book where it locates just about every coaster in the world, I would reccomend: The Roller Coaster Lover's Companion, by Steven J. Urbanowicz.

[Hopefully there'll soon by a 9/06 guide.] It tracks precisely with the competency sections tested in all areas of the GK. My only criticism is that if you are so fortunate as to get one of those harder tests they give out, :) the practice questions on the math portion in the CN's book are not sufficiently difficult.I also purchased the GK guide put out by REA, which isn't as good a guide to the overall GK test, but has a wider variety of practice questions. If you use this Cliff Note's book as the basis for your studies and cull through the REA guide for additional, harder math problems, all should be well. (Note: there is a rumor in Florida that the computer-based math test is almost always easier than the written test. Trust me--this is not true. :) )"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good test prep","review":"I purchased two test prep books for the FTCE General Knowledge Test. This was by far the better of the two. I was very familiar with the content, so I was mostly looking for the practice tests. This book has TWO full practice tests as well as smaller quizzes throughout the book.I took the test and passed all of the sections in March 2008All three of the multiple choice sections of the practice exams were VERY representative of the actual tests. Good prep!I think that the front of the book (where they teach the content) is very good in this book, though I did not read most of it. But, comparing it to the other prep book for this test, it is much more comprehensive. So, if you need to brush up on the content, this looks like a good book from which to learn the material.If you were only going to buy one book to prepare for the test, I would say this one will help you. I used this and the XAM book, and this one is far above the XAM book."},{"rating":"1","title":"An OK Book","review":"I thought the practice tests in this book were a lot easier than the actual test itself.

I know they have to make the real test harder, but they really should update this book ASAP and put some harder math ?'s in this book as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT STUDY GUIDE!!!","review":"I purchased this book only for the Math portion of the study guide. So that is all I can really comment on but the math portion was very informative and easy to understand. I am terrible at math and this book was very clear and had excellent explanations for solving different math problems. I loved after each lesson whether it be fractions, percentages, or even geometry, there were mini sample questions in addition to the 2 full length tests at the back of the book. The one thing people should be aware of is the \\"Mathematics Reference Sheet\\" is very helpful, but I was under the impression it would be given at the test and it was not. So make sure to memorize the conversions and equations. I just took the test and passed. I found that the practice tests were similar in format and content to the actual test. I would definitely recommend this book for it's quality and affordable price to anyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Have!","review":"I would recommend this book to anyone who's getting ready to take the GK.

The reason I say that is the main fuse is only rated at a max of 10 amps which in reality is not sufficient to even check a simple house outlet (15-20 amps). If you are careful and make sure that the amperage is not going to blow the tiny fuse, this multimeter will do a fine job especially for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Dolly","review":"This dolly is well built and sturdy.

I bought this for him, and now I eat just as much as he does. It's easy to clean, easy to use, and the recipe booklet that was included has great ideas! The popcorn comes out tender and never chewy, and there's usually only a kernel or two unpopped.

If you like swing-era music, you won't go wrong here. And, as other reviewers have stated, the sound of this CD reissue is not what it could be.I have a dub I made from the 1950's vinyl issue of these tracks, and it sounds much better than these CDs. The chief problem with the CDs is too much filtering of the high end, in order to reduce surface noise from the original disc sources. But the noise of the originals was quite acceptable to begin with, and the filtering used on the CDs takes away a lot of the definition of the sound. The result is not horrible, but the superiority of the LP issue is plainly evident in a comparison.If you can't play vinyl, then by all means check out this CD set. But if you can play LPs and are willing to hunt down the original LP set, that's the way to go."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grammatical errors and mistranslations","review":"This otherwise useful book is marred by a number of grammatical errors and mistranslations.

About 15% of the DVDs that I own have at least one feature that can crash this player, when that happens the only way to reboot it is to hit the switch disk button, none of the other buttons will work. The remote control design is pathetic, half of the buttons are hidden by a cover, and are virtually inaccessable. The skip and fast forward functions are combined on a single key, to fast-forward you must hold down the skip button for several seconds, if you don't hold it down long enough it skips to the next scene.

This play also reads HDCD's, but not CDR's which are rewriteable disc. You can switch between the two disc and the player continues to play non stop.

Finally about a month ago it got the point where it would no longer recognize discs when I inserted them. It loaded the discs (mechanically speaking) just fine - but it could never seem to track to the start point of a disc.So I finally broke down and took it to Best Buy for repairs.

I was pleasantly surprised to watch Usual Suspects and Top Gun with LD clarity and NO PIXILATION! Maybe the player has something to do with it. I'd say that DVD video is equal to the quality of LD, and perhaps a touch sharper. It helps to have a good Sony Trinitron TV for accurate color and black levels.

You can't do it without sitting through the rest of the video again! Unnacceptable in my book. I returned it immediately and bought a Sony DVP S-530D.

I'm still befuddled as to how to solve for x in an equation. They don't give you a clear-cut or definite way; they only tell you to add/subract on both sides of the equation. And that's not working for me. The book seems to make a lot of assumptions, namely, that you're also taking an algebra class and can direct the questions the book doesn't answer to your teacher.

I bought one, not knowing any better. Afterwards, I discovered that it won't work on other brands of NIMH batteries, only Olympus. I tried it on some NexCell batteries (these are high-quality batteries) and the charger got so hot it almost caught fire. Also, it has no trickle-charge feature, so you can't leave the batteries in it without damaging them (the manual says 48 hours is the max). Finally, there's no 12-volt adapter so you can't recharge in the car. For about $27 you can get the MAHA MH-C240f, which will recharge any NIMH AA or AAA batteries, and also do Nicads, has a trickle feature so you can leave the batteries on charge for up to a year without damage, has a 12-volt adapter so you can rechage in the car, and doesn't heat up at all. It can even recondition your nicads (NIMH batteries don't require reconditioning).

It begins with an explanation of what an ice age is, and presents the evidence that there have been several through the span of recorded history. Several theories as to the cause of ice ages are presented including evidence supporting and refuting them. The author also mentions the potential for global warming, which has particular relevance to the present world.Written at the level of the middle school student, this book is a fundamental and effective introduction to the facts and theories regarding ice ages.

There are rich characterizations here and the dialogue is highly entertaining, tinged mostly with a dry humor and satirical wit.Having been in the annals of classic yet 'lost' shows for so long, I am so glad to see this wonderful series finally see the light of day.

Despite good performances by Eastwood and co-star Tyne Daly, \\"The Enforcer\\" (1976) suffers from a poorly developed script and James Fargo's lackluster direction. The action highlights are rather sparse, with surprisingly few Clint one-liners to enliven the proceedings. Jerry Fielding's jazz-oriented score is a weak substitute for the pulsating rhythms of composer Lalo Schifrin. A definite low point in the Inspector Callahan series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cleaner Still","review":"Third Dirty Harry picture feels more dated than the previous two with its portrait of crazed radicals as the bad guys none of whom register as believable or menacing villains. The picture feels more like a violent TV episode from the era. Like in Magnum Force, Harry is made into more of a conventional cop hero than the extreme personality from the first (and far and away best) film. The whole show here is his relationship with Tyne Daly as his partner. These scenes are the best in the movie and both actors deliver."},{"rating":"1","title":"Going Through The Motions","review":"Clint Eastwood must have been offered a lot of money to do this picture. Without a doubt the worst of the Dirty Harry movies. It seemed like Clint was doing a parody of himself.

The next Dirty Harry film Sudden Impact is a major improvement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad angle","review":"Skimmer is a nice large size and the holes are well-placed and also of a a good size but the problem is the overall shape. I bought this to skim the \\"scum\\" off the top of broths/soups without scratching the interior of enameled cast iron. Instead of an angled spoon or scoop shape, this thing is shaped more like a tennis racquet, which makes it awkward to use and hard to actually get far enough inside the pot to skim the surface in anything less than a huge pan nearly filled to the top. Even in a 6.5-qt pot with a very wide opening it's difficult to skim without having to climb atop the stove to reach around the entire pot. The shape is probably better-suited to straining fried foods from a deep skillet (or, ya know, tennis), but being made of nylon makes that a really bad idea.It seems to be made of very nice material and cleans easily but, unfortunately, it's just not good at doing the job for which I bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"the handle is broken with a loose piece under the hole.","review":"the handle is broken with a loose piece under the hole. the whole piece is a bit dirty.i'm returning it to get a new one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slide copier","review":"Does copy the slide, but the image appears at the end of a tube and you have to play around with it before it is usable.

When I need more of a certain size I just look for a set of just the size I'm missing and replenish the drawer in this chest. You may want to pick up a bit size template to determine what size your bits are. Once you take them out of the drawer you can forget where they go back.

Simply plug the SmartMedia card in the end (up to 32MB in size) and insert into your Type II slot. It's treated as just another EIDE drive, so you probably already have the drivers available! Transfer rates are phenomenal, and it makes the Olympus \\"Slide Show\\" software much nicer to use as a result. Great for those after-the-party pictures at conferences! Be careful, though -- the instructions on the adapter on how to insert the SmartMedia card are accurate, but deceptive; I inserted the chip in upside down (which it will do without complaint, but won't work either) and was confused for a little while.

I had one from about 10 years ago that was great. It weighed a ton compared to this one, but the sound was immensely superior. I couldn't believe my ears when I hooked this one up to my stereo system through the line out, the sound was so thin. Not at all rich and full like my old unit. And the feel of this new one made me think it wouldn't last ten weeks, let alone ten years. Shame on Sony for cheapening down such a good product. I packed it up and took it back.

The italian packaging comes with a ridiculous pair of earphones but I already had a couple of good ones so that's not too much of a problem for me. The trouble is that it doesn't seem to withstand e.m. waves radiated from a GSM phone placed close to it. It's the second unit I change and after some time (notably after an interference from the GSM occoured during a previous playback) the CD just spins down for no particular reason shutting off the unit (that means that the unit could have just managed to survive prolonged vibrations or that it could have been left sitting peacefully on a desk!) Now, I will get another unit for replacement and stick it in a Faraday bag but the idea doesn't please me at all! Nevertheless, it's aeons better than a Thompson CD player I originally intended to buy, but still: looks too delicate and it could be the first victim of GSM e.m. transmissions!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Adopting a chinese daughter prior to the CCCA","review":"Baby In A Box is the story of one missionary family's struggle to bring together an abandoned Chinese daughter and an American family.

Firstly Thomas does play the victim a bit - let\`s get real, he was a drug trafficker and no matter how unfair his treatment, if you break the law in another country you should be prepared to accept the consequences, not that Thomas hides the fact he is guilty, but he does unwittingly gain sympathy.Secondly, it is a bit hippy, traveller, everybody loves everybody, which I guess is no criticism but if you are a cynic like me...I would find it hard not to take the piss more out of the people that came on his tours having met several crusty niaive travellers myself, but this would not stop me recomending this as a must for anyone visiting Bolivia!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"This could possibly be the best book I have ever read.

It tells the story of a British subject convicted of drug dealing and incarcerated in a Bolivian gaol. The gaol, situated in the heart of La Paz, is a city within a city. The way in which it operates is to the western reader bizarre, but it has its own internal logic which becomes apparent as the reader moves further into the book.The main character is boastful and his account of events is narrated uncritically. Nevertheless Rusty Young does a good job in his narration, and the book is well worth reading, especially for anyone interested in South America."},{"rating":"2","title":"As addictive as coke - hard to put down","review":"This is the true story of how one man survived Bolivia's famous San Pedro prison.

Rather, it is a collection of humorous anecdotes from the life of a person who has lived brain injury recovery and is willing to tell on himself, his loved ones and the professionals that worked with him. I laughed all the way through the book and was given a peek into what must be anything but a laughable situation. He has such a colorful way of describing his difficulties with recovery from his brain tumor surgery and invites you to laugh (and learn) along with him. If you know someone that has suffered a brain tumor, a stroke, or a car accident that has left them with serious brain functioning problems this is required reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dick Schmelzkopf is a funny author.","review":"Brain injury is a serious subject but this author covers it with humor from his own personal experience.

First, he goes around town asking 'Who will be my friend?' and only adults respond to him. They agree to be his friend, but none of them has time to play right now.

Having read all of the previous mysteries written by Amanda Cross, I was looking forward to enjoying her literate and witty style, a thought-provoking plot and interesting character development. This book fails miserably in all three areas. The style is turgid, the plot is almost non-existent with a cop-out ending and the characters are one-dimensional (although I'm sure that Woody would say that she had more dimensions that that--I really did get weary of all the references to her size). I can only hope that the author will go back to creating a well-crafted mystery next time around.

Woefully disappointed. There is no depth of character, not in the narrator nor in Kate. There is no \\"sitting at the edge of your seat\\" (or bed) here. It's all tedium punctuated by long disquistions on being fat. Very definitely not up to par. Ironically, I had recently re-read some of Batya Gur's mysteries. In hers, there are echos of P.D. James'--with those wonderful multi-layered characters who are fascinating unto themselves and not one-dimensional, not boring.

The Cover read 'A Kate Fansler Novel,\\" whom I hoped to add to my list of must-read dectectives. What I found was Estelle \\"Woody\\" Woodhaven a fat female detective hired to solve the murder of a pretentious Professor of English Literature. Woody enlists Kate's help to solve the murder as she feels totally out of her league in Academia. While Woody's constant references to her size is annoying;it is her worship of Kate's intellect that eventually made this novel a real bore. One wonders how Woody made it through Law School. The characters are annoying and poorly drawn and the plot convoluted. I Would like to see Woody's Character in another novel sans Kate and with less reference to her size."},{"rating":"1","title":"Burned-out Writer Steals Plot","review":"I have been an avid reader of Cross's work, and so was bitterly disappointed by her most recent novel. She must have been out of ideas because she stole a famous Agatha Christie plot. It was obvious to me about a third of the way in. That Cross gives credit to Christie by actually having the two detectives watch the movie that was made from the novel may have assuaged her conscience, but it made me want my money back. The plot worked barely in Christie's exotic setting. . . in the English department of a small college worked it was completely lacking in believability."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to Par","review":"As a long-time fan of Amanda Cross, I'm glad this isn't the first book of hers that I picked up.

I too was appalled with most everything to do with this DVD. Particularly the song selection, and the lack of special features. I think for the price each band should have gotten more songs, especially Decapitated, whom is no longer together because of the tragedy. I would like to comment though on the fact of why Arsis is not on the DVD. For those of you who may know, Arsis had broken down while on this tour and missed quite a few shows (including the show that the dvd was filmed at). That is why they are not on the dvd, but they should have taken their name off of the cover. Altogether, I felt completely ripped off buying this dvd.

Then we go onto college and the physics classes there use calculus. Now unless you are a math and physics super student, then you should probably buy this book. To me, it seems to just give enough calculus. Some other books - the one used in my school for example, gives too much calculus and confuse the heck out of me. But this book puts concepts as the number one priority, and caculus as the secondary priority. Once the concepts are conveyed to the reader, the calculus seems to fit onto the concepts kind of naturally almost. I like that approach, plus the fact that the author can really explain things really well makes this a great book for all students struggling in college level calculus based physics classes."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great birthday gift","review":"I bought the 3 cars for my grandson for his birthday and he lovedthem....................he played with them all day and had to take them to bed with him.....It was definitely a winner with him."},{"rating":"2","title":"It may be educational, but it's really fun to read to my toddler too!","review":"My almost-two-year-old really likes this book - it's fun reading it together and she loves saying \\"Pop!\\" It's short and snappy enough to hold her attention.

I particularly appreciated the structural layout of this edition - from basic science through laws, regulations and policies, even touching on topics in investing and career development. The glossary and notes provided strong support to novices as well as seasoned professionals. In summary, this book is an excellent reference for both business professionals interested in reviewing its scientific aspects as well as technical personnel who need a grounding in the business aspects of the industry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only for the neophyte","review":"Poor, disjointed review of biotech with odd and off-target case studies. For someone who wants to know about the biotech industry and gain insight into how some of the major companies started, forget it. For someone who wants to understand how to start a biotech, no useful information. For the investor, you can learn more from the FDA website or the PHARMA website. Poor writing style.

Amazon did not reply to me but the author, Yali Friedman sent the 2nd edition to me with a hand-written apolgy for the poor construction of the book I bought.

A basic premise is the salesperson's ability to ask questions, and not just talk. Maybe this is a revelation for someone new to sales, but as I kept reading I found this book just restating the obvious. I've been in sales for 25 years, and this book is nothing new. Catchy title, they obviously have a lot of big name clients. Good book for a rookie though, but an insult to veteran salespeople."},{"rating":"2","title":"An important contribution","review":"While today the book's content seems pretty basic, at its publication the idea of thoroughly understanding the concept of the customer wasn't exactly widespread. Presenting without prior analyzing the goals and theories of the client, or misunderstanding them, is a prescription for objections. Don't make assumptions, is what we learn from this book, and we should be thankful for being reminded by the authors about this fundamental sales rule."},{"rating":"1","title":"Promises more than it delivers","review":"This book promises to change the way people sell and to increase your success rates.

These dusters also didn't pick up much dust- mostly they just moved it around. These are also not good for dusting around objects that might move- vases, etc.If you have a lot of flat, empty surfaces, and you just want a cheap alternative to a dust rag, and you don't mind little green fibers laying around after you dust, then these dusters might be for you.Otherwise, skip these and go with a higher quality duster."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bam!

Although I dearly loved the first two books of this series and am a great fan of her 'Rai-Kirah' series (didn't care much for Song of the Beast), but this book falls apart at the seams. The action is disjointed and the book feels sloppy. To tell you the truth, I rather wondered if Carol Berg had died or was sick and someone else wrote into an outline for this book that they found lying around her house. It feels as if someone else wrote this book. At this point Daughter of Ancients (book 4 of the series September 2005) appears to be a risky venture.They can't all be good reviews..."},{"rating":"2","title":"OK!

I highly recommend this book to all ages - many valuable messages that only Spencer can express with such finesse!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It could have been great...","review":"I was with this book right up to the end. Some may not find it believable that a country star would fall for the high school dork, but I found the romance rather redemptive for the cruel way Tess treated Kenny in high school. Besides, who hasn't read about the ugly duckling heroine who turns into a beautiful swan? This is a great twist with the hero being the ugly duckling turned swan.But LaVyrle lost me at the end when Tess announces to Kenny (while the two are in bed, no less) that she never wants to have children with him because her career is \\"too important\\" to her. Huh? A singer of the kind of music that traditionally celebrates family is putting her career over the family she might have built with her true love? Makes you wonder just how much Tess really loves Kenny and such wondering on the part of a reader spells the death of any hope for a successful romance novel.This book can be summed up in five words: In the end, a disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Loved It","review":"Being from Minnesota, I have read many books by Ms. Spencer, but have to say this book, Then Came Heaven and That Camden Summer are my absolute favorites. I loved them so much, I now own all three (to be read and re-read). They are worth it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Heart-warming & Nostalgic!! A Very Good Read!","review":"This should definetely be rated among Ms. Spencer's best. The main character (Tess McPhail) was portrayed as fresh & funky country music superstar that is forced to take time out from her very busy schedule to go back home and take care of her ailing mother. What she bargained for is a boring stay in the too-small town and painful reminders of her less than grand past. Tess eventually becomes entangled in a heart-warming adventure into the many stages of love and gains the wisdom to realize that there is much, much more to be gained in the giving then she ever thought she'd lose. Country music fans will adore this glimpse into the life of a star. Especially delightful are the backstage views of Nashville and the lonely road to stardom. This is a story that will leave you wanting more, as every LaVyrle Spencer novel does."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved it!","review":"I just found this book when I was moving stuff out of storage. It's been in storage for at least 3 years and I guess I've owned it since it was first published in 1997. I have no idea why I never read it before this! It was fun, romantic, sincere and just portrayed many very charming people. I am now going to find some more books by LaVyrle Spencer and read them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Small Town Girl","review":"I especially loved reading this book about the twists and turns of passions between Kenny and Tess. It really makes you feel that you should always keep your eyes open for love because you never really know where it is going to come about. It was great reading this book, quick read yet very detailed in what happens!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WONDERFUL READING - - IT'S A MUST READ","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I loved all the details about the country singers life. I'm a firm believer in beauty is only skin deep. I liked how Mac came to realize that Kenny (the high school dork) is the love she had been waiting for! I am a huge fan of LaVyrle Spencer. I have read many of her books, and I'm excited to read all the others. I haven't found one yet that I haven't loved."},{"rating":"1","title":"I liked this book.","review":"This was a good easy read book. It was not as involved as Spencer's other books but I liked Tess and Kenny. Their story started off with sparks of anger from the past, but the love story was a bit too \\"happy-ever-afterish\\". I had hoped that more attention would be focused on Tess and her jealous older sister's relationship. I still liked the story even though it lacked the realism that Ms. Spencer's other books have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Super Cheesy characters and story","review":"This was the first LaVyrle Spencer book I have read, though my mom (from Tennessee) has sent me several.I was not impressed with the quality of the writing. Though the story was interesting enough to keep me reading to the end, the descriptions of the characters, especially their clothing, made me question Spencer's sense of style. I found myself reading several passages to my husband and friends, just to make them laugh. For example, when Kenny \\"strode across the yard wearing a white knit shirt COLLAR UPTURNED INTENTIONALLY...and trendy topsiders\\". He sounds like such a GEEK even though he is supposed to be cool now. And Tess's and Faith's clothes are equally nauseating! This was a very annoying book that makes me hesitate to read another Spencer book, but maybe one day I'll be bored enough!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book was great I couldn't put I down for 5mins!","review":"The book keeped you wanted to know what was to become of Tess and Kenny and his daughter.

Waldron's piano swings in and out of shadows, while Red Garland seems to play the blues from a lit stage...both are gorgeous but different. Art Taylor stretches a beautiful spine on both sessions, allowing the music to grow straight and strong. Trumpeter Bill Hardman and Jackie trade loose solos on the title track, it's kind of like Jackie's the hare and Bill the tortoise only Jackie sleeps with his eyes open, however, there is nothing frantic about this record...just gentlemen swinging softly.

I could not understand how a man would want to kill his own son when he was 3 or 4 years old or an adult because it was an inconvienence to him and he was another race. To me that is pure evil.

The women featured are Madge Bellamy, Eleanor Boardman, Leatrice Joy, Laura La Plante, May McAvoy, Patsy Ruth Miller, Colleen Moore, Esther Ralston, Blanche Sweet and Lois Wilson.It is difficult to be genuinely and passionately interested in stars whose films one has not seen. Sadly, most of the films of the actresses featured in this book are unavailable for viewing either due to decomposition or lack of commercial release.Therefore, this book requires prior knowledge and interest in silent films on the whole. Without such knowledge, anecdotes about other famous stars such as Mary Pickford, Cecil B. DeMille, and Zasu Pitts become meaningless.Overall, this book is a nice contribution to the archives of silent film history simply because the words came from the stars themselves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Paint brush and roller cleaner","review":"Paint brush roller works as expected.

The major home one anywhere but online. The cleaner uses centrifugal force to spin brushes or rollers to remove excewss paint and water. I was skeptical that this method of cleaning would work, but after using it the first time I was very surprised and satisfied. The only problem was that the cleaner we received looked like a returned item and had a brokem pump handle clip on one side, otherwise I would have given it 5 stars.

The rating is based on the obvious false advertising, not the product itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must for Anyone Doing a Large Paint Project","review":"A friend loaned me this brush/roller cleaner and I had to have one. When paint starts to dry on the outer bristles of your brush it makes cleanup a nightmare. But cleaning a brush also means waiting a day for it to dry out to reuse it. Not with this tool. I could clean my brush and then dry it out with this \\"spinner\\" and I was back to painting. Cleanup of my expensive Purdee brushes was a breeze. No more wire brush cleaning/ and damaging of my good brushes. The brush/roller cleaner does not work with wennie rollers. I'm thinking that a wood dowel might work with the wennie rollers. Regardless, the effectiveness and low cost make this a MUST HAVE tool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Become a pro painter","review":"I used to dread cleaning up the brushes and rollers after painting. The dread was so great that I bought the cheapest brushes and rollers possible and threw them away after one use. My finished paint jobs looked cheap too. With this tool, I now buy the best brushes and rollers, cleaning them not only at the end but along the way too because it is so easy and quick. The best brushes and rollers last much longer when cleaned often and as thoroughly as this tool allows you to clean them. I save a lot money, time and have much better looking painting results.

The information included was generally very up-to-date and thorough. That said, the LP writers must have been directed to gild the lily whenever possible. More than once I decided to visit a place that LP gushed about only to find myself in either a backwater or a noisy charmless city playing cards until the next day's buses rolled out.Halfway through my trip I found a used copy of Fodor's UpClose Central America Guide (used to be the Berkeley Guide, remember those?) and bought it. The UpClose Guide, while incomplete, provided much more honest commentary on the places I wanted to visit. The book is no longer in print but you might be able to dig up a used copy somewhere.I'd still recommend the Shoestring Guide: you need to know where to catch your bus!"},{"rating":"2","title":"You can't do better","review":"You can't really do better than this book if you're traveling in multiple countries in C.A.

I gave it as a gift to my son who was able to put 2 screws into the wall and it quit. I took it to a machinist to see if it could be fixed and altho he got it to run again, it only screwed 2 screws and quit. From the beginning it was a lemon. When the load was applied to the screw, some sort of auto release kicked in and wouldn't let it screw in the screw.

I hope I helped you if you were considering these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Must order two for a pair, even then not worth it","review":"Perhaps I didn't read the product description closely enough, but I thought that the plural title \\"wristbands\\" implied that there was more than one in a package. This turned out to be an incorrect assumption, so after paying twice as much for shipping than I paid for the product, I now have only one wristband. In terms of quality, although I haven't used it, it seems to be low to mid-range absorbency, so for someone like me who sweats a lot during tennis, I would guess it would last about half an hour before just being a saturated sponge on my wrist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frusterated!!! :(","review":"I ordred wrist bands for a halloween costume.

This is the first novel I've read by her and will probably be my last. I heard she was very good, so I was quite surprised when I realized how disappointing this story was. Basically, reading this novel was like watching a bad episode of Oprah, but with slightly less substance and entertainment. Perhaps the proper response that Oates wanted to evoke in her readers was for everyone to nod in girl-power agreement as they do on Oprah. Maybe my literary tastes are too lofty, but this novel needs to provide more than that facile analysis of rape that one could get on daytime talk-shows, namely, that stock interretation that states that rape is not only rape of the body but a rape of the soul. Oates should stop resting on her laurels or she will run the risk of becoming redundant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Remarkable Here","review":"First, I must say this: Ms. Oates, please get yourself a decent editor. This isn't the first work I've read of hers that had grammatical errors.Dunno what I was expecting in this book. A new perspective, perhaps? Sadly, this novella was simply a rape story with the 'bad cop' taking justice into his own hands. I've watched lifetime movies that were better than this. The story was bland, the plot predictable.If you're looking for similar subject matter, try reading Alice Sebold's brave, gripping memoir, \\"Lucky\\".Reading Oates' \\"Beasts\\" next. I hope it's better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't Get Into It","review":"I couldn't get into this book. I expected a lot more. But I just became bored with the story. Maybe I should pick up something else by her."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Didn't Really Get It","review":"Men are evil, and women...well that's another story. I didn't get it. Call me morbid, but I did rather enjoyed the death of the rapists. That's all I got to say on that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible. Don't read this.","review":"I'm not sure why Joyce Carol Oates thought it was necessary to write about something you watch on TV and read in the newspapers everyday. Why bother? Her obsession with these kind of topics, without adding anything new, is grossly disturbing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Escape to Reality","review":"Books are suppose to be an escape from reality not a morbid dose of it. I found it difficult to get through and the whole time I kept wondering, \\"When does the love story start?\\" There are many better books out there, don't waste your time with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"She had it coming. She asked for it.\\"","review":"I've hesitated reading RAPE: A LOVE STORY since it was published; the idea of reading about a rape never constituted pleasure reading for me with any stretch of imagination. But to tell the truth, I was also intrigued by the subtitle \\"A Love Story\\". Something was telling me that Joyce Carol Oates was going to put an eccentric spin on a terrible sequence of events and for that I wasn't disappointed.I read this novella in one setting and it was a very difficult and painful experience for me. Oates creates a typical situation in which the victim is ruthlessly blamed for her demise while the perpetrators receive the community's sympathy. In this rendition of this tale the victim has the backing of a renegade who takes matters into his own hands to right the wrongs of the faulty criminal justice system.In retrospect RAPE: A LOVE STORY is worth reading and to a degree necessary, not just for fans of Joyce Carol Oates but also for individuals everywhere. Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unexpected and Haunting","review":"Oats has done it again. She has written a short, intense novella that treats a horrible topic in a haunting and beautiful way. Through Bethie's experiences we live her terror, and through Dromoore's revenge we share her relief. My only criticism is that the ending was too swift, too pat. Where the few weeks following the rape were described in excruciating detail, the time after (especially Teena's) is glossed over. You wonder if she ever knew what Droomoore did for her, and if not, how she coped.All in all a worthwhile read, and one that will stay with you for a long time after."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tragic yet Beautiful","review":"This novella is a great example of Oates' powerful grasp on emotions and language. I particularly loved the shift in narrator, from character to character (although predominantly told by the daughter) and I loved the use of second person narration.This is a heavy novella and I thought it best that Oates left it at 150 pages. Anymore and you'd be ready to call your psychiatrist for a higher dose of anti-depressants. This is a tragic story of a rape yet a beautiful story of the love between a mother and daughter. It's short enough to read in one sitting, which is best because it's hard to put down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truth","review":"This book is not well written but it tells the truth of how rape victims are treated. Love the ending!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mother-Daughter Bonds","review":"Rather obvious for a title, but the writing was very crisp - the story moved rather quickly and the 2nd person narrative that dominated a large part of the story was effective for creating reader empathy for Beth, the young daughter of the victim. I suppose we'll never see Dakota Fanning as Beth, now that she's too old to play a 12 year-old."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"This is the fifth cuddle ewe under quilt I've purchased...3 for household beds, 2 for gifts.This is a beautiful product - when new, it is thickly luxurious and comforting to sink into...As it gets to \\"know your body\\" the under quilt becomes more compressed and contoured to you.It keeps you very warm in winter, cool in summer.I have been sleeping on one for 12 years, and it has supported very deep rest.I consider this to be one of the finest gifts I could share with someone as a wedding present,or as a therapeutic comfort in regards to age or illness.One of the greatest products - well done, Cuddle Ewe."},{"rating":"1","title":"A book review--and little more.","review":"I don't want to rewrite this article.

I guess I'll have to look up Tiefer's book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Black Russian pleasantly suprised","review":"I was listening to the Mark Gordon radio show with Stephen Perkins from Jane's Addiction and Danny Naten the Director about the making of the soundtrack for the movie. The process they went through to create the soundtrack fascinated me. So I decided to give this little independent film a shot.

We had a hard time getting the water pressure just right so that the water spray actually landed on the slide and not in the grass.I would, however, strongly recommend any double lane or racing slip 'n slide since with those slides, your hose is attached to a tube that runs down the middle of the slip 'n slide and thoroughly wets the entire slide."},{"rating":"1","title":"Number 10 is more a 2","review":"Although filled with marvelous actors who do a very fine job of creating their roles, I found these productions lacking in writing skills and at times without a clear understanding of what was going on.

In books this short it is hard to develop a character very well, but Shaw does an excellent job, and Kirsten's character comes through here more than in the first five books. Kirsten's well-meaning disobedience causes a terrible fire that destroys almost everything the Larsons own. We see the trials they endure as a result, but also the love that helps them through. Things seem to get worse when close family friends announce that they are moving away. Then Kirsten and her brother make a remarkable discovery in the woods and their luck changes.

Screws either sink through the sheet or don't go in far enough. The instructions say to rotate or pull out the depth adjustment but it is only a piece of plastic that moves on a sliding sleeve, every time you set a screw. I am thinking of putting some type of o-ring on the darned thing to set the screws properly.

Mr. Root's \\"revelations\\" about Ms. Turner include the assertion that she confessed to him that she had murdered Johnny Stompanato and allowed her daughter to take the blame. He also claims that the bedroom where Stompanato died was an incredibly gory scene which resembled a hog butchering.

He was very honest in the way he dealt his stories of former Presidents Nixon and Reagan. he did not try to gloss over the failings of either presidency or try to sugar coat anything. He explained his admiration of both Reagan and Nixon, and making a reasonable explaination for liking Richard Nixon can't be easy in a time when even the Republican party tries to forget him.

I recently got them out of storage to put on some new WTB Dissent, steel bead tires. Lets just say the tires won. I can literally bend these in half, and rip off all three \\"hooks\\" while trying to install a single tire. By the time I was done, my tire levers were scrap plastic and my tire was laughing at me. I don't understand how others are rating these as \\"sturdy\\". Maybe if you're putting on a kmart nobby. Anything with steel bead, or a post 2000 road tire....good luck, because you are going to need it when you're standing in the boonies with a flat and 3 broke tire levers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Plastic is so much better","review":"In the old days I used to use two screwdrivers to change an inner-tube. For a few dollars it's so much nicer to carry something like this and know that you're not going to rip a new hole in your tire when your putting your wheel back together. I changed a tire a couple of days ago and it this tool worked fine. The plastic held up, (didn't bend) and so far so good on the patch. I don't know how long the unused patches will stay fresh. Only time will tell."},{"rating":"2","title":"IT's A PARK TOOL, IT HAS TO BE GOOD","review":"When it comes to bicycle tools one name stands out, Park tools. When you go into a local bike store you see most or many of those same tools sold on their walls for you to buy and see them hanging in their service areas for their employees. Yes, some are advanced tools for jobs you might not be willing to attempt, nor want to pay for.

I would recommend it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Necessary evil.","review":"Blown tires are something we dont want to deal with while we are out on the road or trail, but when it comes down to it, we need to be prepared.

Being different and not following the herd it tends to be lonely. I do admire him for that! This book begins at full speed, an interesting story, but when you get to about half way, you notice the repetition of the quotes and basketball stories. Sorry, but I had a bit of trouble finishing the book, but eventually it did end and I was glad, because the story has a U-turn to boring!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cry me a river!","review":"I like Dennis Rodman the basketball player, but not the author. I borrowed the book, thank goodness for that foresite. I enjoyed about a third of the book. Then I noticed that he was continually repeating himself. repeating himself. And when he did - it sounded like whinning. I took this as long as possible. After fighting my way past the middle of the book I gave up. I couldn't take it any more. I had to quit. Sorry, Dennis. Yes, your a great basketball player, but get someone else to help you write. That book could have saved a lot of paper, if it had been half as long."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dennis Rodman is a GOD.","review":"\\"Bad as I wanna be\\" by Dennis Rodman definitely gives the reader an in-depth look behind that weird, funny looking guy.

He is the Best!!!!","review":"I think the reason that alot of people hate Dennis Rodman is because they don't understand him. I think that if people read this book it would help them understand him a little bit more than they do right now. They won't fully understand him because the only person that will fully understand him is himself.Anybody that treats Dennis bad can go to Hell!!! I think Dennis is one of the coolest people out there in this world because he don't care what people think he will do what he wants, when he wants and don't give a damn what people think and I think people like are very cool. I LOVE YOU DENNIS!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is crap.","review":"Fortunatly I did not have to pay to read this sophmoric peice of self-indulgent flatulence. It is the ramblings of an overpaid NBA star masterbating his ego. I read the whole thing hoping there would be some redemption in the end but I wasted my time. Please don't waste your money. There are plenty of quality basketball books available. This is not one of them. Rodman my be a great player, but this book blows"},{"rating":"2","title":"this is one of the best autobiographies ever written!","review":"In this book, Dennis Rodman reveal the side of him that no one has ever seen before.

I recommend this book to all Dennis Rodman fans out there"},{"rating":"1","title":"Run for the hills!","review":"Isn't it against the law to write books this terrible?

If you like Rodman and you want to hear his opinions about fellow players and what the NBA is really like, then check this out.

Why not? Dennis did!","review":"I am 45 years old and never really felt good about my self image. After reading his book, I can say this....

They make Seasame Street sound as if it teaches kids the world, but really it teaches the kids how to count to three.If you have read bad reviews about the book, you need to remember their ARE good reviews too. So try to stay away from the negative, and read it yourself.

I was expecting something resembling an autobiography of Dennis' life, with plenty of tales from experience. While there were a few such stories, much of the book could be described as a rant, with Dennis harping on about the same old stuff again and again.He hated the Spurs' coach, he's never been paid what he's worth, David Robinson is crap, he's a good rebounder, he was in two championship teams, he misses his daughter, he boinked Madonna, he's misunderstood, he had a tough upbrining.I mean, fair enough that this may all be be true...but do we REALLY need to hear about it over and over and over?? Even in the chapter about sex, which you would expect to have something a little risque in it, Dennis manages to mention his rebounding average AGAIN.If I took all the insights Dennis gave us and cut out all the repitition, this book would be about 20 pages long."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mr. misunderstood","review":"Though I was not the biggest fan of Dennis Rodman, as a basketball player, I always throught that the nba an media picked on him. People didn't hate on him as much when he played for Detroit, but as soon as he dyed his hair, that's when all the mean bashing began. In Bad as I want to Be, Dennis set's the record straight, and gives his opinion, on the league, and players. I have all Dennis's books and love them all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Used copies still at $.01","review":"Used copies are still up to a penny? I've been waiting years for resellers to finally pay me to read this book. I guess I'll have to keep waiting."},{"rating":"2","title":"There's Only One Dennis Rodman","review":"For all of his wild antics and crazy dressing, many people forget that Dennis Rodman is an exceptional athlete. After the Bulls lost Horace Grant, they needed someone to step in and rebound. Dennis Rodman was the perfect choice. He led the league in rebounding each of the three years he was with the Bulls. Bad As I Wanna Be chronicles Rodman's life from an airport janitor to NBA superstar. Readers also get a glimpse into Rodman's feelings, values, and beliefs. Sure, he may be wild and extravagant on the outside, but he also has a vulnerable side which very few people get to see. As a Chicago Bulls fan, I'm truly thankful to Dennis Rodman for helping the Bulls win 3 titles while he was here."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Too much publicity for Dennis Rodman\\"","review":"Don't waste your time on this book.

I'm not sure to blame the writer or the editor. If it wasn't for the pictures, my fiancee and I wouldn't probably continue with it. There's so many ways to improve this book it's sad that it hasn't been done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sooooo Last Century's News","review":"The only reason to go for this book is if you are a real collector of sex instruction books and need to have this to complete your \\"classics\\" section. This book was written a long time ago and is rather \\"out of date\\" and certainly not informed about alot of the really powerful devellopments in human sexuality which have occurred in the 90's and beyond. I mean, even lame sex-instruction authors like Nora Hayden and Lou Paget do better than this re-issue. If you really want to get something worthwhile in this category you should look at \\"9 Free Secrets of New Sensual Power\\" by Clint Arthur. That book is very modern and covers all the bases. Or go for something on video like Dr. Corynna Clarke's \\"Goddess Worship,\\" which is a truly fresh and beautiful look at \\"modern sensual healing.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing new under the covers...","review":"This book is merely a device for Mr Comfort's personal preferences. Armpit hair, personal odors etc. He also uses French phrases freely with no explanation of what they mean. This book seems to give permission to have and enjoy sex to readers who are well beyond the 'is it ok to...?\\" stage. Not sensual, not a turn on or inspirational. Even though the drawins are well done, they seem almost clinical as does the information."},{"rating":"2","title":"Creating Memories","review":"I bought this, along with several other engines and cars, from the Thomas the Train Wooden Railroad.

His bright blue paint and smiling face make him a joy to play with. My son just recently got Gordon, and he has quickly become one of his favorites. He likes to attach all of his other cars to Gordon and have him pull them. As with other trains in this family, Gordon is strong and durable and will provide hours of fun, interactive play. Pick Gordon up today for your child; they will thank you for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Little boys love 'em!","review":"Our grandson makes a beeline for anything blue, so this Xmas I got him Gordon & set it on a window sill right at his eye level. The moment he walked into the sitting room where the Xmas tree was all lit up with gifts underneath, he spied Gordon immediately & reached for it. Fit his hand perfectly & he carried it around & ran it on the carpet for the rest of his visit. I like the clean corners & its durability. Next year I'll find some tracksThomas The Tank Engine: Around the Barrel Loader Set&/or a DVD of Gordon storiesThomas & Friends: Holiday Express.
