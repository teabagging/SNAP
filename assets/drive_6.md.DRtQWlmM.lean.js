Christian Bale is what gave this movie it's essence. What a excellent and hot actor this guy is! The whole script was excellent. There was nothing wrong with it, everything done perfect. Only if the other batmans were as good as this one.Katie Holmes did not perform a good acting job in this. She was a bad choice for this movie. She showed no chemistry towards Bale, but Bale did showed chemistry towards her.I cant wait for sequels to this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's about time.","review":"Finally a version of Batman that seems made for adults instead of children.

Heard there were problems with two-disc set but really doesn't concern me because I'm more interested in the movie than the extras. This movie contains a great extra, namely the first scene of The Dark Knight. I actually have to upgrade my dvd software to play that because it was so new and I'm glad I did because the picture was so sharp and clear. Begins cannot even compare. As a movie, you either love it or not. As a product, you cannot go wrong with blu ray. Once you go blu ray you never go back."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST Batman film yet!!!

The musical score by James Newton Howard (KING KONG) and Hans Zimmer is so intense! It's awesome! Everything about this movie is amazing! I am already looking forward to the sequels! I hope that there are many to follow! Christian Bale was an excellent choice for the title character! I am a huge fan of his work now! Would love to see Harley Quinn and the Joker team up! And if it's done with the excellence of Nolan, hopefully she will be introduced in one sequel then reek havoc in the following. Just an idea. BATMAN BEGINS is excellent! A must own!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great come-back","review":"This is a brilliant recovery from the lousy parts 3 and 4 from the previous film series.

This one is fun to watch! (SARR)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Battastic!!!!!!!","review":"This is by far the way Batman should be portrayed in the movies. I have been waiting to see a movie that shows Batman(Bruce Wayne) the way he should be; dark, mysterious, and real. This is that movie. This movie is so real; you can just see this really happening in real life. Christian Bale has the look, feal, and acting ability to be Batman and Bruce Wayne. He plays the part with such dedication and strength. The villains in the film are realistic as well. No cheesy villains like in the Spider-Man movies. The Scarecrow is frightening and well done. Even though he is a little underdeveloped, but it still works, because it is a movie about Bruce Wayne!!Even the Tim Burton films lack what Batman is really about. If you watch the first Batman movie now you will see that it is cheesy, like the corny Joker. They have their moments but are mostly cheesy, campy, and unrealistic. Not this new film. I just hope they (Nolan, Goyer, Bale) make many many more."},{"rating":"2","title":"BATMAN IS FINALLY BACK!!!!!!!!!","review":"This movie is great iam not gonna ruin anything but the movie is definitly worth your time its abit long but entertaning and the ending is the best setting up for the original with you know who the joker go see this movie its is so good i hope Bale does more batman movies is the future and with the same team and without a doubt the best sequel"},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible transfer on Blu-ray","review":"I already had this title on standard DVD (single disc), but I couldnt pass up the opportunity to get this on Blu-ray when Amazon dropped it to 11.99.

It's darker than Tim Burton's and it complexly makes you forget about all the other modern incarnations of PG rated goffery. This film has a great build up and a great explanation of things. Bruce works hard and fails continually, we get to see him develop and suffer and most importantly we get a great new Bat Mobile.The only problem I had with this film is that the scarecrow just seems unnecessary. The movie worked so hard to present a new kind of realism that seems detracted from one that stupid mask appears. Henri Ducard was a good enough villain and the scarecrow just seemed to get in the way.Still all in all, this is a great picture - one that you can easily watch over and over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible Superhero Action Film","review":"This is one of the best Superhero films ever because is both entertainingbut at the same time, displays a kind of emotional intensity that I'venever seen before in the Batman Series.. it's extremely well producedbut the MVP goes to Christian Bale (who finally gets to really touch 'em all as Batman).He's one of the finest actors of my generation!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good film to say the least","review":"Is Batman begins. It relies a little too much on heavy handed action sequences (like a Chuck Norris film or recent James Bond movie). But it does have pretty good story and I love the way the guy with the mask is such a non-cartoon like villain so unlike any bad guy we saw in Burton's or Schumacher's Batman films or the 60's Batman series with Adam west. Also, I like the way the guy playing the cop in the film is no macho stud (like Tom Selleck) but is still allowed to be heroic. I also like the brief scene with the loose women and the pool."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware - Great movie, but possible bad batch.","review":"First things first. Batman Begins the movie rules. Great cast. Great director. More than makes up for the dreck that Joel Schlockmaker did with the series. I loved it. Why the one star, you ask? Because the the two-disc special edition I received as a gift, that was ordered through Amazon, has two major flaws. First, the second disc (the extras disc) doesn't load at all. Not on my DVD player, not on my PS2, not on my PC. I get the FBI warning, the Warner Brothers logo, then squat. Second, it didn't come with the special 72-page book that I heard so much about. All I got in mine was the obligatory Warner Brothers catalog of Batman Begins merchandise ($125 for a sterling silver Batmobile keychain???) and a Batman Begins branded flyer for Norton Antivirus (don't ask...I didn't even give it a second glance).

Fight scenes? Plenty of them, but you don't really see anything being done. Worst choreographed fight scenes--if this is a new Oscar category, this movie should win it. Background of Batman looks like a ripoff of the origin of Dr. Strange mixed with Magnus Robot Fighter (Remember that one?) Some interesting stuff with the effeminate looking badguy shrink with his \\"bag\\" of tricks, but Batman himself looks like he'd fit in better as \\"Fire Island Man.\\" This picture could have been a lot more than what it is, but it isn't.

The whole corrupt city being saved by a rich man is so simplistic and trite as to appeal to only the most sycophantic libertarian.Holmes' character is totally pointless. Bale, who is obviously talented after 'The Machinist', is emotionally flat.

I never followed the comic book series or cartoons as a kid or teen. I'm just an adult female who LOVES movies, especially superhero flicks. Now, with that said, I have never been a fan of the Batman franchise. I found the earlier Batman films, despite their all-star credibilities, be \\"over the top\\" in every deparment (set, acting, dialogue). As a fan of Christian Bale, however, I was anxious to see the Batman Begins installment. Bale is an amazing actor, even in his younger days with Empire of the Sun to much later with American Psycho or a little more recently with The Mechanic. This was the finest of all the Batman films - darker and with more depth.

The action scenes were frenetic and hard to follow as in who was fighting whom. Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman were good additions to the cast, but following the plot was like slogging through mud.

I remember watching this film originally in the theater and being scared to death for the guys he interrogated! The villians (Scarecrow/Ra's Al Guhl) were smartly handled well. Rachel, played by Katie Holmes, isn't eye-candy like the previous leading Bat-women. She actually has spunk and guts.Overall, all the characters in this film are very believable. For those that still want an \\"Adam West\\" type Batman, please rent the old 1960's film or 1997's \\"Batman & Robin\\" by Joel Schumacher!

Not so. Only certain areas of each brick are magnetic, and they don't fit together in any intuitive way. It's impossible to build the structures you see on the box using the magnetic points as anchors, so basically you're just piling plastic bricks on top of each other that will fall over at the slightest touch. That makes it pretty frustrating for a toddler who wants to do something as simple as opening a door so Bob or Wendy can go into a building. This toy was a big disappointment. On the bright side, he can play with the Bob and Wendy figures in our Fisher Price house, and we've been building Duplo houses for them.

No, they're not the most sturdy things, but my 18 month old can even make a tower with the magnetic pieces. And I've noticed no pieces that can come apart as a choking hazard.As far as the Thomas the train sets, yeah, they're better quality if you want to go ahead and blow hundreds of dollars on that stuff.

My son wanted over and over to build the house as shown on the box - it can't be done.You just can't build anything - not even the face of a house. Not even because the magnets do not hold but because there aren't the right shape bricks.He uses the bricks now as Skip's load but surely there are cheaper things for Skip to cart around!

The cover is with Ronnie Lane who was not in the band during the recording of this concert. This DVD is the final concert with Keith Richards. I'm sick and tired of companies putting out concerts with different covers of the same ones you already have. It's like bait and switch. And I am a number one Faces fan and this is a load of BS. And for those looking at the Rod Stewart and the Faces: Live In London, this DVD is the DVD featuring Keith Richards in his final concert, different cover. And honestly, this is the weakest show of the Faces I have ever seen because of Tetsu. You cannot even hear his bass in this DVD. I have a bootleg of this DVD that's a better quality than this one. Please do not put money in the pocket of this company, the only good thing about this is the cover.Yours truly,Number One Faces Freak."},{"rating":"1","title":"another copy of \\"The Last Concert\\"","review":"This is the same DVD as Rod Stewart & the Faces - The Final Concert.

Ronnie Wood is playing the keyboards, Kenny Jones is playing the bass, and the late Ronnie Lane is playing the drums. In fact, Lane is not even on this DVD, Tetsu is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely terrible DVD!","review":"This is a terrible DVD. The sound and picture quality are both terrible. The first couple of songs we watched all of showed more or Rod's butt in those gold shiny pants than it did his face. Prancing around and shaking his butt with the two big red veil type scarfs he wore it looked really weird. My wife was laughing her own rearend off it was so funny. I should return it but I will sacrife the money and warn others do not buy this DVD as it is absolutely terrible. We have purchased Rod Stewart \\"One Night Only Live at Royal Albert Hall\\" and \\"It had to be You\\" and both of these DVD's I would rate 5 stars for sound and picture. We actually enjoy these two DVD's so much we exercise to them. They are so enjoyable we have 30 minutes of exercise done before we realize it.

When I got these, the first thing I noticed is they ranged greatly in color, dark wood to light wood. Although it's not really that important as only a very little bit of the frame shows through the back, and none at all once hanged. The only other thing I'd have liked is if they were cut a little more cleanly. The ends aren't as smooth as the picture and if you're not careful, they could easily give you a splinter.Other than that these are very nice. Once put together they seem sturdy and they're light enough to make hanging them not a problem. They make a great deal too."},{"rating":"1","title":"This does not fit certain bikes","review":"It would be nice if they specified in the description of the product that it will not fit a number of different styles of bikes. I have a carbon frame bike that it won't even come close to fitting because of the size of the downtube. It also will not fit an aluminum frame bike my daughter has for the very same reason. Because of the cost to return, I kept it and gave it away to someone with a standard butted steel frame. I am disappointed that it didn't work for me and I wasted my money.

I mostly use it for propping my bike up in my apartment so I don't have to lean it on my furniture. It's wonderful for doing quick maintenance jobs, especially if you live in a small place and don't feel flipping your bike upside down or setting it up on a big rack.I give it four stars only because it barely fits my Jamis Durango 2.0 mountain bike. My bottom tube is tapered and goes to about 45 mm wide, which is wider than the hook on the stand. The hook still goes partially over the tube, though, and the stand still works fine. I'm glad it barely fits.Added comment 6/22/10 -- Because the hook barely fits, it rubs a lot every time I used it, and the rubber coating is starting to come off after about a year's worth of use. The coating would probably last longer with a bike that had a narrower bottom tube."},{"rating":"2","title":"cheap but amazingly useful","review":"sure this is a cheap stand BUT if you just want something to hold your bike from falling over and/or you want to have it around for quick drivetrain adjustments (if you set it just so, you can turn the cranks without hitting the stand) it more than does the job. If you're doing a major overhaul you probably want a real workstand but this is an awful handy thing to have around.I've used it more than once to work on a bike with the rear wheel out and/or adjust a derailleur that was a little out of whack, replacing cables, etc. etc. etc. You can't work on the front wheel with this stand, but that's not what it's designed for."},{"rating":"1","title":"For The Old","review":"I have 2 very modern bikes.

So now I'm stuck with this stand that will most likely not do anything for me. It's not worth returning it. I paid $8.49 for the stand and the same for shipping. $16.98 total. It will cost me about $5 to ship it back so I will only get $3 back after it's all said and done which to me is not worth it.If you plan on using this on a Trek Mountain bike look elsewhere, it will not fit and will scratch it. :o("},{"rating":"2","title":"It works","review":"It's made cheaply both material and the workmanship. It's made of relatively soft metal like chrome colored brass. Bright side of this is it's easy to cut, so if the wheel of you bicycle goes way up high, you can cut it lower with a hack saw with relative ease, at least easier than cutting steel. It supports the weight of a bicycle pretty well but you can't sit on the bike while it's on the stand, of course. Even when I cranked the pedal to the full speed, it was stable to reasonable level. It could have been a better design with hollow aluminium(or good quality steel tube) and lighter and I would have happily paid the higher price for it. The bottom line is this. It's not the most refined looking stand but it works for its purpose and I recommend it to anyone who needs a simple portable bike stand for on location repair or adjustment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome \\"Kickstand\\"","review":"The Pyramid Bottom Bracket Type Display Stand is an awesome item to take the place of a traditional kickstand. I don't need to add weight to the bike while riding. The stand is waiting for me in my garage when I return from my ride. A few minutes after returning from my ride I am easily able to safely secure my bike in a stable upright position, reducing the potential for the bike being damaged through falling or knocking against an rough textured adjacent cinder brick wall. Couldn't be happier. Sturdy, and well coated to protect the bike frame from any damage from the stand. Also, raising the back tire allows for routine maintenance of the drive and back wheel components. If your looking for a low cost, simple way to protect and maintain your bicycle investment, this is it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent portable stand, especially for touring","review":"The Pyramid Bottom Bracket bike stand is a great option to take along on those overnight rides. For example, when I do the DALMAC ride it allows me to stand my bike up during the overnight stays instead of laying it down on the ground or trying to find a (scarce) tree at the campground. With my bike standing I can then hang my riding clothes on it to dry in the sun. For these reasons I highly recommend this portable bike stand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even adaquate for older, round downtubes","review":"These Sunlite/Pyramid BB stands have a notorious habit of shifting under the bicycle it is suspending, rendering the bike ever so slightly angled to one side or another - but just enough that a misguided poke will send the whole mess flying to the floor.I once exhibited a series of vintage and modern lightweight road bicycles at a show wherein these stands were provided by the event organizers. I had the foresight to bring chainstay/seatstay hook stands (even then, not the best - crank mount stands are my preference) for my personal bikes, which served their purpose as intended during the event. On the other hand, we nearly lost a Cinelli MASH to one of these BB-shell stands, and had a few close calls with the other bikes as well.I might use one of these in an emergency, but I would not rely on it. Neither would I expect the vinyl-coated hook to refrain from damaging a thin, 1970's-era paint job - or a current-era clearcoat, for that matter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bicycle Display Stand","review":"The price is right and the holds the bike for repair, cleaning, or just parking.

This irritation was compounded when I sat down and listened to the album. This is not a bad album, for most bands it would be a solid effort, but I expect more from Sloan. What this album lacks is variety and subtlety. Most of the songs are just a little too straightforward.

His tonal palette is very broad -- he reminds me somewhat of Bream in this regard. It's a real treat to hear music that hasn't been recorded by anyone else. (Apparently Timofeyev discovered many of the pieces himself in \\"lost\\" manuscripts he studied while completing his doctorate.)His concert also included some wonderfully shmaltzy Russian songs for coloratura.Much as I love the Spanish and Latin American masters, it's a real treat to discover a whole, new, decidedly different tradition to enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't rely on it...","review":"This long-awaited follow up to the 4.5 Resource Kit has been a great disappointment.

Hall was definitely trying to aspire to arty French and Italian films of the time, but it doesn't work. As for the acting, the women are great - the men cardboard. Helen Mirren's first major film role as Hermia is fun to watch as is Diana Rigg's Helena. It's also pretty fun to see a 35-year-old Judi Dench as the bare-breasted Titania. Ian Holm is way over the top as Puck and a future playing villians is apparent when you see David Warner's attempt as the fair hero and lover.

The production (with its pink-lipped green fairies and hairy-chested Puck) may have been misguided, but the actors shine as future stars of British stage and cinema.Because of the poor quality and the faded print, I'd actually give it three and 1/2 stars.

So this comes in as an important piece of protection.Unfortunately in low light environment, especially when there's still enough light for the backlight of the keyboard to be off, you just can't see the keys anymore. Because of this issue, 1/2 of the time i'm not using the protection. The protection is very sticky on the side that goes against the keyboard, meaning that when you don't use it, it gathers a lot of dust very quickly, beating the purpose of having that \\"skin\\" on top of your keyboard.Another good idea, that really needs more thinking, as to what material should be used so that it's fully transparent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing fit","review":"I was really looking forward to using this product given how pleased I have been with the iSkin covers for both of my iPods.

The grandmother, Charlie Kate, is a fascinating, well developed character whom the reader cannot help but admire (she reminded me strongly of the aunts from Alice Hoffman's 'Practical Magic'). Somewhere between a medicine woman and a psychic, she was nevertheless predictable, in that she hung around until her daughter and granddaughter's lifes were fixed and then she died. Terribly predictable, but sparkling with its descriptions of WWII Raleigh and the life of an herbalist/midwife.

The main characters in this book are three generations of Southern women. They are strong-willed, very intelligent women and they will make you laugh and cry. Writing this review makes me want to go find the book and re-read it"},{"rating":"2","title":"So good I always own two copies...","review":"I like to keep a second copy of this book handy in case I need to recommend it to someone. I don't ever want to be without it. The women in this story all live on in my mind/heart long after the last time I read it. I was not crazy about Ellen Foster when Oprah went on and on about it...I always thought she should have chosen this book.I guess if you're \\"forced\\" to read this for school I would recommend that you have a quick attitude adjustment first. Having been stuck reading some seriously dry assignments long ago in the stone ages, how I WISH a story like this would have been put in my life when I was younger! I can't understand a word of the negative reviews here.It's like chocolate.I understand how people might not like brussel sprouts even though I do. I don't understand how anyone can possibly NOT adore chocolate. That's what Charms for the Easy Life is for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review of Visalia STock Saddle Co Reprint catalog of 1938","review":"This is a great reprint of an old catalog. It shows all of what was in the orginal. Saddles, chaps, saddle trees, hats, boots, bits, spurs, and some clothing. This is a great referance book for the person looking to research old equipment that they may have. I would recommend this just for informal reading if you like old west items. It includes prices of items in 1938. This book makes a great addition to your library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Walking in Victory","review":"I refer to this book often to get God's perspective on grace and my new identity in Him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christian Life Gold","review":"This book is a fantastic look at Romans 5-8, focusing on Christian life issues such as understanding the difference between law and grace, the dangers of legalism, formality and license in the believer's walk, and what it means and looks like to walk in the Spirit. Another great read from a great author. I especially like the author's understanding and presentation of the importance of knowing our identity in Christ and how it relates to everything in our walks with Him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forever changed my \\"Pharisee-like\\" attitude","review":"This book shows how to truly \\"walk in the Spirit\\" It highlights Romans 5- 8 and shows how our self-improvement efforts will always be \\"vanities of vanities.\\" We have to put our faith in Jesus. He's the One who did it all. Based on the content you can tell the author was greatly influenced by Watchman Nee's book \\"The Normal Christian Life\\" (also a VERY good book).

Free the shackles and experience a true walk in Victory."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great info on hiking in the untamed wilderness","review":"The book has great general info. on the numerous trails in our nation's biggest state.

This may have been a good product in the past, but it is a terrible product now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slippery in the shower","review":"If you are nervous about slipping in the shower or don't have good balance, don't get this! It really needs little suction cups or something to stay in place. You have to step on it with one foot to be able to use it on the other foot and it just left me tipping and almost falling every time. I ended up using in on the carpeted floor, sitting on the couch and even then, it was difficult to file every angle of my heel. Wouldn't recommend if you want a good file on your feet."},{"rating":"1","title":"what happened??","review":"I had one of these in use for about two years, and everything was fine with it...recently, I changed it for a new one, and it came apart within a week...

I purchased this for $27 (not including shipping). At the end of one week, I have a rash that's spread from my ankles to the top of my thighs, my upper arms, my chest and part of my abdomen. It looks and feels like I've been attacked by a million red ants. After a day, symptoms got worse. Never having any skin problems like this before, I went to the clinic. After $64 for the visit, $62 in prescriptions, I am now going to be on 10 pills a day for the next 14 days to get this cleared up. To boot, sweat isn't allowed, so no working out either. My lesson: STICK WITH THE TREADMILL, and use the money on a personal trainer. And my advice - try the Delfin Spa shorts and a run if you're trying to get rid of cellulite. They're cheaper and they actually work."},{"rating":"2","title":"a heart-felt tearful movie - if you enjoyed August Rush, you'll love Listen to Your Heart","review":"Listen to Your Heart is a heart-felt tearful movie. If you enjoyedAugust Rush, you'll love Listen to Your Heart. Music has the power to change lives, as demonstrated by Ariana. Deaf since childhood, she struggles between the privileged life of her mother's dominance or to reach out and risk the heartache of embracing love. \\"Music is a powerful thing, one song can change your mood, make a memory. One song can change your whole life.\\" The lesson, \\"Listen to your heart.\\"The film is rated NR yet is clean and will be enjoyed as a wholesome inspirational family movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not realistic in the least","review":"If the producers knew anything about Deaf Culure they would have picked an actual deaf actress to play the role. It is not only offensive but is not even remotely realistic in showing what deafness and deaf culture is like. It only shows a helpless deaf girl who magically hears after getting a cochlear implant. Come on. It takes 3 months to heal after the surgery and even get the thing turned on and then years of speech therapy etc for it to be successful, IF its even successful. The actor was cute, I'll give them that much but isn't it time to let the Deaf act for themselves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tear jerker","review":"This was a great story from start to finish as other reviewers have stated. Danny is a waiter at a local restaurant when Ariana and her controlling mother and her companion stop in for lunch. Ariana's mother is controlling of her because Ariana is deaf and feels she needs to make all of her daughter's decisions for her even though she is 21! It is love at first sight for Danny, although Ariana's mother doesn't think Danny is good enough for Ariana and does whatever she can to keep them apart. Kent Moran also performs his own music in this movie which is great! There are a couple more twists to this movie that I don't want to give away. Great tear jerker romance worth having in your movie collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"No cliche unturned","review":"The cliche's:1. The supportive wise black friend,2.

I'm one of the most generous star-givers out there, and I could not find anything good about this movie. I chose it based on reviews, but I just can't believe that anyone, let alone a majority, could give this 5 stars. Beware of this one unless you like sappy, poorly acted, unrealistic films, with really bad music. I hung in there until the end waiting for it to get better, but it just kept nose-diving deeper and deeper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing movie...keeps your interest!","review":"Love this movie!1.) Emotion...The movie has some characters you will love and cheer for, and some you will hate.2.) Twists....The movie has a couple of turns that are unpredictable for sure. Without giving them away, this isn't a movie that just starts, tells one plain story, and ends.3.)

Although not his best work (a title I'd rather reserve for his \\"Satura\\"), the poems of this period are essential to becoming familiar with Montale's technique, which reaches its highest point in the profound \\"Picollo testamento (Little Testament).\\" The layout of this edition leaves a lot to be desired, but still provides the best introduction to this Nobel laureate's early poetry."},{"rating":"2","title":"A real swashbuckler...","review":"...that buckles every swash imaginable. War, treachery, disguise, secret passages, shipwrecks, damsels in distress -- an amazing amount gets packed into this not-very-long book.

It was hard to understand the language used. After a couple of chapters, I was able to get the gist of most of it. There are still some terms that I needed a dictionary for, but they were about clothing so I just skipped over them. The story was very interesting and I would recommend it if you like a challenge and don't mind struggling through a couple of chapters to get to the \\"good\\" part."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Solid Adventure Novel","review":"The Black Arrow was an enjoyable, fast-paced adventure novel. The protagonist was flawed in a way that made him believable and likable. Best of all, his flaws serve the reader as subtle cautionary tales against haste and violence while still providing a very entertaining read.Written for adolescents, I expect that the novel's period-style language would be somewhat difficult for younger readers today although I do think that the lessons are valuable enough that young people should be encouraged to at least attempt what is otherwise a not very challenging read. The ending, the change in the protagonist's goals and his realizations about his own actions were very satisfying.Additionally, I found the free Kindle edition to be adequate and free from distracting format errors or other issues."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Journey of a real Singer-Songwriter","review":"\\"The Big Night,\\" is a breakthrough album for David Zollo. After a Tenure in Iowa's \\"High and Lonesome,\\" and a collection of solo albums each building upon the last, this album presents itself as the matured Zollo in good form.

Check it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can it get better?","review":"Dave has outdone himself with this album. This is his third \\"solo\\" album on the independant label he runs in Iowa City called Trailer Records. Dave can sound like rock n roll, folk, Alt-Country, and bluesy among other unknown or unnamed styles.

The back cover covers most of the flat section, but doesn't extend to the curved section. Mine is going inside of a Speck Products iPod Video ToughSkin, so no worries there.On a side note, beware of the \\"More Buying Choices\\" sellers who are offering the \\"same\\" product at $0.01. I purchased one of these first and got a similar, but much inferior product. It had the same dimensions as the Powersupport product, but it was a sticker and was very hard to apply.

When bands start doing covers of Deringer's rock N roll hoochie coo it's either a lack of new materiel or a shift in direction. Me thinks this is Blaine's Dixie fried influences coming through! Thought the pussy intro was a bit juvenile too. All that being said, most of the album still kicks butt! Like all previous comments, they were a blast to see live - - my ears whined for days thanks to a front row pearch in front of rock goddess Ruyter and her Marshall stack.

The musicianship is superb, the songs are great (including a wickedly dangerous version of the surf classic PIPELINE)and the whole cd just flat out rocks beginning to end!

The main draw for me to purchase a re-release of something I already own is enhanced sonic quality of the music or compelling alternative takes (not some silly video I'll only which once), and the US release misses the mark. I purchased the UK version (from Amazon UK) and I am very happy with it, and it is not much more expensive.

I was so used to listen to this record with the originally hoarse sound. Like if you put your speakers facing to the floor. But now it's so clean so when you listen to it new sounds come up like if they never have been there before.Such a nice experience. Sit in middle of those 5 speakers and you won't regret it.There is only one thing I would have change.

Masses marks the moment Depeche Mode really find their second incarnation, consolidating the successes of Black Celebration, moving from industrial clang to sultry slink. Thank god for the Emulator and digital synths, because the boys put them to very good effect here. And David Bascombe's production rounds out a great collection of thematically connected songs. (They're all about the sex drive and its dull motivations, boys and girls). The only thing more impressive would be what follows: an astonishingly perfect synthpop album...or is it rock album?...called Violator."},{"rating":"2","title":"European Flavor with Plenty of Melodrama","review":"A good record for it's time, I must admit it has lost some of it's polish over the years.

If you have an SACD set-up, the audio quality of the import versions is noticeably better (especially on \\"Speak & Spell\\"). Plus the DVD is region free, so the import video will still play in your PC or Mac (although it will not play on your TV, unless you have a DVD player that can convert PAL to NTSC). I highly recommend sending Rhino a message that selling watered-down versions in the U.S. is unacceptable, by purchasing the Mute label import version instead (all three of which are outstanding)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Experts in Reiki documentation","review":"As with other Books by the Bronwen and Franse Stiene this is an excellent read on energy and Reiki.

The previous volumes had shown the motive behind UNESCO's project was not so much to make a history of africa as to make a history africans should be proud of. That is one hard task to accomplish once you try and tackle with the post-colonial history of the continent. One can understand the focus on the struggle for independence, even though some of the chapters read tiring. It is the chapters on independent africa that simply are not honest history-making: terror, censorship and corruption in the new-born african nations does not figure in this book, the mad reveries of african socialism and personality-cult are politely brushed aside. This is not the history of africa as one can tell it today, it is an elaboration on the politically correct which does africans no favor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I've had this amp for a few years and have been satisfied for most of the time, but it just quit working so ... now not so happy.I'm actually on my second one because the first one I received only worked for a week before failing.

We opened the shipping box, which was 5 times the size needed, removed the amp and hooked it up. We couldn't get it to do anything advertised! Nothing hooked up to it produced any sound. Only the green \\"ON\\" light and the red speaker lights worked. I called the 800 number for tech support at the mfgr. of this AudiolessSource Amp 100, and, after the normal recorded voice menu, when transferred, the phone just rang and rang. No support or customer service!! It went back today!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Auto-off is bad","review":"In general, I like the product specs, but getting it home and using it is a different story. The auto-off feature makes it useless.I used it as a second amplifier for streaming music. The sound quality is nice, but it clicks off when the volume drops low. This means you often miss the beginning and ends of songs (most songs have points of low volume) and in some cases, bits of the middle. I was so embarrassed when I had people over and the music kept switching off and on, making loud clicks in the process.This first issue is a show stopper for me and caused me to buy a different receiver (Teac AG-790A). However it also has a second flaw: no bass or treble controls. This makes it tough when you are playing from a single source to two different sets of speakers. There's no way to separately change the tone for speakers connected to this receiver.Overall, its inexpensive, but not worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amp turns on after music....","review":"I purchased this amp based on the great customer reviews. It is the most frustrating piece of musical equipment I have ever worked with. I do alot of recording and it's impossible due to the fact that the amp does not turn on until there is a signal sent to it, therefore you never hear the first few beats of a song when you press play. It sucks. What a waste of $100. I guess I should have splurged on a higher quality amp."},{"rating":"1","title":"amp","review":"Dont buy this if you want good sound and power! worthless to me for my use!

The problem is with the auto input line sensing circuitry. Even with the auto-sensing switch in manual, the auto-sensing circuitry engages and disengages after every dynamic passage on a center channel home theater setup. When it engages and disengages the sound coming from the speaker connected to the amp also engages and disengages. I just ordered the Niles Audio SI-2125 to replace this piece of junk.

It's simple, direct, and does the job. My only complaint is the speaker selection buttons on the front. They're really sticky. They seem to be set up so that when one set of remote speakers is turned on, the other automatically turns off (i.e., when you push the A button, the B button automatically pops back out turning the B speakers off, and vice versa). Nice, but what if you want both sets of remote speakers on at the same time? Well, both remote speakers can be on at the same time when both buttons are pushed in simultaneously, but then you have to jiggle them all over the place to get the buttons to pop back out and turn the speakers off again. Probably a picky point, but it's annoying. If not for this, I'd give it 5 stars instead of 4."},{"rating":"2","title":"simple and inexpensive","review":"looking for a simple aux amp?

I also use it alone with the Focals when recording albums and cassettes to CD, when I do not need to use my McIntosh amp and Phase Technology 10.5 Phase Coherent speakers.

The real concern is that this is configured as an 'auto-on' device, so it switches itself on when it receives an audio signal on the line-in: this means it is often going to be put somewhere out of the way and unnoticed - and that makes it a REAL fire hazard (as in 'burning the house down' hazard).So if i could give is a zero or negative star it would be duly awarded.

It's awful, but if you row, it's awfully funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"Gabrielle Anwar's uneven (and thus fake sounding) English accent fades in and out during this inane movie with a flimsy premise - four rowing buddies decide to share responsibility for the child carried by a woman they all lust for but promised never to pursue (and some don't remember sleeping with). This cheesy movie appears to be a really bad made-for-cable TV movie that miraculously has everyone getting their happy little ending.More miraculous is that it was made in the first place or that any of the actors are entertaining additional acting offers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Way to Pass an Afternoon","review":"I thought this movie was super cute.

I'm now in book 4....looking forward to reading more of Lynn Austin"},{"rating":"2","title":"You won't be disappointed","review":"Typically while reading Chronicles in the bible, one tends to be overwhelmed and therefore come out of it with a less than exciting experience.Lynn Austin puts you right smack into the scenes. You are not reading about the past, you are living it, feeling it, practically smelling it (smoke, incense, etc.); it is that real.Many times, I put the book down and picked up the bible for verification of characters, lineage, etc....it was all there.Get to know your biblical kings in all their glory (or lack thereof). Love them or hate them, you will love the book. I ordered the second one the minute I finished the first.You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great story, excellent writing, poorly edited.","review":"Like so many other people who have read Lynn Austin's Gods and Kings, I appreciated her fine writing skills and excellent story telling ability. However, her editors must have struggled with the manuscript translation to ebook style. There were so many lines that did not separate into paragraphs, punctuation problems, words not separated or separated words when not needed, and words run together, that at times it was difficult to read. I can't believe that Bethany House would release a script with this many errors in it. An author of this caliber deserves a better production than this gobblygook."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Series!","review":"A series of books that I pass on to others because there are so good. Thank you so much Lynn for writing this book series, it is one of my favorites. It taught me so much in history and of God's Word. I likely would read them again. Our entire family of 5 has enjoyed them and my 16 year old son has it down as his favorite book series. I highly recommend these books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent novel that is Biblically accurate","review":"God and Kings was a book I simply could not put down.

I would highly reccomend this read to anyone who longs for a taste of Old Testament history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful","review":"Austin brings to life a part of the gospel many wish to skip over. The horror of idolatry is described in ways many refuse to visualize because of the horror that is involved. This is a wonderful portrayal of this dark time in Israel's history and the beginning of the glorious rising out of the darkness of sin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent! Couldn't put it down..","review":"I'm an avid fan of biblical historical fiction...I love the way she brings this story to life and keeps you in suspense. Details are clear and accurate....beyond that, you're drawn immediately into the story, the character's thoughts/emotions/motivations/lives, and hoping they choose to follow God. My biggest acclaim for a book in this genre is having read it that i find myself loving my God even more, seeking harder after Him, understanding just a little more, and wanting more of Him! My faith is encouraged! Definitely recommend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating","review":"I truly enjoyed this book, it gives a humanity to the people I have read of in scripture and has a wonderful flow.

Amazing Bible based fiction. I was so encouraged when I saw the characters \\"come to life\\" with Ms. Autens' literary skills. Recommend all five as a very good read and study."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very inciteful","review":"I had rather low expectations since this was a free kindle book, but I gave it a try. I found myself captivated and enriched. Hezekiah is one of my favorite characters because he represented a person devoted to God in the midst of a people far from God. This book gave me much greater insight into what he faced and how the nation of Judah was politically, socially, and religiously during that time. It was a great read and I highly recommend it whether you are a student of OT history or not. It was hard at times to keep in mind that this was a novel. The historical setting is vivid and I believe it to be based on solid historical research. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Get ready for a great series","review":"A great book by Lynn Austin-it made the scriptures come alive.

I first checked it out from the Library and now have bought the first book twice to give to others. It is as close to historically and Biblically correct as any books that are based on Biblical characters. These are not romances, though they have love and relationships in them. The books are informative and entertaining, and just the right length. Austin is a gifted writer!I was sent to my Bible time after time to check and make sure that what was written was Biblically accurate, and it was! I learned so much about myself through this series!

The characters are so well developed. Methodical research has gone into this series, as it brings Scripture and this part of Biblical history to life.

This was one you did not want to put down and felt as if you were there in the scene, as you were drawn into the story.

A true test of any good book is if you want to read the next in the series and I'm there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspired my Bible reading","review":"I really enjoyed this book. After getting it for free on Amazon, I had to give it a chance. It so happened that I was reading through the Bible at the EXACT location that this book takes place around.

I would give a 5 star, but the writing was a bit elementary. It was a great read, though, and kept me interested for sure!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite books","review":"I love historical fiction and was unsure of how I'd like this book when it was recommended to me. I wasn't too familiar with the Old Testament story that this book is about, but this novel really made it come to live. I love Lynn Austin's writing style and have since read many more of her books. This book, though, is the cream of the crop. I loved the characters, the setting, and how the plots interwove together. I've read this a few times since I first read it and it's always as good as the first time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down","review":"This was a great book that brings the Bible and it's characters to life.

When I arrived at the store, I realized the \\"The Collection\\", one in a series of such collections by Columbia/Epic artists, was simply a re-packaging of this original box set, expanded versions of his first three albums, rather than a budget-priced \\"best-of\\" box that I expected. Well, I bought it anyway, and I'm glad I did. This is indeed the best way to introduce yourself to SRV's early releases, and the price is right. (Some fans may argue his first three releases contain most of his best work anyway.) The bonus tracks may seem repetitive as listed, but they are in fact very tasty alternate takes of the final versions.

It is accepted that Beaton's mysteries are somewhat short on \\"mystery\\" leaving her hopefully endearing characters to carry the interest in the narratives. As a result, it is harder to accept that after eleven installments, Agatha has not grown as a character nor as an amateur sleuth. In this latest novel, \\"Agatha Raisin and the Love from Hell,\\" Agatha has been stripped of whatever comedic touches she initially possessed. In the place of a gentle wryness about herself has mushroomed a seething hair-trigger temper that leads her to awkward outbursts, making her a very unsympathetic heroine. Perhaps the story is meant to illustrate that pursuit of an ill-fated love affair can distort or poison one's nature. I hope in the next installment that Agatha might revert to her former eccentric, more lovable, self. I hope so -- and in a mystery worthy of her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Always a good read","review":"I have been addicted to this series ever since The Quiche of Death.

Maybe the author is burned out and no longer has the energy to set up a scene (description of how the character got to that scene, what was the weather like, the set up that makes the reader feel he's right there with that character). This lack of atmosphere/setting seems to be very similar to Lilian Jackson Braun's latest books. I can deal with sloppy proofreading (not too happily) but I'd sure like to have some help in mentally picturing the characters moving about instead of reading mostly dialogue. I agree with many of the other reviews in that it's also a shame that Agatha has not developed one bit and that a lot of the humor has been replaced with nastiness. My suggestion to anyone who has not read an M.C. Beaton book (either the Hamish or Agatha series) is to start at the beginning and enjoy her earlier works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Agatha, poor reader....","review":"I've read every book in the series as well as the H.

Ideally, the books should be read in sequence, starting with the first and my favorite, Agatha Raisin and the Quiche of Death. These books are light reading and a pleasant way to spend an afternoon or evening. At the title implies, Agatha and her new husband, James, discover that their marriage was a mistake. James then disappears after being attacked and is also suspected of murdering his rumored mistress, Melissa. Agatha, ever the amateur sleuth, is anxious to solve the crime and also clear her husband's name. She sets off with her old friend, Sir Charles, to do both. In addition to amateur sleuthing in the quaint villages around the Cotswolds, Agatha is grappling with getting older and feels \\"the autumn of her life stretching in front of her.\\" We will have to wait for book #12 to find out how Agatha is coping with being single again."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Onion Ambassador","review":"Wonderfully written and illustrated book. I work directly with Georgia Vidalia Onion Producers, and they are all just as charming as the characters in the book. The Vidalia onion is just as sweet and mysteriously inviting as it is portrayed in this poetic book. The book is completely accurate...If this onion is grown anywhere except a few select counties in South Georgia, it is no different than any other onion which makes it a modern day miracle and mystery.

Donizetti's music, as always is so melodic you can close your eyes, sit back and soar! The audience was enthusiastic in their applause, prolonged ovations; Leonora was visibly moved to tears after the ovation for one of her arias.

What made the first two movies good was the great gore that made them feel more realistic then what was presernted here. Here there is no gore, but very little action scenes with almost no physical violence at all. This was the worst mistake that Orion made, because as a result this movie flopped with just 10 million at the box office after being shelved for two years, and took down the entire studio with it. Peter Weller should've been in this movie, because it would've been alot better movie.

No Peter Weller? Damn, well hope I live through this... I barely came out alive of my room that night...This is perhaps one of (maybe the worst) \\"3rd movie in a series of good movies\\"-films I have ever encountered... The Plot is bad,probably written by a five-year old child, the actors disgusts me, reminds me of bad soap-opera acting, and the whole thing smells like a movie for children...

It has ruined mine..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hopeless","review":"Trust me, this film is not worth your time.In the first Robocop the violence was extreme and had a wickedly dark twist to it. Even in the second film there was at least some excellent action sequences. The third film, however, is just Hollywood cashing in on a successful series!The plot is both simple and see through and the characters lack any real depth.

Why Anne? She was kinda pretty! Any ways.... so the Robocop name was kinda wasted on this one. Although the robot ninjas were kinda nifty and it was a nice little addition to bring back ED209.

This title was a little to kiddy for my taste and you can kinda tell from the sudden drop from the usual \\"R\\" rating in a Robocop movie to the sudden \\"pg13\\".

It should have been kept a mature film."},{"rating":"1","title":"After this one, no reason for a Robo 4","review":"RoboCop 3 was a show I strongly anticipated. I expected a continuation of Robo 2: The evil mistress in prison possibly teaming up with a revived Clarence Boddicker from Robo 1. They somehow get out and terrorize Detroit. Who knows? Could be far fetched but I thought the ending of 2 was a good setup for 3. Instead, we've got a boring bad guy with an English accent and a show with nothing I could find to get interested in.

The...er, plot, involves an evil Japanese organization who are determined to take over the city with the help of some decidedly uninspiring robot ninjas.Souless, tame, humdrum waste of time and money which seemingly relies on constant flashbacks to the first (and far superior) Robocop film. If you haven't seen any Robocop movies then see the first one instead of this. If, on the other hand, you've seen the first Robocop film, then be content with that. You won't find anything worthwhile in this trash."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a bad movie!","review":"I'm not a fan of Robocop and the movies with him, especially the ones from 2001, but this movie has totally changed my mind about him .

Evil, satantic Japanese baddies seek to take over Robocop's home city with the help of some rather melodramatic and frankly tedious robotic ninjas.The first Robocop was an excellent and moving film. By now the series has lost all its magic and vitality and is no more than people fighting. Somebody seems to have had the idea of making this one for younger viewers, so it's all very tame compared to its predecessors and relies heavily on flashbacks to the first (and superior) film.Uninspiring, dull and overblown. Don't bother with this film. You'll only encourage them to make a Part 4 and drag the character of Robocop down to even greater depths."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Robocop Yet?","review":"This movie was a colossal failure. The storyline and plot were good but Burke sucked as Robocop and there are to many unanswered questions from Robo 2 that weren't answered in Robo 3...#1:What happended to the Old Man from Robocop 1&2? Did he die? How did Rip Torn become the Leader of OCP?#2:What happended to Dr. Faxx? Did she just disappear?#3:What happended to the mayor and how did OCP get control of the city?#4:Where is Peter Weller?Do you see what I mean? The only positive things about this movie are the storyline, the introduction of the Rehab team and Basil Poulodoris's theme. John Castle was good as Paul McDaggett but other than him and Nancy Allen (Lewis) no one else really lit up the screen. It is also a shame that Lewis was killed by McDaggett.

In PG-13, no less! Boy, where to start. Well after 5 or 6 years, the evil OCP is still trying to tame Detroit and build a bigger badder cop. Now the Japanese have taken over OCP and have a Robo of their own and they are twin/triplets? For the most part this 3rd feature is just as bad as the 2nd one, but at least we see some of the townsfolk putting up some resistance. I'm also giving a little credit for some then new acting faces that are more recognized today. Although Peter Weller wisely didn't come back in the role of Murphy watch for Rip Torn, CCH Pounder, Mako, Stephen Root, Bradley Whitford and Jill Hennessy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Robocop 3(1993)","review":"Robocop 3(1993) was the last nail in the coffin for the Robocop film franchise. B movie director Fred Dekker tones down the violence and adds a lot of campy humor into the film so it can get a PG-13 rating. Peter Weller bailed from the series and Robert John Burke was cast as Robocop! Officer Lewis(Nancy Allen) is tragically killed off by an evil OCP officer! Robocop takes sides with people who are being kicked out of their homes by OCP so they can build Delta City over Old Detroit. The film is even more camped up by throwing a robo-ninja into the movie! Basil Poledouris returned to give us a real Robocop music score. Robocop 3 is a mish-mash of serious drama and campy comedy. Robocop \\"borrows\\" a pimp's car to chase bad guys! Even with the best of intentions, Robocop 3 was still a failure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why they did this","review":"Robocop 3 has to be the worst possible movie in the series.

Be aware that since this is a dual band radio you need to be careful what channel you transmit on if you don't have a license from the FCC. The manual tells which channels are FRS and which are GMRS.These radios are small and easy to carry. They work well for kids to use in a limited area.The range is closer to a half mile than the 6 miles they state. That's normal for FRS radios from what I hear. Near the end of the range the sound cuts in and out, and is hard to understand.One problem: on one of the radios the push to talk button is sensitive, it just barely works and you have to hold it just right or it cuts in and out.One irritation: you can't turn off the roger beep that gets sent after you talk, and it's really loud!

It contain only very basic information, author thinks he's some kind of a all-knowing investigator, yet his orb photo is a mistake, literally, it's just a reflection.This books is more for self-promotion of author, than for providing information to people interested in becoming paranormal investigators, sorry.

There is helpful information on forming an investigative group and lists equipment that someone might wish to purchase. Richard Southall does a good job of describing how to use each piece of equipment to gather evidence. He does also express his theories on the paranormal, and it is interesting to listen to his point of view. I think this is a good start, but seasoned investigators are not likely to learn anything new."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"I have to say this is a very interesting and informative book for beginners......can't wait to get started.

Years ago, I had a similar chain that did that, but I only paid about $6.00 or $7.00 for it. It was sterling silver, too. And, the whole necklace is so little and scarce. The way that it was made to look in the adverisement made me feel like I was really getting a good deal. Instead, I feel like I got taken. I thought that the chain would at least be thicker and stronger--I mean, for $30.00.

Although they had seven languages between them, the only language they had in common at that time was music, since Joso didn't know English. These songs were all recorded in the mid 60's before they dissolved their musical partnership in 1967.This album is full of beautiful folk songs from the world over. It is also an album that has to be heard and deserves to be heard. Their voices are beautiful as are the songs. Please buy this album, you will not be disappointed.

The print type and size is not condusive for student literacy. The print is very difficult to read and it appears to be in about 8-9 pitch throughout the book.

Not very big, but lovely photos and details with good ideas. The recipient was very pleased with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"Oh dear, this was such a disappointment. Diana Ackerman spends too much time in pointless shots (looking a river; admiring her own photos from childhood) and has produced a NOVA series that seriously misses the mark. Too little science, too much irrelevant material. While one can certainly connect art and human experience with scientific knowledge about how the brain works, this series didn't do so successfully. If you were hoping to reveal the wonder of the senses for your students, do not buy this series. Unfortunately, I ordered it through an affiliated store with Amazon and they won't answer my queries about whether/how I can return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very informative","review":"This series was a disappointment. The narrator, Diane Ackerman, apparently an author in her own right, gives a disjointed, rambling discussion of the five senses, with bits of science (interviews with actual research scientists, which Ackerman is not) joined to rather arbitrary examples of how the senses are involved in various cultural activities. Ackerman's examples are often a bit of a stretch, and her monologues are full of distractingly florid language. Kind of a New Age/postmodern pseudo-anthropological view of what science knows so far about the senses. I believe that Ackerman was trying to convey sensuality in her delivery, but I found myself increasingly annoyed by her throaty-yet-girlish voice, heavy make-up, and grating self-involvement. There was too much of her and not enough science. There are far better Nova series out there, and I'm sure that there are better programs about the five senses. I don't recommend this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"A sense-ational documentary!","review":"For anyone who has ever wondered how the five human senses works, this is the tape to purchase! This film of the flagship series NOVA introduces a wealth of knowledge on seeing, hearing, feeling, taste, and smell. Anyone who has seen anything educational program from the NOVA series, now on PBS across the nation, knows the quality of their documentaries. This tape is no exception. This film is highly recommended to anyone who is interested in exploring these five basic functions of the body, taken for granted everyday. A real winner, this video will not disappoint!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A interesting blend of biology and sociology","review":"If you are looking for a strictly scientific documentary, you may want to look elsewhere. That said, I watched these films in conjunction with a biology class and found them to be useful tools that enriched what I was studying in the dry biology books.

This book explains more about different genres and how you can apply them to your artwork and what you can do to emphasise the manga style, and a lot of useful tips for character design.The photoshop tutorials are very comprehensive! They really helped me to improve how I was making my photoshop coloured pictures so I have a lot more control over how they look now.I also like the section the book on making comic pages and applying screentone! You can get some pretty impressive manga style looks by following the steps in the book.My only criticism of this book is that some of the introduction was stuff I already knew, but only about 15 pages or so and the artwork was good in those bits anyway.Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for experienced users","review":"I purchased this book with the idea that it might teach me something new, but I was mistaken. If you already have basic Photoshop knowledge, this may not be the book for you. I returned it because my money would be better invested elsewhere. If you have no idea where to begin with digital artwork, then I would recommend taking a look here. This is for the novice, not the intermediate or advanced user."},{"rating":"2","title":"No words to describe it.","review":"Post is simply Bjork's masterpiece. Both Rolling Stone and Spin magazines have acknowledged Post as one of the most influential and important albums of the 90's. (not sure which issues, but i know i read them). And besides the fact that it won an MTV Europe Music Award, and was nominated for a Grammy, just listen to the songs and you'll realize how ingenious Bjork really is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bjork rules!","review":"Bjork might be somewhat of an acquired taste, but even if you don't like her you have to admit that she is completely original and unlike any other artist out there. Bjork is always ahead of her time! Not all the songs on Post blew my mind but the ones that did (HyperBallad especially) make this album one of my favorites. Become a Bjork fan, you can always wow non-Bjorkers with her wonderful voice and melodic weirdness :) (Plus, Bjork is so adorable! I love seeing her in interviews just to hear her talk! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"An awesome cd","review":"This cd is an eclectic mix of all different types of songs.

Articulate words from an original voice make this the first of one of the best hi energy CD's I've ever heard. You don't want to mix the remixes either."},{"rating":"1","title":"I weep.","review":"This collection of tunes is an experiment with rock. I'm loving Björk's vocals, all though over-produced to an inch of her life. This LP is too eclectic to be eclectic. Post seems an effort to please mainstream goons. The LP feels forced."},{"rating":"1","title":"This sure ain't the Sugarcubes!","review":"I bought this CD simply because I spent my teenage years listening to the Sugarcubes, and I LOVED THE SUGARCUBES. I'm quite disappointed though cause this just doesn't sound like them. I mean sure the songs have Bjork's trademark singing voice, but the style of the music is rather boring. The only song I like on here is \\"Army of Me\\". The rest is just filler to me. Sorry Bjork if I'm not digging your solo career."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninteresting and over-hyped","review":"I bought this CD on the basis of the rave reviews here. After the first listening, I was bored and couldn't see what the fuss was about. After listening another 3 times, I found the album even less interesting. What I was expecting was the excitement and artistry of, say, the early Streissand albums. Bjork turned out to be a disappointment. Her vocal technique is so-so, and her lyrics are largely insipid. Obviously, many people like her work, but for me(a member of the minority) her music just doesn't do very much. Maybe after listening a few more times, I will finally see the light. But then again, there seem to be a lot of used copies of this album for sale, so maybe listeners are giving up and trying to recoup their lost money."},{"rating":"2","title":"GENIUS","review":"I am so sorry that I didn't buy this album a long time agao.

But honestly, this is really a relevant CD for anyone interested in decent mainstream pop music. Bjork can turn her limits (naive vocal technique, an icelandic accent you could cut with a knife) into peculiar qualities. She is unique in her ability to couple unusual harmonic passages with quirk turns of phrase and superb arrangements. This album defies classification -- there's big-band jazz, trip-hop, electronic dance, \\"sugarcubes\\", trance, soundtrack-like strings, even traces of Abba's notorius pop. This is an album that has not created a genre like \\"Dummy\\" by Portishead, but is vastly superior to it and many other for its musicality, originality, literary quality and sense of humor. \\"Homogenic\\" is equally good, but much more tense and influenced by the Bristol scene."},{"rating":"2","title":"i love her....","review":"The whole album is amazing and hyper ballad has got to be one of the most beautiful songs ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the greatest albums ever made!","review":"I was reading the latest issue of Rolling Stone where they were rating the 150 greatest albums ever produced, and I was ecstatic to see that Post was nominated.

Her celestial voice sends shivers up your spine. Her tonal quality and dynamics are extremely unique. And her lyrics, oh her lyrics. They paint images like a master surrealist. Lyrics like, \\"I walk towards the edge and throw little things off like car-parts, bottles and cutlery, or whatever I find lying around..\\" make music all worth it. Absurd, beautiful and intense. What more could annyone want. Bjork, please marry me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good - but not her best","review":"I have purchased three of other Bjorks releases (Vespertine, Greatest Hits, Medulla) and this is sadly the worst (not to say It's bad, I did give it 4 stars) but this just seems too simplistic for Bjork, although I do like her dance/club songs from her debut.The standouts are Army of Me (4/5), It's Oh So Quiet (4.5/5 - my favourite), Enjoy (4/5), I Miss You (4/5), and Headphones (4/5) and I don't really like tracks 8 and 10.Some sales information for you:: Sold 3 million copies w/w, and peaked at #2 in Australia, #32 in USA and also went platinum there. It's Oh So Quiet was Bjork's greatest hit in Sales and it won numerous awards.79%"},{"rating":"2","title":"Post: quintessencial","review":"Björk's Post is the sizzling second Björk's Elektra-album who really came to prove who she was and her place on the contemporary alternative pop music. This album consists in a non-stop sequence of hitsand pearls and is absolutelly heterogenic and diverse. The first track and single, Army Of Me, is a really strong electronic tune. Hyper-ballad is aclassical Björk song, following her innovative (but today very imitated) mixture of strings and electronic noises and melodies which began with Venus As A Boy, and the song is a real poem where she creates images of suicide thoughts. The Modern Thingsis another impressive electronic track, and It's Oh So Quiet her most successful single ever, a cover of a jazz classic where she really reinvinted the song and gave it a totally new and unexpected interpretation. Other pearls are Cover Me, Possibly Maybe, Headphones, Isobel, You've Been Flirting Again, evry one a totally different, lyric and strangely melodic track.Post is a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it or hate it...","review":"Everyone I encounter who knows who Bjork is either loves or hates her work...doesn't seem to be any middle ground. If you like only traditional pop, country or other genres and want all the songs on your albums to sound the same, stay away from Bjork.If, on the other hand, you get tired of songs that all sound the same and are looking for something fresh, you'll love Bjork. It seems she is trying something specifically unique on each track.I find 'Post' slightly more innovative and interesting than 'Debut', although both CDs are great. Of this bunch, my favs are, in order: Possibly Maybe, Isobel, Army of Me, Cover Me, Hyper Ballad and Enjoy, so the Amazon provided clips cover only half the good ones! The only track I didn't care for is It's Oh So Quiet.Get it and listen to someone who isn't afraid to experiment!"},{"rating":"2","title":"At the limit of human achievement.","review":"I saw Bjork in the swimming pool in Laugardalur, Reykjavik this summer. She was oh so friendly to her fellow swimmers and sunbathers. Her charm, hyper-normalcy and magnetic personality all shine through in her music. Post is a rare treat for the soul. In a way her melodic innovation here is as starlingly beautiful as that of the beloved Beatles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wicked sense of humour!","review":"Bjork's vibrant music may be a bit of a shock for first-time listeners. Hang in there. You can't help but be carried away by her raw, fresh vocals and strident rhythms! I would recommend this CD (and all her music) to anyone. Whether she's hypnotizing us with whispers or gracing us with her mighty bellow, Bjork's music is unabashedly a good time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great cd by Bjork","review":"I love this album so much. the reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because while I totally absolutely love some of the songs on it there are some which leave me a bit dissapointed. For example \\"You've been Flirting Again\\" and \\"Headphones\\" etc but I LOVE \\"Army of Me\\", \\"Hyper-ballad\\", \\"Enjoy\\", \\"It's Oh So Quiet\\", \\"I Miss You\\" , \\"Isobel\\" and others. I definately recommend it if you're tired of the mainstream stuff they play on the radio and are looking for something different. Bjork's voice is just amazing. I don't know too many people who can sound that good when they wail =)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoy","review":"I've been a fan of Bjork's since this album. Enjoy is my favorite song of her's to date. DJ Burning loves to throw that one in the mix. I like almost everything she's put out over the years except It's oh so quiet. I know it was a single and a lot of people will disagree with me but it just wasn't my thing. I'm anxious for the new album. I can't believe it's 5 years old now."},{"rating":"2","title":"variery is the spice of Bjork","review":"My love for Bjork's voice began when I was in fifth grade and heard \\"It's Oh So Quiet\\" for the first time at a dance rehearsal. I rediscovered her two years later when I began my collection of Bjork CD's which is now at 15. \\"Post\\", my favorite, is a breath of fresh air from the uncreative, trendy, shallow, too feel-good, or too angsty sounds you hear on the radio nowadays. Each song has a different tone, emotion, and musical arrangement from the techno beat of \\"Hyperballad\\" to the stark sounds and keyboards of \\"Possibly Maybe\\" to the drum beat and screams in \\"I Miss You.\\" Bjork's tireless voice is beautiful and full of energy- it growls, screams, slides, whispers. Her music cannot not be categorized- each song is a different style and attitude. I highly recommend her to anyone looking for a change from the ordinary. I guarantee you will become addicted- I am."},{"rating":"1","title":"Honestly, a joke!","review":"I am not one to be pessimistic or have a bad attitude in any way, but honestly.. I have to say that the first words that come to mind are that this DVD is a joke. With that being said, the one good thing that I can say is that it is at least entertaining and made me laugh. Sadly enough... being from Austin and listening to tons of live music for years, I cannot think honestly of a time when I have seen a worse live music show. Ringo doesn't even play on most of the songs and at least his band covers up, to a degree, his deficits. I will say that it appears that Ringo himself is enjoying it, which I have to give him credit for, but that doesn't mean that others will! When I first saw this DVD, I was really looking forward to actually to see Ringo playing live, not having heard much from him in years. I could go into more critical detail, but would prefer to just think of this DVD as an amusing entertainment experience, but for serious music lovers.. save your money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great concert!","review":"This concert features Ringo playing Beatles classics that he rarely performs live (if ever)... Don't Pass Me By and Octopuses Garden! Ive seen Ringo live several time and these great songs are left out. Considering how great they sound on this concert i hope he considers including them as concert staples. This show lacks the usual greatest hits night of the supporting band (although it has Who Can It Be Now by the Men At Work guy). Wish it included more songs from the band....their contribution is half the show! Instead you get Ringos new material which some songs are surprisingly catchy..others the usual B-side at best type songs. Sound quality and picture on this blu-ray are awesome! Loved it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ringo and band on fire","review":"Having seen Ringo and his All Starr Band play live in Liverpool and Glasgow last June, I pretty much knew what to expect from this Blu-ray. I wasn't disappointed! Ringo plays to a formula that works a treat. He keeps the crowd on their feet pretty much the whole time with so many hits from both Beatle days and his solo career. What a treat to see Don't Pass Me By, complete with piano introduction! The band are tight and the picture and sound quality of the blu-ray are excellent. My only disappointments are that it runs for less than an hour, there are no extras on the disc and information about the gig and musicians is almost non-existent. There is also a mistake in the credits where the band is shown as including \\"Mark Har\\". The keyboard player is former Crowded House member Mark Hart. An unforgivable error. Having said all that, the disc is very entertaining and recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ringo Starr and the Roundheads: Live","review":"I was anxious to view and listen to Ringo and the Roundheads concert.

The plot has elements that are familiar from several of the earlier works and many of the characters borrow from more familiar characters in other plays as well. Nevertheless, Cymbeline is a rewarding play to either view or read. The Arden version that I recently read was useful but for the footnotes which focused on various usages and interpretations of the language over time which I found distracting and finally chose to just ignore. The play itself because of the familiar elements will appeal to those who have read the better known works. Cymbeline revolves around a layered plot that includes the devices of mistaken identity, evil and deception , unbridled ambition and political intrigue. It is a rather long play with 5 acts and 27 scenes. Having the benefit of seeing this well staged would enhance the reader's experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst and least favorite Shakespeare; boring to the nth degree","review":"My least favorite Shakespeare--long, tedious, boring and highly distasteful.

It does and it works and functions great on my 55 inch HDTV. the other cord I bought didn't have the same picture quality.

I like the way they've implemented the station pre-sets. They're accessed via a rotary knob, not a lot of hard to find buttons, and you can mix AM and FM stations among then presets. The clock radio shuts itself off after 10 minutes and can be combined with an alarm. In general, I like the Recepter's controls and user interface. I also own a Kloss Model One, another outstanding piece of equipment, and the Recepter has comparable sound quality, which is saying a lot. The Recepter has the edge in ease of use and the Model One lacks a clock radio. One drawback, the Receptor lacks an audio-in jack, so you can't attach an IPod. The Kloss Model One permits attachment of the IPod. Overall, I highly recommend the Receptor."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT for hard to reach radio signals","review":"I live in Broward County Florida and wasn't able to pull in the West Palm Beach radio station that Howard Stern is on now as I'm outside the stations standard range; not on my regular clock radio or even my stereo.

Either the reviews are terribly biased or my unit was not properly refurbished. The radio is potentially fantastic and worth a rating of 10 or five stars. However, the bass is absolutely unaccptable. Yesterday, I was playing the same station on my stereo and the Boston Acoustics Receptor. The difference was mind boggling. The bass on the Boston Acoustics Receptor drowned out the singer and the band. I was thinking of buying one or two more units until the bass really got on my nerves.

I'm into a lot of ambient/experimental electronica and this band really created something neat here - catchy vocals amidst very experimental glitches and whatnot.My only gripe is that some of the glitch and bleeps are stock sound files from the Reason sound bank. If anyone is familiar with Reason, listen to the drum kit \\"Glitch kit 4\\" and you'll find a lot of the sound effects they used there in the first song. I think I'd like this album a lot more if I didn't know this or if they made their own effects.Still, a great listen.

I should think that a high-school text book would give a more lively presentation of life in the \\"New Jerusalem\\", as Bradford calls it.

I detest pop Christian symbols and the urge to define a Christian by market forces. Schaeffer attempts to challenge the reader into not only glimpsing in the mirror, but to really make changes accordingly."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Schaeffer's finest moments","review":"How can a person prove they are a Christian, that their faith is real? This is Schaeffer's question. He seeks Christ's answer and finds it: \\"They shall know that you are my followers by the love that you have for one another.\\" So the defining characteristic of a believer is that they exhibit love toward other believers. Sounds simple enough but it is, alas, terribly hard to live out in real life. In this brief tome, Schaeffer economically explores the mandatory nature of this quality (\\"As I have loved you, you must love one another\\" is pretty imperative), how its neglect dooms the church to skeptical reception at best, and examines how one can cultivate such love for fellow Christians. A very important read from one of the 20th century's most important Christian minds."},{"rating":"2","title":"With the length of this book, you have no excuse not to read it","review":"This is a very short book.This is a very good book.Schaeffer's insight put a whole new perspective on things that I had never before considered. Namely: the world has the right to judge Christians based on whether or not they love. You will have to read the book to understand everything Schaeffer uses to reach that conclusion, but I doubt you will be able to argue once you do. Schaeffer explains how love is the not just an element which distinguishes Christians from nonChristians. You will be challenged to re-visit your own heart and determine the truth of John's words \\"If a man does not love his brother, the Truth [Christ] is not in him.\\"You can read this book in an hour or two, but its thoughts will travel with you for weeks and its impact for the rest of your life."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Powerful Message That Can Be Understood By All","review":"The Mark of the Christian was written almost 40 years ago and has less than 40 pages. Despite the thinness of his book, Pastor Schaeffer presents a critical message that many people who profess to be Christians need to hear. As stated in John 13:33-35, love must be the distinguishing mark of all Christians. He who fails to love has not been truly changed by the gospel message."},{"rating":"2","title":"Relaxation guidance","review":"3 different relaxation sessions with explanations embedded within, along with hypnotic programing to help release tension, fears and any pre-programmed negatives which might be preventing pregnancy.

The lack of a proper seal between the filter basket lid and the water reservoir is the culprit.The filter basket and water reservoir are also not separate chambers. This causes steam to rise from the filter basket, hit the lid, and condense as water back into the reservoir.

Anyon does not jump to blame the schools, teachers and students like is done so often when schools fail, but rather she portrays how cummulative effects of school and public officials decisions have tied the hands of the public education reformers in those cities.

Contains lots of great tracks including:I Feel Free,NSU,Toad,I'm So Glad,Sweet Wine,Dreaming,Cats Squirrel, and Spoonful!!! Great Guitar(Eric Clapton),Bass(Jack Bruce)and Drums(Ginger Baker)!!! A treat from start to finish!!! Two thumbs up!!! Five stars!!! A+"},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite Cream Album","review":"Many think that this album is inferior compared to other Cream albums. This is my favorite Cream album, Clapton's guitar work is beyond compare. \\"Spoonful\\", \\"I Feel Free\\" and \\"Sweet Wine\\" show Clapton's talent as a top guitarist as well as his talent as a blues musician on blues songs \\"Sleepy Time Time\\", \\"I'm So Glad\\" and \\"Cats Squirrel\\" as well as his lead vocal on \\"Four until Late.\\" Gingers drumming is also at its peak on his showpiece \\"Toad\\" as well as doing more than keeping time on \\"Sweet Wine\\" and others. Jack Bruce's range as a vocalist combined with his talent as a bass and harmonica player are shown on this album more than on any other Cream Album. Though many of the songs aren't original, they sound like no other band when coming from Cream. I would take this album over any other made by Cream, or any other band!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fresh Cream (Cream)","review":"A significant piece of rock history. Raw, hard early British rock for the aficianado. Clapton is as good as expected, but give a listen to Ginger Baker's fine work on drums.

A lot of future stars. Highly recommend!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mel Torme steals the show!","review":"The best thing about this film is Mel Torme singing \\"and All That Jazz\\" with a group of swinging jazz musicians who have the whole club rocking. Mel's smooth-as-honey golden voice bounces through this joyous number with great verve and confidence as the camera pans over to a poster advertising The Supremes at Lincoln Center in 1965.Frank Sinatra, Jr. is cute and innocent sporting a pair of the most luscious juicy lips I've ever seen on a white boy. Are Sinatra and Sammy really playing those trumpets? Of course, Satchmo plays, sings, and acts his way into everybody's heart.It's good to see Cicely Tyson playing a girlie \\"Audrey Hepburn\\" role before she was typecast as Hollywood's \\"strong black woman\\".Unfortunately the story is weak, the lines are trite and the dialog sounds forced and over amplified...because of a cheap sound stage? \\"A Man Called Adam\\" looks and feels like an amateur budget film filled with some of the best talent in show business."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT!","review":"This book helped me a great deal, when I was ready, to deal with my anger problem. Realizing that I had a problem was the first step. The authors take you through steps that really opened my eyes and made me aware of my choices.

Next time I'll read the \\"about the author\\" section, which revealed it's written by a christian counselor....whoops.Just thought I'd give others a heads up on what they're buying, in case you flip through in a hurry like I did, and discover reading bible versus just makes you MORE angry, because that would just be counter-intuitive :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Christian-based philosophy!","review":"If you're not seeking religious advice for your anger management, be warned that this book is by and for Christians, and published by one of the largest Christian publishing houses. You won't find this mentioned on the back cover or the table of contents, but all of the chapters have to do with Christian spirituality. Can come as a surprise if you were just looking for some secular communication tips and self-soothing techniques!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Book is not appropriately labeled","review":"When I purchased this book, I did not read the fine print. There is no labeling whatsoever that this book is fundamentally Christian based. The only indicator is the very fine print on the back cover, which most people would probably not see when purchasing this book. The reasons for anger are in-depth and can easily relate to anyone's life, however, the solutions are not for everyone. If you are not a fundamental Christian, the book can be interpreted as insulting, as not everyone lives their life thinking that everything they do/think/feel/say is based in what the authors may call \\"sin.\\" I wish I would have read reviews myself prior to purchasing this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anger Workbool","review":"A friend suggested this book - I have gained a whole new insight to some of the issues I have been dealing with in my life. This book has helped me put a lot of my life experiences in perspective and has helped me understand myself and others so much better.

Do yourself a favor and get (and read) this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Made Me More Angry","review":"Unfortunately, this book just made me more angry.This book might be okay for a person who subscribes to the religious views of the authors, but since I do not, I was annoyed at having been duped into buying a religious book under the guise of a psychology book, not to mention the bad advice inside it. I tried to get through it anyway, but after two valiant attempts (if I do say so myself) I decided I couldn't do it. I wish I could get my money back but unfortunately I wrote it in (as the book instructs) before I saw the religious stuff. Also, nowhere on the front does it say anything about religion, and only in tiny, tiny text above the barcode does it say it should be categorized as \\"religious\\" and the category \\"psychology\\" is absent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mis-lead","review":"I work for a correctional institution doing therapy and assessment with inmates. My treatment team ordered this book thinking it would have good information to give to the men we work with. We were completely SHOCKED to find out that this book is Christian based! It says NOTHING about being religious based on the front, the back, or in any description. Yet, the book quotes the Bible and expresses explicitly Christian ideas. Because we work in a state facility, we can not use this book. The authors need to state clearly on the front of the book and in the description that the book expresses Christian ideas and is designed for Christian readers. We were very very disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Prompt shipment and book is as ordered. Good customer service, would order from this source again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anger management book with christian agenda","review":"I was excited about reading this book as the text on the back and the information listed on the cover advised I would find answers on dealing with anger and ways to counter anger within yourself. I was dismayed to find that the book uses the bible to help resolve issues without going into greater detail within the book. I can understand how a christian viewpoint can be considered helpful, but was disappointed that the book makes no reference to the christian viewpoint on the back of the book. There is a brief reference in the acknowledgements about christian integrity in printing, but it is hardly sufficient notification prior to purchasing and reading the book. Unless you are looking for a book with a christian agenda on dealing with anger I would advise to pass on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be in the religious section, not pyschology","review":"The cover and description of the book do not express that Les Carter and Frank Minirth are really only interested in appealing to Christians or people who want to convert to Christianity. I look to books like this for scientific reasoning, but was greatly put off when it started quoting Jesus on page 11 (after prompting the reader to complete workbook questions on previous pages therefore making the book unreturnable.) Anyway, I think it's a shame the authors do not put \\"For Christians Only\\" on the cover so at least their book would only end up in the hands they intended."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what I expected","review":"I bought the book to help me understand someone who I feel has anger problems. After about two chapters, I determined it would not help me but decided to keep reading, hoping it would get better. For me, the book posed many causes of anger, but never did propose specific solutions. A lot of theories with no substance. I quit at page 178. I was able to tolerate the abundance of religious context, but when Dr. Carter put forth the proposition that criminal behavior is the result of environment rather than free choice, I closed the book forever."},{"rating":"1","title":"a refund please","review":"If you want a book that's based on religion, not psychology and practical ways to deal with your anger (as I was expecting), then this book may be for you. If, like me, you want a book that deals with anger from a psychological/behavioural stand point, then look elsewhere, as (like me), you may be angered by all the biblical /God/Lord references in this book and find it better suited to kindling or the recycle bin....time for me to go find a 'real' book on this topic now...."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Anger Wrokbook","review":"The book is full of religious references, and not especially helpful overall.

Boy was I wrong! It seems like there's not one page without NUMEROUS references to bible passages! I couldn't even make sense of what the authors were trying to say when connnecting their points to stories in the bible. This book is useless for my work and now I can't even return it! It should have been made VERY clear on the description of this book that it is WRITTEN FROM A CHRISTIAN PERSPECTIVE! All the Minirth-Meier Clinic series books should have that label/caution on them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deceptive","review":"This book professes to be for all people, but is in fact, just for the devoutly religious. I could not finish it because it was so faith based, it made me sick to my stomach. Maybe some people can just give over control of their lives to God, but I cannot. I don't think that the reason for anger is our sins, as the previous reviewer has written, but I do think this book is deceptive. Nowhere on the cover does it mention that this book will try to get you to give your anger over to God and let him take care of you, but that is exactly what this book tells you. It is a total waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deceptive","review":"Deceptive, this is a book with a strong religious content. It assumes the reader has a strong reliance in God to solve his/her anger issues."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasted Money......","review":"Wow, I know that I can be a fool, but I was definately robbed of $16.00, even after reading the front and back of this very deceiving book! I mean, I know that I need help with anger, but this book just seemed to make me ANGRIER! I spent $16.00 on a wanna-be Bible (Something I could have gotten for free at my FORMER Church) and the contents only seemed to anger me more! Not only did half of their text not make sense, their descriptions of anger and recognizing anger only seemed to categorize the entirety of this country! The verbage used and perspective in which this ~story~ is told borderlines an autobiography of a man named \\"Tom\\". If you like a good bedtime story, like to waste time and money, and do not need real anger management help, then by all means buy this \\"novel\\".

I, as a Biblical Christian, appreciate the Biblical and godly approach taken to meet the needs of those who struggle with anger and its many forms. I would recommend this book to Christians and to non-Christians who are open to accepting Christ and the Holy Spirit's work in their life, as they seek God's guidance in managing their anger. If a person reading this book is not a Bible-believing Christian or open to that belief, this book is probably not for him/her."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Anger Workbook--- personal review","review":"I purchased this book quite a few years ago. That was the beginning of learning to control my anger. Note I use the word control, not eliminate my anger. I finally learned why I get angry and react the way I do. I learned anger is not a bad thing--it's just the way you express it that can cause you such hardship. I really appreciate the Christian perspective this book offers. It has blessed me to use the information in this book. It has been about 6 years since I read the book and I can honestly tell you the information, counseling, and techniques really have worked. I highly recommend this book for anyone struggling with anger. There is hope to learn about it, understand why you do it, thus having control of it rather than it having control of you."},{"rating":"2","title":"I thought this book was GREAT and HELPFUL!","review":"I am a Christian, and I found this book to be very helpful. It touches some personal areas that I wasn't aware of, and it has helped me enormously. I feel like I have a handle on my anger (with God help of course...)now. I recommend this to any Christian who needs it, and I'm sorry if this book offended those of you who aren't Christians. I think it has great basics covered, so even if you aren't a Christian I think it would help."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anger Management for Christians only","review":"As person who recently realized they have a problem with quiet anger I was heartened to find this book. The Description on the back cover seemed to describe a good methodology to work on anger management and the first chapter was encouraging.However, it quickly became evident that there was a lot of religious content in the book and in some cases it was counterproductive. Not all of us can simply believe that God made this so and we need faith to press on.There is a lot of good material in this book. However, after progressing a third of a way through it I simply couldn't take the religious references and leaps of faith the authors used to dilute what was a promising way of handling anger.An actively practicing Chrisian would probably find this book helpful. Anyone else should keep looking."},{"rating":"1","title":"good idea's but has a religious context","review":"I started reading and unexpectedly came across religious/Christian context.

In addition to the poor quality of materials, as others have stated - it's not designed very well - handle is too short and not angled enough. Its only semi-redeemable quality was having very stiff, scratchy bristles that, for what areas of my back I could reach with it, those areas felt sufficiently scrubbed. But who wants to scrub their backs with a moldy back scrubber, no matter how stiff its bristles are? Yuck!I will return this as \\"defective\\" as it certainly fits that criteria in my mind - anything that can't even hold up through the 30-day return period is pretty pathetic."},{"rating":"2","title":"My husband loves this.","review":"I bought this brush for my husband.

Even at 600 plus pages, this book could have easily gotten bogged along the way on the wealth of detail about this well researched conflict. And this book shows that despite some of Morris' more inflammatory interviews recently, he can still present a work of historical research that is even handed and fair."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very hard to justify not reading thisbook","review":"This is a fascinating and detailed examination of the evolution of Israel from the perspective of early Zionist aspirations, through to the Hagannah and the IDF. Morris clearly has access to high quality IDF intelligence and archives. While many reviewers have focused on the Arab vs. Zionist sections of the book - presumably because these tensions feed naive political emotions - the text itself devotes a large amount of space to the double dealing by Britain that sowed the seeds of much of the current conflict. In my opinion, an understanding of international subterfuges plotted against, and subsequently thwarted by, a nascent Israel is proably the primary added value of this text. Irrespectove of one's ideological stance, Morris draws together a compelling account of the injustices directed at the early state of Israel (Yishuv). Well worth reading. Packed with detail and certainly not propaganda."},{"rating":"2","title":"Remarkable work of history","review":"Benny Morris rose to the forefront of Israel's 'New Historians' in the 1980's with the publication of 'Birth of the Palestinian Refugee Problem,' which provided radically new evidence which altered modern perceptions of the region forever. Morris retains his important findings in Righteous Victims and expands on them, covering virtually the entire history of the Israel-Palestine conflict. I found the earlier chapters leading up to the creation of the State of Israel on the earliest Zionist settlers to be particularly interesting; Morris presents a picture which indicates that the current bloodshed is by no means a product of natural necessity. The ethnic cleansing of Palestine and subsequent military occupation is the cause. However, Morris becomes overly ideological in the concluding sections of the book, allowing his harsh realist politics to creep in. Nevertheless, this is arguably the most comprehensive single volume about the history of the conflict."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bias, dense and dull","review":"Not at all even handed. Morris makes sweeping statements about what an entire group of people were thinking or feeling based on antidotal evidence at best. Anyone looking to this book to educate themselves about the history of the region should also know that the author has since recanted much of the editorializing he did in these pages. Besides being misleading, it's dense, boring and long. I recommend it only in lieu of a sleeping pill. Look for my copy on the \\"used books\\" shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"re-wrapped oozing cheese","review":"Lovely sentiment, not what was expected, though.

Combining the best aspects of death metal, grind, and hardcore, The Red Chord deliver a disemboweling nine song, thirty minute time signature juggling expose. Incomprehensibly fast and original drumming, technical riffing, and some of the best Godzilla impressions in years are all present. The Red Chord have raised the bar for technical metal on their first release, an astounding feat to say the least. Metalheads, expect to hear much more from this little known band in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heavy and technical Metalcore","review":"Yes the more emoish metalcore is becoming so \\"trendy\\" but that's cool, just as long as they're good, but for AMAZING metalcore, Red Chord is where it is at. This nine-song masterpiece ends in just under half hour and delivers some of the most intelligent compositions heavy music has heard. Sometimes so backwards that you can't even tell what's going and other times so bone-crushing that you have to step away from the speakers for fear of your life, but no matter what the riffs work together perfectly through each song. The guitarist is incredible. The drumming is superb as well, with lots of quick time changes and riffs that are played once, the man on the throne keeps it together and flowing. All in all this is great for fans of truly talented music and should be in your CD collection. BUY IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"BEYOND COOL AND AWESOMENOUS","review":"Great great grindcore slash metalcore slash hardcore or what have you. Starts off with a bang and never lets up.

Having spent three years attempting without success to follow the Sufi path, Ibn al-Rawandi in this book returns to Sufism but weakly flails about in his efforts to exact from it his revenge. Ultimately his message is that if you are a rationalist and do not believe in spiritual transformation, do not get involved in Sufism. Sound advice--but isn't this obvious?! The bottom line, though, is that a good piece of yellow journalism should at least be a juicy and engaging read. Sadly, this work is by and large flat. So if you want a book on spiritual disenchantment, read Masson. If you want something on Sufism, read anything but Ibn al-Rawandi."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful listening and sing-a-long CD!","review":"Normally I'm not a Blues listener, but when I heard this CD, I immediately bought it.

The spring-loaded valve that enables \\"Stop-n-Pour\\" has fallen out 6 times. The plastic O-ring on the valve is beginning to break down. The pot is very difficult to put into or take out of the unit, requiring two hands. The pot leaks coffee onto the counter during the first pour, no matter how it is done. When the pot is taken out of the unit, coffee drips onto the heater plate, resulting in a scorched-coffee smell. It's hard to imagine how such a design failure made it into production.

First, is Manhattan Melodrama which is a drama, duh, starring Clark Gable and a few other people you may recognize. Then the mystery thriller, Evelyn Prentice, which is sure to please those of you who love courtroom movies. The next three are all romantic comedies. Double Wedding is one I can watch again and again and is one of the first films I saw with both Powell and Loy in it. I also enjoyed both I Love You Again and Love Crazy. Each film comes with a cartoon, a vintage short and one disc even has a Radio Show.

It fills the bill and is probably also appreciated by William Powell and Myrna Loy fans as well.Mother stars in the short musical film \\"Dancing on the Ceiling.\\" She plays the dentist.

It will Scare the Wits Out of You!!!!!!","review":"There are plenty of other great books on parenting twins & other multiples out there -- do yourself a favor & don't buy this one! First of all, it is very technical & difficult/unpleasant to read. Second, it has pictures of women after childbirth with like several feet of hanging extra skin -- not something I needed to see when I was emotional and pregnant with two. It also had the most negative, scary tone. It seemed to tell you all of the things that could go WRONG and very little of what could go right. Let me tell you, from a woman who has been there -- it can go beautifully & without incident -- & not everyone ends up with miles of extra skin on their stomachs. If you buy this book while pregnant, it will only serve to scare the wits out of you. Save yourself the stress and look elsewhere for good information!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very bizarre one-sided perspective","review":"I've read most of this book and the more I've read the more bizarre it is. Noble claims that hypertension, anemia, and gestational diabetes are natural aspects of pregnancy that can be harmful if treated. She says bedrest is actually harmful, that ultrasounds increase fetal mortality and left-handedness (???) and a host of other claims. She implies that those carrying multiples many years ago gave birth to healthy 7-lb each infants with none of the problems that some of us having multiples face today. She is an advocate for veganism, water births, home births, doulas and midwives and avoiding pain meds. Though my twins are big and healthy I certainly didn't take the advice in this book.This is not medically sound advice nor is it objective or open-minded. It is a book of extreme views."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scared me to death!","review":"This book had me convinced that amy twins would have some type of birth defect, or that something would go wrong with my pregnancy, labor, or delivery. I read this when I was on bedrest, and finally had to remove it from my room because it scared me too much. The author seemed only to concentrate on what could go wrong with a twin pregnancy. I would recommend the only other twin book I read - \\"Keys to Parenting Twins.\\" It's much more positive! By the way, my twins were born completely healthy & normal at 36 weeks."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Freightening\\" and \\"Far Out\\"","review":"Noble's book is best summarized as \\"frightening\\" and \\"far out.\\" Her thoughts on twinship experiences in utero sound like something out of the X-Files; her warnings against the evils of consuming dairy products and foods containing preservatives are pure paranoia; and the gorey details of multiple pregnancy hazards are nothing short of terrifying. In fact, the positive aspects of having twins are completely ignored. The only redeeming quality of this book would be the last 3-4 chapters dealing with prematurity and dealing with loss. However, this same content can be found in many other less frightening and definitely more positive books, such as \\"Twins!\\" by Agnew, Klein and Ganon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outdated","review":"This was the first book that I bought when I found out that I was expecting twins and I found it to be outdated and full of a lot of biased information. The author has her own thoughts about what type of diet you should eat and advocates natural childbirth but doesn't provide a very comprehensive point of view to assist those that may not want to experience childbirth the way that she has. If you share her views then this book will be very helpful to you.I also tried contacting a lot of resources at the back of the book and found most of the numbers to be disconnected."},{"rating":"1","title":"It scared me to death!!!!","review":"I do not recommend this book at all. There is way too much discussion of what can go wrong and too much \\"new age\\" philosophy that is very strange to me. Elizabeth Noble is under the impression that she had a twin that died in utero and that influences the way she has gone about writing this book. This is very scary reading for any woman pregnant with twins."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would NEVER recommend this book!","review":"This was the scariest book on twins that I read. If you want to be afraid to eat, sleep or breathe during your entire pregnancy than this is your kind of book. Almost every chapter focuses on a negative aspect of carrying more than one baby and there are more chapters on what can go wrong than what to do to help things go right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Focuses on the negative","review":"Having just been told I was expecting twins, I was keen to find a book that could give me the information and reassurance that standard, \\"singleton\\" pregnancy books could not. But instead of finding useful information and reassurance, I finished this book feeling anxious and alarmed. It focuses far too much on the negative aspects of having twins - loss of one twin, preterm labor, birth complications, vanishing twin syndrome, etc. It is daunting enough being pregnant with twins without reading a book that reminds me of all the things that can go wrong. In addition, the author offers impractical advice on nutrition and exercise, which in many cases is contrary to advice from the medical profession. Not everyone has the money or the desire to eat seaweed and other \\"macrobiotic\\" health store food. All in all, I would not recommend this book to any woman expecting twins. It is alarmist and out-of-touch with real pregnant women."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Expected","review":"Finding out I was pregnant with twins was moving, exciting, shocking and scary. I wanted a book that would help me understand how my pregnancy would be different to a singleton pregnancy, what to expect and some guidelines on how to look after myself. Although the book was informative and I loved the little comments made my mothers of multiples in the borders I didn't feel satisfied. I was more worried than before as the book goes into so much detail about the loss of a twin (this was the majority of a book) and premature labor. It started out good explaining the types of multiples and how common they are (or not) was interesting but there were very few pictures and I found it to be quite long winded. I must say that although this book was informative I felt more worried and anxious for my twins after reading it than before and was left still not knowing what to expect during my pregnancy."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are much more postive works out there...","review":"I read this book right after I found out that I was having twins. Although I was a little concerned about the financial aspects of having two children, I was very positive about having twins. This book absolutely scared me! Doom, gloom, and more doom! After reading it, I thought that I would end up on bedrest early, that my twins would end up in NICU for months, and that all sorts of problems would come up. My husband and I later attended a childbirth class for multiple births and one of the first things that the instructor told us was to NOT read this book. There are so many other books out there that do tell you the risks and the problems, but manage to stay positive. Incidentally, I never was put on bedrest, my girls were born at 36 weeks, they spent one night in NICU and came home with me three days later. Believe me, from talking to other moms of twins and my own experiences, this is much more common than this book would make you believe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh my...","review":"Quite old and outdated.

I was severely disappointed. This is a middling, at best, romance novel with a pedestrian plot, predictable characters, and a hero and heroine who couldn't be more representative of all that's tedious in the genre. The author seems sincere and there's a sense that she did her civil war era research, but the book holds no surprises and little inducement for the reader to continue past the first few chapters.If you're going to write a novel about another spirited, plain but beautiful, impoverished girl-woman who makes a marriage of convenience with a gorgeous, tortured, secretly-sensitive man who-pretends-to-hate-but-really-loves-her than it better be exquisitely plotted and beautifully written. This book is neither."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"bought this book eagerly because I'm a Civil War reenactor and love the period. This book is a major disappointment. The hero and heroine don't get together until the last third of the book. The war is little more than a backdrop \\"Oh, this is going to be a terrible thing\\" over and over. Instead of real romance, we get child molestation, slave concubinage, the obligatory PC horrors of slavery....gag. I wanted history and romance and this book fails to deliver. The author also made a few mistakes with her research and does a poor job of depicting historical figures such as General Lee, Stonewall Jackson and others. She tries to describe the heroine looking sexy in pantalets (which were out of style by the time of the war) and a camisole (which is an undergarment that didn't exist yet - women of the period wore chemises).

The pictures are also excellent, but there is one flaw which has caused me not to give the map five stars: the paintings of Minas Tirith and various Good Guys are on the East side (right side) of the map while the pictures of Barad Dur, the Nazgul, and assorted other Bad Guys are on the West side (left side) of the map. Now, the problem with this is that the West contains the lands of the Good Guys and the East contains the lands of the Bad guys.

After this, everything changes, and they start doing stuff to please others rather than themselves. They would never, for instance, produce a pop classic like \\"Calling All Girls.\\" The muddied production that scars the rest of their albums, as well as quoting their own songs, is not present on Hot Space. Sure, there's wimpy electronic drums, but there is on Prince albums, too. It's the songs that are strong, and they're not afraid to do funky stuff, following thier bliss. I abhore the revisionist Brian May, going on about how he hated doing the funky stuff. Listen to his solo on \\"Back Chat.\\" I really think this album is a document of a band at a crossroads. Fans who have listed to Greatest Hits and likes it should by this album well before Innuendo, The Miracle, and Made in Heaven."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"How could they have sunk so low? This is the ultimate sell-out album. It's not even good dance music, if that's what Queen was trying to do here.

Some songs are quite agreeable like Back Chat (sounds a bit like Diana Ross\`s \\"upside down\\")\\"Las Palabras\\" is a nice ballad Under Pressure is still a great number which was originally written for the Greatest Hits album(1981) and therefore it sounds like a stranger on this record."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good, but even bad Queen has its pleasures","review":"Let's face it, Hot Space is filled with filler. But if you love Queen, and I indubitably do, you'll find several splendid touches. But you have to go mining for them...rather than having them explode into you, as great Queen so incomparably does.

But it is Queen, and even bad Queen has its pleasures."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh. This is horrible","review":"I'm shocked at all the good reviews I'm seeing! I'm a huge Queen fan, and have been since 1980. Day at the Races is wonderful. The Game is a classic. Night At the Opera is quirky, but still a good listen. But Hot Space is atrociously bad. Let me repeat that: atrociously bad. It sounds like somebody fooling around with a drum machine who didn't realize they were being recorded. It's a bad karaoke nightmare.Admittedly, yes, Under Pressure is a great song. But it couldn't possibly be more out of place unless it were included on a Megadeth CD. Really, it's that bad. Am I making myself clear? :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"In a word ... \\"Jesus\\"","review":"Most of the time when I write a review that has anything negative in it, it doesn't get posted but again I will take that chance. This is not only the worst Queen cd EVER but almost the worst CD I've heard PERIOD! Honestly, it sounds like they made up the songs as they played them! In contrast to Queens \\"The Game\\" which may be in my top 5 cd's of all time which is a masterpiece. People who give this mess 5 stars really must like Queen -or- are in the group. ... where are the guitars? They must have made the cd sound the way it does because \\"synth\\" was in .. but it wasn't \\"them\\" and it shows, badly.

They played two songs from this CD; first they played \\"Under Pressure\\" which the crowd went nuts for. Then they played \\"Body Language\\" and I swear the crowd went stone quiet. Needless to say, the band didn't play another song from this album. I only give this review two stars because \\"Under Pressure\\" is when of the best songs they have ever written. Other then that, like my German friends in 1982, I find this to be awful. The worst in their glorious career."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still Stinking After All These Years","review":"I was fortunate enough to see Queen in concert 19 times during their touring days in the US, up to and including their last tour in this country in support of this piece of garbage album, Hot Space.I find it amusing reading reviews here from people who actually think it's good! I remember clearly when this album came out, how despised it was. I never met a fan of the band who liked it then, even at the concerts.Yes, this one album single handedly destroyed Queen's career here in the US, from which they would never recover. Queen never toured the states again, yet they remained tremendously popular around the rest of the world. They still made alot of good music after this diatribe of stank.Now over 20 years later....I STILL hate this album. It's awful.To the dude who thinks this junk is brilliant because it is a chick magnet, rock on, dude. It's just too bad that you don't know what Queen were all about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Very Queen","review":"What can you say? Doesn't even sound like Queen in some places. A bit too much disco. There are a couple of good songs though. But this is my least liked Queen album apart from Flash Gordon sound track."},{"rating":"1","title":"the \\"black sheep\\" of the catalog...","review":"if you asked Queen fans in the States the reason for the band's decline in popularity here, alot of 'em will cite Hot Space as the reason...the band did lose more than a few long-time fans with this one, and in fact the tour for the album would ultimately be Queen's last in the USA. Many of the tracks aren't bad per se, but often they're experimental to a fault...and in many instances, the \\"human\\" element is upstaged by synths & beats. With the exception of a handful of tunes, Hot Space is a far cry from the days when Queen proudly boasted \\"No Synthesizers!\\" on their albums. I might recommend this for completists, but first-timers should probably avoid this for now. However, if you want to hear proper versions of these songs, check out Queen's Live At The Bowl CD or DVD...\\"Staying Power\\", \\"Action This Day\\" and \\"Back Chat\\" are actually powerful in raw form, unlike the techno vibe in the studio."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misfire","review":"Like all great Rock Groups who made several albums together Queen had some misfires. Hot Space is one such misfire. After the excellent The Game provided Queen with a major disco style hit in Another One Bites The Dust Queen decided they would make an album largly steeped in a Dance/Disco sound but the songs are not as good. This album fails with the exception of the songs that do not take this approach Life Is Real, Under Pressure, Los Polabras De Amor, Calling all Girls and Put Out The Fire."},{"rating":"1","title":"An embarrassment","review":"I am a big Queen fan, and this cd is their worst ever. Why they put it out instead of taking a sabbatical is beyond me...The only decent songs are Under Presuure - even if the live versions tend to put the studio one to shame, and Put Out The Fire. Maybe Life Is Real could be saved from the bonfire as well. The partially Spanish-sung Las Palabras de Amor is pretty silly. I am Spanish but have always found appalling the knack of foreign artists to try and record in my language because the lyrics lose a lot and sound silly.All in all, do not buy this if you consider yourself a Queen fan, unless you're the blind-faith kind, which is notrecommendable. You'll find yourself cringing more often than not if you listen to it..."},{"rating":"2","title":"STAYING POWER","review":"Queen upset a lot of their fan's when they put out \\"Hot Space\\". At this point, their music headed in the direction of dance.The album only has one hard rock song, which is Brian May's\\"Put Out The Fire\\".\\"Las Palabras De Amor\\"is a nicely written ballad.The collabaration \\"Under Pressure\\"w/David Bowie is on this album as well.The guitar lead's on these upbeat dance song's are cool as well.Queen would not be Queen unless they explored and did album's like this. This album is just more variety added to the rollercoaster record catalogue that they have made over the year's.No one could ever put there finger on Queen, or what their new music would sound like. NEW TERRITORY AS ALWAY's-HOT SPACE!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Under Pressure and little else","review":"If you're just getting into Queen's music, then I would avoid this album if I were you. There's a good reason Queen's popularity went down the tubes in the US, and it's called Hot Space. Hard to believe this album followed the smash hit The Game and preceded The Works, another strong album. But it did, proving that even the great rock bands slip up now and then.The best song on Hot Space is by far Under Pressure, the collaboration with David Bowie. That's the only reason this album gets 2 stars in my rating. Staying Power isn't that great, but not terrible. Body Language is awful; just a hard song to listen to. The other songs are just as bad.If you really want a Queen CD with Under Pressure on it, buy Classic Queen or one of the box sets. Avoid this album. You'll be glad you did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too unrocking for my taste but it's alright","review":"Queen's \\"Hot space\\" is very different from the classic and excellent albums from the 1970's. The overall approach is more pop than rock. The opening \\"Staying power\\" is pop-disco with a pumping bass and some horns, and is kind of a declaration of what to expect this time from Queen. Regardless of musical style, Queen are so talented that they do it with class and quality whether it's heavy metal or pop. On this album John Deacon's bass plays a major role on the behalf on Bran May's guitar and even if I would prefer a more guitar oriented album, Freddy Mercury sings as good as always. The melody and the groove is usually there and songs like \\"Back chat\\" are very good indeed. But of course there's a couple of tunes I don't think stand up to former heights. The closing number \\"Under pressure\\" is a duet with David Bowie and in regard of the other songs on this album it falls kind of natural."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT IS \\"UNDER PRESSURE\\" DOING HERE??!!!","review":"QUEEN could have got away with this piece of junk had UNDER PRESSURE not been in this disc. Why? Because when you listen to that song you realize, by simple comparison, how bad all the other tunes are!!!!!! Even the ballads!!! Not to mention the dreadful opening track, STAYING POWER. THis album was an unsincere attempt by QUEEN to go disc and make some more money. Of course fans will say they \\"tried a new approach\\", \\"experimented some new ground\\"... (...) THis is just a bad CD by a great band. There are hundreds of cases like that !!"},{"rating":"1","title":"QUEEN'S WEAKEST EFFORT","review":"I really think the rest of the band don't think much of this album.

Disco! Queen was a victim of the times and perhaps a horrible identity crisis. While Body Language still pops up on greatest hits packages, that track is not enough to warrant buying this album. Stick with Queen's 70's releases."},{"rating":"1","title":"The undisputed low point in Queen's history","review":"If you're a Queen fan and you need a complete collection, or if you must have an original recording of \\"Under Pressure\\" (the only listenable song on the CD), then go ahead and buy it. But the rest of \\"Hot Space\\" is so completely awful, so completely un-Queen, that it makes you wonder if it was an intentional joke, as the early tracks on \\"A Night at the Opera\\" were. If you don't fit into one of the two categories listed above, avoid at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hot Space Leaves Me Cold","review":"Hot Space is not only Queen's worst album (I'm leaving out their contribution to Flash Gordon) but may be one of the worst of all time. From the first notes of Staying Power, one wants to ring up Brian May and ask him, \\"Dear god WHAT were you thinking? Did someone put a gun to your head and make you record this awful formulated music?\\" Queen is one of my all-time favorite rock bands, but to hear them playing dance music like performing monkeys is torture to me. The first five songs are truly awful (horns on a Queen song??). This is the new funky Queen. Freddie Mercury is \\"Calling All Girls\\"? Please! The second half has some nice rock and roll tunes, as if they woke up from their haze. \\"Under Pressure\\" with David Bowie is one of a kind. \\"Life Is Real (Song for Lennon)\\" is surprisingly touching. But even these don't make up for an attempt by Queen to apparently ride the success of \\"Another One Bites the Dust\\" by turning up the funk levels to 11. Be afaid, be very afraid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding performance","review":"I got to see this talented duo perform live twice last year, and was thrilled when they released their first recording. I love their program - quite varied and different from what any other duos out there are playing. The performance is pristine, and the recording quality is great, with nice stereo separation between them (I believe Risa in on the left channel?). My only gripe is that the recording level is a bit low, so you've got to crank the volume quite a bit (still sounds great though, especially w/ headphones). The Prelude, Fugue and Variation by Franck alone to me is worth the price of the disc, I can't get enough of that haunting theme. This is my favorite CD purchase of the past 6 months."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was disappointed","review":"I do not know what I expected, however, after seeing this duet on TV, I was disappointed with their recording.

Fans (and detractors), will know the formula by now; dubbed-up, loungey and/or eastern-tinged beats. All good stuff and the album flows very smoothly. A common criticism of Thievery Corp. is that that their original compositions, mix CDs and remixes are all a bit samey but I think that's why many people like them. They provide a cool, unobtrusive soundtrack to people's everyday lives.What do reviewers usually write in such a situation; will please existing fans but won't win many new converts? That's spot on"},{"rating":"2","title":"Consistently Excellent!!!","review":"It's nice to finally have many of these remixes in one place, including many I had not heard before. Despite these songs being from many different genres and times, they flow together like liquid butter! The new Thievery song \\"Originality\\" is a slamming reggae jam that will liven up your party in the coming months. Imagine today's young people getting down to The Doors, courtesy of Thievery's \\"Strange Days\\" remix. Elsewhere, there are plenty of songs to spin, no matter your mood. This is not just some knockoff package till Thievery can deliver another studio album - this is a full fledged musical work!On another note, it's nice to know that Thievery is embracing the beauty of album packaging, with another first rate package here to go along with \\"The Cosmic Game\\" and \\"Richest Man in Babylon.\\" Even though CD sales are going the way of the passenger pigeon, it's nice to browse through such an elaborate package, which can then enhance the entire listening experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not An Easy Read, But Worth the Extra Time","review":"I was overwhelmed by the volumes of historical information in this book, but not so impressed by its organization. It would have benefited from a more chronological organization or some other means of keeping track of who was who and when and where they lived. The book is packed full of information, historical interest and the \\"voices\\" of women of the Renaissance. It is a great source for research, but give yourself lots of time to read it.

Nimble fingered, precise, and fun - if every UPS driver could play like this we would have packages flying in all directions! Staats is backed by the likes of Sam Bush and Jerry Douglas - both are two of the most respected musicians playing in Country/Bluegrass today (Bush and Douglas contributed to Dolly Parton's 1999 release \\"The Grass is Blue\\"). Back up vocals are provided by folks such as Kathy Mattea and Tim O'Brien. CD standouts are the Jazz inspired \\"Mandolin Meltdown\\" and the Celtic influence of pieces like \\"The Legend of the Ghost Coon\\", and \\"Shafer's Reel\\". Other standouts, such as the CD's title track \\"Wires and Wood\\", and \\"Timbuktu are played with a gentle Country/Folk styling. There just isn't a bad piece on this CD(most were composed by Staats). My favorite is \\"Jessica's Lullaby\\" -a graceful tribute to Staats Daughter. Buy this and enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"How do you rate a great CD? Here's my answer:","review":"If long after you have played the CD, the tune echos in your mind! It true Jonny can pick a mean mandolin -an instrument rarely used in old style bluegrass- but he also shares the spotlight with others in his group. Sam Bush and Jim Hurst can be heard taking a lead, and round out the sound nicely. Listen to \\"Catch Me If You Can\\" for a good lesson on harmony, and balance.

We did not have a problem with the tube coming out, however, we have lost the rubber pc that goes on the tube, so now, the toy is worthless, and will not pump without the rubber piece.The water blaster is HEAVY, and straps are not stable.

With an attachment that comes with the crane, you can turn the ride-on into a tow truck. Good idea but it doesn't work very well. My son can never keep things attached to the hook on the crane. And the crane is virtually useless by itself. Pictures always show the crane standing by itself but it won't stand alone. The child has to hold it up, while trying to operate the crane to pick things up. Its too much to do at one time. My children do play with it time to time, they pretend its a vacuum and push it around the floor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Magnet does not work","review":"We received this toy as a gift for my 16 month child and found out early on that the magnet is NOT attracted to any metal of any type. So being the tinker that I am, I took the magnet section apart to find that THERE IS NO MAGNET IN THERE! There was just 3 washers (like the metals discs with holes in the middle of them) and they weren't magnetized at all. I tried sticking one of my own magnets in there but I do not have a strong enough magnet. It just didn't work. Unfortunately since I have taken it apart already, I cannot send it back, but maybe I can convince some of you to NOT BUY THIS TOY!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"We thought the Rumblin' Rollin' Crane would be a great addition to the Tonka Scoot'N Scoop, but it has proven to be a big disappointment.

But one thing is certain, it is all filtered through a suppressed anger which transforms the stories in these songs into dirges with very little color or light.Her vocal method of delivery here is a closed-throat, closed-mouth drone that is unnecessary. She has a good voice but won't let it shine because she doesn't trust her lyrics alone to reach the listener and leave their mark. She is the real loser in Bittertown because she hasn't accepted and moved on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must for Buffy fans!","review":"This collection episodes is great for Buffy fans, or people who have no idea what Buffy is. This video is what the show is all about. Humor, drama, sorrow, love, friendship, etc. is all in these two episodes. \\"Angel\\" describes the relationship between Buffy and Angel, and gives viewers a look into his life. \\"The Puppet Show\\" may give off a creepy vibe, but it's one of the episodes I laugh at everytime I watch it, it's so funny. If you haven't seen these episodes, or even if you have, you should get this video!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific Fun","review":"In all of television history, I can't think of a better love story than that of Angel and Buffy, the mismatched lovers on \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer.\\" It has passion, sex, violence, all the angst of youth tormented by parents and a world that contrives to keep them apart. The episode \\"Angel\\" introduces us to that romance and it's a great way for newcomers to the series to catch up. \\"The Puppet Show\\" is creepy but also a real riot. The strength of \\"Buffy\\" has always been its knack for portraying high school as a horror movie. Sure, vampires are scary. But so are high school principals with Napoleon complexes. I only hope the WB releases more episodes on videotape."},{"rating":"2","title":"Angel-The Puppet Show","review":"The VDO is good i like the angel episode:D...the puppet show wz ok but the VDO is worth it 4 just the Angel episode:D"},{"rating":"2","title":"THe best video in the pack","review":"These two episdoes are the best in the pack. First you got Angel which is the episode when Buffy learns the truth about Angel and when they share there first kiss. Then you have the puppet show.

She opted to put it on the deck so she can hear the water when they hang out under their canopy thing. From what I understand about a lot of solar panels is that they should be able to store up some energy; the only major disappointment I came across is that whenever the panel is even half way in the shade, the fountain stops running. When the sun is shinning bright, it trickles away.So if you're planning on using this outside, be prepared for an on again, off again fountain unless you have sun all the time. Mind you, I didn't expect it to work all night; but I did think if it got cloudy for 5 or 10 minutes, it would work throught it.But overall, my mom loves it and everyone that's seen it, adores it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overpriced and tips over easily.","review":"Be careful when putting these together.

I could see my friends in some of the characters.It seems that Shaw just couldn't resist showing us how crazy the human condition really is by his works that always include funny yet absolutely true twists on things, and his twist on the Don Juan tale is one of his best ones yet.This story was smart and funny. I loved it and wanted more when it was over. I'll have to buy another one of his books. I just love his style.I can't resist any chance I can get to peek into the mind of a genius, and Shaw was a true genius. This story was delightful and brilliant."},{"rating":"2","title":"About This Book","review":"This review is for the 1962 Heritage edition in the brown pebbled slipcase.Heritage really went to town with their edition of Man and Superman. Bound in half-cloth, and half-marbled paper with a blind-stamped urn emblem and gold print, it is extensively illustrated by Charles Mozely in tones of russet, puce, green, and brown. Fully illustrated pastedowns and prelims. Over 40 incidental illustrations in sanguine and six 5-color full page illustrations.The introduction is a personal reminiscence by Sir Lewis Casson, apparently written for this edition, who played Octavius Robinson in the original production! Shaw's Epistle Dedicatory is present.And, most charming: the John Tanner Revolutionist's Handbook is separately printed in cheap-looking bright red (of course) stapled wraps lodged in a special inset cut into the slipcase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Viewsonic builds products that don't last","review":"Viewsonic customer service is nonexistent and product support worse than poor. Products are poorly made and will not last. Call technical support 1800-688-6688 and see how long you have to wait for a service rep. Online you get someone to respond who barely speaks English. I bought a plasma TV for $3000 and it failed in less than 3 years. Viewsonic reaction: Too bad, you should have bought a warranty and we'll fix it in 48 hours. Without one, you are on your own. I think something bought for $3000 should last more than 3 years, and Viewsonic should too. Viewsonic intentionally builds products that won't last to sell you an expensive product warranty. I wouldn't buy Viewsonic again and don't think you should either until they built a better product and improve their customer support."},{"rating":"2","title":"The book would make those who demonize China unhappy.","review":"The book stays almost unknown in the U.S. only because it provides solid evidences of how aggressive India was.

Just what I expected from this, good story line with live issues. Not a typical Hollywood movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining","review":"This was a different kind of story...I like different, so it was good. It's not your typical comedy, but it's not a real drama either. Obviously taking place in a psych ward of a hospital, it's got both humor and serious moments that were well done by the actors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought Provoking","review":"I liked it.

The lead in the movie was this entitled New York brat that checked himself into a mental hospital because he had a little stress from his prep school. Give me a break. I was hoping that by the end of the movie he would introspect a bit and find out that he was just being melodramatic, but instead the movie was biased to his point of view.

This film is supposed to be an uplifting comedy, however I found it painfully predictable and a bit sad. Keir Gilchrist was great, playing Craig, a young mental patient who wants to kill himself. Gilchrist and the flashes of his thoughts, that we get to see, are the best part of this film and the only thing really worth seeing. Zach Galifianakis, who is one of my favorites, isn't at all funny, he's actually kind of pathetic in this film. Despite Gilchrist performance, the movie is actually quite stupid, I mean what kind of mental hospital lets the patients have access to the roof of the hospital? It looked good, has some really good actors in it, but nothing happens, the story is predictable as hell, and it's a \\"comedy\\" in which no one really says or does anything funny. I was hugely disappointed with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A dark comedy with a feel good ending","review":"Watched this movie on a whim and turned out better than what I thought. It is a dark, light-hearted comedy with a happy ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie","review":"I liked this movie. It has good character development, doesn't rely on special effects and was generally entertaining and thoughtful."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's Kind of a Tragic Story","review":"Any story whose premise is the would be suicide of a teenager is rather too cynical to be saved by dark humor. I'm not one to take things too seriously to see the humor in everyday life; in fact I consider doing so to be humans' best coping mechanism. But this movie falls prey like so many others these days to the urge to drastically overstate its thesis lest the slow-witted fail to grasp it. You can't start with miserable and strive for sardonic irony. You can start with sardonic irony and strive for humor, sure, but going waaaay too dark from the start makes it impossible to be lighthearted to the grown-ups out there. Think the difference between Little Miss Sunshine and One Flew Over Cuckoos Nest: this is trying for the former and nailing the latter but without the social commentary. No upside here."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of the 5 billion hrs it took for this movie to end","review":"This movie was pointless, and I really don't remember laughing at any of it.

The story never really connects all the characters in a meanful way."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Promise You, It's Not","review":"A 1-star rating is being generous. It's a terribly boring movie that really makes no sense. The main character is very much the Everyday Man, and you don't need a movie to let you know that life is stressful. If you've come this far w/o knowing or experiencing that, then maybe you should watch this movie. I promise, for almost a full 2 hrs, you will be distressed. I was. It wasn't funny.

If you've read the product copy, you know the deal: twist the ears, flick the \\"flicker\\", or press up/down/left/right on the unlabeled stomach to create and modify music and sound effects. This is all quite interesting, but I haven't decided yet if it is actually fun (but as I'm a bit older than the target demographic, my opinion on this may not matter).What I like: It's a nice idea, looks cool, and you can plug your iPod/MP3 player into it. The music it creates sounds pretty good.What's disappointing: The moving eyes are noisy and distract from the music. I wish there were more ways to modify the sound.

I purchased IZ for my son of 7 who absolutely loves it! IZ's movements and noises are very comical but can drive a parent batty after a while. But in a kids view this is Great. My son can listen to his music on it by linking his CD walkman to it. (also works with MP3 or IPod)Or just listen to IZ's personal music making abilities, which your child can mix up and manipulate by making faster slower or different sounds etc. It is like a personal speaker and a fun friend. My two year old also enjoys IZ and that where the durability comes in. IZ is very surprisingly durable. I was even considering getting him one. Now as for the older set like age 13 (Forget it!!). My 13 year old thinks its ridiculous and the IDog was the way to go there.

Kelly for his great talent. The man has soul, and this new CD is a great addition to what is becoming an impressive body of work. 'Just Like That' and \\"I Wish' are two of the best tracks here, and maybe better than anything D'Angelo or Maxwell have done. What is surprising is that he doesn't get more media attention: how many millions of albums has he sold while white bread lightweights like NSYNC and Christina Ag get all the attention.

However, 12 Play (94') release is loaded with heavy bass and catchy tunes. TP-2.com is an album for the \\"fans\\". Unfortunately, fans are willing to accept anything these day.

Yes scratched ...so that kinda sucks, but Tp2 is still a great Cd , and the fact that Cd was scratched on a few songs is no fault of R Kelly! I'm still happy I purchased it for my collection...

A bootlegged video would offer better picture and sound quality than this.But as much as I've bashed this movie, I recommend getting it, for the sole reason of a very young (and oh my lawd, ever so sexy and gorgeous) Uma Thurman. She will make your saliva glands work a double shift. Uma is THE reason for owning this movie. Fast-forward to every scene with her and you're all set.

Nor can she play a psychotic with any zest: when she lost it in the restaraunt in her husband's presence, running up the stairs and proceeding to yell and flail, I felt embarrassed for her. If I had more space I could go on, but I want to end with one burning question; Why the hell didn't the wardrobe mistress give Bassinger a decent pair of stilleto pumps to at least wear with her slinky black backless dress, if she insisted on outfitting her through the whole movie with dopey little flats?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible DVD, ok movie","review":"The quality of this DVD is bad; that's being kind.

Although the conductor uses a variety of orchestras, his vision is imparted to whatever band he is conducting and the engineering and acoustics of all the venues are exemplary.It is unfortunate that Georg Tintner committed suicide because of a particularly nasty form of cancer and we are denied his insights into the symphonic cycles of Beethoven, Brahms, Mahler, Haydn, etc.There is being issued in Canada a \\"Georg Tintner Commemorative Edition\\" and having listened to some of the offerings, his death was a great loss to the world of music and musicology - he wrote his own liner notes to the Bruckner cycle.I highly recommend this set to any Brucknerite as it measures up to and sometimes exceeds the offerings of Jochum - and even von Karajan (no mean feat, indeed!)Timothy Wingate, Ottawa CANADA"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bruckner by Jochum","review":"These CDs contain performances of the nine Bruckner symphonies.Of these 3,4,7,8,9 are remarkable, with 4, 8 and 9 beingmasterpieces. The performances by Eugen Jocum and the DresdenStaatskapelle orchsetra are well-designed, and played at tempithat seem to represent the composer's intentions. The recordingquality is good, except for dynamics: the sound volume ison the low side. One needs a high grade system for adequatereproduction, especially given the wide dynamic range andtimbral subtlety characteristic of Bruckner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like Hearing Bruckner for the First Time","review":"I have listened to Bruckner for more years than I'd care to admit, but these recordings by Eugen Jochum are like hearing him for the first time. It is startling how good these recordings are, and what freshness Jochum brings to the more familiar Bruckner offerings...the 3rd, 4th, 7th, 8th and 9th. Electrifying is not too strong a word to describe them. In addition, these EMI recordings are an astonishing value. Buy and listen for yourself. I dare you not to be transfigured by the music-making."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for the very religious, but not for the rest of us","review":"A TON of the quotes in this book are religious in nature--whether they be bible verses, quotes about \\"god in christ,\\" about faith, praying, etc, etc! As an Atheist, I didn't appreciate having so many religious quotes in what is billed as just a book of quotes on \\"Wisdom.\\" And they aren't only in one section of the book, but ALL OVER--in the sections about art, nature, love and friendship, conscience, etc! I feel like a \\"bait and switch\\" was pulled on me, and that this book should be advertised as a religious quote book. So I'd say buy it if you're religious and draw your inspiration from religion, but not if you aren't/don't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet movie for preschoolers","review":"I bought this movie to show our faith- based preschool group when we were studying Native Americans.

You could only play a few games and you cannot do as many things on it compared to the neopets website. this toy is not educational because it doesnt teach you anything and it isnt fun to play with. You play with it only a few days and then you get tired of playing with it that you just leave it hanging around. I dont recommend this toy for anybody."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aisha Pocket Neopet","review":"I bought one a few days ago. It has already 'left' me three times.

I could only force myself to read half of this book before I got sick of the author constantly talking about homosexuality as humiliating and ridiculous. Having researched Native American tradition and Wicca I have come to know that neither of these traditions look down on homosexuality as being humiliation or ridiculous. This book is not at all what it appears to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"IZ---mixed reactions","review":"I love that I can play my ipod through IZ... although I could do without the farting and burping or the outbursts in the middle of my music. I suppose for kids, IZ can be pretty amusing. Overall, it's not a disappointment, but it can be annoying if you're not in the right mood!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the music?","review":"I got this for Christmas, and I thought it would be great fun. I was SO disappointed when I plugged in my iPod and discovered that the music is quiet and sounds tinny and the words are COMPLETELY drowned out. Not everyone wants to listen to a crummy, psuedo-techno version of their favorite songs. Do not buy this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Devil","review":"When I turned 12, 5 years ago, I received the iZ on Christmas from my aunt and at first I thought this would be really cool. Oh how wrong I was. First and foremost it does not turn off, even at the age of 17 I still cannot figure out how to turn this contraption off. It basically plays the same looped annoying beat for hours on end while adding even more mind-numbing effects into the mix. This leads me into my next point: the sound effects and \\"voice\\" of this demonic figure can induce many nightmares. Honestly, this \\"voice\\" is so soul crushing I would rather be deaf then have to listen to this toy speak and/or make noise. This toy has fallen from my shelf several times over the years and it literally takes me hours to turn off. This toy should be avoided at all cost because it is a perpetual, annoying toy that only plays infuriating effects over a terrible looped beat."},{"rating":"2","title":"IZ is it","review":"Got a couple of these for the kids, good fun, well made. It looses a star because it seems when you patch through your iPod music to use the speaker the IZ puts in its music sounds-which is realy terrible, maybe there is a way to turn IZ off and just use speaker. Otherwise they are super tough and look great on the shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"I HATE this toy!!!","review":"Yes, I fell for the marketing. I saw it spotlighted during the Christmas season and I thought why not. Well before you make the same mistake let me tell you how incredibly annoying this toy is. It is loud, frustrating and has no obvious on/off switch. Therefore my kids refuse to have it in their rooms because it will unexpectatedly go off in the middle of the night. It will play your ipod or simaler mp3 player but it adds so much noise that it really isn't worth it. It does not dance like it was advertised to do. In fact it will hardly stay in the position that it is pictured in. I will say that this was a complete waste of money and is about to be donated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Kids","review":"This should be considered a toy and not your only set of Ipod or MP3 speakers. The kids love to play with the sounds and listen to IZ's crude sounds along with their music. However, you can forget about listening to audio books. This would have been a really great product if you could just turn off the sound effects when you want to."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you can't understand it, you're lucky!!","review":"My step-mom decided to waste money not once, but twice, getting one for my 6yo brother, and 5yo nephew...both of them(the blue one) if you press it's stomach right say, and I quote:\\"It's time to get f*cked up!\\"That is not appropriate for kids at all, and we will be seeking legal advice on this toy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ok","review":"I got this for christmas it was great! The only downside is that it makes its own \\"comments\\" and you cant play music without that thing shuting up. Other wise it was great. I think its great that its one of the very few toys that boys and girls like. (Only recomended for ages 8-12 and dont buy this unless u have some sort of ipod!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why??","review":"I don't get this toy, it seems to suck it. I also don't understand the whole fart or burping that everyone else has experienced. I've never heard it do that. My parents got this for my 3 year old. A little young if you ask me. I personally don't get it. What's the point? I mean I can listen to the radio to hear music. I just don't get it and the eyes moving do take away from the actual playing of music, they are loud. I think this toy is just a waste of money, but my parents can afford it so I'll keep it until I get annoyed and throw it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasent the best","review":"i am 9 years old.This Iz thing isent great .Once i tested it out and when u make a mix in DJ mode the IZ is (lol Iz and is)really making the music and u are just making a bubble sound.The only reson i really like it is becasue it makes songs from to ipod to hear out loud.I rather get a I-Dog if i were u.My mom said this thing would dance and i got very exieted.But it is the worst."},{"rating":"1","title":"This toy is horrible","review":"Bought this toy for my 8 year old daughter and promptly returned it to the store. Even she was disturbed by this toy. The burping and snorting was obnoxious and completely distracted your ability to actually hear your ipod. Which isn't that the point?

I played with it to make sure it was living up to the reviews and I'm going to return them all. It's cute but I just don't think it's worth the money. You can make it play funky sounds but I can't see it holding a kids attention for that long. I plugged it into my ipod and was expecting that to be the greatest part (I thought it was going to dance) but it basically functioned as speakers and it's eyes bobbed up and down. Funny for a minute."},{"rating":"1","title":"RUDE!","review":"I am the mom of a 4 and 7 year old and I wish I had played with this before christmas morning.

The reptile information is broken down with easy to understand symbols and includes reptile characteristics, diet, behavior, times of day they are most active, level of difficulty for the reptile's care, terrarium size, type, substrate, temperature, and other habitat items that are needed to care for that reptile.This guide is well beyond the simple quick reference guide I was looking for!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Travis MsGee","review":"I agree with the other two star reviewer for this book. Nothing seems real or convincing in this work. If this had been the first MacDonald book I read I would not have read another.The plot read like the cheap 60's motorcycle themed movies the book kept discussing. I didn't believe any of it. Travis reluctant to grieve over a woman he knew that was brutally murdered because he couldn't focus in on her personality just amazed me.Even if you're addicted to the series as I am; don't read this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate giving a two star.......","review":"rating to any MacDonald book but this one is deserves it. In my opinion it's the weakest of the McGee series. I wouldn't avoid it if I were going through the series but don't look for the usual MacDonald here. It's fairly strong on character as MacDonald always is but a very weak, convoluted plot takes away from any strength of character the writer exhibits. It's like MacDonald got caught up in it and didn't know how to extricate himself! Not a particularly good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"That Night","review":"If you love laughter, tears, romance, and great music, this is a great choice! A cult classic for romance fans as well as fans of the fifties era movies. A must see for anyone who enjoys a great flick. The chemistry between the entire cast is magic. And if you love a good misundertood bad boy, C. Thomas Howell is one of the best. Even though I grew up in the eighties, this movie was still quite reminicent of my own childhood. Anyone who was a kid in any era will find something to relate to in this movie. One of my faves.."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great movie!","review":"I have liked this movie ever since I first saw it. Since then I have watched it many many times.

The channel I saw it on played it constantly and it quickly became a favorite. I think it's a wonderful story and it has many great people in it! I do hope it gets put on DVD one day soon, so then I can watch it without hooking up my VCR!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting Premise, Predictable Plot","review":"This novel is an interesting concept, but is done in by a completely predictable climax that you can smell before the book is barely a third over because once again, JFK hagiography must ultimately rule the day. All one has to do is substitute the name of Curtis LeMay for the novel's \\"Ramsay Curtis\\" and you know right away how things have to turn out. I have seen this cliche hashed out time and again in other alternate history novels like \\"Promises Kept\\" in which no one can ever point to any flaw in the leadership of JFK, or that he would have been the savior of America and never done any wrong, and the end result is still utterly banal and predictable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Something to read while waiting for a plane or train","review":"Fairly decent \\"junk\\" reading, full of cliches (e.g. news reporter uncovering sinister conspiracies; romance between reporter and predictably beautiful, spunky, and mysterious female correspondent), and simplistic characterizations (e.g. the Globe's military censor is downright demonic, with no redeeming attributes at all). Best part of the book is its description of the hypothetical Cuban War, and its immediate aftermath as America gradually withdraws from the world scene (some sections are absolutely chilling). Unfortunately, the plot steadily unravels as it plods its way to the disappointingly predictable conclusion (which any half-intelligent reader will figure out by the first 1/3 of the book). Furthermore, too much of the story is derivative of Harris' Fatherland. But JFK adorers, former hippies clinging to the 1960s, and anyone who loses sleep over the possibility that the Redcoats will one day reconquer America will surely love the novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"He Lives!\\"","review":"This was a GREAT book!

However, the unrelenting political thrust of the novel, given life by the sensitive / tough-guy / ex-army protagonist, becomes very quickly annoying. I won't mention which way the author leans - that is unimportant - but will say that the apparent assumption by him that everyone thinks as he does leaves a bad taste in this reader's mouth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read","review":"Probably one of the best alternate reality books I have read. It places interesting characters into interesting what-if scenarios. The periodic injection of real persons such as Bob Dylan, DR. Martin Luther King, etc still working to improve life gives additional substance."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Unique AH","review":"Dubois gets credit for tackling a subject that has not had much alternate history devoted to it -- the Cuban Missile Crisis. Like much alternate history, Resurrection Day has a great setup and a great idea, but the plot itself is strained. It is fascinating to read Dubois's vision of the United States ten years after a limited nuclear war, with President Kennedy maligned as the reason for the nation's collapse. The most original idea is Britain's smug condescension as the U.K. is called upon to offer aid and assistance to the now-impoverished United States."},{"rating":"2","title":"Resurrection Indeed","review":"Although it starts off a bit meandering, Resurrection Day quickly builds into a book difficult to put down. There are two phenomenal stories here. One is what if the Cuban Missile Crisis had turned into WWIII? The other is what the US might be like as a 3rd world nation. Both are compelling.DuBois writes engaging characters and fills his plot with enough turns to make a Ballerina tipsy. I repeatedly tried to geuss the ending, and even the next page, and was always stymied. The conversations flow convincingly, and the story is a joy to read.Here we are given a look at how Americans are like the rest of the world. If you strip them of the technological advantage, and the moral advantage of a well-constructed constitution that is actually followed, they respond like everyone else. Not badly, not well- just as humans, struggling to survive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comfortable and stylish enough","review":"I like black sneakers best because you can pull them off going to casual social things like neighborhood parties, cookouts, etc. and they dont look dumpy.these are comforatable and break in nicely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classics baby! ;-)","review":"I'm wearing these bad boys right now.

I went to a party over the weekend in a backyard that was very little grass, mostly dirt, and was able to just wipe off the outsole with a damp cloth.

In truth, her trial was orchestrated by the English and their clerical allies (and even Shaw admits that the Inquisition overturned the verdict in 1456, shortly after the English were finally driven out of Rouen); nor was Joan a \\"rebel\\" except in the minds of her political opponents. By dredging up this fraudulent view of La Pucelle, Shaw's play was among the first popular works to undermine the efforts of countless scholars whose research had brought a more truthful view of the issue to light. For an historically accurate version, I would recommend any book by Regine Pernoud, many of which are offered here at Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD MUSIC!","review":"After I heard Cheatin' from the Shaft soundtrack, I couldn't wait for Liberty City album to drop.

The CD is 100% Webb, but there are hints of other things here as well, and there is even a noticable Elvis influence in some places. It is in no way an attempt to copy Elvis, though. It is very subtile. Like they were influenced by the same music growing up. That's what I heard, at least.This remastered compilation also sounds great. Some of the best sounding recordings I have heard in a long time. The drums are noticably clear and great sounding.This CD completes my collection. I now own the complete works of Webb Wilder. This CD does not disappoint. It is excellent, and I have never heard a bad Webb Wilder CD. I think that I enjoy it more because it was the last one that I bought, and I can really appreciate the variation on this CD more than if I would have bought it first.He is also great live."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"The book starts well( first 20 pages).

Norman does best when the physical action is coming at you fast and furious; not so good when the only action taking place involves complex human interactions.Not only are many of the scenes way over the top, but there were too many characters to keep track of. At times, Tarl Cabot gets lost in the storyline. I simply didn't care enough about many of the minor characters to want to hear much about them.I think it was just a bit too ambitious an undertaking for Norman, and it didn't play into his strengths as a writer.

I suspect it is uninspired placement of microphones that often renders the sound muddy and distant. Jacob sometimes sounds very matter of fact and occasionally downright bad.

I like the selection of songs including a song he wrote for this album. Not all the arrangements are tradtional (some even being on the ridiculous side) and maybe this makes his efforts a little tainted. In the liner notes Roberto comments on his approach to some of the songs. He admits he tries to sound like a pop singer (i.e. White Christmas-what a butcher job). On other songs he was a tenor. Even that doesn't add up to much. Tenor fans and Alagna fans will be very disappointed with his singing. I was. This album will let him iclude himself as one of the elading tenors in the post Domingo/Pavarotti/ and Carreras era.

All that being said, \\"mediocre\\" Kaye Gibbons writing is still phenomenal by any standard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly affecting if somewhat romanticized","review":"As a Southern woman and the daughter of a schizophrenic, I read this book with particular interest. In places I was amazed to find my experiences described exactly, and the book was always affecting and detailed. However, coming from a situation in which the family came to economic ruin, and lives were destroyed by mental illness, I found the book in some ways too comfortable. A lucky family indeed that is gifted with the money, the isolated farmhouse, and the hired help to manage Maggie's illness the way it is managed! And lucky family whose mother's illness --as we are told at the very beginning of the novel -- is cured. Still, I admired the plainness with which Gibbons told her story, and the fact that she was not tempted -- as the author of _The Daughter of the Queen of Sheba_ was -- into pitching a parent's catastrophic mental illness as an empowering experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"From crazy mom to Stepford wife....which is worse","review":"Well I can't say that this was the best book I read. It was definately a fine book. Fine being Ok not good but not horrible. It was an easy read with nothing to miss seeing as Gibbons pushes everything down your throat. Not much thinking needed for this one. I would have liked to see more of what a child sees in a mother. Not what a commercial says one should be. If the book had gone into more depth and actualy painted the characters with lives outside of Hattie's I might have found it more interesting. For a mediocre read about woman who goes from insane woman with passions to a Stepford Wife whom Jesse Helms himself would be proud of, pick this book up. If it doesn't sound good your money is better put to laundry or a good CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Under developed characters","review":"The character development was poor and insufficient, almost like the author tried to disguise the identity of them. As far as what was there, it was accurate, from my experience with people suffering from a bi-polar disorder but I wouldn't look here for any great insights. Worth a read if you don't have anything else handy because it is a fast read, but I've read short stories that were better thought out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moving story","review":"Sights Unseen is a moving story about a young girl who has a mother who is mentally ill, and by all accounts, unable to have a real relationship with her daughter. The yearning for the closeness young Hattie wanted with her mother, Maggie, is only too heartbreaking. This book not only shows how hard it is for Hattie to deal with her mother's emotional dips, but for her brother, Freddy, as well as her father. Pearl, the loving housekeeper, sometimes seemed to be the life preserver that kept the family afloat. She's a likable character, and it's too bad you don't know more about her. The only complaint I have about the book, or Kaye Gibbons as an author in particular, is the fact that there is not more dialoge in the book. The story is there, but there should be more interaction and depth between the characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"As described","review":"The product was delivered to me as described.

However, I found that this dictionary had significant gaps in the vocabulary covered. The cover boasted of coverage of insurance terms, but failed to include fairly basic insurance terms such as Hoechentschaedigungsgrenze (indemnification limit). Further, what listings the book does contain can best be described as bare bones. The entries indicate the gender of nouns, but do not include phoenetic pronounciations or suffixes for plural forms. I found the book to be of little assistance in my work.

It's a great basic replacement cat-back kit. It's no Borla, but you're not paying Borla prices either. The only parts that you may need that do not come with the kit are two metric 10mm 1.5 thread pitch bolts - and that is only if you have a 2000-2001 Cherokee. The exhaust sounds great, a little more bass to it, but no drone or rattles. Very easy install, removing the old rusty exhaust is always the hardest part.One other helpful note - if you have to replace any of the exhaust hangers on your Cherokee due to rust (the rear one in particular), they can be hard to find outside of a Jeep dealer. NAPA tends to carry them however."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sounding muffler","review":"Just what I wanted.

The hardest part was taking the old exhaust system off. For this I would suggest using a recip-saw or an angle grinder with a cutoff wheel. In this case I used a recip-saw.Mounting it was easy, just a matter of attaching the clamps and tightening them down. If you have one, I would suggest using an impact driver to do this. It would cut the time needed to install this considerably.The exhaust sounds great at idle and really opens up when you give it some gas. All in all a great product, we'll see how well it holds up to the Ohio winters though. I'll update if anything changes.*Bottom Line*Awesome kit, easy install, use a recip saw and impact driver if you have one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great.","review":"As advertised.

The second half deals with the \\"nuts and bolts\\" of the abandonments and methods of attempts to cover it all up.

I speak as a former career Intelligence officer, Marine Corps Captain who served in Vietnam, and as an advisor to the Select Committee of the US Senate, which in 1990 was charged with looking into the POW/MIA disaster.Dr. Douglass brings impressive credentials to this book. He is a leading authority on Soviet era nuclear, biological , and chemical warfare, having taught on these matters at Johns Hopkins. He worked for Paul H. Nitze, former Secretary of the Navy, Ambassador, and confident of several U.S. Presidents.The POW/MIA question is complicated. Dr. Douglass is superb in his making sense of this complex mess. 'BETRAYED\\" is well worth a close read, if one has a serious interest in this dark history.

Instead of wasting tons of space and loads of my time, I'll wrap it up quickly: What Douglass purports to be true in his book, i.e., the transfer of US POWs to the Soviet Union via Czechoslovakia could not have happened. Look at the timeline. Douglass would have rational people believe that the Soviets would use the Czechs to transfer US POWs at the same time the Soviets INVADED Czechoslovakia. So, let's see - the evil KGB would enlist the help of the same people they were CRUSHING? Come on.

Though not awful, the beats and groove sound very 1997; a mid-tempo dance rocker with no surprises. I can't pinpoint what else is wrong with this single, but it looks like it could use a serious remix or maybe more production.

These songs are suprisingly catchy and Serj's range shines out, the guitar and drum work are commendable as well.This album is definately worth picking up.

See, that drove you nuts and so will this cd after a few listens. They constantly say the same thing over and over again. A note to System boys, PLEASE WRITE MORE LYRICS WITH YOUR SONGS!!!!!!!!. The music rocks and the production is very good, just write some more meaningful lyrics please!!2 Stars may be a bit tough I'll admit, but these guys have something here and they should really try and explore it a bit more on the lyrics side of things as it would truly be awesome then.

A few bright spots shine through - \\"Atwa\\" and \\"Toxicity\\" actually have melodies, which is a welcome departure from the noise that permeates the rest of the album.I guess it's rough being a heavy metal kid these days.

Toxicity has picked up right where s/t left off. The same unexpected time changes and death-metal-like intensity is what SOAD is all about.

System of a down has taken heavy metal and interlaced it with melody and arabic influences to create an entirely new and different sound. It is heavy metal, so the faint hearted may find it a little hard to get past the sheer heaviness of the album. Daron and Serj's lyrics are at times very direct (\\"Prison Song,\\" \\"Deer Dance,\\" and definetly \\"Bounce\\") and at other times quite mysterious (\\"Toxicity,\\" \\"Chop Suey\\"). Overall, a great album. They showed heaps of promise and their excellent but occasionally poor debut, and delivered on every sliver of it. Very highly recomended. High points on the album include \\"Chop Suey!\\", \\"Prison Song,\\" \\"Aerials\\", and \\"Shimmy.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Big Bill's #27 of 2001","review":"This is NOT nu metal.

It's a cross of Black Sabbath, The Dead Kennedy's,Faith No More's Angel Dust and Tool. NOT Linkin Park. Best songs are The Prison Song, Chop Suey, and Deer Dance.

If you listen to this second cd of this band (Toxicity), you will truly understand where this generation of rock bands is going. I don\`t quite know what category this band (System Of A Down) fits into, maybe it's Nu-metal. For me, this album is simply the best albun of 2002. Serj Tankian with his naive and socially conscious lyrics and hypnotic weird vocal style is destined to become the Bono (U2 vocal) of Nu-metal. This Armenian album will make you hear a style of music that you will not find anywhere else. There are parts in some of the songs that are slower and then when you least expect they change into a heavy, head-banging style. I wish to see this Armenian band playing live here in So Paulo but it will take a long time, because the album has just been released.

A fierce rollercoaster can describe the experience with this album.The reason that I gave System of a Down's second effort 4 stars, which is still good, is because of parts of \\"Chop Suey\\" and \\"ATWA.\\" It's indisputable truth is that lyrics about \\"self-righteous suicide\\" and lyrics that speak of a religious matter that isn't correctly grasped (Chop Suey) has a negative connotation, and I don't like to think that anything like that track was overrated; I'm not sure why an aspect of \\"ATWA\\" seemed like a dead man walking (I don't feel/eat anymore).Most of the rhythms on this album were exquisitely done and are fun to listen to like \\"Bounce,\\" \\"Psycho\\" and \\"Deer Dance.\\" Of course, weird lyrics are presented. Most of the album is fast paced, but at times, rhythms slow down.Overall, \\"Toxicity\\" is an intriguing masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"great CD","review":"This CD is great. The band is made up of Daron who is a great guitar player, Shavo a good bass player, Serj a amazing singer/song writer, and John who is an exceptional drummer. This CD has most of System of a Down's good songs like Pshyco, Chop Suey, Toxcicity, and The Prison Song. I actually cant think of a bad song on the whole CD. Soad is very unigue. There isnt a band out there that can match Soads unigue style and sound. There is absolutely nothing like System of a Down. Once you hear some SOAD music you will be singing it for days or even weeks. System of a Down even touches on political content. Their music is meaningfull.

'Toxicity' is THE BEST heavy/rock album I have ever listened. Tracks such as ATWA and X touch an more of a sensitive side of the band, but dont worry, they keep their natural stile of playing in every track. Other tracks such as 'Arto' remind us where the band had originated from, Armenia with the insturment used 'doodook' (also originated from Armenia). This is very commendable for a foreign band to I'd recomend this album to anyone that appreciates good music."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Follow up to the self titled cd!","review":"The new System of a down cd is great carring over the same lyrical style of the first album but the music is much harder and packs an even more powerful punch. The musical work and devolpoed lyrics make this cd a definate best release of the year. Make sure to buy the limeted edition with the bonusd footage. All in all a great cd and definatly worth the buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slightly under SOAD's first album","review":"This is a great sophomore album, but it's not really as spectacular as the self-titled first album. I mean, the lyrics are still significant, and the music still heavy and enlightening, but there does seem to be a bit repetition that goes on in some of these songs. And unlike the first album, the second half of the songs do seem to get tiring afterwards. But still, I admire SOAD and I admire this album. The best songs have to be \\"Aerials,\\" \\"Bounce,\\" \\"Psycho,\\" \\"Prison,\\" and \\"Chop Suey.\\" Still, not their greatest album, but it still a likable effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Dead Kennedys of our generation?","review":"It might just be! That means a hell of alot too. It's a shame that that this band is labled 'nu-metal', becuase honestly, this is the most punk rock thing I've heard in a while. Hell, even the singer makes me think of good ol' Jello. I'm not a big fan of radio suppourt but this band diserves it. Some of the best lyrics in mainstream rock.Thumbs up"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best cd's EVER made","review":"I LUV this band and these songs. My friend introduced me to this band, and after the first song i as absoloutely hooked. Wierd enough for kids, loud enough for teens, and heavy enough for adults, this cd will make anyone who listnes to it absoloutley LOVE it. There are a few songs that are a bit \\"bad\\" shall we say (some pretty heavy swearing), but the rest of the songs are absoloutely wonderful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even more amazing","review":"This album is even more amazing than the last album. If you liked \\"System of a Down\\" at all, pick up \\"Toxicity\\". All the songs here are awesome. They are both heavier and more beautiful than the songs on the last album.

It rocks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poltical dullness","review":"In this pathetic excuse of a cd and this band is nothing more than a public enemy/RATM (Which I Don't like either except their first album), Rip-Off without the honest truth of the worldIf this band is against america, then play someplace elseDull and uninspired.Nu Metal is Garbage"},{"rating":"1","title":"I just dont get it","review":"uummmm this is disturbingly bad. This music is what you find in 10 year old bratty kids' rooms along with other loser bands like Linkin Park, Limp Bizzkit, and Green Day.It makes me laugh every time i see SOAD labeled as rock/hard rock. I dont think so. They are nu-metal mixed with some weird Arabic rapping. If you want hard rock get some Alice In Chains.The only ok song is Toxicity. At least they sing and dont try to sound Arabic.So if you like Linkin Park, Limp Bizzkit, and even 50 Cent you might like this.

The song that is the CD's namesake has no identifiable beat. Chop Suey is half-assed. Half of the remaining songs are worth little. There is not a track on Toxicity that is worth anyone's time. System of a Down, a bad band in any case, has not had much luck in displaying their apparently quasi-mystical musical talent, and it remains to be seen how anyone can enjoy System of a Down's music-that which lacks tone, feeling, or any sense of emotion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not thier best","review":"This cd was not thier best but it did have some hard hitting lyrics.

That is especially good for because - although I don't mind it - I'd rather there be no swearing, as I see it as pointless and just to get immature kids to listen to your music. That aside, I'll talk about the Album.Musically this CD- although a tad softer than their self titled- is very heavy, and exceptionally good. The vocals are equally as heavy, although pleasingly weird in some parts. The lyrics tackle things from the Prison System (Prison Song), to Spousal Abuse leading to suicidal (Chop Suey!) to Cocaine Crazed Groupies attempting to change their ways (Physcho). This is easily my current favourite CD, and is a must have."},{"rating":"2","title":"very different","review":"Heavy these guys are excellent at writing lyrics and since rage against the machine isn't around anymore these guys are using they're anti govermant message.

This a good CD, but it lacks the complete insanity of the first one (Sugar, Ddevil, Darts...). The band is starting to head in a more mainstream direction. This CD is good, but I'm worried that they will become progressively more poppish with each album.There are alot of songs on Toxicity, such as Science, that succeed only because of one small section. Science would be a pretty boring song if it weren't for that awesome eastern sounding bit. The songs on the first album didn't need to be patched up to sound cool; they were brilliant to start with.If you don't have the first CD and want to buy Toxicity, do yourself a favor and get the first one instead. Only buy this if, like me, you really like the first one and want more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"This cd really rocks. SOAD has such a unique and energetic sound.

It's incredibly weak! The melodies are in a weird arabic (wrong orientation nowadays, after 9.11) style, the lyrics are utterly meaningless, solos are non-existant, guitar melodies are really primitive and the singer has one of the worst voices I have ever heard with this stupid accent, that he purposely stresses in every song. Besides that, all the songs are prolonged as possible, just to cover those poor 40+ mins of the album with one of the worst cases of hardcore.It's NOT worth a buy, really! The whole album leaves a sense of a group that have hurried their release, just to scrapp of some money on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"simply amazing","review":"Let me say that I have the first album, and love that, and this is just as good. It's got the same attitude and is still heavy. It may have a few more slower songs, but they're just as good in their own way. If you liked the first one, you should like this one, and if you're a fan of hard rock, then you should like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic","review":"The first time I listened to this album I was thoroughly disgusted. Repeated listens did nothing to endear me to it.This album basically sounds like it was written by a band that listened to \\"System of a Down\\" and thrashed out a really bad rip-off of it. Get the band's self-titled album and avoid this piece of garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is what is wrong with music in the USA","review":"If I could I would give this zero stars.

I just can't believe there are people out there listening to this and actually saying \\"Yeah, man.. This Rocks. This is great music!\\" Thanks.

I think the kids in Hanson sang better than this-didn't they???? lol. Anyone who takes this band seriously should be locked in a room with Michael Jackson for a month: showers not included. On the other hand, this band is so funny to listen to, you might want a copy to keep around for when your friends are over and you're partying: this could have EVRERYONE on the floor rolling in laughter by midnight! Big Zero waste of time and money ... A 10 ZERO RATING."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uh Oh","review":"I bought this when it came out because of all the hype, I really hadn't heard them on the radio as yet. After one listen I was disappointed..........and two listens I was pissed........after 3 listens I wanted my money back. The lead singer has got one of the worst, off key voices I've ever heard.

I was referred to this group thanks to their advertised proximity to Slipknot's death-metal grind-core. I also heard \\"Chop Suey\\" on the TV.You can imagine my disappointment, when niether of the songs on the album, was as impressive as \\"Chop Suey\\", nor System of a Down's overall style corresponded with my expectations for it to be some death-metal hardcore.Basically, the songs are not that bad, but ONLY if you're into rock, or some oriental, armenian-arabic mix with horrible and meaningless lyrics and a blend of music styles. However, if you're looking for something heavy and killer, I'd say it's best to go for either Slipknot's \\"IOWA\\" or Slayer's \\"God Hates Us All\\", and leave this album to kindergarden rocker-kiddies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying","review":"This kind of \\"music\\" is just annoying to my ears.

I read some of the reviews on amazon and were more or less accurate to how I feel about this album. The vibrant 'Prison song' starts the show and sets you up for some serious rocking and it just flows from one song to another so easily. Technically they are brilliant Serj Tankian's voice is so unique and hauntingly changes from madness to mellow in seconds. There are, in my opinion 10 great songs on this album but one to look out for (after the favourites Chop suey,deer dance,Toxicity and Aerials) is 'Forest' the drumming and guitars are mind blowing. Buy this album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple but effective","review":"Having not purchased SOAD's first cd, I had labeled them one-hit wonders after I heard the song \\"Sugar.\\" When \\"Spiders\\" became a hit, I was genuinely surprised. When I first heard \\"Chop Suey,\\" then learned it was from them, I knew 3 songs were no fluke. I picked up this cd the day it came out, and I must say, I have been greatly impressed by this cd. The way they can incorporate Middle-Eastern styles into hard rock is amazing to me, and the vocal talents of Serj are hardly limited to screaming. I can't wait to hear the next offering from these guys, hopefully they can step it up one more notch."},{"rating":"2","title":"i'll just add my two cents","review":"i'm sure everyone else is doing the same, but this album is truly a work of genius"},{"rating":"2","title":"The greatest hard rock ever made in years....","review":"and made right! I've been in love with them them ever since the release of \\"Chop Suey!\\" on the radio. So pretty soon i downloaded \\"X\\" and \\"Chop Suey!\\" off the internet. Within two days I had heard it blaring nextdoor, so i hung out for like thirty minutes by a window listening. Then my brother got one of his friends to burn the cd. The lyrics are so smart, and the aggressive beats are aweosme. You cannot be system of a down no matter how hard you try. The driving guitars, the fast drummming, the good bass. It all comes together, and I think the fact that Serj (singer) is arabian really makes the singing interesting. Buy it!

Gee, might as well call your band \\"Carrots\\" or \\"Broccholi.\\"SOAD can rock, no question. Some of their earlier stuff is good, well mostly the insane-sounding \\"Sugar\\" is great.

Other songs are also good, with the exception of Psycho and Shimmy which may be good live, but are pretty boring on the album. Its worthy."},{"rating":"2","title":"S.O.A.D.s best yet!","review":"Toxicity is possibly the greatest CD in history in my opinion. Their song, Bounce, woul make Frank Zappa very proud. Political bands are quite scarce these days, mostly rock music today consists of sex, drugs, and pushing down old people. Prison Songs is widely known for its lyrics ...and law enforcemnt decreased while abolishing mandatory minimum sentences!...

With songs ranging from political hypocricy, to sex & suicide, you might think \\"oh just another (...) metal album\\", but that would be far from the truth. Take the song 'bounce'. In wich they cleverly candy coat the songs true message about sex, with lyrics about a kid and his pogo stick. Then they have their ballads like 'chop suey' and 'arials' wich are so gracefull you wouldnt expect the upcomming mindshaking metal. System has truly outdone themselves on this album.

It'll definitely be on your list of cd's that make you drive about 80 miles/hour on the highway without even noticing. This cd has some heavy material on it, great for unwinding after a long day. There's some serious intensity on this disc that I can't describe in words. I picked up the disc after hearing Chop Suey! and Toxicicty and it's been in heavy rotation in the car ever since.PLUS - You get the bonus DVD with the Toxicity Video and 3 live tracks (Prison, Chop Suey!, & Bounce).If you're looking for somthing heavy, pick this up.

I was anticipating this album very much and was not at all upset. \\"Chop Suey\\", \\"Needles\\", \\"Toxicity\\", \\"Deer Dance\\" and \\"Aerials\\" are flawless, perfectly written songs with great lyrics and great music. The only song that didnt really appeal to me was \\"Bounce\\" because I think they could do a little better with it but the rest of the songs make up for what they lack in \\"Bounce\\". This is the best follow up album I've ever heard with the exception of TOOL's Undertow. Worth every star"},{"rating":"2","title":"fantastic ....","review":"this is a great rock album! It's not nu-metal, not heavy, not trash, not punk ..... it's everything together, all styles mixed up in a wonderful sound! One of the best band I listened to in the last years. Last time I had the same feelings was as I listened to Slayer's \\"Reign in blood\\" .... a shocking experience! Buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What am i missing?","review":"With the exception of Chop Suey and Forest, this album is nothing but screaming over intense power chords....and to me that is not music. How can everyone say that this is such a masterpiece? You want a masterpiece that rocks? Check out Metallica's \\"Master of Puppets\\" or \\"Black Album\\" or Cigar's \\"Speed is Relative\\" or any of the earlier stuff by Led Zeppelin. This album has a few nice moments, but those moments are more than offset by moments of crap. Yes, sometimes Serj Tankian hits a pretty note or sometimes they play a cool guitar riff or drum fill, but there is too much incoherent screaming and angry, cliched death metal nonsense. Too many bands think that in order to rock they have to scream and play their guitars as loudly as possible. Jimmy Page didnt play super loud and intense power chords, and he was one of the best guitarists of all time! You dont have to be loud simply for the sake of being loud to rock, and these guys do not rock."},{"rating":"1","title":"The new system blows","review":"...I only like the first five songs on that toxicity cd and the rest sucks in my opinnion. If youre thinking about buying that \\"steal this album\\" cd, its kinda dumb to buy a cd that looks like it was downloaded style cd. Its worth it to buy it if you dont have a cd burner or a computer. You should try System's Debut cd before you try Toxicity."},{"rating":"1","title":"a few good songs","review":"a few good songs, buy this one if you are going to buy this cd at all, because it comes with some cool features."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best","review":"Anyone who likes Limp Bizkit and Tool but suspects that these guys are basically talentless screamers needs to dig up System of a Down. Intelligent metal isn't an oxymoron...here is an abulm that shakes your bones while stimulating your mind. Amazing."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO: THIS IS CRAP!","review":"DON'T LISTEN TO WHAT ANYBODY SAYS! This album is such a letdown after the first. Even their b-sides are better than this! Ugh! This is the perfect example of a band that reahces their haitus, and figures no matter what they do people will buy into it any way, so they make a horrible album. This album is like Nonpoints Development letdown after their groundbreaking Statement. Bad stuff. Keep away from this cliche trendy little cop-out band."},{"rating":"1","title":"They get an extra star for effort.","review":"I guess it isn't really fair of me to slag this group off completely, as I have never listened to one of their albums in its entirety (I can barely bring myself to sit through half a song, let alone half an hour). So they get two stars instead of one.I just don't like anything about this band. The music itself is monotonous, and the frontman's voice irritates me. As for the hard-hitting political lyrics, I could probably write better:\\"The government is bad.\\"\\"They lie.\\"\\"Arrrgh.\\"Pass this up if you have any respect for your eardrums."},{"rating":"2","title":"metal at its best","review":"this cd is excellent. system of a down shows that you can rock, and still not sound the same as everyone else. in a maket saturated with cry-baby-middle-class-... (see fred durst and aaron lewis) it is refreshing to hear this cd. they are loud, but actually have something to say other than \\"... you, i rule\\" (see fred durst again) and \\"... you dad\\" (see arron lewis). and they aren't afraid to incorperate different instruments and sounds into their music, or have songs that, gasp, no way, sound different. also, they get their point across without the use of constant profanities, showing that if you use that much profanity, you obviously didn't put much effort into your lyrics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Are you feeling amped?!?!","review":"It's just Narley. Only for those days when you're just in the mood for some energetic and bugged out tunes. Inervision and Toxicity are the best song they've ever made yet in my opinion and based on what I've heard from SOAD. I personally agree with some of the reviewers about heavy metal. I feel that it's a way of expressing your feelings on life and it's more passionate and positive then rap. Heavy metal gives me so much motivation at a level where it's consistent about different things and it's very unlike the bullcrap which is possibly the most listened to source of music out there called rap. I usually listen to jazz, but I would rather prefer this over rap any day because you won't have to worry about hearing money, sex, drugs and b*tches all the time. Although, you may also find negativity in this kind of music."},{"rating":"2","title":"What rock is all about","review":"This is possibly my favorite post 2000 band. I mean it is the best metal gets. Its political, hard and down right cool. John Dolmayan one of the coolest drummers makes me proud to be a drummer. Some of the songs were just funny little songs and some of them were angry rock and some of them were just memorable. but i still wish there was osme way to put it all together"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great cd, but.............","review":"First off, I recommend this cd to anyone who likes modern rock. All the tracks are listenable, and I usually go through the cd nonstop. The only problem is that System of a Down isn't all that musical. They tune down their instruments down one step, then just hammer away with no effort. While I do appreciate this album, it doesn't offer that much musical talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as crazy but still good! 4.5 stars","review":"When this record first came out I was worried it would be too commercial, but its not. Don't listen to the hype. This album never gets old, no one else out there can do what \\"System\\" does. They are one of the most original bands, doing your own thing can be hard. With the radio full of bands that sound the same, SOAD is the one different band. Other than the radio over played \\"Chop Suey!\\" the rest of the album is great. If I could give it a 4.5 it would."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb!","review":"Non stop headbanging action. If you liked the first you will love this one, its actually a bit harder!!For the people who are buying this because of the Chop Suey you will be disappointed because that song is one of the few soft songs..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Music fan","review":"This is one of the best albums ever created. If you are into heavy music and also like rock you will love it. It is hard to put SOAD into any category perhaps because they are a fresh stream themselves...I would recommend it to all who appreciate novelty and alternative thought in music. The actual lyrics are not so important. This kind of music would be hard to digest for the shallow mind/taste though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great cd but","review":"I gave this four stars instead of five bc the 6 song on this cd (chop suey) already skips. Other than that it's fine...but that was a bummer for sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"The System Let Me Down","review":"Gave this CD a whirl after hearing so many people rave about it and I still can't find why it's a good CD at all. I'll give credit to the song \\"Aerials\\" because it's just awesome and different; however, the rest of the CD didn't ever seem to lyrically grab me and I got tired of the leader singer's same vocal pattern on every single song. I thought this CD would yield yet another rock band for me to like but unfortunately it seems too monotonous in structure and almost disjointed at points. I hope this band does some more fine tuning and gives more variety in singing style but also in the way they produce songs that can at least be deciphered somewhat on the first listen, not unintelligible until the fifth or sixth listen."},{"rating":"1","title":"quite good","review":"this is a very critical album. the songs like forest \\"why can't you see that you are my child?\\" yeah that's quite a good question... chop suey! is one of the greatest songs ever!"},{"rating":"2","title":"HAVE YOU HEARD...","review":"The two singles you've probably heard are \\"Chop Suey\\" and \\"Toxicity\\", both of which feature very original and surprising shifts in the speed and tone of the music, going from passionate rage to calm sweetness and back again. Be assured, these are not the only two songs like that on the album; it is a CD that deliveres what it claims -- exciting and creative music."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS CD IS THE ...","review":"This CD is beautiful. I can not begin to explain the greatness ofthis work of art that System of a Down has come with. With the masterpiece lyrics of Serij. Shavo's breath taking bass riffs. The melodies of Daren's guitars.The ear-shattering rythms of Jon's drumming. This CD is a must have for any hard rock or punk fan. My favorite song so far is \\"Deer Dance\\". I Highly suggest buying it if not for your own sake then for your ears sake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad, but not that good either.","review":"Well, I bought this album based upon the three songs I heard on the radio: Chop Suey!, Toxicity, and Aerials, and frankly I am dissapointed. This album is a hit and miss. On one hand it has some great songs on it, but on the other a few songs (namely Jet Pilot and X) bring it down. The only non-radio song on here that I have learned to like is Science and maybe Bounce (mainly for its comic value.)The band does have some talent, and they do have a unique sound to them. However, I think that if they trimmed off some of the lower quality songs on here, the album would have been better."},{"rating":"2","title":"SOAD-not your average metal","review":"very interesting band-can be fast and intense, and also slow and moving. The most interesting part of the band is what Serj Tankian can do with his voice, and in songs like, \\"Chop Suey,\\" and \\"Toxicity,\\" you'll see what I mean. Definitely has that middle eastern flavor to it, which makes this album so different and original and cool. All you people who have reviewed this, have no idea what ATWA is about, do you? Well ever hear of a little serial killer named Charlie Manson?..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for loud HARD Rock fans!","review":"of course like everyone else chop suey brought me in.... Well, this is a pretty great band. I think that this is a band that just wants peace and not war. But I don't know. I'm probaly too young to get it. But thats probaly the case. This probaly isn't for everyone. But just try it cause you might just like it. I suggest this to heavy metal rock fans! and I suggest that people maybe under 13 get their parents ok first. But this is a great band!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Toxicity--System of a Down Music CD","review":"The price was right. Fast delivery. My sons like. Thanks. Colleen"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pounding but thought provoking","review":"The first time I heard this CD at a friend's house, I hated it. But after another listen or two, I ended up loving it. The lyrics are insightful and political, and are paired with driving, heavy riffs. The best songs are definitely Aerials, Chop Suey!, Toxicity, Prison Song, Forest, Needles and Science. However, all of them are good and they are the type of songs that will get you pumped really easily. If you like hard rock, chances are you will like this album.( I have also heard Steal This Album, which has some of the unreleased material from the Toxicity recording session. It is very good too.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Toxicity","review":"It's hard to decide whether Toxicity or Steal This album are the better of SOAD albums, but I have to ere on the side of Toxicity. It is short and punchy, has some great riffs and some very intelligent lyrics. It is safe to say that every song kicks ass, and I'm always feeling left slightly disappointed when the album finishes! A great album and should be part of any metal/rock collection.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."},{"rating":"2","title":"Major Step Forward","review":"Let me start off by saying that I didn't care for the last album.This one however is light years ahead of the debut. Sonically it is phenominal, they got great sounds this time out.The songs are heavier and less quirky than the debut. There are some awesome heavy riffs with great grooves, however there are still some of the annoying (IMO) vocal interludes. Basically I tolerate these to get to the cool parts, fortunately those \\"coolparts\\" pay off big. Just saw them for \\"Pledge Of Allegiance\\"and they were outstanding live."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best metal album I own!!","review":"There is one thing wrong with this album and that is it made me like their s/t effort less. Although there is no 'Sugar' on this album it is pure quality from start to finish. The only song i don't love is Jet Pilot because I think its a bit too heavy in all the wrong ways but its still a good track. Best songs for me were Chop Suey, Forest and ATWA.I reckon Serj is the main reason that SOAD are a brilliant band rather than just a good band but every member pulls their weight. In short a modern day classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Toxicity ...Intoxicating","review":"I love this album, it has to be one of my favorite albums in my collection.

Be sure to check out Steal this album out too."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome!","review":"With toxicity, system of a down has really progressed their sound.

I enjoy it from time to time, but I mainly listen to Radiohead, older hip-hop, etc. But this album got me hooked.One day, many years after the release of Toxicity, I decided to check it out. Right after the first track, \\"Prison Song\\", I knew this was going to be a great album. The great riffs and political lyrics basically told me I was in for a treat. And I sure as hell was. Serj Tankian's interesting [but awesome] vocals and catchy guitars and drum beats make for an awesome listen. Check it out.-Jeff"},{"rating":"2","title":"This cd is absoultely amazing","review":"This is the first system of a Down album I have heard and I must say it is one of my favorites. All the songs have words that actually go together thay say SOMETHING as opposed to bands like Blink 182 (everytime i look for you is a perfect example). Aside from the lyirs (which I say can be very depressing), the style of music is awesome and the voice of the lead singer is extremely unique. Can't wait for their next album, but if you're wondering what to add to your CD case next, Toxicity is a very safe bet."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME CD!!!","review":"i just got this cd for my b-day and it hasnt left my cd player since. this cd is so amazing. my favorite song is \\"Aerials\\". the lyrics are so well written and the music to it is awesome. if u are thinkin about buyin this cd, stop thinkin and buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best rock cd","review":"This is just flat out the best rock cd ive ever heard.

Their self titled album caught me by surprise- i liked \\"Sugar\\" and was really shocked to hear that the rest of the album was just as good and better in some places. They had catchy guitar work,crunchy rythms and those intense vocals. Now the lyrics are just annoying with simple phrases screamed over and over. There's no melody in these songs, and the guitar is nowhere near where it was on the last album. The last album was so much more creative. Toxicity sounds like what you'd get if you asked some teenage SOAD tribute band to make some new songs. What happened?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh so disappointed","review":"I bought this release based on the merits of the two singles which made the airwaves. When I first heard them I was psyched that here was a band with a great new sound that was powerful, raw, and original in a world of mediocrity.Then the CD came. Boo.Aside from the two singles the rest of the album delivers the same old same old... yelling and screaming about injustices in the world and overcrowded prisons and displaced youth, blah, blah blah. I couldn't tell where one song ended and the next began. Look, if these guys ever did spend time in an overcrowded prison or got hit with rubber bullets, then I'll raise the rating.. or maybe if they reveal that half their record sales from their record deal go to amnesty intl. then OK they get a four out of five. But c'mon.... Rage Against the Machine did this already. We don't need anymore preaching guys, let alone screaming nonsense about the government."},{"rating":"1","title":"absolutely dire","review":"I bought this a couple of years ago as a mate was going on about them. Big mistake! There's only one really decent song on it - Chop Suey!, which is actually very good, but makes you wonder how a band capable of this is able to fill the rest of the CD with utter tripe.The lyrics to most of these songs are utterly dreadful, a child could write more meaningfully. They seem to be popular with the 10 to 15 age group, and really is you're older than that stay well clear.One star may seem harsh, but I really cannot bring myself to give it two stars, even though there is one song which impresses me. One good song on an album just isnt good enough; buy the Chop Suey single if there is one, and save some cash and disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not all that Great! This cd kinda gets on your nerves","review":"their first cd was ok but this cd really gets on your nerves the constant chage from singing to screaming sucks because the do it so often. I mean the first album was great and then this one pushed the anyoying limitations that the first one only mildley had.

I do enjoy listening to \\"Prison Song\\", matter of fact I love that one, but the rest doesn't do it for me. Why? System Of A Down have progressed. Try and compare \\"Needles\\" and \\"Psycho\\" to tracks like \\"Sugar\\" and \\"War?\\" from the 1st album.

The other two were too mathematically advanced for me at the time as I was concurrently taking Calc II.The material tends to be covered first in some R dimension using a lot of symmetry to get the main point across and then the second half of a chapter will go into the details in R^3.Compared to its glossy alternative this book was more serious.

It tracks the relationship between Wallace, a clever young man of Portuguese-Cantonese descent, and the family's shrewd, miserly, tyrannical patriarch. Perhaps it's a bit of a fairy tale that works out too smoothly in the end. But Mo writes so well about families - and is so good at capturing the magic of people finding somewhat unexpectedly that they love each other - that it doesn't matter. The scenes between Wallace and his surprisingly resourceful wife May Ling -- and between Wallace and his beloved nephews -- are simply a joy to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for my pickup.","review":"I have a S10 pickup with a topper and my options for a bike rack were limited.

But he was a mean harpsichordist as well. And of all composers for this strange instrument, Rameau is among the most prolific and tastiest. His La Poule is a famous piece, and this performance shows why.When looking at a reissue, among the most important considerations is how well remastered it is. Well, have no fears. Have no fear, said the Cat. The sound is immediate (sometimes a bit TOO immediate) and clear. Clean, fresh, and snappy, you can hear the clicks and pops of the instrument and the performer. Sounds great.My only caveat is that 51 minutes of unaccompanied harpsichord can be a bit much. But the playing is delightful, and full of smiles.

The traveling circus element was great comic relief and I laughed out loud at the scene of 3 or 4 little clowns swinging bats to take down a giant villain! I think folks are judging it to harshly based on the quality of the DVD. I admit, in the beginning the aspect ratio is squeezed together to fit TVs and the picture looks elongated, this is annoying.

The film is interesting mainly for the glimpses of how the Trinity/Bambino characters were developed. Do not expect comedy, although there are a couple moments of it. Directing OK but film shows its age and circus scenario will be too exotic for many tastes. Some viewers will find the film more dull than moody or stylish (as the director seemed to intend).

The best thing about this book, in comparison with other books in the subject, is first of all that it provides a highly engaging read, and second of all that it offers a very clear solution to our social and environmental problems - to live within and according to nature's limits.

His story needed telling and if you enjoy and learn from history, you will enjoy learning about him.Mr. Patton does a great job helping the reader understand life in the Korean conflict as well as Vietnam.

This is notable in the Depeche Mode colletion, if only because it was Vince Clarke's only album with the boys. However, he would go on to create better albums with Yaz and Erasure, and the rest of Depeche Mode would move into darker territory. Besides, some of this music sounds really corny and dated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy it for \\"Ice Machine\\"","review":"The only good thing about Speak & Spell is the fact that \\"Ice Machine\\" (best DM song ever, in my eyes) is on it... that is, if you have the version with the B-sides on it. The rest, while catchy, are downright wussy (especially this version of Photographic; go find the Some Bizarre version or a live version). The only other remotely listenable song on here is Tora Tora Tora!

Comparing this CD to Depeche Mode's newer, more somber music, I was amazed at how different they sound now compared to twenty or so years ago--and thank god for the change, too. I know I wouldn't be a DM fan if all of their songs had remained like this.The only two decent tracks on \\"Speak and Spell\\" (or, at least, the two that I didn't outright hate) are #2 (\\"Puppets\\"), a medium-tempoed song with a catchy chorus, and #11 (\\"Just Can't Get Enough\\"), a high-energy, spunky track. The rest are just too cheesy and silly for me, in particular the two \\"pretty boy\\" songs: #4 (\\"Boys Say Go!\\") and #6 (\\"What's Your Name?\\"). I've honestly heard catchier tunes on my old Nintendo system, i.e., Dr. Mario.

They could have used DVD-Audio instead, considering all the trouble they went to creating surround versions. The DTS 96/24 tracks are decent IF you have a newer 96/24 DTS decoder, otherwise you'll get 48/24 output. This same problem will plague the upcoming Genesis reissues as well, you'll only get the SACD layer if you buy the import and that means the videos will be PAL format."},{"rating":"1","title":"buy the import !!!!","review":"If you must have Speak and Spell ( which is quite good, despite being very lightweight, fluffy, lyrically empty early-eighties synth-pop ) do yourself a favour and spend the extra money on the import version. The US version pales in comparison to the original Uk version. There is a great song ( Sometimes I Wish I Was Dead, which is not as depressing as its title would suggest ) that was left off the US pressing, and the extra time was taken up by the inclusion of the 12\\" remix of Just Can't Get Enough (which is better in its original 7\\" mix anyway - over six minutes of Just Can't Get Enough is, well, too much of enough ).

It's simple, light, and rather comically gay-tinged, even though the lineup is all heterosexual. One can even see the leather bar look the band had on YouTube. I second the reviewer who said seek out the version that comes with the b-sides. This record shows bubble gum pop done right, unlike A Broken Frame. I'm not sure about the extended Just Can't Get Enough. Maybe that's something that was added later because I recall my tape had the regular version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super","review":"I have the DVD, and the blueray version has more color and the sound really pops out.

I had heard some negativity from fans of the comic (I've never read the comic myself); and it certainly had the potential to be a flop. But I absolutely loved it! The plot was interesting, the acting was good, the effects were great -- and there was not a boring moment. What could have been a hack, predictable plot was always surprising and interesting.

The story just makes no sense at all and feels like it needed a good rewrite for everything to truly come together and the direction just does help move things along. Other than the great scene in which Rachel Weisz get torn out of a building, most of the special effects are not very good and could have been improved during post production. As for the rest of the actors, only Rachel Weisz manages to give a compelling performance despite the bad script in which she had to work with and Peter Stormare does a great five minute walk on as prince of darkness.

Keanu Reeves literally gives the worse performance of his career in this film and most of the actors around him follow his path.

His fellow co-stars do far more in their parts with Rachel Weisz being the stand out, giving a great performance that has resonance and guts. Djimon Hounsou is good as well but he's barley in the film and Peter Stormare give a great cameo that really should have been a bigger role. Weisz, Hounsou and Stormare give far more acting weight to this lame brain horror movie than it deserved and for that, they are worthy of the praise (Especially Weisz, who does lift this movie above the mediocre garbage it's really is.) but regardless of their worthy acting turns, the movie is plague by a script that really does not make any sense and a director who does not know how to direct a movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cable movie of the week at best.","review":"Horrible Keanu Reeves movie that is with out a doubt the worse film he has ever made.

Not very original, not to mention cliche-ridden. Of course his friend (who is stereotypically geeky and likes to study arcane literature) had to die, just as he was trying to give Keanu some vital information! Of course there has to be a slow-motion scene where Keanu kills demon hybrids, a scene stolen straight from Blade. Of course he has to wear a long black coat.And suicides automatically go to hell?!

Keanu tried is best with a script that was being change almost every day and I think he did well. I will admit that this is not his best performance and I would also agree with the majority of the reviews written that Rachel Weisz gave the best performance in the entire movie (she is that good).

As for the angel, why? why? why? Why the ridiculously cut hair? The characters seemed to be thrown in, all with their slightly different accents or speaking styles.

Watching how they made the part in the beginning when the car hits the guy was friggin' awesome!!!!! Plus, I adore Peter Stormaire, Tilda Swinton, and Rachel Weisz.

Regardless of how much the film may stray away from the original comic book source material, Constantine is an interesting take on the concept of heaven versus hell. For a first-time director, I have to give some credit for what he was able to pull off and I think the special features give audiences a better understanding of him and his intent.As for as the blu-ray features, there's a hefty amount of filmmaking information that will keep movie fans busy for at least an hour, watching in-depth explanations of how the director approached the design of the film and it's special effects gags."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good movie!","review":"very good movie, must have on blu ray. although mine was skipping on my ps3 for some reason. amazon was excellent in their customer service replacing the order."},{"rating":"1","title":"Constantine","review":"A very nice movie.

There is only one outcome to this breath taking plot. Will he get in or will he get rejected? You have to see it to believe."},{"rating":"2","title":"CONSTANTINE raises the bar for HD-DVD","review":"Everyone knows the plot, but some maybe unaware of just how incredible the HD-DVD disc looks and sounds. The bar has been raised and a standard has been established. This IS the best HD-DVD transfer thus far. When displayed over a 1080p television, I dare you to find a flaw in the transfer. Warner Bros. has truly given CONSTANTINE a pristine transfer and a Dobly TrueHD audio soundtrack to boot! I highly recommend this disc for anyone looking for a reference disc for their collection.

Wait for Dvd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining and thought-provoking","review":"Anyone watching this movie must accept it on its own merits apart from any prior expectations. For example, if you see \\"Constantine\\" with the expectation of Oscar-worthy performances, you are almost certainly going to be disappointed.\\"Constantine\\" is an entertaining and action-packed ride, and Keanu is a fitting lead actor for the part. The main source of John Constantine's angst stems from a portion of Catholic doctrine that says that suicide is a mortal sin; thus, he is doomed to hell. However, after committing suicide, he was allowed to come back and try to \\"atone\\" for his mortal sin in any way that he could. This backdrop should allow anyone watching \\"Constantine\\" to appreciate the depth of the plot while overlooking occasional bad acting. The special effects are great as well as believable, and the ending ties everything up nicely with a bow while at the same time leaving room for a sequel.The fifth star is for the fact that this movie is NOT a remake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cool concept, not so good delivery. 2.5 Stars","review":"I thought the movie was ok and had some cool moments.

Hopefully something of worth will be produced in the near future."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie was pretty bad","review":"I've never read Hellblazer before, but I am a comic fan and thought maybe I'd enjoy this movie. I was wrong. This movie had some of the worst acting I've seen, especially by Keanu Reeves and Shia LaBeouf. Aside from that, it contained a storyline that was just too much for a 2 hour movie. It's obvious that Constantine's life is more complicated than can fit in their time slot, so it appears they left many things out and tried to pack in as much action as possible without explaining very much.Overall, the storyline was incredibly boring, and despite some decent special effects, the action was even more yawn-inducing. This is the first movie in my entire life I've ever fallen asleep in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Supernatural fluff piece.","review":"Flat Keanu Reeves vanity project that lacks a lot brain and allot of showmanship with a story that makes no sense and a leading man who can't act the role he's playing. Rachel Weisz and Peter Stormare are about the only actors in the film who give great performances and that's really because they are over qualified to be in a movie of this type. Weisz gives too much heart and soul to her role and Stormare gives a sadistic edge that is way too fierce to be in a movie like this. Both of them are head and shoulders over Keanu Reeves in the acting department and both of them literally blow him out of this film.See it for their performances only because it's the only good you are going to get out of this bad movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unholy Crap","review":"If the Matrix And the Exorcist got together and had a baby and it came out as a turd then that would be this movie. Terrible acting, the worst script this side of Reefer Madness, and an unplausible plot revolving around (sigh) the Devil, a hippy-dressing angel, and a holy artifact found in (What!) Mexico? The only thing realistic about that was how easy it is for illegals to cross the border. Now, everyone put their forearms together and repeat after me: GO INTO THE TOILET, I COMMAND THEE! Now flush."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie was horrible.","review":"Awful and down right degrading horror freak show that has Keanu Reeves redoing his Matrix role for a supernatural tale that makes no sense in what it was trying to accomplish. The screenwriters of this film look like they were making all of this up while they were going along and the cinematography is murky at best. Not even the special effects were up to what they are in terms of what is standard now and you can see how bad they look once you see some of the demons are in the light. Some of the acting is very good with Rachel Weisz doing much more than she should have for this movie but the movie falls on the shoulders of Keanu Reeves and he rather be Neo than a real character.Wait for Video instead of paying for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disgrace to the name Hellblazer.","review":"Dumb down adaptation to the great vertigo horror comic book lacks the flare and the heart of the book and dumbs down the subject matter in order to please Keanu Reeves's fan base. Keanu can't act if his life depended on it and the script is not worth its weight of tissue paper. The acting by most of the cast is almost as bad as Keanu's with the excerption of Rachel Weisz, who gives the only real and compelling performance in the entire movie and to Djimon Hounsou, who is the only actor in the film who does his comic book character justice. Other than their performances, the movie is not worth your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"If Hell wants Keanu Reeves, let it have him and this stupid film.","review":"Dumb, very dumb supernatural thriller that lacks a lot of brains and a credible leading man. Keanu Reeves literally sucks this movie dried with his lack of talent and makes every thing about the movie into a very bad and cruel joke. The director can't even stage a scene with tension and some parts of the movie are very dark to even see what is happening from time to time. The script is horrible with some of the worse dialog imaginable and the special effects are pretty bad. The only thing that this movie has going for it is the performances of Rachel Weisz, who gives the movie more class and dignity that it does not deserve and Peter Stormare, who does more with his small role than Keanu does with his main character.If it were not for Weisz and Stormare, I probably would have walked right out of the theater, that's how bad the rest of the movie was."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time watching this trash","review":"If you're looking for good movies to watch, don't waste your time and money with this one, I mean it's so stupid, boring, bad acting, all the movie is awful that's all what I can tell you"},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst movies starting Keanu Reeves","review":"It's one of the worst movies starting Keanu Reeves.

Keanu Revees is gravely miscast as John Constantine, which is a shame because Reeves could have pulled off the role but with a screenplay that is so badly written, Keanu does not come out looking good at all and makes an complete fool out of himself in the process. Only Rachel Weisz and Djimon Hounsou manages to pull though this mess with their dignity intact and that's manly because they bring far too much acting talent to this badly made film. I suggest you see it for Weisz and Hounsou because they are the only good things about this bad movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time.","review":"Disappointing horror movie that lacks the scares and the tension and inserts a sense of humor that falls flat most of the time. Keanu Reeves is miscast as the hard-boiled Detective John Constantine and his acting is really laughable and down right bad. A better actor could have pulled off the role but the script is a mess in terms of it's narrative and certain things just don't gel in logic and common sense. His co-star Rachel Weisz gives a better performance and is one of the few good things that this movie has to offer. Her performance is much better than the film and she deserves better than the horrible script she has to work with. Djimon Hounsou is ok but under used, Shia LaBeouf, don't asked and Peter Stormare is fine for the five minutes his on screen but he does over do it a bit with his role. The special effects are fine but not earth shattering and it could have been better.See it if you have nothing to do."},{"rating":"1","title":"and now a delux edition ...why","review":"What a terrible movie,Reeves is just horrible and boring in this role.Maybe a spectacle for the kids but I think this film would put most inteligent adults to sleep or just prompt them to hit the eject button.Watching this really is like a trip into hell !!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If You saw this movie, I pity you!","review":"This is a Bad movie from start to finish.Perhaps the trend of tranfering comix books into big screenmovies has begun to play itself out.

The direction from first time Director Frances Lawrence is flat out horrible with lousy direction and murky cinematography and the script is so badly written that you are really surprise by what you are hearing from the actors' mouths from time to time. Out Of all the actors involved only Rachel Weisz and Peter Stormare are able to come out of this horrible film with their dignity intact with good performances that this film really did not deserved.

The direction by first time director Frances Lawrence lacks passion for the material and not to mention professionalism and the script is by far the most offensive thing in the entire film with a very confusing story line that does not make much sense and some pretty incredible bad dialog. My heart goes out to some of the good actors in this film, who does bring their amazing talent to this waste of celluloid especially Rachel Weisz, who manages to overcome the very bad script to give a tight and powerful performance that the movie clearly does not deserved.

I agree with the majority that Rachel Weisz is the movies only saving grace and she's so good that I really felt sorry for her for even being the movie. Her performance makes the movie better than what it really was and that's a miracle in itself considering the fact that the film is almost too bad to watch. Unfortunately, her performance is the only thing that this movie really has to offer and it gets put in the background while the director and Keanu try to rehash the Matrix films into a supernatural thriller that has no qualms in insulting the audience with it's lack of substance and plot.Avoid."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a letdown.","review":"Shameful attempt at a hybrid of horror, action and suspends that cast Keanu Reeves as occult detective John Constantine in an adaptation of the vertigo comic book that loses it's edge and goes for the gusto in flat out stupidly with a boring acting turn by Keanu Reeves who just does not come across well in the role. The story just makes no sense at all and feels like it needed a good rewrite for everything to truly come together and the direction just does help move things along. Other than the great scene in which Rachel Weisz get torn out of a building, most of the special effects are not very good and could have been improved during post production. As for the rest of the actors, only Rachel Weisz manages to give a compelling performance despite the bad script in which she had to work with and Peter Stormare does a great five minute walk on as prince of darkness.

The second half of the film manages to go against what the first half establishes and the last thirty minutes absolutely makes no sense what so ever because it has a certain revelation that makes no sense what so ever and leave you wondering on what the hell just happen. The rest of the cast is solid with great performances by Rachel Weisz, Djimon Hounsou and Peter Stormare which the film does not expand on and the script does not give more time to because it only wants to focus its energies on Keanu's bad attitude than the real actors that are in the film.What a shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hellboy was a masterpiece compared to this","review":"Dimwitted supernatural thriller that is a major bore for the most partwith a dimwitted performance by Keanu Reeves, who is miscast in themain role and a screenplay that is as stupid as it can be.

I will admit that this is not his best performance and I would also agree with the majority of the reviews written that Rachel Weisz gave the best performance in the entire movie (she is that good).

The only three actors who do make it out of the film with there dignity intact is Rachel Weisz, who I agree with almost everybody gives the films only great performance, Djmon Hounsou, who makes a more believable sorcerer than Keanu Reeves and Peter Stormare, who's brief appearance does more for the climax than the stupid gun fight that rips off The Matrix.Too bad nether Weisz, Hounsou or Stormare could have saved this film, that's how bad Keanu and the rest of the movie is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Much Worthwhile Here","review":"Constantine was a big disappointment to me.

Keanu Reeves is Keanu Reeves, don't expect much emotion from him or for that matter much acting ability either. Rachel Weisz on the other hand does deliver the goods with her very good performance but she's literally alone in the good acting department while she is surrounded by actors who are more in tuned with Keanu's style of acting. This movie rip off a movie called \\"The Prophecy\\" and it does it so blatantly that it even steals its climax.I suggest you rent that movie instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really, Really BAD.","review":"Horrible Keanu Reeves action film that is as bad as the word of mouth suggests and then some. Keanu's acting is so bad in this film that he even makes the dumb script with the horrible dialog look good in comparison to his performance. Rachel Weisz does give a great and lively performance but she's the only actor in the film who bothers to give one while the rest of the actors camp it up to the point of nausea (with the exception of Peter Stormare, who was great as the devil) The direction is a joke and lacks coherency plus the screenplay does not handle the subject very well at all with dialog that is horrendous and story structure that literally makes no sense.Thumbs up to Rachel Weisz and of Peter Stormare for at least doing their best with what was handed to them but the movie itself was horrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"absolutely awful","review":"This is easily one of the worst movies I have seen in years. A barely comprehensible mess, with no redeeming qualities."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy and incoherent.","review":"Incoherent thriller that has Keanu Reeves in full matrix mold and making a complete fool out of himself with a pretty bad script. His performance is not very good and he's miscast for the role he is in. The other actors in the film, most noticeable Rachel Weisz ( She does give the best performance in this movie, she is that good), Djimon Hounsou and Tilda Swinton all do better than poor Keanu in there roles and manages to rise above some of the cliches and the flimsy plot to give solid performances but not even they can get pass the fact of how badly this film was made and how incoherent it really is. For their performance alone, the movie gets a star from me but don't expect much from the movie itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"fun fantasy","review":"So, it might not be true to the comic, or be altra horrifying, or abundantly serious... but I LOVED IT. It was refreshing movie against all of the indie film foreign horror remakes that have been hitting the screen lately. What happened to movies being fun? If you're looking for somethi9ng entertaining and you're not Ebert or Rooper (is that the new guy's name) definitely get it or watch it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a waste of time","review":"Lightweight horror yarn that is more fluff than substance. Keanu Reeves was not the right man to pull this role off and the decision to cast him was huge disservice to the entire movie because he just does not cut it in the role. He makes an effort but he just not a strong enough actor to pull of the role and the script he's working with does not cut it as well because its badly written in certain scenes and does not hold itself well once you look closely at it. The visual effects are below par with some of the movie that has come out recently and the musical score is not well done. Rachel Weisz does in fact give the best performance out of the entire film and that's manly because she gives more to her role than the story itself does and a special nod also goes to Peter Stormare who's only in the last few minutes of the film but manages to give a good performance with the little he has."},{"rating":"2","title":"A pleasant surprise","review":"It's possible I've missed the point and, no, I haven't seen the comics but this movie has to be one of the most (only?) enjoyable in the \\"demon\\" genre. For the first half-hour I wondered whether I'd made a serious mistake. After that, I learnt to enjoy the ride and the laughs.I'm now entirely convinced the movie was intended to be tongue-in-cheek, entertaining and stimulating - in all of which it has succeeded. It definitely presses a few buttons and perhaps its detractors' funny bones were bumped a little too hard?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Uh...","review":"Constantine was the corniest movie I think i've ever seen.I don't remember much of it because I was so busy cussing under my breath about wasting $8.50 on such nonsense.

Keanu Reeves proves yet once again that he's one of the authors of how to be a one-dimensional actor (see all the usually mediocre movies that he's done, such as Speed or one of The Matrix sequels if you don't believe me), second only to Vin Diesel (TWO DAYS. dUR-HUR-HUR!!1!111!!1!!). OK, I know I have slightly digressed and should return to the matter at hand. This movie is a desecration to the comic book, the action scenes were dumb almost to the point of sheer hilarity, that lady cop talked like a retard who got turned down from competing in the special olympics, that Satan dude looked gayer than Richard Simmon's shorts, and anyone who spent their hard-earned money to see this atrocity of a film should be entitled to a full refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"most boring thriller ever written","review":"I really wish I had gone to the movies to watch this instead of buying, that way I could have walked out instead of feeling compelled to watch the whole thing to get my monies worth. The plot is fine but the acting is so stilted and the pace of the story so slow that I would prefer to watch paint dry. If a rating of -3 stars was available that would be my rank for this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Constantine: Great effects but no power","review":"The special effects were great; however, the plot was slow moving. I was bored with the story line. John Constantine running around using crosses and other religious items was not believable because he didn't believe in God. He cherishes and has faith in created religious objects but has no faith in God. This is equivalent to making a movie about Spiderman but not having him get bitten by the spider, or making about about Luke Skywalker without him using the force. Constantine's holy incantations seemed like a bunch of voodoo mumbo jumbo. Anyone who knows anything about the bible should know that if you are going to make a fictional work off of it, at least get the core principles down. What was good about the movie is the fact that it showed that you don't have to work your way into heaven. It showed that although you may have a lot of faults, God will accept you where you are in life. All you have to do is accept Him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much worse than I expected.","review":"Mind bending stupid horror film that lacks any form of common sense what so ever with a script that was looked like it was written by a ten year old with dialog only a child could understand and a leading man who is as bad an actor as they come. [...] The special effects are not really good and the direction seems forced in some places. The only performance of merit that this film has is from Rachel Weisz who does much more with her character than she needed to and she does lift this film pass much of it's problems but a good actor can do only do so much with out the help of the director or the rest of the cast and she's basically by herself in this film in terms of good acting.Avoid."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the \\"hell\\" is going on here???","review":"This is a bizare movie. I was raised Catholic and it made no sense on either the theological or fantasy level. God love ya' Keanu, but damn, find some range bro. Very boring lead acting. Lines like \\"I just got attacted by a demon\\" performed like he was asking the time of day.Why was everybody whispering? I can't hear you!! I haven't heard this much whipering since \\"The Sixth Sense\\".I did like this the first time when it was called \\"The Prophecy\\".Enough bagging. It did have awesome FX and the guy who played Lucifer was great!!This could have been a four star movie, but alas, it was mostly a mind-draining snooze fest. Sorry Keanu.

Who ever thought that Keanu Reeve would have been perfect as John Constantine should be fired for sheer in competence. Keanu takes a great role and basically craps on it with his lousy acting. Of all the actors involve, only Rachel Weisz and Peter Stormare are able to transcend the horrible script, which manages to contradict itself in the last forty-five minutes of the movie, and the climax is a horrible joke in itself. The special effects were decent but I have seen better on TV plus the plot is taken from an episode of Buffy the Vampire slayer. They should have just called it Keanu The vampire slayer instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have been called \\"Inconsistantine\\"","review":"After hearing this was the best Keanu movie I decided to go see this movie to see what I thought. But this movie was a complete bore. I fell asleep 3 times during the movie, It did not even scare me, I was checking my watch about 15 minutes in. It's supposed to make you scream, but I didn't. I laughed."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a supernatural feat in stupidity.","review":"To call this movie stupid does not do it justice enough. It's beyond stupid and it's an insult to the people who write for the comic that it's based on. Keanu Reeves literally stinks up the screen with his worse performance ever and the script helps him in spades. The special effects are just awful and the direction is just off center in a lot of places. There are some points about it like the performances of Rachel Weisz and Djimon Hounsou that make this film a little better than what it is but other than their grand efforts to be better than the script, the movie just falls apart in every area excerpt their performances which is in fact better than the film itself.I hold much respect for the efforts made by Weisz and Hounsou but not even divine intervention could have saved this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly scary and horrifying... just not in the intended way .","review":"I saw this movie in the theater when it came out. For the first time in my life, I was part of a theater full of people who began screaming comments at the screen as the movie went on, Mystery Science Theater 3000 style, with not one patron becoming upset.That's how bad this POS is. I did enjoy it, because some of the people in the crowd were really funny and it made this awful waste of time palateable. To this day, my friends and I use \\"Constantine\\" as a punch line.Run, screaming from this \\"film.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumb and unsatisfying.","review":"Dumb and unsatisfying horror movie that is made worse by the terrible acting of Keanu Reeves, who is extremely miscast in his role. The rest of the film is almost as bad as Reeves's performance with the exception of Rachel Weisz, who manages to give a great performance thou out despite the movie horrible script and crappy special effects. I would have paid to see her character in a more serious and better horror film than the garbage that is here.The one star review is for Weisz, for at least giving a great performance despite the huge shortcomings of this film. Too bad that she was not the lead instead of Keanu Reeves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Bad.","review":"Very bad Keanu Reeves film that could be one of the worse films ever made. Keanu sinks it up so badly that he should be thrown out of Hollywood all together and they should include the director and the screenwriters as well because the movie is as bad as Keanu's performance. Out of the entire cast only Rachel Weisz gives a real performance in this movie and she is so good in fact that she does almost redeems the entire film but not even her great talent could save it from the script, which is excruciatingly bad and the direction, which is as bad as the script and lacks focus for what its trying to accomplish. The story makes no sense and manages to go against itself in certain scenes and the climax literally destroys the narrative that the movie was trying to build up.Maybe asking for a competed director and a lead actor who can act was a tall order for the producers of this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical Keanu, poorly written, lots of CGI.","review":"The title says it all.

Keanu Reeves lacks the right stuff to pull this character off and he does make the film worse just by being in it. Rachel Weisz gives a powerful performance that does do its job in keeping you from walking out of the theater but unfortunately, her performance is the movies only plus. The rest of the film just does not know what it wants to be and the direction has no idea on where it wants to go. Not even the special effects are up to standard here and that's where the movie bread and butter should have been."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unwatchable","review":"Bad special effects movie that has possibly the worse performance ever by Keanu Reeves, who almost makes the movie as bad as his performance. I don't know why Keanu was cast in this role but he's the worse actor in the entire movie and Shia LaBeouf is almost as bad as he is and gives a very annoying performance that reeks of stupidity. Only Rachel Weisz and Peter Stormare are able to give good performance in this bad movie and for that, I will not totally thrash this movie but its still not very good and you should wait for cable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth your time.","review":"Really bad supernatural thriller that has Keanu Reeves of all people trying to save the world from the devil and his army in a piss poor movie with a bad script and poor special effects. Reeves comes off very bad in his role and basically leaves Rachel Weisz to not only hold the audience by herself by giving the only good performance that this film has to offer but also to make them think that the movie would have been much better off with Keanu not there. Weisz's performance is the only good quality that this film has and she's so good in fact that you almost forget how bad this movie really is, int'l the script lets her and audience down with a very bad second act that not only takes apart the theme of the film but makes a mockery of it as well.Other than the good performace of Rachel Weisz, it's not worth your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weisz and Hounsou are great but the movie is a huge mess.","review":"I don't know much about the comic but regardless of it, it's still a really bad movie. Keanu Reeves is with out a doubt the worse actor we have around, giving a performance that kills this movie and makes everything about it into a joke. The only three actors who do make it out of the film with their dignity intact is Rachel Weisz, who I agree with almost everybody gives the films only great performance, Djmon Hounsou, who makes a more believable sorcerer than Keanu Reeves and Peter Stormare, who's brief appearance does more for the climax than the stupid gun fight.Too bad nether Weisz, Hounsou or Stormare could have saved this film, that's how bad Keanu and the rest of the movie is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some people will watch anything...","review":"This movie is so bad. Not in the funny way. In the unwatchable way. I love comic book movies. I love Exorcism movies. This movie was worse than Exorcist: the Beginning. Worse than League of Extraordinary Gentlemen.

You've been warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"I'm a fan of Rachel Weisz but not even her effort could have saved this extreamly bad film.

How many times can you kill yourself and go to hell to see the same thing over and over. It was less irritating when the same thing was done in little nicky. Reeve's acting is normally garbage but he gets put in some good movies like the replacements. This time it was his bad acting paired with an awful movie. You need a good ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Other than the great performances of Rachel Weisz and Peter Stormare, the movie is horrible.","review":"Very bad Keanu Reeves horror film is a real look at how much a vanity project can spiral out of control. Keanu Reeves is just out of place in supernatural tale about a private eye that helps a cop look into the suicide of her twin sister. The special effects are not of top quality and the script is too jumbled to even try to figure out what is going on from time to time. The rest of the acting is decent with Rachel Weisz stealing the show and giving this movie more than her fair share of heart and talent and Peter Stormare doing more in his brief cameo that most of the other actors in the film. Unfortunately nether Weisz or Stormare can over come the hack like script which treats their characters and the story of the film as a joke. I like a good popcorn film but this is not one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor and rather too lowbrow for it's own good.","review":"Lowbrow and pretty stupid horror movie that lacks screenplay to not only explains what is going on but a lead actor who can act. Keanu Reeves is the gapping hole that sinks this ship and his performance will be remembered as one of the worse performances ever in a major motion picture. It also does not help the film that the director does not know how to shot a scene and the special effects are bottom of the barrel for a movie of this kind. Rachel Weisz is great but she's the only actor who seems like she gives a damn about her performance While the rest seem like they are sleepwalking.If you love to look at your watch for two hours waiting for this movie to end, be my guess. If you want to save your dignity and your eyes, skip this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Constantine is a horrible movie. The first hour of it is just unexplained occurrences. In a movie, it is good for things to be unexplained at the beginning and gradually explain themselves as the movie goes on, but when it goes on for an hour, you get bored and stop caring about the characters. Then when this happens you can't tell when the movie starts to pick up. Then, no matter what happens in the movie you don't care and it becomes a long boring escapade. None of the characters interested me because I didn't think any of them were well done and as I said before, it needs to explain some stuff earlier in the movie and when that doesn't happen the more unexplained events that go on just add on to those before, so you stop trying to keep track of it all and that's when I stopped caring. It would be a form of torture if someone made me sit through this movie again."},{"rating":"1","title":"This generations \\"Plan 9 from Outer Space\\"","review":"What do you get when you have an actor who can't act, a director who can't direct and a script that is so badly written that you will be laughing your head off at the same time you are throwing up at the pure stupidity of it? You get one of the worse movies ever made. Keanu Reeves performance in this film is so bad, it makes his Bill and Ted movies look Oscar worthy. The direction from first time Director Frances Lawrence is flat out horrible with lousy direction and murky cinematography and the script is so badly written that you are really surprise by what you are hearing from the actors' mouths from time to time. Of all the actors involved only Rachel Weisz and Djimon Hounsou are able to come out of this horrible film with their dignity intact with good performance that this movie really did not deserved.

I am not saying it's the greatest film ever made, but it seems to vibe with all of my likes.

He doesn't appear to enjoy al those ciggies. I'm around dedicated smokers all the time and when they inhale that smoke, they appear transported into a little bit of heaven.

This is not traditional candle burning, it's new age nonsense. Theres one simple test you can use to determine wether a book is reliable. The author has chosen to use the \\"k\\" spelling of magic making it magick. This \\"K\\" spelling was invented by aliester crowley, a drug adict and mental case.

It starts out as creepy from the very begniing -- starting with a black aith a charcoal drawing of the author's face, which is half shaded in black staring right back at you -- creepiest thing I ever saw. On top of that, you're supposedly praying to God or Creator but he tells you that you have to pray to God calling him by a different name for each prayer-- names which came to him during many many meditations -- I didn't trust this book at all and it was in the trash within 2 days. I'm sorry I ever bought this lousy book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ultimate Gum Kit instruction incomplete","review":"Once we figured out that you needed to add a teaspoon of water to the gumbase before you microwave it it was a lot of fun. The instruction say to pour off excess water but neglect to tell you to add water in the first place. My son and his freids had a blast making their own custom gums. I had to help with the kneeding process but over all I think it's a great product for kids who like their gum. You can substitute splenda for the powdered sugar if you want to make sugar fee gum too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!","review":"This looked so cool, I thought my kids would love it. But the gum base is impossible to stir - you need to nuke it for way longer than it says to and then it hardens up and is impossible to work with. It becomes hard and brittle rather than smooth and workable. Save your money and don't bother with this! My kids were totally disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A lot of fun","review":"My daughter (9 years old) asked (and received) this kit for her birthday. After reading the reviews and some complaints about how messy the kit was, I was very nervous to actually do it once we got it. But, while it is a *little* messy, it's not nearly as bad as I was expecting. The food coloring does make it MORE messy - so if you're nervous, start with one of the recipes that doesn't need coloring (or just skip that ingredient! At least for the first batch) She and a friend did this (with my help) and had a blast. They were so proud of their creations and even had fun trying to invent their own names for their gum. The flavor of the gum goes pretty quickly when you're chewing it (and the jury is still out on how well it \\"keeps\\") but I think all that is secondary to the actual fun in CREATING your own gum. They loved it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"This is one of the worst kids products I've ever had the misfortune of dealing with. I can't understand how it has any decent reviews at all. The gum base has to be nuked every 30 seconds because it hardens within 10 seconds of removing it from the micro. Be prepared to throw every thing away that you use in conjunction with it (cups spoons sticks) THe gum tastes disgusting and chemically....my kids are so disappointed and messy and stained with food coloring and we are throwing away the rest of the kit and the gum we made. Please - save your sanity and don't buy this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too much work for gum!","review":"All I need to say about this item is buy gum at the store. way to much work and kneading of gum that tastes like you are chewing on plastic and rubber.

Negg Drop, Techno Says, Poogle Races and Fruit Machine. After about 20 minutes I got bored with the games. You can only earn Neopoints(neopets money) for the first couple of times you play. So I decided that I would buy some food and a toy for my neopet. Well there is only like 3 toys you can buy and 3 items of food you can buy. It's pretty boring. There is nothing else that you can really do. I put it in my junk drawer and havent taken it out sense.

It wasn't a matter of the batteries; it simply ceased functioning. It was quite distressing for my daughter, as she had spent so much time building up the her pet's health, intelligence, happiness, neopoints, and trophies, and they were all lost forever. Because she had put so much time into it and personalized it, she felt like her pet died, and it was a loss."},{"rating":"2","title":"Neopets rule!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I think this toy is very cool because Neopets is the best website in the whole world wide web!

I have been playing on neopets for months and months and when I saw that my cousin had a different one of these things, I went and bought this thing. It is so fun! You have to feed it and play with it and play the 4 games to earn NPs (neopoints, sort of like money) to buy it stuff. You get even get a rare item code to use on the site! The only thing I don't like about it is that if you drop it, 85% of the time it will reset itself and you have to start all over again if you don't have a screwdriver with you and pop the batteries back into place in less than a minute.

Normally, with a lot of CD's, if you listen to the whole thing a couple of times, you pick out songs you like more than others, and are able to narrow down your playlist to the \\"better\\" tracks on the album. Not so with The Matches. After roughly 9 months worth of listening, I am still hard-pressed to pick out a \\"best\\" song on it, because they're all really good. This would have to be one of the best punk CD's I own. Download the free mp3's on their website, and listen to them. If you like the samples, then you'll love this CD too."},{"rating":"2","title":"the Local boys finally go national...","review":"I've been a fan of these guys since the days of the original Locals demo (five tracks with the cartoon cover).

I don't understand why \\"Superman\\" isn't on this, but I can live with its absense (I've got two other versions of it). It's awesome to hear \\"More Than Local Boys\\" with quality production. Why are you still reading this? BUY THE CD!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Get it","review":"The matches rock, no doubt about it. I have seen them live and they are my favorite local band ever. I saw them a little more than a year ago for the first time and I called a few friends and told them that this band weas going to be huge someday. At the time I copmpared them to sum 41 and said they were even better than them and to look out for them. Well check it out, here they are on epitaph and i am so proud of them.

He said it was because they were bad songwriters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Band, Poor Effort.","review":"I love the Crowes -- best band of the '90's. However, I'm still riding the euphoria of \\"Southern Harmony\\" and \\"Amorica\\". \\"By Your Side\\" is so trite. The lyrics are sometimes \\"goofy\\", and mostly simplistic. One song even has \\"na, na, na\\" in it. You almost can't believe that the same band that turned out the above mentioned classics, with their soulful guitar, dynamite lyrics, and truly \\"classic\\" appeal, could produce this latest effort. It seems like they just \\"whipped it out in a hurry\\". Come on guys. Listen to some Zeppelin for a few hours. Watch the Woodstock movie. Even spark it up, if you have to. Then give us something that you'll be proud of in 10 years -- something they'll still play on the radio."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse than Amorica, and that says a lot","review":"This album is definately a low point in their great career. I thought Amorica was the result of them taking too many drugs. I think this album is just the opposite; they are completely sober on this one. I am not an advocate of drug useage, but \\"Southern Harmony\\" was brilliant for Chris Robinson's imaginative psychedelic induced lyrics and the Crowes slightly stoned hard-rock blues. This attitude is also evident on their awesome debut and other great album \\"Three Snakes\\". They lost their grit on this one, complete with over-production and lackluster typical rock and roll lyrics about love. A let down from previous great Crowes albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Album by the Crowes","review":"I bought this album that day it came out, listened to it twice and put it on my cd rack severely disappointed. Every two years since, I grab the CD thinking, \\"Hey, it's the Crowes, it can't be -that- bad\\". And every time, I put it back on the shelf.It come down to this, if you like the Black Crowes and don't have this album, don't buy it. I read all the press when this came out. The album was supposed to be a return to their early days (ala Shake Your Moneymaker). In my opinion, Moneymaker is good, but not nearly as good as Southern Harmony and Amorica. Although By Your Side has the Shake vibe, it is at best secondhand rehash of that album.In reading the positive reviews about this album, I have to think the authors aren't normally Crowes fans. This album sounded like a hollow attempt to reclaim radio glory. If you like radio rock, it might be for you. If you think the Crowes are best when they are experimenting and grooving (ala Amorica) stay away from this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's My Favorite","review":"I don't know why, this Crowes record always seems to get the most rotation, in my car. It Could Be that it's starts strong and finishes strong. It is probaly the most solid of all the Crowes' albums. 'Nuff said."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shows Crowes True Talent","review":"With only owning the Crowes first 2, and what some would call their best albums, I was anxious to get By Your Side. It was only more recently that I learned this album was a forced studio effort. It seems, at times, tight and forced, but the true talent of the Crowes shows through. Even under the... supervision of their record company the Crowes add their personal rock n' roll touch and attitude.. Songs like Go Faster, By Your Side, Horsehead, Only A Fool, Go Tell The Congregation and Virtue and Vice will be classic rock songs. In a decade were manufactured teen pop ruled the scene and record companies were trying to make carbon copies, the Crowes keep a breaming rock generation alive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still rock but too commercial next to the others","review":"The guitar sound is great, the rythm is fast, but the feelings from Amorica an Three Snakes are missing. The Crowes are still the best but I miss their hippie period..."},{"rating":"1","title":"A band on the downside of its career....","review":"The Black Crowes first three albums were great, but I think they reached their peak with Amorica. They have been on a down slide since then, and this cd just continues that trend.

That is a great staff.","review":"Finnaly the Black Crowes are back to what they are doing best-dirty,bluesy rock & roll. Probably the most Black Crowes's fans(including myself) were wondering whether they will produce an album to match the level set by their first two projects. Yes, The Black Crowes delivered it. It is a huge enjoyment to listen \\"By Your Side\\". WELL DONE BOYS! I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO SEE YOU ON STAGE."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Just Dismiss These Guys","review":"If the Black Crowes had decided to rest on their early 90's fame and fortune, they'd still be remembered fondly...but they've chosen to move ahead, and the results on By Your Side are a happier Chris Robinson and some nice crunching riffs...I defy one to find a better riff than Horsehead from one of the Neo-90's bands...and they still kick some rear live!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An \\"all 'round\\" good album","review":"I don't think I'm the average Black Crowes fan as I actually LOVED \\"3 Snakes & One Charm\\", I probably listened to as much if not more than any other Crowes album (it's very close between \\"3 Snakes & \\"Southern Harmony...\\"). \\"By Your Side\\" is in a different vein than \\"3 Snakes\\" as it is a lot more rockin'. No one does the \\"crunchy\\" guitar like the Crowes & the vocals are great (even though the gospel-like backup singers get a little irritating on a track or two). For me, this album sounded a lot like \\"A Southern Harmony & Musical Companion\\" (which was probably their best album)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Criminally Under Rated Album","review":"I have to admit I'm a recent fan of the Black Crowes and \\"By Your Side\\" was their first complete album that I listened to, but not the last. Because of this I album I got everything that they have ever released and I have to say, this one is definately their best. From \\"By Your side\\" to \\"Go Tell the Congregation to \\"Virtue and Vice\\" there is not a minute of music on this album that does not rock. I read a biography of the band at the Apple music store and that writer said it best, \\"This album is Criminally Under-Rated\\". If you're a Black Crowes fan then you'll love this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"If it were any other band, I'd probably rate this higher, but my boys just took a bad turn. I don't know what Chris was thinking when he wrote these lyrics. How he went from the poetic \\"Girl From a Pawnshop\\" off of Three Snakes to \\"Heavy\\" and \\"Kickin' My Heart Around\\" is beyond me. He used to write the best words. Also, the album has too much noise; if they've completely changed their style, I don't like it. Hopefully, they were just trying to get their name known again, and they'll go back to their good stuff from now on."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY AVERAGE","review":"When THE BLACk CROWES FIRST CAME Out they seem Like they were gonna be Huge.They Had a Strong Southern Rock thing Going On.but as Time has Gone on The Words&Music Seem So/So at best.Diamond Ring&By Your Side were My Favorite Cuts on Here but Other than that I Got The Feeling they were Looking For a New Direction&Couldn't Reach that Point.They Are Missing their Edge."},{"rating":"1","title":"retirement is a brilliant idea","review":"Chris Robinson should kick himself out of the band for these lyrics.

Unfortunately, \\"By Your Side\\" is a much worse album than anything they have done to date. Normally, this would not bother me to much, except that I know that any band that can come up with \\"Southern Harmony and Musical Companion,\\" one of the greatest pieces of rock n' roll ever made, can do much, much better. If there is any consolation, it is \\"Welcome to the Goodtimes Baby,\\" which is not a bad little tune. Otherwise, it's back to the drawing board for the Robinson brothers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to their standard","review":"Once upon a time, the Black Crowes were one of the best bands around. I thought Three Snakes... was disappointing, but I think that album is stronger than this one. The songs sound silly, with ridiculous lyrics and strained choruses that sound almost like glam-rock (Kickin' my Heart Around).

There are many handy tips and practical tips, especially for first-timers looking to live and work overseas. But a lot of it can be obtained elsewhere (e.g. from the net). Overall, I would say, if you are after an all-in-one guide / reference book, this is by far the most comprehensive guide in print form I've come across on the market for the American / Canadian market.The key additions to the 4th edition comes in \\"soft-copy\\" in a CD-Rom - the printed version remains more or less the same.

When I heard they were getting back with their old producer, I was suddenly excited to hear a new ICP album for the first time in a few years.Overall, I think this is probably the best ICP album since The Amazing Jeckel Brothers. Bizaar/Bizzar had a few good songs, but I absolutely couldn't stand The Wraith Shangri-la, Hells Pit, or The Calm. I have no idea why they ever got rid of Mike Clark to begin with, but The Tempest obviously shows that Mike Clark is clearly needed to make a decent ICP album. The majority of the songs on this album are great, but I am giving it 4 stars because there were a few songs they really should have done without. But this is The Wraith done right. If they had released this as the 6th joker's card instead, I would have been much happier."},{"rating":"2","title":"Predictable but good ....","review":"Being a big fan of The Great Milenko and The Amazing Jeckel Brothers this is what i would expect from ICP.

He really is. Unfortunately, you really don't get to know him through his autobiography (it was written for the moral instruction of his son, first of all).Half the book reads like a \\"Mrs. Manners\\" column and the other half reads like a resume. Franklin lists all his numerous contributions to American society fairly coldly and not a little pretentiously (but we can allow him the pretention) and fills in the blank spaces with moral and philosphical instruction. ]While he was a great inventor and statesman and had a knack for collecting and spitting out trite \\"truisms,\\" Benny just isn't that interesting a moral philospher.

Thrown together, arbitrary, sinfully pedestrian, this is one book that you can easily miss in your short life. Franklin shows you he's just a regular guy with regular thought processes. He drifts through life sometimes helping people and sometimes taking advantage of them. He may be an early humanitarian, but he is also an early capitalist, and he knows what he wants. Great, so does Ted Turner, but you don't see us going ape for his life story, do you? Franklin was truly one of our greatest founding fathers, but you won't get a glimmer of that from this book.

Also, I couldn't figure out whether certain times he spent in Europe or in the States. He did not write much about his family life. At the end, it jumped from place to place.

It is beneficial to understand the character of this great man by judging him through his own words. There is no doubt that Franklin was an ingenius man and his witty rhetoric further confirms his intelligence. It also confirms his egotistical nature I hate to say.... But I suppose he had every right given his success...Anyhow, I thought the first portion of the book (written before the revolution) was much more interesting that the latter half. Unfortunately the autobiography was never really finished by Franklin. He ends off abruptly during the French and Indian War period and there is nary an remark concerning American Independence, which would have been interesting to read about from his point of view.Still, overall, it's worth the read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boyhood Bio","review":"An interesting book only if you enjoy learning how people in earlier history thought and lived.

He concentrated on overcoming one character flaw such as his temper and worked on it for a month. Then, he moved on to overcome another character flaw.

This seems like an 180-degree reversal from his Batman books, which were somewhat negative on liberal issues (well, justice, at least).But Miller obviously wanted it to be a work on par with Moore's \\"Watchmen\\" - why else waste Gibbon's talent on this book? Perhaps it was a catharsis, because it seems like a lot of venting - against Reagan, against white males, against evil phallic space stations, against ... well, enough said. Read \\"Watchmen\\" again instead. Or why waste time with comic books? Although Moore's stuff is always interesting, most comic-book philosophy is at the pop level.

Unlike most other Michener books which take a locale or topic and follows it through generations and eras, this takes one group of folks on an expedition during the Gold Rush and sticks with it cover to cover. It might be a good introduction to Michener in the sense that it's a shorter read. On the other hand it's a bit different than the approach Michener usually takes, so I can't say that it's a great representative for Michener's status quo. I do think there is a bottom line of...

It is an invigorating adventure story, however if I had just one quibble, the characters for me were a little one dimensional, and the story told in a less complex manner than it probably deserved.Nevertheless a thoroughly enjoyable expose of the spirit of adventure, capturing much that is part of the northern spirit of romantic escapism and self discovery."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This is one of the more entertaining books I have ever read.

I have so high of expectations for Mr. Michener that when he doesn't hit a home run I'm disappointed. This book is OK, it is short compared to all his other books. He only used his old trick once where he reintroduces a character, the one feamle of the book, then brings her back. She was introduced, forgotten, then found stranded in literally nowhere, and rescued by the heroes. Also something different in this book was a chapter of reflection by the author. Many claim the book is about Canada. I sensed very little Canadian, except for the fact that they were traveling through Canada.

My expectations going into reading were quite high, but by the end of this novel I was very disappointed. The story was decent, however the plot was very thin. I had alot of trouble relating to the characters. I could not figure out if Luton was just a snob, or a real caring person that was afraid to show his emotions. The deaths were very predictable, and to be quite frank the ending just sucked! What a let down, Luton just leaves the same day he gets to Dawson like he is supposed to be some kind of hero or something. Luton just made me angry the whole story especially the way he treated Fogerty, at the end I am very surprised he paid for his telegram.

A party of adventurers, including a snob British Lord, a poet, a retired Colonel and a cunning Irishman go on a journey to the Yukon River during the gold rush.

DAP may help with this, but about the same time I also switched to home made dog food, started adding nutritional supplements to reduce their stress responses, so I'm not sure how much this product contributed to their mellowing.

I ordered DAP on recommendation of a friend (I already had a plug-in for Feliway and this refill would fit). When I plugged the DAP in, my dog became extremely anxious. Everything made him jumpy. The training I had been doing was no longer working. At first I didn't associate it with the DAP. I then thought about what might have caused his anxiety and the only change in the environment had been the DAP. I unplugged it and he calmed down... mostly... but not completely. He did not relax again until I removed it from the house. He is now back to normal and training is going great. I am sure DAP works great for some dogs, but for mine (and from what I have read in other reviews, other dogs like him) it had adverse effects."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Whale","review":"This is great to add with your Heman action figure.

The plot is simple enough: Sylvia, the 24-year-old wife of Richard Tebrick, suddenly turns into a fox while they are out walking in the woods. The rest of the story is the tale of Richard dealing with the transformation and his struggle to accept his wife's ego as she slowly loses her humanity to the fox form she inhabits.Is the story a morality play? Fictional essay? Eccentric novella? The last gasp of scandalous English yellow literature? Each reader will have to judge for his or her own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dean Grows With You","review":"I don't own this model, but I do have a Tradition S2.

It gives basic information about astronomy in a comprehensible manner. The book is handy enough to keep with you and with a small penlight you can reference the maps while observing the night sky, easily fits in a jacket or pans back pocket. Additionally I found the mythology behind the traditional western culture naming of the constellations interesting.Only criticisms include 1) as previously mentioned, no star charts for the Southern Hemisphere and 2) wasted pages printing illustrations of the characters the constellations represent. These pages could have been used to add Southern Hemisphere maps or to discuss more then the listed 13 constellations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a shining star","review":"Recognizing this is a $6 \\"First Guide,\\" overall, it pretty much provides what one would expect: a decent dry survey of constellations, planets, and other astronomical features with some truncated star maps. And it's in a slim handy-to-pocket volume. However, two aspects make this guide subpar, even for the price. First, in a few places they did a poor job of updating the 1988 edition to this 2006 version. For instance, we are told to expect another exciting Leonid meteor shower in 1998 or 1999 (page 62). Second, they should make it clear - on the cover - this guide is geared to the northern latitudes. This little fact is buried in the third paragraph of the introduction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't have any information","review":"This book doesn't have any information for the dummy in the astronomy.

There were parts however, that did get into how the eye works and how there are 4 sections of the brain used for seeing (the 4 parts are form, shape, color, and movement) and somehow the brain presents us with a unified experience of all these processes. Also, how the same neuro-pathways we use for imagining an object and actually seeing it are the same. I really enjoyed those parts yet so much time was spent on the subjective evaluations of how this Indian sees the world that I considered it a waste of time. The ratio was about 20 minutes on vision / brain activity and 40 minutes on this Indian's view of the world.

I left it on over night and just applied it with a Q-tip with the end cut off, then covering with a bandage. Killing some of the surround skin was a huge concern, because in my opinion, the skin on your foot is thick enough to withstand it. While I don't know if I would recommend it for everyone, I used a cuticle clipper to cut away the dead layers of the wart so that the medication would be able to kill the wart faster.

I enjoyed looking at her costumes in this dvd and will be in my sewing room trying to recreate the sparkly belts she was showing us. The choreographies are good for beggining belly dancers. I was hoping for a break down of the Turkish dance style here, but there were only two choreographies. No real explanation of Turkish or the raw elements that can be used outside of those choreographies. But I can't get over what a good speaker Sarah is and how fun she is to watch and listen to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought provoking","review":"When i started this book i had no idea that it would lead me to read the next four. two thumbs up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poetry you can understand","review":"Tony's work turned me on to poetry. I used to believe that poetry was supposed to be un-understandable [stuff] with strange cadences, stupid rhyme schemes and bizarre capitalization. Tony's poems are deceptively easy to understand and they hit with the force of a punch to the gut. However, the ease with which they can be grasped, should not lead to the conclusion that there is not a hell of a lot more going on under the surface of these poems. There is. Tony's writing tells it like it is, and makes you think about the assumptions and occurrences in our daily urban landscape.Read these poems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money!","review":"I am writing this review because I don't want another person to read the editor's reviews and believe that this CD is anything but garbage. I am a huge fan of Dirty Vegas, but by far, this is not their best effort. In fact, it took no effort on their part at all. They put a couple of songs from the 80's and 90's and compiled them on one CD. There wasn't any great beats, vocal overlays, or anything to speak of that would have made this CD unique. I could have made this CD at home on my computer and \\"mixed\\" it better than this. Please, if you value your money spend it on something else. Let this CD go to the wayside. You will be better for it. I ended up giving my copy away!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rates Minus Stars","review":"This is a supposed \\"thriller\\" that is actually a dull, dialogue ridden yawner with little action and uninteresting characters. The \\"mystery\\" involved is psuedo-solved in a very unsatisfiying way and the reason behind the murder involved is (to say the least) contrived. I read the descriptions on every box and bag in my cupboard before I resorted to complete the reading of this book. I held out a very small hope that its \\"resolution\\" might be in some way satisfying. My hopes were crushed. I will avoid this author at all cost in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"a very interesting and well written book","review":"This book was a true revelation to me. I've read a couple introduction books in php and tried some more advanced books. But they all stuck to small examples and none of them explained how to code a real life working web application from scratch. This book does, in such way you get totally hooked and can't stop reading.I truly recommend this book to everybody who wants to develop a robust and working web application."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a book for beginners","review":"I bought this book for my first PHP college class. I had only dabbled in PHP, so I was in no way ready for this book. While the book is very large, it fails to go indepth for explanations. I tend to learn well by a book staying with a program and going through into detail what to do and then expanding on that program throughout. This book is only useful for referencing."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this book!","review":"The author covers a great deal on commands and syntax, but the true strength of this title lies in its ability impart an understanding of the logic and numerous concepts behind PHP/MySQL development. I would most recommend this book to those individuals who are comfortable with HTML and CSS, and have at least minimal programming experience. Sharp and dedicated \\"no-experience\\" beginners could probably figure things out as they go along, but it would require some effort. I personally think that's a fair trade for a book that will prove itself invaluable to anyone seriously interested in learning PHP/MySQL development."},{"rating":"2","title":"The pleasure of ethical paradox","review":"Social satire has ever been an interesting and delightful way to discover and examine the basics of human behaviour and believing, both to show the weakness of logic and the strength of hypocrisy of many rules and customs. Butler, in his novel, developes this theme as a XIX century writer can do. The result is a pleasing reading, made a bit difficult by a slightly obsolete style and too much care of details, which sometimes gives some obstacles to thread. An example of how, about half a century later, a writer could have faced the same subject is given by new world by Huxley. The book is nonetherless quite readable, and an example of the high level tradition in which Butler can stand together with Swift."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Out-of-date in most respects","review":"It is interesting to read the \\"Terminator-esque\\" fears of 19th century scholar/writers like Butler. Unfortunately, in the face of today's depleted oil supplies, such fears of machines taking over society may be a bit out of date. At any rate, what surely is out of date is Butler's writing style, which is all \\"tell\\" and no \\"show\\"--the complete opposite of, and in this case vastly inferior to, the Hemingway style of the 20th century. There is only a thin veneer of story here, a thin and slight excuse of a story and then Butler hits us with page after page of philosophical dystopian diatribe. Orwell may have learned a lot from this book which helped him write the masterpiece \\"1984\\", but Orwell did it much, much better. Orwell's story, as well as his dystopian diatribe, were much, much sounder and more described and more plausible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreary and ponderous text makes for a dull read","review":"This book was originally published in 1975 and boy does it feel its age. The writing is dull, flat and mindlessly repetitive. Reading it feels like a flat-footed \\"Dick and Jane\\" story with corns and bunions to boot. I probably should cut this book some slack because the author was probably trying to follow some educational theory of the time where children learn best to read if the text is \\"X\\". All I can say is \\"Humph!\\" Reading this little gem aloud for the first time to my little four-year-old, I had to heavily revise the text on the fly to make it even halfway listenable. The two stars comes from the drawing of birds. My little guy loves birds and loved looking at the pictures. He recognized some of the birds from our backyard.

That fight is continued later in the episode as the team of TAs walk right into the Fakes' trap. The battle concludes leaving the TAs with a sample of the Fakes. The second episode is even more intense as the JSSDF scuries to get the TAs out of Belgistan, but then Yushiro runs off again to see Miharu. Miharu and Yushiro become targets of Symbol, but get rescued by a man named Phantom. Phantom gives them a place to stay and Yushiro gets picked up. The crew of the JSSDF takes off back to Japan and are then forced to take on Armekistan aircrafts with a TA latched to a steel teather. Seeing Captain Ataka trying to talk in English was a very funny part of the subtitled version. There is a lot of funny stuff on this tape that you can only get in the subtitled version. If you can afford it, get it. Its worth it. Action, intrique and little bits of humor. The perfect show."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost there","review":"This is a great series, but like most anime, builds to climax near the end of the series.

However I was disapointed in this vid. Their were less episodes on this disk than the first one and fewer extras.

I would rather buy the Robotech legacy DVD or even Fight Club instead of this vid.Sincerely:David C.

Now however, the TA's have fought in real battle and there has been more action than the first volume- slowly things are coming together. Volume 3 is when you'll decide if you like the series or not though- There is a lot more action and more character development than the first 2 volumes. Although Volumes 1 and 2 seem slow, it is important for a basis for the rest of the series so bear through it! Again, I recommend you rent the first 3 volumes before buying them to decided whether or not you'll like the series. I really enjoyed this series and it took the first 3 volumes to figure that out."},{"rating":"1","title":"I give it a full two stars because of the great artwork.","review":"It offers nothing but mystery. The first volume was left me a bit clueless. I had bought this hoping it would answer some of the questions of the first volume, like what is up with the ceremony, the main charector or even what does the TA's have to do with any of this. It appears to be extremely slow. So far there is nothing much more than talking with a little bit of action in the 2 DVDs. It makes it seem like you need to buy the next DVD for the answers, but they do not give enough episodes per DVD for price and I usually do not buy any more of a series if I did not enjoy the first few episodes, more of less the first 7. This DVD make me feel like I would be wasting money if I were to finish the series. I recommend watching one of the Gundam series, at least that might offer more action, plot or even comedy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie, mediocre transfer.","review":"You can read the other reviews to hear what a great classic of French New Wave cinema this is.My only complaint with the DVD is the narrow-screen \\"pan and scan\\" format, and the sound quality.

It is terribly overexposed, washing out much of the picture detail, and making most of the white-on-white subtitles impossible to read. In addition, (I am unsure if this is unique to my particular copy) the video tends to ghost, and in places appears pink with a moving vertical (this is definately not a tracking problem, rather a glitch with the copy of the film this tape was recorded from).

Michel Poiccard (Jean Paul Belmondo) is a disaffected youth, a sort of French James Dean, who steals a car, shoots a policeman, then goes on the run. Whilst trying to track down money he is owed so he can escape to Italy, he pursues his affair with the beautiful, bird like Patricia by breaking into her hotel room. In a memorable, drawn out scene, the two lovers flirt and fight amongst the pillows, discussing the deeply philosophical and the trite and trivial. The dialogue sequence in this scene is a superb piece of cinematic realism. The detail of Breathless - Michel's white shirt and Bogart style cigarette and hat combo, Patricia's striped dresses, he city of Paris, a sharp jazz score, the doomed forebodings of noir - raise this film up to its position as Flicks magazine puts it: the yardstick of celluloid cool."},{"rating":"1","title":"What an annoying movie","review":"I guess those who enjoy movies from a box-seat of film-critiques find this movie superb, and I kind of get their points. It's a classic in its theme, content and emphasis on the story. But acting itself was centered on one person--the male protagonist. The female character was lacking in her skill as an actress. Also I find it annoying the way most French movies keep ranting about love. Give me a break! Love this, love that, yak yak, dreamy intellectualism and what not.

He is literally on the ground of the World Trade Center after the planes hit and goes into Iraq with the invasion. There is a certain lack of pretension in his style and I feel that the writing and the photos he gives us are as close to the reality of being there without being there.He is not afraid to present himself as a humanist who is in love with the Army, which I am afraid will be far too complex for many who cannot reconcile that idea. His foibles, screw-ups, less than flattering lights are all in there.He says he has not read books of other wars and I believe him. If he did, the style and degree of openess would be very different. Without trying to be poetic or profound, he testifies to the day-to-day grind of trying to make a difference in the occupation of a hostile land.This is as real as it gets."},{"rating":"1","title":"looks better that what it really is...","review":"1.

I have kept this for an indoor toy for the long winter months. Assembly was simple and at this point, I do not need to add the sand to the bottom to \\"weigh it down\\", but I might have to as he gets older and plays with the toy more aggressively.

The set is flimsy, attaches cheaply, and falls over very easily. Without the addition of the balls, I set it up and my 1 year old loved it. I determined that I was going to get a different brand all together because I was unhappy with the order. The balls, besides used already, were very cheap and squished easily.

These 5 pieces went up in about 8 minutes and were taken down in about 5, you cannot ask more than that.

We plan to move it to their playroom as soon as we do some rearranging in there. The boys have knocked it down playing rough inside the hut. It just pops right back. The setup was super easy. If you don't have a room big enough for the entire play hut then it can easily be setup into two smaller units that are still fun. Great buy. I wished I would have discovered this sooner.

It was a good deal for the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a piece of junk","review":"Based on the reviews I had read, I had high expectations for this toy and thought it would be perfect for my daughter's 3-year birthday. She loves to play hide and seek, build houses and crawl through tunnels. However, it turns out the play tent is a piece of junk. Even the lightest breeze will tip it over. Needless to say it can't handle a child crawling through it without getting all messed up. To say it's flimsy is an understatement.At her birthday party, not one of the 10 kids paid any attention to it (says it all, doesn't it?) until the very end when my daughter and another girl entered - and the tent tipped over immediately.I'm kicking myself for discarding the box because otherwise I would have returned it as fast as I possibly could. A huge waste of money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"mega FUN for all","review":"This product is awesome. Children as well as adult children can safely play with product and not damage it at all. If you have a very playful child (or adult) this is the best toy to have."},{"rating":"1","title":"inseam torn/metal frame showing","review":"A little scary. I'm sure it's a fluke,but the one I bought the inside of one tent had an inseam not sewn around the metal frame of tent, therefore a portion of metal frame was available to toddler. Possibility of breaking and small metal pieces was all I could invision.Therefore I sent product back. The other 2 tents were in perfect condition, as was the 3 tunnels, so as I said,I'm sure it's a fluke, but didn't want to take a chance for my 2yr old."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware - Not Same As Pictured/Described","review":"When purchasing this from Amazon Prime (not a third-party seller), the item that you will receive is not the Mega Playland, but rather the Megaland model. It has three compartments and two tunnels but is a a much different configuration. It can only be configured in an \\"L\\", not a straight line like the pictured Mega Playland model."},{"rating":"1","title":"not too sturdy","review":"This product was made a lot cheaper than a similar tunnel we bought years ago - the material is thinner and the construction & seams a lot less sturdy. I don't expect it to last long. The basketball goal ripped off the first day. It's just a matter of time for the rest of it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun for Toddler","review":"My 1-year-old loves this tent.He goes and sits in the ball pit portion throughout the day. He's always loved tunnels so this is a perfect set for him. His older cousins came over and started playing in it and kept knocking it down, so it is a bit flimsy but I doubt it was made for rough play. Again, perfect for my one-year-old who crawls through and sits calmly. Not so perfect for older kids who play rough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Fun!!","review":"WE just got this for our 21 month son and he LOVES it! My sister put it together so easily. And it stores very very small. He loves running in and out of it and crawling thru the tunnels. And the fact you can add to it is awesome. This was a great buy and the cheapest price by far on line!"},{"rating":"2","title":"FUN For Many and Peace for Mom","review":"My 13month and 28 month old love this product. They spend hours playing in the balls and crawling through the tunnels and tents. It is however much better with an extra box of balls. It is wonderful to buy more add ons and build a whole city of tunnels. It also amuses older chilren 7 & 9 when they come to visit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fun but beware of the dye that rubs off of the balls!","review":"This product is a ton of fun for the kids, HOWEVER, the balls that are included with the product have a dye on them that has rubbed off onto our carpet....I now have blue circle stains on my family room carpet that I am still trying to remove."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money even with it being 50% off!","review":"What a bunch of junk! Upon opening the Megaland, I noticed it was ripped at the seam in one area. This was a pretty large rip I might add. After inspecting it more I noticed about a dozen more places where it was ripped. I noticed another parent said the same thing. Now I know why it's half off! Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this toy!","review":"Great for rainy days or parties and when you are done playing it folds up flat. I would suggest that you buy extra balls for the ball pit. I got a huge bag from second hand store for cheap and wiped each one down with lysol wipes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome for toddlers too!","review":"We bought this for my son's first birthday and he and his friends enjoy it. The tubes are short enough that they don't \\"get lost\\" or scared and the rooms are fun to bring toys into and play. The ball pit only comes with 50 balls so I definitely recommend buying more. The mesh and holes in the ball pit wall make it fun to play with on both sides and the little basketball hoop is adorable.My only real complaint is the fabric/stitching. The ball pit has higher walls to keep the balls in, but after crawling through the connector tunnels a few times, one of our walls is coming undone. It's still functional, but the balls tumble into the tunnel. Overall not a bad product, especially at such a reasonable price. This playland takes up a good part of my son's toy room and he loves hiding in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"great fun","review":"Only two little issues with this toy.1. You are gonna want more balls. seriously... order them when you order this product. The balls that come with it are simply not enough. We got a hundred more for a really good price and it made all the difference.2. The basket ball hoop came right off in my sons hands. It wasn't sewn on very well to begin with I guess.Other than that, the seams are holding up well and my two year old loves his tent! I absolutely recomend this toy! Great for rainy day fun or for when it is way too hot outside!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Thing I could had purchase","review":"This toy was a big hit at my son's birthday party and my son still loves to play with these tents as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Toy!","review":"I bought this toy for my daughters first birthday, and she absolutely loves it. We had to buy extra balls for the ball pit, but others than that it has been awesome."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"This book consisted of black and white 2D scetches that lacked any real depth or detail. They are basic and generalised in presenting each period and contain nothing new that you would not have already seen or known about that decade.I do not recommend it to anyone who has a intrest in costume or design, but think it would be better suited as a childrens colouring in book.Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely pics, no writing","review":"They say up front that they (the authors) purposely did not put in any writing to as not to sway our view of the clothing. Alas, that means if one does not know period clothing from LOTS of different periods, one will not be able to identify items. Still, lovely drawings. It will make a fine adult coloring book! (Yes, I'm serious) :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for quick visual reference!","review":"I love to use this book as a quick visual reference while working on shows. When helping a customer, or explaining something to an assistant at our shop, this book is the easiest way to do so. It is so great to have a book where I can flip to a certain date, and have pages full of pictures grouped together to show someone what exactly I am thinking of. We have to work at a fast pace, and this book saves me lots of valuable time."},{"rating":"2","title":"2.5 minute waffles!","review":"It works perfectly. It was a little smaller than I had hoped, but the other features make up for that. The temperature control actually does what it says (unlike so many other waffle makers!), and the 2.5 minutes is as fast as you can ask for. It didn't hurt my feelings that you can store it upright to save cupboard space either."},{"rating":"2","title":"A refreshingly original and unique mystery thriller","review":"I didn't expect to be overwhelmed by this book, thinking it would be the typical albeit entertaining murder-mystery novel. Instead I encountered an exceedingly well written story with a warm, likeable protagonist and a plot that truly keeps you wondering until the last chapter. After reading this novel, I have since sought out and read all of Lindsey's novels. If you like a good, gory thriller, you have to read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"It doesn't get any better, so quit reading","review":"Carmen Depalma, a Houston detective, searches for a bizare serial killer. The search leads her into the world of bi-sexual women and sado-masochism.I liked this book for the first hundred pages. It seemed like a good murder/suspense tale was in the making. About page 200 I began to wish the action would speed up; at page 300 -- with 200 pages yet to traverse -- I gave up. I won't read a book that bores me.A good editor would have chopped out most of the author's lengthy descriptions of odd sexual practices and societies of bi-sexual women and cut this book down to 300 pages. With a little more discipline and a lot of cutting the author might have produced a good thriller.Smallchief"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"The book is really well written and I might be willing to read another book by this author.... but this book is just too ugly.I had nightmares after reading this book, it bothered me for weeks. Read it at your own risk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes Proust read like Elmore Leonard","review":"This has to be one of the most over-written books in any genre. I could not believe the amount of space wasted in wordy, directionless exposition. The author should be cited by the EPA for the hapless trees that needed to be sacrificed to print this junk. Police work has never seemed so boring. The events in this book are built on coincidence and the lethargic will of the author; the investigators do nothing except stand around, talk in copspeak and react to the next transition in plot-which seems light years away to the reader. I truly cannot believe the number of people who rated this book highly. In one of Kirkus' other reviews, they equate Lindsey to Le Carre, a comparison that might ring true if Le Carre was drugged and beat about the head with a hammer before being positioned in front of his typewriter. Mercy blows more hot air than its Houston setting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent! Interesting subject matter-made me think alot!","review":"Mercy starts with a bang and doesn't let up until the final surprise.Lots of fun to read, lots to think about. Mercy was hard to put down. I enjoyed the Palma character.I would recommend to anyone who likes a good detective story. I have passed it to several friends who also enjoyed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read","review":"This was the first David Lindsey book I read and after this one I went on to read many more.

I figured out the plot twist in the first few pages and the murderer as soon as he/she was introduced."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boooooring!","review":"There are very few books, no matter how poor, that I have been unable or unwilling to finish, but this was one of them. I had to force myself to keep reading until finally, I just had to give up. I thought the writing style was pedestrian and there was just way too much of it. And yet there was no suspense and the pace was so slow, it drove me nuts. I totally disagree with reviewers who claim Lindsey writes good prose. There are so many who are better in this genre. Try John Connolly, Dennis Lehane, Carol O'Connell. I'm sure there are plenty more who can write circles around this guy. (Just to be fair, and as a favor to a friend, I'm giving Lindsey another chance and am halfway through his \\"Animosity\\". It's a totally different style, but unfortunately, no less boring. Ho hum!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"vocals are just wrong","review":"Sorry to bum people out but the vocals just ruin this, if you could call them vocals. It sounds like some one mumbling some spoken words under water or outside of the house when I listen to this on my great home stereo. It would have been a better release if they just left the vocals or mumbling off. This sounds like other darkwave/ambient works, Lycia is the closest comparison except Lycia's music is well made. Sorry for the low rating but I doubt this will get much play again and I have a wide variety of tastes, I rarely exclude anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst toy ever","review":"Let me count the ways that this is a horrible toy:If you put an egg in the carton wrong end down it can get VERY stuck and what kid knows to put the skinny end down?The case is flimsy plastic.The carton says 18 months+ but it is a choking hazard for kids under 3...hmmm.The \\"quote\\" on the side is supposedly by a 2 year old - \\"With the Egg-Shape Sorter learning my shapes was over easy!\\" - what 2 year old says that!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"egg-cellent!!","review":"I love this product and my 3 yr old has enjoyed playing with it.

When they arrived though, there was mysterious dust (not just dust from shipping, it was silvery and smelled odd) in and on the carton and it had little plastic shavings coming off all over it that there was no way I would give it to my daughter to put in her mouth.

Rather too much of it is not specific to Great Pyrenees. We have owned several Great Pyrenees and, from time to time, need information from reference sources. This book does not fall in to that category. It can be classified as \\"Read through it once and then never refer to it again\\".There are several other Great Pyrenees books on the market that more adequately describe the requirements of owning one of these large dogs. Andrew Jonson's attempt to address all matters relating to Great Pyrenees falls well short of the mark.This is not a book to recommend to potential or existing owners. Probably okay for children"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant Playing of lesser known works","review":"These are lesser known pieces of Mozart comprising mainly of etudes and unfinished compositions that were rounded off after Mozart's death.Although these pieces are by no means masterpieces, under the wonderful hands of Staier they are given resonance and meaning that confirm the great powers of Mozart as a composer.Of all the pieces, it is Allemende which is the highlight here. The playing is ghostlike. On the fortepiano, the effect is quite chilling and each phrase seems haunted by spirits of the great man himself.The key to all Staier recordings is the use of silence or brief, almost imperceptible pauses which allow the sense of a phrase sink in. He's used this to great effect in his harpsichord recordings of Bach and he re-employs the technique for this recordings of Mozart.In Europe, Staier is considered a modern genius - listen to the Allemende and you'll understand why."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better books out there","review":"Nancy Cobb has some other books out there that I found to be much better than this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it","review":"It was just what I thought it was.

As you might expect, it is not as advanced as the 20Q web site, but it is much smarter than I had expected. I'd say it gets the right answer about 2/3 of the time with \\"normal\\" people and kids. You do need to be able to read to use it alone, but the questions are fairly simple - my 6 year has no problems playing it by himself. It also has some funny (and clean) answers for people with \\"dirty\\" minds.After buying one, I went back and bought 6 more as gifts for kids.

It took an eternity to find. It seems this little pup is the hottest little gadget of the year. It will amaze you. Just think of something and answer it's 20 questions and it will (most of the time) guess what you are thinking. After seemingly unrelated questions, it still somehow manages to get ya. It's witty little comments in between questions will irk you a bit. Everyone in my family enjoyed it....from my 15 year old brother (who hardly saw the poor thing) to my 60-something year old Grandmother. The price is unbeatable (I got it for $10), but I hear that it's on the rise, due to the demand. It's also very conveniently sized. No larger than a tennis ball, this is excellent to take along on road trips. The whole family can play."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent fun!","review":"It was truly amazing that this game guessed our word almost all the time (we stumped it once with some really obscure item choice!)!

Unfortunately this toy is not as smart as the website, perhaps due to memory constraints. The first two things I tried with it were \\"a cardboard box\\" and \\"an alien\\" and it didn't get either one. This is troublesome because the surprise and wonder of using the website comes from its ability to guess even the most obscure and outlandish things (a stork, a game boy). This toy cannot guess those things, so you must ask guests to choose more obvious things, taking the fun out of it.

The whole family loves this thing. It's inexpensive & it's hour of fun! It's right most of the time, but when it's wrong, it's fun to see the answers, many of which are really close. It guessed manatee & seal when I was thinking dolphin. Or vollyball when I was thinking football, & fish tank & hot tub when I thought swimming pool.This is well worth the money, very impressive. I will likely pick up a few more for friends & family."},{"rating":"2","title":"20Q","review":"It's addictive and a great intergenerational activity.

It guesses what you're thinking every time! I think this is a fun toy for people of all ages! I love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty dang good.","review":"This game is cool and unique. The perfect stocking stuffer. BUt for the price, do not expect a genius or anything. I played the game in the store several times and was amazed that it was able to come up with random words of mine like hubcap. The coolest part was that it would ask these crazy questions to make me think it was lost, only to make fun of me and tell me what my word was. The downside was that when I got it home I stumped it 3 times in a row. Maybe it was the magic of the store. The problem comes in that it is hard to answer the questions sometimes because none of the answers fit your word. So you pick the best of the three, and it really does end up throwing off the game. Sorry to break it to you. It is a cool game though. As long as you stay with concrete things that are easy to answer."},{"rating":"2","title":"20Q is fun for ALL ages","review":"I work at a toy store and 20Q has been flying off the shelves no matter how many shipments we get in.

The whole family was out here for Christmas and we spend Christmas day sitting around trying to stump it and amazing ourselves every time that we couldn't! My grandma, Aunt, and I all played it together-fun for at least three generations, and I take it to school now and my friends are always asking \\"Do you have 20q!?\\" We play after tests and in boring classes-the sound turns off so it is not a distraction and it is small enough to carry around in my backpack. It's a great game for family nights and friends alike, and well worth the reasonable price. It also comes in four colors, as far as I've noticed-red, orange, blue, and purple."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of FUN!","review":"I bought this ofr my neice, but all of the kids had a great time with this from 6 to 16 years old.

Luckily for the Conns, that passage led to a mile of unexplored cave passages, then two miles... and exploring Jewel Cave became the Conns' life's work. They describe the exciting exploration (which is still ongoing, with more than 100 miles of passages mapped) with just the right balance of action/adventure, science, and humor. This book is a pioneer of the outdoor/geography genre and is readable, fun and fascinating.-Review by David Bezanson"},{"rating":"2","title":"caving in South Dakota","review":"What an adventure Jan and Herb Conn experienced! I have had the great experience of actually meeting the Conns in person and they are as delightful to visit with as they are in the book.

I cried, I laughed, I was depressed I was extatic! This book was really amazing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A bittersweet novel","review":"This book is a bittersweet novel about a girl growing up in Brooklyn in the early 1900s. Even though her family is poor they still know what is important in life. All the characters come to life in this book. Francie is described from ages 11-16. I like her character better as a child than a teenager. This is a very well written book. I would recommend that every American should read it for a taste of a different life style."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully written story with so much heart!","review":"Wow - this one has been on my \\"must read\\" list for a long time, and I am so glad I finally picked it up. I read it in 2 sittings, and could barely put it down. The coming-of-age story of Francie Nolan is apparently based on Betty Smith's own life - and she is a magician with the written word. Her descriptions of the deepest poverty of Brooklyn during WWI and insights into the minds and souls of fragile yet incredibly strong people are stunning. Her observations about the human condition are timeless. Tree is a real treasure of American literature..."},{"rating":"2","title":"this book is like an old friend","review":"There are a few books that I always, always return to (Gone With The Wind, Rebecca, and others) and \\"Tree\\" goes into this category without a doubt. I don't know how many times I've read it in the 15 years since the first time I read it, but every time I pick it up, it's like coming home again. I have read Betty Smith's other books, and I was disappointed with them. Nothing could compare with the richness of \\"Tree\\". I wish a more recent film were made of this book. Ignore the reviews here that insult \\"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn,\\" because this book is like sinking into a big comfortable sofa for a long talk with a friend you haven't seen in years."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the BEST book I have ever read!!","review":"First of all I would like to say that this book deserves A LOT more than just 5 stars. It deserves the whole sky full of stars,.... and then some!I started reading this book for an assignment in 7th grade and had one week to read it. I didn't get it done though but I loved it very much. Two years later I found it at a library and decided to start reading it again. I got finished with the whole thing and I don't think I'll ever find a book better than it! It just touched the bottom of my heart and it made me cry when I got to the last chapter of it and I would recomend this book to anyone especially people who don't like reading because this would teach them that there really are totally AWESOME books out there and I would say that this is the #1 book in the world!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Endearing Tale","review":"I have seen the video twice for this story and did not realize how much was not included until reading the book!This is a timeless classic.

The book is different from the movie in some of the character portrayals and chronology. The character portrayals are excellent because the poverty mentality is so real to life - some thrive, some overachieve, and some grow bitter. There is an alcoholic father. The reader gets to see him differently through the eyes of each character. Very well written. No sex or violence. No unpleasant graphic detail. For a real experience of the beauty of this story, read the book AND watch the movie. Can't say enough!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this book!","review":"This was probubly the best book I've ever read! It's realistic and entertaining. I'd recommend it to anyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My all-time favorite!","review":"I bought this book in the 5th grade and was absolutely mesmerized by it. Over the past 15 years I have read it over and over again and have appreciated it on a different level each time as I, too, have grown-up with the lead character of \\"Francie\\". If you have ever wanted to travel in time with your best childhood friend, this novel is one way to experience bustling Brooklyn, New York from the turn of the century through the first World War. I cannot recommend it enough and the movie truly does not do it any justice. A must-read for all ages!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Life lessons","review":"It is the first book that I read that really made an impression on me, and I was only 13 years old the first time I read it (That was over 40 years ago!). I did not even realize how strong an impression it made until years later, as I began to grow and mature as a person. I recently (1 year ago) sought out and bought a new copy for my two teenage daughters to read.I identified with Francie's plight, growing up in a 'poor', but rural, area, and becoming 'aware of life' at 13, when I first read the book.Betty Smith's portrayal of a 'survivor' of a disfunctional life and time is 'universal' and timeless. Her poignant reflections of a young girl struggling and learning 'against the odds' are heartfelt and enduring.(I believe she was a strong influence in my love of writing and story-telling)"},{"rating":"2","title":"25 years later...","review":"Francie taught me about America, immigration, poverty, and how hard it is to be an intelligent woman.My mom let me check this book out from the public library in 1976 -- I was 8 years old.

It was recommended by a book club who has just completed it. Great Book-5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down.","review":"This was a great book. I must admit that some parts of the book, some of the chain of events seemed unrealistic and this frustrated me a little bit but it did not keep me from wanting to read more. I was ready to give the three and a half stars until I reached the end, where I was hit with sorrow that the book was coming to an end and the characters had grown on me. The ending had a huge effect on me and was symbolic in that life goes on but you will never forget the hardships and the happiness that made you who you are. From the beginning of the book, I felt attached to the serene 1900s Brooklyn setting of the book and I can only imagine the blend of hardship and morsels of happiness that those times brought to a child and his/her family. I was very sad to say goodbye to the characters in the book and goodbye to life in early 1900s Brooklyn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Wonderful!","review":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is one of my favorite books of all time. It touched my heart in the same way that Angela's Ashes did. To immerse yourself in the childhood tribulations and joys of a time when life was positively brutal in many ways...it makes you appreciate the society we now live in, flaws and all. Wonderful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read","review":"I read this book last month....should have read it while an adolescent.Setting is pre-Depression era about the struggles of the American 'family', some born in country, others immigrants or first generation. You gain a tremdous appreciation for what we have now, AND on so many levels. Social stigmas related to accepting 'charity', the cruelty of those with money against those 'without' and the sheer STRENGTH of the human spirit when facing adversity. THis book led me to examine my own reality and realize how fortunate I am to have all that I do."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I ordered this book as it was my book club selection, very sure I would not find it terribly interesting. What a surprise it turned out to be! This is a very readable, colorful story of an immigrant family in early 1900's Brooklyn. With every page, Betty Smith carried me away to these neighborhoods and ethnic communities. I loved the trip."},{"rating":"2","title":"A compelling, historic novel","review":"I've finally gotten the chance to read this book after many recommendations. It was rather hard to put down, with its compelling plot line, memorable characters, and poignant moments. What I found most interesting was its historic portrayal of Brooklyn as a growing neighborhood and home to European immigrants during the early 20th century -- where the beginning of a developing \\"American\\" political and cultural identity affected the lives of those such as our main character, Francie Nolan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"I haven't read a book in 10 years. My New Year's resolution was to read more books and this definitely didn't let me down.

I analyzed this novel as a realistic one but it's not so gray as most of realistic stories I've read. it has all the emotions 445 pages you can cry be afraid to luagh and to just be happy from reading the book. the main charactor- Francy- She is a wonderfull girl with a lot of imagination and very smart and good I also liked the grandmother - Marry Romely wich is the symbole of the idea that you don't have know reading and writting in order to be smart. she is very good and too smart I know many people who studied in the university but still not as smart as she does."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was a great story of a poor girls life.It was facinating!","review":"A girl born in to a poor family shares her life with us by telling her story.

It was really hard to find in the bookstore, for it was bought as soon as it was brought in...and my teacher let me borrow hers. Anyway, I read it then, couldn't get past the first page. Then, MONTHS later, I read it.....and fell in love with it. It's a wonderful book, full of emotions. It isn't afraid to show the view of real life, with all its hardships and happiness. I love this book so much, I didn't even return it to my teacher! I have to pay her back soon :) I read this at least 10 times! :D"},{"rating":"2","title":"This was a terrific, well written, thought provoking book.","review":"I loved this book! I suggest it for anyone who knows how Brooklyn was at that time.Because both my parents and also two of my grandparents were New York city kids. I am only a 13 year old girl but I have an adult reading level. I think this book had an incredible plot and some of the most wonderfull charecters ever written about. Learning of Francie's life, her thoughts and her pain was incredibly interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Touching To the Heart after many years","review":"I remember to this day receiving this from one of my favorite teachers in the 6th grade (Mrs.Diaz) as a gift. Now, a Sophomore in College, A tree grows in Brooklyn is still my favorite book ever. A really warm story, its so real you can feel it. Really touches the heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book that forced me to think about myself","review":"Every so often I find a story that is so authentic in the revealing of its characters, that I find myself wondering about them when I'm finished. \\"How is Francie?\\" I think to myself...\\"Is Katie happy?\\" I wonder...\\"Does Neely sing just like his father?\\"...as if they are real, and their lives continued somewhere in the cosmos after I finished the last page. This is one such book. Although I found the everyday drudgery of the Nolans just trying to survive a bit tiring, I would often chastise myself with the thought that \\"This is very real for many people, even today...\\" The crisis of poverty and hunger remains with us, and I was struck by my own frivolity as I watched the Nolans struggle to save every single penny. I wonder if I had read this book at a younger age, would my lifestyle have been any different? It is well worth the occasional struggle to complete this novel...for I believe it will impact you internally."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book!","review":"I read this book along with my class and my language teacher in the seventh grade. This is one of the best-written books I've ever had the pleasure of reading. This isn't a book for short-story readers and it's definitely not one for fairytale readers. This book gives a vivid, firsthand account of a young girl growing up in turn-of-the-century Brooklyn, and it deals with all aspects of society, no matter how shocking or taboo they may normally seem. This book describes literally ever aspect of this young girl's life, and I think that the author should be praised for examining the issues that she did and presenting them without the silver lining that isn't there in real life. This is a wonderful book for fans of history and especially for fans of good literature. Books like this one don't come along very often, and if you haven't read it then you're missing a great work of literature."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This is my favorite book of all time. I first read this book over twenty years ago and to this day, I think about the characters often, comparing their struggles to those I have experienced in my own life. I recommend this book to anyone who will listen. If this book touches you the way it has touched me, it will stay with you forever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspired my love of reading","review":"This was the book that set me on the path to a life-long love of reading. I read this book in the sixth grade because my mom had been trying to get me interested in reading, but up to that point, nothing had clicked with me. She said she was going to read it along with me and quiz me after each chapter. It wasn't long before I didn't want to put it down. From then on, I would read just about anything I could get my hands on. I have such a fondness for this touching story and I plan to read it with my sixth grade students as the time frame and subject matter correlate with my state's social studies standards."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is literature!","review":"I have plowed through so many boring books over the past several years, but this one was a real gem. They are few and far between, but when you find a book like this, it makes all the others worth reading to get to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful tale of the people of Brooklyn","review":"This book was really moving for me. I read it in 8th grade and still remember it. I especially loved the symbolism of the tree, that was very moving. The characters are very memorable and the language very easy to understand. Some parts get a little tedious but still a great read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I read a lot of books... and rarely have I had the experience that I had with this one. Usually I devour the language... gulp at it and after I finish a book I find that, although I enjoyed it, I didn't gain anything from the experience other than a few killed hours.This book made me slow down. Instead of reading ravenously through the pages I found myself savoring the language. I laughed, and cried, and rolled my eyes at the sarcasm and irony, and gasped, and remembered, and felt attached to the characters.I didn't read this book... I stood beside the characters and lived it with them."},{"rating":"2","title":"A sentimental Must Read","review":"This is one of the best books I have had the pleasure of reading. It is a wonderful bildungsroman (coming of age story) about a girl growing up in the city. Her father is a loving drunk but her mother is a hard working woman who encourages her children to work at everything they do. I really enjoy this book and read it every couple of years. Definetly worth the time it takes to read it--- wonderful story."},{"rating":"2","title":"An earnest, good book","review":"I read this book three years ago, when I was in fifth grade. It seemed to be the world's best book then. Now a little wiser and wider in my knowledge of literature, I see this book as an earnest, honorable book. One thing I loved about this book was how the perspective of the book grew more mature as Francie grew up. It makes this book a 'happening book', and draws its readers well into the book while reading. Another excellent technique that Smith used in the book is the way she made littel events seem so important and glorious, the way it would seem to a little girl. It is a touching, rich book, full of emotion and feelings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't miss this very special book","review":"As a 17 female I have read this tantalizing book a number of times. Basically the other reviews say it all, how magical this book is, how inspiring, and just plain special. I just wanted to add one thing however, and that is that this book is not only just for girls, my father read it and loved it, and so did my brother. Certain scenes like when Francie goes fishing with her father are drop dead hilarious. This book is a must read for all, old and young, female and male."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting parallels to Angela's Ashes","review":"I thought that A Tree Grows in Brooklyn was similar in so many ways to Angela's Ashes. I enjoyed comparing them as I read. Mainly, I thought that A Tree Grows in Brooklyn had a more hopeful spin than Angela's Ashes, but that Frank McCourt was more poetic in his writing than Betty Smith. If you have read one of these two books, I definitely recommend reading the other, too. It makes for a really interesting comparitive read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Its a wonderful book that will you will find yourself in.\\"","review":"I was in the seventh grade when I first read a \\"Tree Grows In Brooklyn\\". At the young age that I was, I still knew I had read a book that had changed my life or at least the way I looked at things. This is a book that will make you smile and say thats me! And by time your done with it you will find that a little bit of it is a part of you. Since I first read it I have tried to find as many books as a can that Betty Smith has written. I have suceeded in finding only two, \\"Maggie Now\\" and \\"A Joy In the Mourning\\". I have poured over these novels and dread the day that there will be know more left to find. Reading one her books has become to me like sitting down and being very content and confortable. I have had the previlge of reading many good books and understanding them.

I can honestly say that it was one of the richest, most fulfilling books I have EVER read.

This book breaks the definition of a literary classic and goes off on so many tangents that the reader becomes confused as to what the entire book is actually about, not to mention Francie is a one dimensional charachter who shows little growth until the end of the book where she suddenly changes into an entirely different creature.

I felt it was meant to show \\"what growing up in a poor Catholic family in that time period in Brooklyn was like.\\" That's my family background, and it just struck me as some upper-class WASP who beat it out of the brownstones down South at a young age's snobbish look down. The \\"plain\\" daughter got sent to a convent? The daughter who was moving up financially sent her kids to an Episcopalian school? The mother told her daughter it would have been a beautiful thing if she'd lost her virginity to a guy she wasn't going to see again, although wearing her hair down was bad? This is probably my least favorite book ever (I finished it because it was a school assignment.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"AMAZING BOOK","review":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is a great book.

An excellent book from cover to cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull","review":"The novel, A Tree Grows In Brooklyn, was (in my opinion) not insightful, and completely lacked any reality needed to convince the reader of the author's position.The stories of the protagonist making up the entire novel may be uplifting to some, but those crave action or more reality are in for a snore. Of course, while some books really do a decent job of conveying their message without either of the two, A Tree Grows In Brooklyn not once persuaded me of the author's point of view.The novel was written in hopes of inspiring people by leaving out most of the details we need to hear to really understand what life in the slums is like. If you do not want to hear those details then read the book; for everyone else, however, I strongly suggest you stay away from A Tree Grows In Brooklyn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"This book was totally boring.

As I was on my way out of the library (they had no books from the list there), I bumped into one of my mom's friends. She looked at the list, and saw A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, and told me how much she loves the book, and that I must read it! I looked at it and first thought, 1912? How can THIS be interesting? So I started to read, and then couldn't put the book down. I began seeing how much the girl, Francie, is just like me, even though we grew up 74 years apart. I even learned some lessons in the book, and will defninitly give it to my sisters, and future children to read. I love that book so much."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book deserves to be acknoledged as a master peice!!!","review":"When reading this book for a seventh grade book report, I fell deaply in love with it!!! It was all so realistic. I was given a month and a half to read the book and write the report, but now I am finished after four days!!! I love this book and will read it many more times in my life time! I belive Betty Smith Deserves great praise for her work in this book. My heart goes out to the Nolan family. They suffered and worked so much with little reward. The ending is extremely heart warming! Anybody that doesn't read this book will be greatly deprived!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A 'Rites of passage novel, that transcends time.","review":"I am seventy three. I remember reading this book in my early teens. I gave a copy to my daughter, then to my granddaughters, who enjoyed it as much as I did. Fashions and lifestyles may change, but the human condition does not. 'A Tree grows in Brooklyn'is a perennial delight and as fresh as the day it was written. The bitter-sweet tale of Francie, a young girl of Irish immigrant stock, approaching womanhood in downtown Brooklyn, speaks to the heart. On the face of it, this is a somewhat bleak tale of poverty, disappointment and sorrow, but above all, it tells of great love and youthful hope springing up among the weeds. My only fear is that in today's society, where instant satisfaction has become the norm, this book, with its' 500 pages, might seem too long - I hope not, for it is one of literature's truly great stories and a very good read!Rita Southgate - Cyprus"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This book was 9th grade honors English required reading...our teachers beat it to death, and it was really awful anyway.

It wrenched me to it from the moment I read it, and made this book worthwhile to me. It was a wonderful book, but I might have read it much faster if I did not keep turning back to that page to read that quote over and over. It stuck in my heart, and will stay there forever.

I realized that I was not alone in the world when I read about Francie who loved her alcoholic father and had to cope with her mother, who had been so hurt by her father's alcoholism that she was unable to be the mother Francie needed, hard as she tried. Instead, her mother had to figure out how to keep her family together, always a tough job for the non-alcoholic parent.I admired Francie so much, and she inspired me to be strong, courageous, kind, creative, and loving.I am 62 years old now, 50 years after reading A Tree Grows in Brooklyn for the first time, which I re-read every couple of years, and I still remember the thrill I felt as I learned that there were other girls who faced the same challenges that I had to face when I was 12.

I recommend that adults who loved this book as a child return to it. The story of Francie Nolan and her family will most likely have a different, and interesting effect on the reader. Francie is a bright young girl growing up in a poor, but hardworking family in Brooklyn in 1912. Although her life is a constant struggle for money, she still manages to eke out much joy. The novel, which does not really have a plot, is rather a collection of vignettes about Francie's life. While so much of her life appeared to be conspiring against her success, she never, ever gave up, never gave in to defeatism. A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is an inspiring and a sweet story, squeaky clean, one which both young teens, and their parents should enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"It dragged!","review":"This book took forever in developing the plot.

It moved too slowly for me, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"So So....","review":"I read this book for our book club. The reviews for this book got my hopes high before I started reading it, but disappointed me after I completed the book.

If you have no interest in experiencing poor childhood or awkward adultlecense, I would not recommend the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book ever","review":"I don't think I've been forced to read a book so poorly written.

I just wanted to say that this book is not for very young readers: it's maybe just a tad too realistic. After all, one does want to believe in Santa Claus for awhile. This is a book worth reading. It opened a new and deeply moving world to me which I'm not sure I want to explore further, but I probably will because Betty Smith has caught me in her web.

Katie ends up being responsible for keeping the family running because Johnny, is an alcoholic and they can't depend on him for survival. The Nolan's are faced with many problems and hardships, but they are strong and always manage to get through them. Life starts to look up for the Nolan's just as they thought all of their dreams would never come true. This is an easy book to get into because it is very discriptive.

I think I missed some of the underlying messages when I read it when I was young, and I don't think I really agree with Ms. Smith's world view, her political and theological ideology.

Smith does well in characterizing Brooklyn and its inhabitants, from the \\"fast\\" but warmhearted woman to the lonely army boy.Smith accurately portrays the hopes and fears as well as the crushed dreams and ambitions of one young girl looking for happiness in a world full of nostaligia.A time that is past comes alive with glitter and grit in Smith's words."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is a classic for a reason.","review":"The imagery in this book is haunting and evocative.

The writing and the story are so clear it takes my breath away. You should definitely read this if you haven't already."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Book Everyone Should Read","review":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn was honestly one of the best books I have ever read. I was actually a little shocked at how deeply I loved it and how much I didn't want to put it down. A lot of times books written many years ago have a style to them that makes them a little less enjoyable to read. This didn't have that at all and I actually thought it was a new book just written about the early 1900s time period. The story really flowed nicely.One of the things I think that makes a book great is it's ability to change your perspective. This book really did that for me. In the way I think about money and education. I have a passion now to really succeed through college and get the career I have always wanted and I attribute a lot of that new drive to reading this book.In short, this book is an excellent choice when looking for a good read. It is now one of my favorite books of all time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so sure anymore","review":"I have used Bragg's Liquid Aminos (BLA) for a couple decades now, but I'm not so sure anymore.

I am disappointed that John Malkovich has chosen not to be in more mainstream movies, because I immediately wanted to see everything he was in, after watching this movie. (I immediately rented \\"Being John Malkovich\\" when it became available, and was quite disappointed when he was not the protagonist.) John plays a brilliant Psycho in this movie, and plays it very well. In fact, I actually changed my image of him after this movie.

What's missing is the a 12inch remix of Let Me Be the One. It's called the 'dance remix' and was on some 12-inch's with the Philadelphia remix, depending on which catalog number was on the picture sleeve.

They wanted to play with big brother so went right for the wood play structure. They all still use this occasionally (ages 3.75, 3.75 and 7 now) but it is pretty small for them. I would suggest this for 1-3 year olds and only if they don't have an older sibling and bigger play structure to entice them. It is low to the ground, providing easy access to a new walker.

One improvement is that Sonny's character is much sweeter and more likeable in the film than in the book, but the finer points of the story have been lost. The part about the beard, for example, which wasn't just very touching, and funny, but incredibly shocking to someone born in 1964 and had never known a time when beards were downright subversive! All the actors were excellent--but more of the book could have been written into the film.Also, to a previous reviewer, the time frame of the story is in the early '50's--they were NOT returning from the Vietnam War!

That's a particularly sad thing to say after Heroic Trio is one of the best Hong Kong movies in a long time. I'm not sure if I'm annoyed with Michelle Yoeh's prolonged death or her prolonged presence with nothing to do for the rest of the movie, or the fact that the husband is killed 20 minutes into the movie.It's not just that this is one of the dumber Hong Kong movies I've seen, it's also that it had a potential to be really great. It has great stars, it's a sequel to an amazing movie and it just falls flat. Too many places where nothing's happening, dumb jokes, awful musical montages and the fight scenes don't excite me.Nothing really to recommend in this movie.

There is absolutely no suspense. The movies spends 90% of its time with a silly ridiculous plot and at the end when they tried to up the suspense it was a disappointment as well. I'll try watching House Sitter and see if that is more interesting but I doubt if I would even watch \\"Mind Over Murder\\" for a second viewing because it is really really \\"mindless over murder\\".

That led me to this movie Hunter/Prey, since the leading actor had played Batman in that video years ago. I read some of the reviews and thought, \\"What the heck!\\" Unfortunately, this movie was a waste. It had tones of the old Dennis Quaid movie Enemy Mine, but sadly it didn't have the heart that movie did. The plot was silly and the acting was terrible. It's one of those movies where it's not bad enough to turn off, but when you do finish watching it, you'll wish you hadn't wasted the time. There was potential, but I would guess the writing is to blame in this circumstance. As far as Sleep Dealer, it wasn't anything to write home to mom about, but out of the two it was definitely the better movie.

What James O'Toole does well is to weave his personal story and struggles with these issues in a language and context of today. I found this personal view refreshing and move Aristotle's theory to a very practical level. The book is clearly aimed at baby boomers, like himself, who are struggling with meaning and unfulfilled career aspirations. Personally, O'Toole's writing got me to think more about the question of whether all vices are \\"fun and exciting\\" and all virtue is \\"boring\\". The book is easy to ready and allows one to access easily Aristotle's important writings.

Also i didn't care by the end of the book which of the main charters died...i was actually hoping for it . The mere thought of trying to read the others in the series... frightens me.

Every character in the book is a whining sissy. The author repeats a few phrases more times than I would like to read. The lack of creative writing along with the characters whining, irritates me. If you like zombie novels were everyone sits around and sobs about how pathetic and confused they are. Then this is your novel. This book is bad, but it has some good qualities. The second book (the city), however, is just more of the same and worse. I'm 100 pages into The City, and I feel like a chump for giving this publisher more of my money. In both books there has been the introduction of more than a hundred characters, and out of all of them not one is going on a zombie killing rampage.Autumn doesn't compare to other great zombie adventures like Day By Day Armageddon or Tooth and Nail.This is one story that isn't worth the time or money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different","review":"I wasn't expecting what I got with this book.

The hope to carry characters through a cataclysm is one that intreges me. Unfortunatly, although the concept around the story is a good one, the characters are incredibly unsympathetic. They are either bickering or whining, even close moments when you feel that they are going to connect it turns into a confronation. At the end I really didn't care if they lived or died.And the language is unbelievably harsh, yes, I don't mind the occasional f-bomb, but at times it seemed unrelenting.

That being said.... the characters were hateful. Nothing redeeming whatsoever.

I got a chapter or so into it and thought it sounded familiar. I had seen the movie. I really liked the book. I liked that it moved slowly. I think if real people faced such a scenario, they would experience the same disconnect: disbelief in the situation and the idea that rescue would come if you just stayed put and waited. Deciding on your own what to do would be a difficult decision, especially in the face of pressure from others.Moody's story slowly built up to the final confrontation. Anticipating some horrible climax is, to me, good horror. Even after having seen the movie, as I read the story I wanted to put it down. I couldn't. I wanted to see what would happen.I'm hooked.

David Moody is rising star in this genre, and if you read this book, you'll see why. The accurate portrayals of ordinariy people in this crisis is shockingly real.

Much of story is these idiots who hang around a building, yelling at one another, then die. So you get to know a few characters, and then they're dead in a few pages.Gawd.

Maybe it was the large anticipation I had incorporated when purchasing the book, thinking that post-apocalyptic scenarios were \\"my kind of thing\\" (and they still are). However, Moody's book was very poorly written. Not only did I encounter numerous grammatical mistakes, but there was absolutely no connection with the characters. It was almost like, \\"here are the characters, now you must try and relate to them and follow through with their overly obvious situations.\\" I felt no sympathy with Carl's death, or any other middle school -written events that occurred. Overall, this was a terrible book in the sense that there was no captivation whatsoever.

The plot was slower than a turtle swimming in a pool full of yogurt. The characters were boring and I never felt any connection to any of them. The zombies were equally as boring. I grew weary of the snarky way the characters were in the beginning, when they were all still in the one depressing building together. I expected things to pick up after Emma, Mike and Carl struck out on their own but that didn't happen either.One of the best series I've read (zombie themed) was the \\"As the World Dies\\" trilogy by RhiannonFrater. Those books were fast paced, full of action and intrigue and the characters were interesting. Plus it also made you think about how mankind really WOULD react if some similar apocalypse occurred.

It holds many shoes and takes up very little space in my closet. This is actually the second time I have purchased the shoe tree as I decided I needed another one for my other closet. It is very easy to find the shoes I need as the rack revolves and displays all of the shoes nicely. One can adjust the different tiers to accommodate different styles of shoes - pumps, flats, flip flops and varying heights of heels. Easy to keep clean and the base is solid. I have tried other brands [ from Bed, Bath & Beyond] but they were flimsy and the entire tree kept falling over as the base was not solid enough, so buyers beware of these cheap imitations!

She used to just either leave them on the floor or would toss them in a empty laundry basket.The rack was easy to put together and so far have had no problems.

The review that said it was a little too small for men's shoes doesn't apply to us. My husband wears an average size 10 shoe and has no problem fitting several pairs of shoes on this rack. Assembly is very easy and once assembled, the shelves swivel so you can easily get to any shoe. It's also very sturdy and quite large. If I have to say anything negative at all, it would be that it's almost too big to put two of them in one 6 x 10 walk-in closet. Other than that, it is a perfect alternative to leaving shoes on the floor. I would definitely recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does the job and the kids like it.","review":"Shoes were creating a mess on our garage floor so I purchased this unit. It works great, it is very sturdy/heavy. It was super easy to assemble (took less than 5 minutes) Fully assembled, it is pretty sturdy. It does wobble a tiny bit, but that may be because our floor is not even in the garage. The great thing is that it keeps the shoes off the floor and the kids like using it so they are more likely to put their own shoes away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I needed, holds ALL of my out of season shoes","review":"Other than my boots for which I have a standing-tiered shoe rack, this shoe tree is perfect with enough room to let my 9.5 women's size shoes hang without hitting one another.

FM reception is mediocre, although probably on par with most walkman type devices of its class. Perhaps related to my unit in particular, but the socket connection became loose, making it possible to hear through only one channel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a 'SPORTS' walkman","review":"This product is not typical of Sony quality. I can't believe that Sony can sell this product with a straight face. The problem is when you drop this walkman while running or excercising the batteries fly out and you lose all your preset stations. The clasp that holds the batteries in the radio is flimsy and not designed to sustain an average drop. The old Sony design use to have a heavy duty screw that locked the batteries in the walkman and you can drop it all day long without your batteries flying all over the place and losing your preset stations.Why did Sony re-design something that was already great ? There are many better Sports Walkmans out there. Don't buy this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"The CLip STINKS","review":"The flimsy belt clip does not work properly. It pops off continuously.

I couldn't stop watching this well-written, well cast, fabulously performed movie. From the opening moments until the credits rolled, it blew my eyes out. McAvoy is obviously the best known actor to Americans, but the entire cast was STUNNING. Even those with small parts were entirely believable and added their piece to making this one incredible mini series. There was only one tiny misstep and that is why did the police shoot to kill the hitman when they could have taken him down without that? Ah, I guess the answer is that you wouldn't have had such a great time unraveling \\"who dunnit!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE this!","review":"Everything about this is amazing.

Bill Nighy, McAvoy, Morrissey are but a few of them and do not disappoint. This miniseries is loaded with formidable British actors.

I highly recommend this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb, tightly-acted drama...","review":"I wasn't familiar with this drama when I checked it out from the library but soon spent the majority of my Sunday watching this. Featuring a wonderful cast and well-written script, this political-media thriller won't disappoint. I would have given it 5 stars if the ending wasn't so frustrating, but then I suppose how else could have it ended? Definitely not predictable and will keep you guessing till the end.

The language was unbelievably bad and there were lots of passionate bedrooms scenes. Sex was brought up too many times to count. When one of the male characters makes reference to one of his body parts, we turned it off. There is also a gay character. Not sure what other characters say about him because we muted the conversation. My family and I were so disgusted. The story-line was good and interesting.

Well, the build quality sucks but it looks that way in the pictures. Also, it does take 20 minutes to cook a hotdog but it cooks very evenly.Also one thing to note, when you pull the hotdogs right out of a package, they are squarish, not perfectly round. So they don't roll very well until the hotdogs heat and start plumping up. You sort of need to give the hotdogs a turn or two until they start plumping up and rolling on their own. I would suggest buying hot dogs in a different packaging.Overall, good product and makes good tasting hotdogs.

Man this is a classic from the 70's...! a gem from Black Sabbath's vol 4 and I can't understand why Ozzy and Co (Sharon Obsbourne of course) can take a song like this to ruin and destroy it like a pop trash on the voice of this little stupid girl called Kelly (yes with Ozzy but ...) And all for money.If you want to hear the real thing go for Vol 4!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate you all....","review":"It's just a desperate attempt by two failing musicians. Both Kelly and Ozzy have been criticized for releasing this song! Why? Well because they absolutely butchered it! Now I will give Sharon that it was a smart move...but that's all. True, when you just look at what the song is it's a father & daughter song. But that id rather they had actually taken the time to write a new song. And I wonder what the other members of Black Sabbath think about the re-done Changes.Ozzy's music career is in jeopardy and Kelly's was D.O.A. almost from square one. This is just a last stitch effort for two failing artist.I honestly think this is the last song these two will do together.Lastly, Mtv can go to hell for making them both look like complete fools. I hope that this isn't the end of Ozzman. (I do hope it's the end of Kelly though)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money","review":"My sister has this single, and she spends all of her time whining about how she wishes she hadn't bought it. I agree completely. Kelly Osbourne is one of the biggest poseurs I've ever seen in my life. She has an awful voice, and the only reason she got into music is because someone - as a joke, probably - told her that she could make it. I did end up listening to the songs, and I nearly killed myself. \\"Changes\\", which was her only hit, was HORRIBLE. If you want to hear the REAL \\"Changes\\", buy Black Sabbath's \\"Vol. 4\\". This was a sad case of a classic destroyed by a new wannabe artist. I can't believe that Ozzy agreed to do a duet with her. Ozzy, how could you? I cringe just thinking about it. If you want real music, buy anything from Black Sabbath, which is the greatest heavy metal band EVER (only the Ozzy years, though), or anything from Ozzy's first two solo albums.Peace everybody, and keep rocking (to good music, though)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh it works!","review":"This really works and has a great eye on it. I placed this in my backyard under a covered patio facing the rest of the backyard. It went off once because the bug zapper was blowing, so dont make that mistake. It went off once when the neighbors cat was walking across the fence. It went off once when the neighbors kids jumped the fence. Thankfully i havent had any intruders but it is nice to know what is going on out back when im sleeping. Having said that it didnt go off with blowing plants on the deck, but it did go off when the wind blew the potted plant over, which was nice to know because a storm was coming in and the patio furniture needed to be covered. I wouldnt have known if the alarm didnt sound... Personal experiece: Get it, and when you do, play with it, get it set, walk around; check where it will alert, and then adjust to your likings."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHERE ARE THE EXTRA SENSORS","review":"So, I am satisfied this is a good product based on the reviews here. However, I am not seeing any additional sensors. At first I was thinking it came with six sensors based on the name of the product. I suppose this is not so. You get only one sensor. Finally found additional sensors on another web site at $60 each. So, do the math. To fully utilize this device I need to spend another $300 for sensors. That makes a total price of $437. Guess I will keep looking!"},{"rating":"1","title":"never worked for me","review":"I spent almost $400 including extra motion sensors. Was very excited to get it, but as soon as I put a battery in one of the sensors (never even plugged the base in), my house alarm went to trouble. I tried for over a year to get it resolved, but was continually told to try something else (move this, turn on before you reach the house, etc...) I called my house alarm guy and he said the frequency should not be the same, but they conflict for sure. I can't say if this works at all, since I don't have another house to try it out on. Super disappointed. I will say, that when I called, I always got a very nice man who seemed like he was trying to help but never offered a refund or a solution that would work. I bought a cheap unit that didn't work well, then spent a good amount on this and it still didn't work well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well, almost too well","review":"This little device, is inexpensive and very easy to set up. The only issue I have is that it can be triggered off easy. Our neighbor's cat likes to trigger it off in the driveway, so don't be alarmed if it goes off once. I have learned to wait until it goes off more than once, maybe even a few times, and then you know someone is out there. Little things can trigger it off like small animals and very windy days."},{"rating":"2","title":"voice alert security","review":"I bought two stations and two sensors for the outside of our house. I can now hear when anyone comes to the house in both my bedroom and other end of the house. The sensors work great and do not give any false alarms when set up properly. Set up of the units is very simple. Being able to add up to six sensors per station works excellent and being able to have each sensor send signals to both base units is great. The range of the wireless is very good also. I highly recommend the voice alert for anyone trying to protect there outside perimeter."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lesson in caring.","review":"There is no plot to this book. The words are simple (usually no longer than five letters) and the illustrations are full of color and vitality. Basically, children from all different cultures express what they like in the world by saying, \\"I love you, ___ (fill in the blank). For example, \\"I love you, fish\\"; \\"I love you, sun\\".

It is hypnotic and I find myself listening to it time and again. Although I can't get the idea out of my head that it's an album made up of afterthoughts.Some think it's more upbeat,I say it has more of a somber feel to it. The standouts for me are \\"Farewell To Annabel\\", \\"That Same Old Obsession\\" and \\"It's Worth Believin'\\". It has it's high points, but again, to me it's difficult to nail down a vibe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heartfelt and non-commercial","review":"One of my favorite of Gord's albums because he's singing his heart even more than usual.Nothing commercial going on here; no pop tunes, no overt attempts at a single.

Each song evokes a particular mood; just the right memories matched lyrically to just the right music.More than any other GL album, this one makes me feel like I know him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lightfoot's Best","review":"I agree with the previous reviewer who states that this may very well be the best Lightfoot cut ever. In my mind, the music and instrumentation (guitar, banjo, autoharp, dobro, pedal steel) are the very soul of Gordon Lightfoot: Country folk tunes about the day-to-day thoughts and feelings we all experience. Love, travel, \\"chilling out\\", and good-old fashioned clean fun. Yup, some reviewers found the album boring: It is supposed to mellow the listener out! The proof of this is in the lyrics to the classic \\"Hi'way Songs\\": \\"When I walk the hills so high, around the town where I was born; New York seems so far away, though I was there just yesterday.\\" Buy this CD and take a trip back to when \\"...picking with a friend 'till dawn, singing all those hi'way songs.\\" was one of the most exciting and meaningful things one could do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun \\"hands on\\" maze!","review":"This wooden maze puzzle is a good exercise in problem solving.

The regular book is great. It is written in an easily digestible manner while still covering the material in surprising depth. I found the use of figures and illustrations to summarize concepts particularly well executed. I was incredibly disappointed by the Kindle version I bought for use on my Kindle DX. The text looked like it had been scanned from a copy of a copy made on an old xerox machine. Parts of the letters in the text were missing and the general appearance of the text was blurry. The figures did not line up with the text well, and their quality was not good. I want to make a switch to buying textbooks on the kindle. But if the other book conversions are as poorly executed as this one, then I will stick to buying used hard copies. I would rate the hard copy as a 4 or 5 star book, but I have to give the kindle version a 2 for the lackluster conversion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply More Garbage","review":"As advised in another review, after \\"Kildar\\", there \\"action\\" moves further and further away - with each succeeding book - away from The Valley (Kildar's personal little feudal kingdom).Rather than \\"re-invent the wheel\\", would simply point readers to my other (1-star) my reviews in this series of trash (and poor writing at that!)JR was so much better when involved in co-authoring books with well renown top level Sci-Fi authors.

The Choosers of the Slain is one of the books in his series about Ghost, who is ex military, going to college (UGA) on the GI Bill and comes face to face with a jihad plot. The entire series (five books) is action packed, and great reading. I thoroughly enjoy his writing and recommend him to everyone. In fact, I'm reading another of his books (a different series) now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ok, but not as good as the others","review":"Choosers of the Slain is a decent book and a slightly new departure for the Paladin of Shadows series, as Mike takes to tracking a stolen womam through the western European white slave trade with the aid of a squad of his Keldara retrainers. The core store is sound and like the second book, it is a single story rather then three short stories the way the first book was. As with the other two books in the series, there are some fairly graphic sex scenes - a bit too much for my personal tastes as it happens - and lots of guns, violence, and women. Overall I enjoyed the book a great deal, but I do have to say that it wasn't as good as either the first or second book of the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brain candy","review":"Yes, this book is brain candy. Potato chips for the mind. So what? Not every book has to be freakin' \\"War and Peace\\". Mr. Ringo gives us the ultimate adolescent fantasy -- a super-warrior with a harem, his own band of warriors, all the weapons & gadgets he wants, Presidential support, his own brewery, and millions of dollars. (Having read what I just wrote, I feel a strong urge to shout, \\"Dude! Chicks and money and guns! And beer!Awesome!\\" I'll try to restrain myself. Heh.)While the sex scenes are a bit overdone, the novel itself is quite enjoyable. I read it while stuck in an 8-hour plane ride; and I must say it was very entertaining.

This Peel Session is more an extension of that than anything. I liked the minor additions to Aquarius, and the Olson revamp is quite soothing, yet short. Happy Cycling is a track I had already on the album, but a great addition, no less. Perhaps the excellence of this release could have been helped by the addition of \\"XYZ\\", which was also recorded for that session. If you are looking to be blown away, look elsewhere; if you are looking for a couple new (yet familiar) tracks, this is the one for you. A definite \\"A+\\" for content, but a \\"C\\" for effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"A ripoff, $12 is too much to pay for a single.","review":"Although containing 3 songs, this disc is essentially a single. 'Aquarius' is a less-polished but nearly identical to the album version from 'Music has the Right to Children.' Similarly, 'Olsen' is simply a longer rendition from the album.The only remarkable track is 'Happy Cycling,' which is a really nifty hip-hop-ish mix of the non-existant track 18 from 'Music has the Right to Children.'This disc is worth owning for 'Happy Cycling,' but try to find a cheap second-hand copy instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shoegazers, get this album!!","review":"Very dreamy, shoe-gazer pop reminiscient of Catherine Wheel (in fact, the lead vocals sounds very much like Rob Dickinson's hushed vocals on \\"Ferment\\" 15 years prior), only with tighter beats and more dramatic drone where appropriate.

I love the books. I just sometimes find it a bit strange that the mysteries from Québec *always* link back to North or South Carolina. But I have to say I'm glad, as Pat Conroy was the only person writing mainstream fiction set in that neck of the woods.The sense of place in these stories is remarkable, with just the right evocative details. The characters are finely-drawn and the plotting is rock-solid. The tension is just perfect. I recently buzzed right through my first two Reichs books with a great deal of pleasure. A very good read indeed.As a side note, I was a bit startled to find *myself* in this book. I've used the name Ivy Lee online for years, and I lived, until quite recently, near Beaufort, SC.

There were four people inside the house, all burned alive. As Tempe investigates, she is greatly disturbed to discover a possible \\"cult\\" connection. In this fast-paced novel of thrills and murders, Reichs takes readers on a hunt from Quebec, Canada to North Carolina to try to stop this group of evil cult members before they kill again. The only part that I didn't like about this novel was that in Tempe's free time, she investigated a century year old remains of some religious member at a local church. That part could have been cut of the novel. Overall, \\"Death DeJour\\" is a worthwile read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book but slow start","review":"The book was extremely good with its careful detail to scientific facts.

I think that she had a lot of knowledge and did a lot of research to write this book, but the plot is really slow. There are too much coincidents and some plots just don't connect. What makes it even worse is that the auther tried to connect what seemed so far-fetched plots. After we learned about some cult culture and main characters, the author had to use one sentence as a whole paragraph to explain how the story fitted into her research. At the end of the book, we just got all the expaination of the whole plots and how every character fits in the whole story. I hated this kind of spoon-fed story. I also don't care much about Dr. Tempe Brenna. Too bad for me.

I have absolutely nothing against a female lead having a love interest, but it seems quite obvious that the author is not only inexperienced but also uncomfortable when it comes to writing love scenes. Oh well... Romance sells, I suppose, even if it's poorly written. The only good thing about the clumsy description is that we are spared the \\"insert tab A in slot B\\" part.The only plausible - and hence best - part of the story was the plotline about the old bones in the church, and that took up maybe 50 pages of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A page-turner with ALOT of details on human putrefaction","review":"I got hooked on the storyline despite the repellant descriptions of decaying bodies and maggots.

A recommended alternative to Patricia Cromwell's Kay Scarpetta, whose plots and charaterizations are getting weaker and weaker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Abridged","review":"The info on this audio book, Death du Jour (received from bordeebook), didn't indicate that it is abridged. I didn't like it much, partly due to her poor use of similes, partly because I got tired of the plot development. I didn't listen to the last 45 minutes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating science; now I'm hooked on Kathy Reichs","review":"If you like the science behind forensic pathology, you'll get hooked on Kathy Reichs reading this book. The plot and characters seem rather unlikely - but no more so than most of the classic mystery writers - and the book carries you along rapidly. I read this in one sitting - I recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Read","review":"This is the second in the Tempe series, and it was not quite as good as the first. The story line tying where she worked in the winter to where she worked in the summer was just too coincidental for my taste. Made it unbelievable. But her forensic writing was still on top. Nobody does that better. No gratuitous gore! Overall, still a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Didn't skip one page of this book!","review":"As a skimmer who can usually finish a book in a few hours, this book was the exception. The plot was well contrived, the characters highly developed and the ending not expected. Superb!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Most enjoyable entertainment","review":"Quite often a second book after a very succesful first one is a dissapointment. This one isn't!Ms Reichs turns out to be a real good writer. Even though the plot is by far not as strong and tight as her first novel, the writing is good enough to keep you on the edge of your seat; by times witty, by times reflecting and a good solid portion of well written thrilling scenes.I am as a reader quite happy to share the feelings Temperance has but I am also glad that we are not taken on the long soul searching journeys that her literary rival, Kay Scarpetta, takes us all the time.I hope the third novel is just as good and highly recommend this one for a quiet weekend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Turgid, nay, tedious","review":"Oh dear. Another person steeped in his art/job/hobby writes a book so as to be able to brain-dump his hard-earned skill in the guise of literature on the hapless reader.This is a very poor novel. It is peppered with irritating coincidences and has long turgid passages that require teeth-gritting determination to wade through.In my opinion the heroine is unlikable and her angst fabricated in an attempt to give her some depth ... a device which to my mind fails. This is an attempt to out Cornwell Cornwell. Trouble is that Cornwell got there first and in the process exhausted the genre so that most people I know who were fans are now equally fed-up with her output.Perhaps it is a little unfair to denigrate Reichs because Cornwell's mother-lode is exhausted but even so, Reichs just don't cut it for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"not bad","review":"This book is not bad, but it needs a little more work. She has a good start on her characters, but they need a little more work so that they have more depth or something as they seem a little superficial. Maybe it is because I have read and enjoyed so many of Patricia Cornwell's books and, as they are both about a woman who is in forensics or pathology, I unconsciously compare them and I shouldn't because they are very different heroines.The book is about a woman who splits her time between Canada and North Carolina who examines dead bodies. A lot of the story has been told by the other reviewers so I won't go into too much detail except to say that she looks into the death of a century old woman that nuns want to make into a saint and many mysterious deaths that are extremely gory. It keeps you on your toes and is packed full of murder and hayhem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Ground","review":"I thought Kathy Reich's first book \\"Deja Dead\\" was a quick, fun read, but a little sloppy. Given that the killer kept changing the method by which he killed, it was a wonder that Tempe Brennan actually solved the crime. (Aren't serial killers supposed to be consistant?) Anyway, the atmosphere was good and I'm a sucker for anything about Montreal. Which leads me to \\"Death du Jour.\\" What a surprise to find Ms. Reich in such firm command of the genre in just her second book. She juggles several (try five) different story lines so successfully, you would think this was fifth or sixth in the series. Brava! I dare you to put this one down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great book","review":"I really like Reich's style. The fact that she's a real life forensic anthropoligist gives great credence to her work. I've read all 3 of her books and each is just as interesting as the previous.I hope to read more about her undercover friend in future publications. Just like Kay Scarpetta, she needs a social life!"},{"rating":"2","title":"this series has hit its stride","review":"I really enjoyed Dead du Jour. It's a classic multi-murder mystery with a smart, interesting female protagonist. Brennan is a forensic anthropologist who is a professor in North Carolina and who works for the police in Canada. The setting changes between Canada and North Carolina, which gives a nice variety of outside influences on the plot (ice storms in Canada, a swampy monkey island in NC). There is a love angle between Brennan and a Canadian detective, Ryan (Will they or won't they?!) There is an interesting subplot about the bones of a nun that the Church wants Brennan to dig up and analyze. If you read the first novel in the Brennan series, you will certainly like this novel--it's even better. Brennan gets along with people better in this novel, there is the love interest with Ryan, and the annoying Claudel from the first novel is barely in this story. After reading this book, you'll want to go and get the next book in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"The plot is disconnected and unnecessarily tragic.","review":"Kathy Reichs uses too much narrative for my taste. The main character, Tempe Brennan, is not particularly likeable and it is not clear why she chooses to do some of the things she does. For instance, what was the point of the \\"mugging\\"? Why didn't she at least tell Ryan about it? Maybe I would understand had I finished the book. I feel betrayed by her weaving me into her life and then killing her cat. I am not an activist but I don't understand a writer who feels he/she needs to kill an animal for what? Shock effect? I understood the reason for the other deaths - even the babies - which were remote and had some purpose to the plot. But to make the reader feel warmth and love for Birdie, through her writing in both books, and then kill him? I didn't feel it worth my time to finish the book. Nor will I read another of hers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bones","review":"Damn, I purchased the series but can't seem to get into them. Boring character and I was so prepared to love her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Half way thru reading then bang! You may as well be dead.","review":"I was riveted to this book and really picking up speed until I reached about dead center of the book. Then POW! Ms. Reichs throws ridiculous, implausable coincidences to salvage her complex plot. I was really in there with her until her ridiculous plot links. This a mystery that detectives must dream of. I call it the \\"follow the dots\\" scheme that result in a staight line honing in on a places the heroine just happens to be even if they are literally a thousand miles apart. Thus I hurled the book into the air, it fell to earth I care not where!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, Not even close to a Deja Dead.","review":"I really enjoyed Deja Dead. Death Du Jour however seemed to be forced, frenetic, and padded. I felt there were a hundred pages in the middle that were rather experimental in style. Does the author gain some personal redemption discussing for a page why she did not spend the evening with her x-husband. Do we need all of the cliched discussion of the south and draped Spanish moss ending in probably one of the worst sentences to be published this year: \\"The tide of time itself ebbs tardily to the eternal sea\\"? (p. 170). This is not the dialog of a forensic anthropologist.Hey, I am not a professional critic. I have never read Patricia Cornwell. I eagerly await another tale of forensic sleuthing from Kathy Reichs who I'm sure has a great story to tell. Now just tell it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Deadly Disappointment","review":"I have not read any of the authors other titles but I decided to try this from the good reviews. I felt that it lacked pace until the last quarter of the book and found myself skimming through pages just to find something of relevance to the plot. The technical detail was informative but didn't really add to the story. I couldn't wait to finish it and start something else. Really quite dull in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, again a clear miss","review":"I recently reviewed Kathy Reichs' first book and thought it was bad, very bad actually. But because Kay Scarpetta's new one wasn't out yet, I read this one. Again we see our heroine Tempest going through a load of cases, connecting them and saving them. Cool. What Mrs. Reich did better this time: the case is more believable than in the first book. But still: the character is pretty flat, the relationship of the protagonists is way off the standard we came to love with Patricia Cornwell, especially Mother & Daugther. BTW: I knew before I opened the book that Tempest would get a kick over the head after leaving a something. And, yessss for three points, she did. I fought through to the end and then threw the book around the room because I hated myself for reading that far. Spare yourself this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Have not received my order yet","review":"I have not received my order yet so I cannot review the book; however all the Kathy Reich books I have read so far have been enjoyable reads."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck","review":"After the baby mulilations I couldn't read any more. I am still haunted by the images from that, as the mother of three young sons it was too disturbing for me. Definitely will not purchase any more books from this author. I couldn't donate this one to our libary's book sale fast enough!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Death DuJour","review":"Too much swearing! Books do not need all that to make a good story, it is very distracting"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best read","review":"Let me preface my review by stating that this is my first Kathy Reichs book. It will most likely be my last. I felt as though I was reading a CSI book written by Tom Clancy - way too technical. However, that may be the audience for which she is writing.The first 2/3rds of the book was dull, slow, boring and disconnected. As Ms. Reichs builds to the climatic end, I felt as though it suddenly jumped to 120 mph which did not lend itself the ability for the reader to get a mind picture of what was happening.If you like technical writings (sometimes even in foreign languages), this is the book for you. If you are looking for an entertaining mystery to read, I would suggest you look else where."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"This novel grips your imagination from the very first pages..Kathy Reichs can really write an attention getting story! I love all of her books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost as good as 'Deja Dead'... but still amazing!","review":"If, like me, you have lived in Montreal (or maybe just visited), you will LOVE this novel - even more if you enjoy thrillers... A true page turner... Will Brennan ever have a fling with the French detective? Read to know. Again, you'll learn more about psychology and forensic anthropology than three years at the University.The reviewer, JR Geoffrion (JR@Geoffrion.com), earned his MBA from York University and completed the Wharton School Multi-National Marketing and Management Program. He also holds a Engineering degree from the University of Toronto."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor sophmoric effort.","review":"Too bad on this one. Too many coincidences occur in this book to make me think the author didnt' know what to do with this story line. What happen to the story of the saint? That sure was more interesting than these cult people. How convienient that the woman helping her with the research on the saint also was in the cult. When did her brother show up in this? Should have brought in the romance more, I doubt I will read the latest effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother reading this book.","review":"Having greatly enjoyed \\"Deja Dead,\\" I really looked to Death Du Jour. Unfortunately it is a complete disappointment. I found the story overy contrived and coincidental. The characters were wooden. Frankly, the whole thing seemed like a bad movie where no one had the courage to ask \\"why, this story.\\" In summary, don't bother with this lousy novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"My first Temperance Brennan story - Good book!","review":"It was a really satisfying read. There are a lot of gruesome details...it helps that the author is a forensic anthropologist herself.I read parts of the book alone at night and made myself scared thinking someone was watching me or going to break into my apartment while I was sleeping. After numerous attempts at trying to read before bed and getting too scared to carry on after a page or two, I finally decided to stick to reading during the daytime.The only things that slowed me down with this story were the French words. I could have done without them, but I guess Reichs was trying to keep things real since part of the book took place in French-speaking Canadian cities.I really enjoyed the chemistry between Tempe and Detective Ryan. I'm anxious to see that relationship develop throughout the rest of the series which I will be reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Turkish Bellydance","review":"It is essential to have a listening sample - one cannot make an educated decision without it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING: Identical to \\"Naked Chef Takes Off\\"","review":"I don't know if this book preceded the other Jamie Oliver book, \\"Naked Chef Takes Off,\\" but it's the SAME BOOK.I bought this for my wife, thinking I'd found a J.O. book she didn't already own.

After that, it leaks at night because it gets saturated. I wish Pampers makes a size 2 instead of a size 1-2. Size 3 looks so hugh so my baby is now using Swaddler size 2 instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Baby-Dry Diapers Ixnay Asgooday Swaddlers","review":"Pampers appears to have two lines of diapers for small babies--Baby Dry, and Swaddlers. My wife and I had to buy Baby Dry in a pinch, and they weren't as good.The primary problem is that the waistband is not strechy AND the tabs have more adhesive than hook-and-loop (a.k.a. Velcro(R)). Swaddlers just have the hook-and-loop. You need to adjust the tabs more precisely the first time because there's less forgiveness, and it's not as easy to reposition the tabs securely because the adhesive loses stickiness.Six thumbs down to Baby Dry. Stop those lines, and just make Swaddlers. That's my advice to Pampers.I give \\"2 stars\\" because the koala is cute, and the diapers are better than going without !!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Manson meets the Monkees","review":"While I personally discount the rumor that this record was recorded not by \\"Craig Smith\\" but one George W. Bush during his acid/coke pagan stage these two discs give one plenty of room to project. A delightful mix of Buffalo Springfield like folk pop and a darker more morose Bread, not to mention the weird cut ups and studio nankering between songs. For those of you who wish you were old enough not to remember the sixties this is a good way to start."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magical!","review":"This is one of our all time favorite books. The art is great and the story is a blend of magical and kooky that delights children and grown-ups alike. When it was my turn to be a guest reader at my daughters K class we went through all our books (which took two days) and this is the one she chose for me to read. It is so refreshing to find a book that appeals to me as much as it does to her and that is fun to read and not painful. If you've choked your way though enough insipid fairy, kitty, and princess drivel to last you a lifetime (and haven't we all?) then you might want to give sweet dream pie a try.*** We discovered last summer that softened ice cream, fluff, food coloring and assorted candies and jimmies could be swirled into an oreo crust to make a quite passable sweet dream pie for home consumption, though my daughter was a little annoyed that it didn't actually cause her to halucinate a monster with people feet ;)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this one","review":"This is a marvelous, detailed fantasy.All day, Ma and Pa Brindle make an enormous \\"Sweet Dream Pie\\". The pie is clearly magical - every move the Brindles make to bake this pie is echoed on the street. When they roll out the dough, everybody falls off their bed onto the floor. When the oven is on, the street is hot. When they blow on the pie to cool it off, a breeze picks up in the neighborhood.All the neighbors (except the little allergic girl) are invited to have a single slice of pie - but they eat too much, all of them, and promptly fall asleep, causing wild dreams to go up and down the neighborhood in a totally non-frightening way. The dreams are eventually swept away, and everybody gets a good night's sleep.The story and the illustrations are wonderfully detailed, as I said. The only thing that ever prevents me from reading this book is that it's a long one - sometimes, you really don't have time for it and have to use a shorter book instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is probably only book you need to read in this subject","review":"I truly believe that this is the only book you need to read. It has all the concepts, theories about the story. Densly written and every sentence has concept, theory in it. Starts with the history of cosmology and continues with Cosmological Models, Origin of Galaxies, theory of Galaxy formations and star formations and future of the Universe. Inflation and other theories are all covered to the extend that space allows. What I liked most in this book is that it covers everything and you do not need to read ten books to get the idea complete. For more technical oriented person, book has Mathematical section at the end describing the concepts with formulas. Author always gives brief description of concepts and usually he explains any conclusion with reasons so that if you can not derive the conclusion by yourself there is the reason.This book together with Kip Throne's beautiful book on Black Holes will make it complete."},{"rating":"1","title":"More opaque than the Big Bang itself","review":"I've read quite a few books on astrophysics, cosmology, etc., and this is one of the most poorly written books I've come across. It's too bad, because the writer is trying to be current and thorough. But he doesn't know how to write clearly, his grammar is terrible, he skips steps in his explanations, jumps all over the place, and leaves you wondering \\"what in the heck is this guy trying to say??\\". Not recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lightfoor at his best","review":"This is one of the \\"final four\\" - the four albums recorded by Lightfoot which had not, until now, been released on CD by Warner Brothers. (This has been released with Old Dan's Records, which is also very good.) I had Dream Street Rose on vinyl and so listening to it once again, this time on CD, is like seeing an old friend for the first time in a long time.It's typical Lightfoot, with his usual blend of simple melodies, lyrics about bittersweet love and, refreshingly, a brilliant version of the Auctioneer - all sung in his wonderful baritone voice. He's on good form, as are his usual backing musicians - Terry Clements, Rick Haynes and Pee Wee Charles.If you like Lightfoot, go buy this and the other members of the \\"final four\\" - well worth the money. Incidentally, if you're in the UK, they have not been released yet - am I the only UK resident with these on CD....?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of Lightfoot","review":"I have been a Lightfoot fan for decades. I find his music rich, lyrically appealing/entertaining. I tend to be drawn more to his mid period than his earlier or later stuff. Ol Dans Records is certainly one of my favorites BUT this I believe is my favorite of all my Gordon Lightfood records. I like the nautical theme and his haunting lyrics and vocally he was at his prime. Musky, masculine and down home, that is how I describe his music. A true form of the description minstrel, a great storyteller. I am so glad this is on CD now."},{"rating":"2","title":"New Light Shed On An Old Should-be Classic","review":"Released in March of 1980, DREAM STREET ROSE had all the makings of a classic Lightfoot recording. Every track shines on its' own. The opening track \\"Sea of Tranquility\\" is mesmerizing with its' blend of steel, electric guitar and keyboards. This should have been the first single from the album. \\"Sea..\\" is definately one of the highlights as is the title track, \\"On the High Seas\\", \\"Whisper My Name\\" and \\"If You Need Me\\". This is definately the BEST record that Lightfoot has created."},{"rating":"2","title":"Musician, Songwriter, Composer, Poet And Matchmaker!","review":"Released in '80 'Dream Stree Rose' was Gordon's fourteenth album.

Burt Lancaster stars as an inmate who plans his escape to be with his critically ill girlfriend, Ann Blyth. He enlists the help of his cellmates and an older, experienced inmate, Charles Bickford. Standing in their way is a brutal, ambitious guard played very well by Hume Cronyn. There are a number of great scenes in the movie, including Cronyn's beating of an inmate to the sound of classical music, and the death in a giant press of an inmate that informed. The performances are good, the film moves at an excellent pace, and the ending surprised me somewhat, again given the time that it was made.

That is a truly ignorant comment because if you would notice that on a flat 2d plane there are 360 degrees. moving in all dimensions would actually be about 129600 degrees (360degrees * 360degrees). Also, while there may not be as many moves as other games, and the combo system is limited, you have to realize the strategy involved in the fighting system. You have to take advantage of other characters' flaws and time your projectiles. You have to lead characters with your projectiles and manage your psi.

In actuality any lesbian content could be compiled into about 2-3 pages out of the entire book (which was a disappointment for me). Further none of the characters, including the main character Sunshine/Kali, were likable.

The resulting story is a delight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Probably the least interesting Foundation book","review":"Really, this concluding novel of the Foundation series seems to belittle the original books in the series by trying to tie the Robot Universe with the Foundation.The writing is excellent, and the book is really quite interesting when taken as a stand-alone work... but it wasn't the grand end to the \\"Foundation\\" series that I had been hoping for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterful --- a history lesson about the future","review":"I am a foundation purist that only really regards 5 books as integral to the message that I believe Asimov was leaving for the earth. The original trilogy, Foundation's Edge and Foundation and Earth.Is the individual or the whole more valuable. The planet of extreme individuals, one of whom travels off with the adventurers in search of earth is certainly there to question the wisdom of Galaxia and indeed whether or not Galaxia can succeed. Galaxia or individuals, which will win?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific! One of the best of the series","review":"Excellent book. Isaac Asimov ties together the Foundation series with his Robot books and his Empire books. He makes many allusions to those earlier books, even bringing back R. Daneel Olivaw, now 20,000 years old! Continuing the storyline in Foundation's Edge, he examines the conflict between individuality and unity, with the extreme unitists of Gaia, the extreme individualists of Solaria (who have even become hermaphrodites to totally eliminate interaction) and the moderates of the Galaxy. This book has intellectual excitement, some adventure, a bit of romance, and some philosophy. This is definitely one of his best"},{"rating":"1","title":"Should of stopped after the first three","review":"The first three books held my interest the whole way through. Intelligent writing and an exciting story. Foundations Edge was okay. Foundation and Earth, however, was preposterous. I'm afraid to say a LONG, boring story with a rediculous ending. He didn't really want to write these two books and it shows."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting ending . . .","review":"Asimov wrapped up the Foundation/Robot/Empire saga quite well in Foundation and Earth. I must admit I was a bit confused by the book as I read the Foundation series starting with Foundation before I read any of the Robot/Empire Novels or even Prelude to Foundation or Forward the Foundation. Despite my confusion, I was impressed with the book even then."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and repetitous","review":"To start, I loved the first 4 books. But this was really bad. The characters were very unlikable. Golan was a child hating old grump and Bliss almost broke down in tears every time she stepped on a blade of grass. The same arguments over and over, no action and then he had to throw in a sex, like it's mandatory for the hero to sleep with at least one woman per planet visited or something. Yuck! This and _Prelude to Foundation_ should have never been written or at least cut down to a reasonable size. Each book could have dropped about 150 pages with absolutely no effect on the plot. If you really want to find out what happens, do the abridged version on tape and save yourself from this trash."},{"rating":"2","title":"Asimov","review":"Great sci fi read. The originality is so that many movies n shows depicting space must have read the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst of the Series","review":"If you enjoyed the ending of Foundation's Edge then you will probably like this book. You will find more analogies comparing Gaia to things in the isolate world, and Bliss squaring off with Trevize about stuff you really don't care about. Asimov does, however, succeed in making you feel the fustration that the characters feel when they don't discover ANYTHING about Earth for the first 450 pages. The most annoying character is Fallom. I found myself wanting Trevize to kill Fallom as he suggests he will do several times in the book. The \\"twist\\" revealed in the last sentence is all but a surprise as Trevize foreshadows it several times in the book. I just read a review that this was more part of the Robot series than the Foundation series. I had only read the first four Foundation novels so perhaps that is why I didn't care for the portion of the book where they meander through space accomplishing nothing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Even for the Most Devoted Fan","review":"It's hard to believe that the man who wrote this book (and its equally disappointing predecessor, _Foundation's Edge_) even READ the original Foundation Trilogy, let alone wrote it.This book is repetitive, tedious, and unimaginative. The conversations about collectivism vs. individuality, repeated _ad nauseum_, for all the constant hashing and rehashing of those themes, do not even skim the surface of the points of contention between them.It's bad enough that this book isn't the least bit about the Foundation(s); the real problem is that it isn't even good science fiction, and worse still, it isn't even good writing. If you enjoyed the original Foundation Trilogy, please don't bother with the last two books (chronologically) in the series. They'll only ruin the whole experience.One star. Maybe less."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to standards","review":"If you're an Asimov junkie like me, you'll buy and read this book no matter what anybody says. But if you were thrilled with the first three books in the series, ecstatic over the addition of Prelude to Foundation, and slightly less than pleased with Foundation's Edge, then you'll be disappointed with this one.I felt Isaac was preaching at me in some sort of new age galactic godspeak rather than entertaining me with a good story. Maybe that's the danger of writing so many good adventure books: eventually you want to advertise your beliefs. I don't know if that's true or not, but I do know that this book was a terrible letdown for me in an otherwise brilliant series.The ending didn't gather together the threads of the story, but only seemed to serve as a steppingstone for books that were never to be written. The Foundation Series is a grand adventure, standing up for the most part over forty years after some of the volumes were written. Well, five out of six of them do, at least."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and unscientific","review":"Unscientific? You are probably wondering how I could say such a thing. I could easily get through the heavy philosophysing via the Trevize & Bliss arguments, but when you get right down to it, Asimov just took the \\"Future is bliss through the oneness/Gaia/connectedness\\" (pick a mechanism) option. Ho-hum. Really, I expected a better ending to this grand series."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit disappointing","review":"It would seem that the last batch of books produced by the Asimov aren't quite what they use to be.

I decided to renew my interest in the Foundation series and since this book was hazy in my memory, I decided to reread it. Now I remember why it's hazy. This has to be the most boring and wordy book Asimov has ever written, period. I found myself skipping over large sections of nonsense dialogue of Bliss arguing with Trevise about Gaia. Nobody talks and discusses as much without saying anything as the characters in this book! I managed to get on by skimming and concentrating on plot points. Asimov in his foreword said his publisher asked him to write a large book and he complied by filing it with 80% useless chatter and boring dialogue. He could have written a good short story about this quest for Earth that would have been enjoyable, rather that this bloated, boring, and frankly turgid effort. I gave it two stars in respect to Asimov, had it been any other author, one or no stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"eh","review":"I became enthralled by Issac Asimov through a collection of his short stories. In just a few pages he presented and explored a brain-boggling idea. But in this longer work and two others in the Foundation series (Foundation and Empire and Prelude to Foundation) I admit considerable disappointment. There are some good ideas but they're lost in a sea of shallow characters and needless ramblings. I won't give up on the author because when he hits he really hits. But I'm through with the Foundation series"},{"rating":"2","title":"Foundation's End?","review":"In my opinion the last two foundation books, Foundation's Edge and Foundation and Earth, are alot better than the original three. Isaac Asimov's wrting style has improved, it is a very imersive series that I would recomend to any sci-fi lover. Too bad Isaac didn't write anymore foundation books after this and prelude and forward to the foundation."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"Nowhere near the intrigue and plot of the original Foundation Trilogy. Foundation & Earth was an irritating series of hypothetical debates that amounted (usually) to nothing, and a series of trite, rather meaningless visits to far off planets. The ending (I won't spoil it) was hard to believe, to put it mildly. I give Asimov credit for some of the greatest sci-fi around, but he should have retired from the game after the 1950's."},{"rating":"1","title":"not one of his best...","review":"...and the ending really sank the series.

It is now August 29, 2010 and I have still not received the book I ordered. I understand the book I ordered was ridiculously inexpensive, but that doesn't justify terrible service.

No popular singer has ever explored this rough and ready terrain with Frankie Laine's success, and it's a thrill to hear him charge through such masculine songs as \\"Call of the Wild\\" and \\"Roving Gambler.\\" Even songs that had proved major hits for other artists are remade in Laine's image: Johnny Horton's \\"North to Alaska\\" comes to mind.

I sat down and read this in one shot; to give you an idea how engrossed I was. The story moves really well, they did a great job of juggling huge list of characters and using them appropriately.That being said, it does have it problems. If you are reading this as a standalone, then some of the characters may/may not be familiar. There was a few that I knew by name, but really knew nothing about (Cloak and Adam Warlock are good examples of this). The art is also not my cup of tea either.

The most important characters such as Captain America, Silver Surfer, and Thanos are handled flawlessly. The entire first five sections just keep building the suspense and you are wondering the entire time \\"how are the good guys going to win?\\" and we find out in the sixth. This book shows why Marvel comics are the best because we care about the characters. The book also has Captain America's defining moment: at the end of the battle only Cap stands. He walks up to the God-like Thanos. His shield is destroyed and Thanos brings his fist towards him. Captain America stands there, defiance to the last. The look in his eye, captured perfectly by Ron Lim says it all. In short, if you are a fan of comics, or even if you aren't and want to see why so many of us feel like the characters are friends and, in some cases like Captain America, even good role models, then buy this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"1634: The Ram Rebellion","review":"Very, very disappointing. I loved 1632, liked 1633, was luke warm over the Gallileo book, and really disliked this one. Sad to see a great idea/series start go downhill so fast. The \\"humor\\" in this book is mildly ammusing for the first 10 pages or so then increasing sophmoric and boring for the next 50 pages. I scanned the last 50 pages and then ash canned this turkey. Save your money. I hope \\"CAnnon Law\\" returns to the quality of the first book, but the blurb on it is not promising. Most readers, like me, don't really care how many angels can dance on the head of a 17th century pin and get really bored with endless minutia about religious arguments. Wake up Eric and give us some fun, rousing tales of survival, war, and innovation in the unique \\"world\\" you created in 1632."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't buy this book......","review":"....unless you have nothing else to spend your money on. I am a great fan of the other books, especially 1633, but this one is a poorly, maybe even unethically, conceived project. Many of the \\"stories\\" contained in the book were written by non-professional writers, and it really shows. Apparently many of them are available on the web, which makes the decision to publish them in book form, without warning the purchaser, rather iffy, in my opinion. The theme that is supposed to hold everything together, \\"Brillo\\" and his use as a symbol for a new form of government, is just, well, lame. The songs are unbelievably tedious, and the idea is not ever presented coherently.Pass on this one, save your money for 1634: The Baltic War."},{"rating":"1","title":"What A Mess!","review":"This side story is actually an anthology of semi related tales. It is tedious, boring and an absolute mess. Unless you have a passion for the minutiea of 17th century German government this is a waste of time.

I found it a bewildering mishmash, even the wrap up section at the end. The storyline jumps between characters and locations frequently, and the timeline jumps back and forth as well. The number of characters in play is astounding, and most of them are not the main 1632 characters. It was just plain hard to follow, and therefore hard to fully enjoy. For newbies, this is a definite DO NOT BUY. If you are a 1632 series experienced reader, go ahead, but be forewarned that this one falls a little short."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this One and save your time and money","review":"Eric Flint is a learned and knowledgeable historian with a splendid imagination. He has co authored a number of good alternative history books with David Drake and his 1632 was excellent. Left to his own devices, however, or with a lesser editor, he becomes lost in the twists and twirls of his own highly nuanced world. He has a difficult time sustaining realistic characters. (Pretty much the same set of heros again and again.) Here, another reviewer compared this to reading a high school newspaper, which is apt -- but more likely one will find as much benefit reading off of Flint's fan website and finding that various folks have given additional life to his characters in his alternate universe. So let's join those who hope that he will return to the main flow, with a better editor and prove himself an independent success."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What it seems","review":"I will never again buy an Eric Flint book without physically examining it.

It takes an interest in the nitty gritty of politics and history in the making. It is probably an oversimplication of a guided revolution, but oh, how I wish some of the authors could give some much needed advice to the idiots trying to administer US policy in Afghanistan and Iraq. This book is about nation building. I really enjoyed it, although parts are a bit amateurish. I think overall it showed the complexity of events, in a slightly non-linear fashion, and how history is made up of people and individual decisions. It is a hopefully view of the potential of humankind, and worth a read if you give it time.

Then don't bother with this book. It is another anthology and it is by far the worst of the lot. I am sure the writers thought that these stories about the antics of a goat were hilarious, I however found them tedious and after I was on page 100 and the book was STILL going on about domestic farm life and the antics of a perfectly ordinary goat I just couldn't go on any further. Please no more anthologies. Maybe I can give my copy to the library to keep someone else from wasting twenty dollars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I love the 1632 series. I have bought every book as soon as the come out, and enjoyed each immensely. This is not a novel in the normal definition. It is a collection of stories, kind of like the Gazette, except the Gazette is interesting. I was bored frankly with the stories. I normally read a book in less than a day, but this one took me over 4 days, because i just could not get interested, I just finished it to keep me in the story and to ensure I would not miss anything for future books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Disappointing","review":"I have to say that after becoming immersed in 1632 and enjoying 1633, I feel like the author's pretty much abandoned the project to whoever wants to publish some small snippet. This was the worst of the series by far and I actually just gave up on it half way though which I never ever do to fiction. I truly wanted to see the author embrace this universe and allow me to come along for an enjoyable ride. Looks like it's not going to happen. Probably need to hold off or write your own version since that's kind of what got published anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Far and away the most boring book in the series","review":"I have every single Ring Of Fire book, and in general, the series is among my favorite sci-fi works. Except for this one. This book is not only almost unrelated to the rest of the series internally, it consists of a series of incredibly inane anecdotes about raising sheep and rabbits. Certainly the dullest sci-fi book I own. The ONLY reason to read this one is because it's referenced from later works, in particular 1635 - The Dreeson Incident. You'd think that a character in a sci-fi novel should have a story at least as interesting as a normal person in real life - and this book sure misses that goal. Unless you're really, really keen on reading short children's stories about anthropomorphic rams (the sheep kind), this book is sure to disappoint.Skip this one - you'll thank me later."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stagnent!","review":"I love the RoF series. I love the politics, intrigue, planing, and military actions. But this book is borderline horrible! The Ram Rebellion was fun for the first 20 to 30 pages, but then it just got old. Simply felt like bad filler in a worse dinner. How many pages about a dance instructor trying to figure out how to get a dance company up and running? It became a Seinfeld show. A book about 'nothing'. I have read maybe 1000 sci-fi/fantasy books. I can count on one hand how many I have just given up on or skipped through. This is one of them. This is the equivalent of a modern day reality show about little to nothing. Some may like that, some may love that. Good for you. I feel ripped off in time and money.I wont buy any more written by VD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow and Confusing","review":"To me, the best recommendation for a book is how often I re-read it after I have read it the first time. For example, most of my copies of Robert Heinlein's books and early Tom Clancy novels are almost worn out. By that note, this book gets low marks, unlike other books in this series. It is slow and confusing. Fans of the series probably should read this book as it does contain information important to other books in the series, but these are characters and stories you will soon forget. I have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish they'd remember they're spinning a yarn!","review":"Sorry about the terrible pun in the review title, given the subject matter of this book. But the book is a death march--a long slog through trivia that might be fascinating to a few Baen's Bar fanatics, but which the rest of us find pretty boring. The greatest thing about 1632 was the fact that it told a great story, which was strong enough to hold the history that was hung all over it. The storytelling isn't nearly as strong here, and the history weighs it down. Recommended for die-hard 1632 fans only."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Dodge This Ram","review":"While this book isn't quite up to the standards of the previous books in the 1632 series, it's still a good read. A bit more analytical and lacking the \\"big names in history\\" factor of it's predecessors, it manages to remain entertaining while examining the ground-level effects of the intersection of modern social mores with 15th century German societal unrest. Fans of the series should be well-satisfied with the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ponderous and Uneven","review":"I need to start out by saying I thoroughly enjoyed 1632 and 1633 and am an avid fan of alternate history novels. That said, wow, this book has been some serious work to get through. With a cast of over 50 characters (many who go by several names) and multiple stories cobbled together, this book is all over the place. I tend to read in small sessions and this book is not conducive to that at all. This book is only for the die hard fans of the series, and then only for those who like stories about tedious political maneuvering.This counts as strike two against the entire series, with 1643: The Galileo Affair being the first. Mr. Flint needs to get this series back on track and stop focusing on these side stories. The main story line is solid and makes for great novels. Save these side stories for the short story compilations where they belong. I will try 1634: The Baltic War next, but if it is strike three, then I'm done with the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hugely Disappointing","review":"I've read all the previous entries in the Grantville Universe and enjoyed most of them quite a bit. But where the use of various writers and short stories worked well for a time, the quality of the writing has been steadily decreasing.The Ram Rebellion reads as a book totally abandoned by Eric Flint and handled almost entirely by the Regulars at Baen's Bar. I understand Baen's practice of pairing up-and-coming writers with more established writers in order to develop new talent and further the plot of popular series. It's worked well in the past.Here it simply failed. I'm about 1/5 through the book and am so tired of the lackluster writing, the sophomoric humor and the terribly slow plot progression that I'm putting it away for good. I'm probably unlikely to read the rest of the series because it's reached a point where having Flint's name on the cover is totally meaningless and not at all representative of the quality of writing to be expected within."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disappointment","review":"Another big disappointment. We seem to be getting more and more filler books. I absolutely loved the 1st two (1632 & 1633). From then on this series has been going downhill. The Ram Rebellion is a dis-jointed series of short stories about goats, of all things. Made no sense to me and ended up just tossing it in the trash where, I feel, it belongs. Again-the first two books were absolutely spellbindin. I'll be much more careful (read all the reviews) before I get sucked into another turkey like this one.

I'm always doing something with my hands, at the gym etc that the rings make me feel uncomfortable and I needlessly worry about whether the diamonds would drop off or I'd lose them.I bought this ring off Amazon.com as it was a cheap version of what my wedding band looked like. I have used this for the past 1 year and trust me, it's been through a lot. It still looks great! It's comfortable, no maintenance, low stress, negligible investment and it looks great. No one knows it's not my real wedding band!It really does serve my purpose.

It's quite shiny (both the CZ and the silver), my only knock is that the prongs holding the crystals down have such a large surface area compared to the stones, detracting from the sparkliness of the CZ. (I bought this to replace a channel-set eternity band which did not have that problem.)I was a little concerned that pointy end of the stones would poke my finger through the holes on the inside, but I can't feel them.

Anyway, I was grossed out since I usually do not have athlete foot problems. So I used this for 2-3 days in a row and then a couple times a week after yoga class once the problem cleared up. And you do not need much, use a few drops on a nail brush for each foot and start scrubbing the fungus away. It has a strong tea tree scent, but I like, and I know it is working and it dissipates in a few minutes. It's worth it!

Once I received this product, I immediately began to use it once a day on during his bath on the rash on his neck/back. Within 3 days, the rash was gone.

I'm all for the screaming and everything but it doesnt work with them, the guitars have to be the worst thing about it, their all over the place, the singer is great and is the only thing that keeps it respectable. Some of the songs alright though, i really liked ape dos mil, and there were a few other decent ones like must have run all day, two tabs of mescaline, cavalcade and convectuoso.

But this album drips with ingenuity, art, and uncompromised sound - quenching my thirsty ears.GlassJaw continue to push the envelope...Can't wait for the next 1."},{"rating":"2","title":"One word---AMAZING!!!!!!!","review":"This cd is absolutely awesome!Daryll's voice is great,the musicianship is excellent.This is an all around great cd.BUY IT!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the very best","review":"this album, \\"worship and tribute\\" is an awesome album by glassjaw. daryl's voice is very sexy, and it chimes throughout the cd causing you to gear your attention at what is being said.there is no known musical genre to put this album into, for it is too great to be demoralized by labels. the guitar riffs and drums play of similarity to incubus, while daryl's voice can wail and coo liek chino moreno's. it is just too splendid to even put into words. it si great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, except for the slow songs","review":"As the title says, this album is excellent, except for the slow songs. \\"Ape Dos Mil\\" relies on an obvious rhyme with cursing and is off-putting. \\"Must've Run All Day\\" has an awkward Daryl singing \\"come 'ere\\" creepily. Rest of the album is tremendous, especially side B (Stuck Pig onward). The first three songs are rad, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh, the TEXTURE of it!","review":"I liked EYEWTKAS not for the lyrics (which I actually thought were sub-par), but for the interesting musical soundscapes the rest of the band created. This CD is even better in that sense. From the first five seconds, in which a guitar riff moves from one speaker to another, you know that you are in for a musical odyssey of heavy riffs, frantic drumming, and frequent change within songs, a journey that increasingly few bands can take you on nowadays. Probably the best description of this work would be \\"Dillinger Escape Plan goes emo.\\" If you like complex, intense rock with frequent tempo changes, get this CD right now. The only songs I don't like are \\"Cosmopolitan Bloodloss\\" and \\"Ape Dos Mil,\\" the first two singles. Oh well, maybe they'll get some emo kids to stop listening to their other music... and get some taste."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scything hardcore beauty","review":"The raw emotional energy that emanates from this album is incredible. Every song is a outpouring of Palumbo's heart and soul in his lyrics and singing. The musicianship on this album is stunning as well. The pure hardcore punk jams are intense and complex especially on the opening song \\"Tip Your Bartender\\" and the closing song \\"Convectuoso\\" along with \\"Mu Empire\\" and \\"Radio Cambodia.\\" \\"Stuck Pig\\" is a hard hitting, wailing almost metal song that is surprisingly catchy. The song \\"Must've Run All Day\\" is a haunting, but beautiful trip that rings with sincere emotion. The song \\"Cavalcade\\" is memorable because of the sportscasting done by Palumbo at the end of the song. Sort of lyrical experimentation. Worship and Tribute is a superb album that is right up there with The Used's amazing debut in my book. Excellent vocals and musicianship with a sound that is completely their own. Hard to beat an album this good."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book","review":"The Transall Saga is a really good book. It has a lot of action in it like when Mark is in the woods and a buffalo thing chases him. It also has a lot of suspense in it, for example, when he follows the monkey human things to their tribe. I can relate to this book because he had to build a shelter and I used to do that. I think this book is for kids from 10-16 years old. I liked this book a lot.Andrew W."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read!!","review":"Great adventure book. Especially for the younger readers!!!

I suggest this product to all big book readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"not typical gary paulsen material","review":"This book is quite a change from all of the other Paulsen books, although it retains Paulsen's usual underlying theme of survival in the wilderness. Yup. And I'm afraid that several of the other reviewers were misguided or perhaps confused, as the book is not overflowing with \\"goar\\"; nor was the main character-Mark-on Mars. I found this novel captivating and entertaining. I enjoyed Mark's attitude that he aquired on Transall, which is the name of the world Mark is mysteriously transported to after falling into a bizzare blue light. This book has a satisfying ending and leaves the reader both awestruck and contemplative."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not your typical Sci-Fi","review":"We were assigned to read this book for my school's bookclub. At first I was disapointed that we were going to read a nerdy sci-fi book but once I got though the first chapter I was really interested. This book wastes no time at all getting into action. You will be hooked by page 11. It's a thought-provoking book, I am really looking foreword to discussing it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is cool","review":"I rated this book four stars because I think that they should have made a second one or they should have made this one longer. It is a very adventurous book. So if you like adventurous books read this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Transal Saga","review":"I would recommend this book to anyone who seeks adventurous and mysterious books. This book has many problems and conflicts that result and rise up to the main idea or plot of the story. The characters throughout the story are very different and strange but in all, they all have vital parts in the story that affect the main problem, and small problems that arise in the story. The details are distinctly described, and are very clear. When you start to figure out what will happen next, something unexpected pops up and changes the whole story. After starting this magnificent book, you will never want to put it down. I myself thought the book was an incredible adventure book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Challenging and confusing at times, but a definite Must Read","review":"This book contained many characters and was easily confusing, but every moment I spent reading this was way worth the while. I read this book from 2:30 in the morning to just after four. I could have watched TV, one of my favorite hobbies, but I chose to read, instead!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific Sci-Fi book!","review":"I just got done reading \\"The Transall Saga\\" by Gary Paulsen. I have known about Gary Paulsen for sometime now ever since reading part of \\"Hatchet\\" in elementary school. This book however kept me more interested than Hatchet could ever hope to. The Transall Saga in my opinion is Paulsen's best book and I recommend it highly to readers of all ages. Paulsen wrote a Sci-Fi novel that actually gave me that feeling of being a kid again for the first time in my life! It contains an imaginative world with wonderful characters that you grow attach to. It has a little something for everybody: action, adventure, sci-fi, romance, survival, and good vs. evil of course. Truly a wonderful story that is of the highest in children storytelling."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Transall Saga:school reveiw","review":"Wow!This book was excellent,I don't think there's one part I disliked.I would rate this book with 5 stars because it was outstanding how Gary Paulsen matched the characters with what they feel.I liked how Mark was able to survive in another culture ,after being transported from the desert in a blue light to another planet in another time.I really liked how Mark became a very important member(a warrior) of the Tsook.I thought it was a little weird though, how Mark fell in love with the cheif's daughter,Megaan, from the Tsook, rather then the slave that he had known from when he first got there.I was suprised at how many people turned against Mark and wanted to be the one to stop the outlander.If you like science ficton and mystery, this is the book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vanchman's book shiznack","review":"The Transall Saga by Gary Paulsen is a superb book. It takes place in the past on what appears to be a different planet. A young boy named Mark gets bitten by a snake and falls into a big blue light and is transferred into a new time. I encourage the people who are reading this to buy or get this book at a library or a book store, because once you start to read this book, you will never want to put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Exhilarating Adventure","review":"13-year-old Mark goes on a solo-backpacking trip in the old Magruder Range when a strange blue light transports him into another time. This trip turns into a terrifying adventure, which he now has to survive on his own and start a new life in the world called Transall. Along the way Mark meets tribes with unusual looking people and makes various friends. He also sees strange animals, gets involved with war, pain and fighting. Now he must search through this war torn land to find the blue light that sent him here so he can get back home. Mark soon discovers his startling powers. But when something really bad happens, all of his skills are tested. How will he win this battle of guts...literally guts? Will he find a way back or will he live in this strange world forever?This science fiction book is full of adventure, war, love, and new and amazing things. It is a good book for young adult readers who fantasize about living and surviving on their own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!!!","review":"I just finished reading this book,it was incredible! Just when you think it can't get any better it does! Gary Paulsen capsures the emotions and situations in this book! For people like me that doesn't like to sit down and read for hours and also wants it intresting and action packed this book is perfect!This is a must read 5 star book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Transall Saga","review":"Gary Paulsen shows his style of writing in this must read book. I've read books that don't make any sense at all but this one is an awesome book. It is about Mark who gets sent to a different planet by a mysterious blue light. Along the way back to his own time Mark finds out that people aren't the way they seem. Gary Paulsen is a excellent writer when it comes to this. I would recommend this book to readers who are interested in mysteries of the outside world. Any one who reads this book would love it instantly. I've read this book about three times and I still find suprises along the way. The book does have some goar, but it is a book that needs to be read. I've been assigned this book in fifth grade and I still can't stop and take a day to read it. Gary Paulsen just has a way to capture the reader and take them into the book. Honestly, this book is a great pick for a school project or just a reading material. Take my word on it. Read this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"YES!!!! He's Done it again","review":"...this book is awesome!!... Mark, the main character is transported through time when he is on a hiking trip when he ventures towards a mysterious blue light and is sucked in. He then is forced to survive in the so called \\"future\\". Mark must find edible food, englsh speaking humans and friends such as his monkey to help him out. All sorts of elements come towards him that he must conquere and many things that he must come toward and conquere. During this book he finds other tribes and becomes parts of them, gets maried to an indian and also rides across nearly a whole desert. I would like to tell more but I worry i'm telling to much! I hope you find my review helpful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for a sequel","review":"First, if you have not read this book you have to read it, you are hooked from chapter 1. It would be great if Gary Paulsen wrote a sequel like brian's winter. What if the blue light never came and he had to make a life living on the new planet earth. I think a sequel to this book would be as great as the Hatchet sequels. Please send responses to this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thrilling Takes you to a different level of creativity","review":"Wow! Gary Paulsen has done it again. In this brilliant masterpiece Mark, a 12 year old boy falls into a blue light and ends up on a differrent planet.The book is about him trying to find the blue light to get home. Paulsen does a fantastic job describing the new world and how brutal and tough Mark's journey is. This book is a must read! If you do not buy it please check it out at your local library"},{"rating":"2","title":"Transall Saga","review":"It was the best book ive ever read!

I found the tools neededto help myself be healther and happier. Her approach is different but if you listen to what she says, you can do the same as I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Cartoonish Insects & Slide Feature \\"Bugs\\" Me!","review":"Charles Reasoner has designed a whole series of these interactive sliding books. All of them will probably have to be read with your child since the sliding feature is simply too hard to them to work. Each pages describes the action of a particular bug and then asks which bug does such and such. In all of his books, the animals are hidden between the page (which you are supposed to pull apart to reveal the animal). If your child was to look at it alone, he would simply be viewing pages of scenery. The bugs also look very cartoonish and don't entirely resemble what they are supposed to be. Having said this, I don't regret the purchase and recommend this book - with some reservations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not my favorite in the series","review":"I am a pretty big fan of the Dave Robicheaux series but this was my least favorite book so far. I understand that Dave has a \\"cowboy\\" personality and always wants to rebel against any kind of authority figure but it was way overdone in this book.Also, I got pretty tired of young, really attra active women begging to sleep with Dave (a not-so-young alcoholic who has tons of issues and isn't particularly attractive). Once the third girl came after him, I was really rolling my eyes...All of that said, I really do like the series and have enjoyed many of the other books. I won't give up on Dave Robicheaux yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Down on the Bayou","review":"Wow! This turned out to be far better than I had expected. I had seen the movie and hadn't been terribly impressed but decided to pick this up after watching \\"In the Electric Mist\\". Tommy Lee Jones evoked such a great character that I wanted more. My only real qualm with this book was the sex scenes that always came across as awkward. What worked well for me was the speech patterns, the food, the descriptions of life in New Iberia, the descriptions of the bayou and the areas around Dave's house, the villains, and the very nature of Dave as a dried out alcoholic that still struggles to find what makes him tick. Well done!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Heaven's Prisoners - touchs the heartbeat of the South","review":"I grew up in Mr. Burke's Lousiana and know the cities he writes about. This book was like a visit home. This is a murder mystery novel for those, like myself, who usually don't read murder mystery novels. This book is about the inward struggles with the dark side of humanity as well as the public issues that we face. Mr Burke puts his reluctant hero in the middle of a murder and captures the esscence of Cajun culture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not his best","review":"This is the third of Burke's Robicheaux books I've read, and, in my opinion, the worst. to give him credit, Burke's descriptions are ethereal, his characterizations (at least, of Dave & Clete) are vivid and make you care. Unfortunately, his political rants honk unpredictably and obnoxiously throughout his books (especially this one) like an amateur tuba player in a beautiful symphony. I want to be entertained, not preached at. There are also times that his denouements leave much to be desired. As as mystery-reader, the puzzle is very important to me. I want it to make sense, and I want the loose ends tied up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfulfilled","review":"I listened to this one on tape. The reader was perfect for the part. The story, however, left me high and dry. I felt like I'd fallen asleep and missed the part where he avenges his wife. Maybe I did. This was a depressing story for the most part but done by a talented writer. Too bad it seemed to stop instead of end. Loose ends left blowing in the wind all over the place."},{"rating":"2","title":"James Lee Burke","review":"Burke is a master at language. Most of his characters have depth and humor. Even those you dislike, and believe me there are a few. And he writes a hell of a mystery. Love him.Ceré"},{"rating":"2","title":"oh heavens","review":"I think readers want to know whether or not a book is worth reading, rather than my telling the story. I think it is a really good book in this series. As a woman, I think he went from Annie, his wife that is killed, into another woman's bed a bit too quickly. I think the ending could have been made clearer. All in all it is a good, moody book. Dave has a lot of intelligent insight into his own psyche. May help us to have a peek into our own. From reviews, I can see the movie made from this novel is a loser, so I will skip it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Applied Regression Analysis, Includes disk (Wiley Series in Probability and Statistics)","review":"esplains the theory very detaily.and lots of excercise and solution is included"},{"rating":"1","title":"Timmy's Special Delivery","review":"I have the movie in vhs but wanted to purchase it on dvd for my younger grandchildren who love the vhs. The vhs is giving us trouble. When I ordered the dvd they said it was in stock and charged me for the dvd. Then I was given a refund and told they did not have it. I would really like to have this dvd for my babies. I was very disappointed. I wish you wouldn't have said you had it then said you didn't. My review for the dvd is excellent but for your company ...poor."},{"rating":"2","title":"2nd only to lord of the rings","review":"If you have read any of my other reviews, you will notice that I'm a big fan of Gemmels. I love all his books, but none (except this one) have I ever rated 5 star. The characters are fantastic and I even became mournful when ever one of them died. In most novel I'm able to pick out a favourite character right from the begining, but in this story I could not decide who I liked the most.The demons are brilliantly contrasted from one another and I love the way all the odds are stacked against the goodies. You really feel that there is no way out for them, and I can promise that you will never predict the ending.This is a Drenai book, yet it is seperate from the Nadir war story line. So you don't have to read it in link with the others. Simply put: this is one of the best stories you'll ever come across."},{"rating":"2","title":"Out to pasture","review":"Some authors manage to completely ruin great characters by simply stopping to care about them. I think most readers of this genre love it when we get the great awe-inspiring acts of fresh on the scene heroes. David Gemmel manages to show the readers what happens when those same heroes get old.Gemmel has a talent for creating great scenes. There are other authors out there, who can perhaps describe a fight scene with more detail or zeal, but David Gemmel can deliver a simple scene and make it seem like a pearl hidden in an oyster. The action is not packed into this book, but there is enough for readers like me to keep us turning the pages. I enjoyed the character intereaction in this book. He doesn't try and make you love all the characters, in fact with one of the characters it is quite the opposite.Simply put it is a great book, by an author who writes some great fantasy. It is definately worth picking up if you love the fantasy genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"You won't be able to put this book down!","review":"I only \\"discovered\\" David Gemmell very recently but he's rapidly moving onto my list of favorite authors. In this book, complex characters are drawn with intricate detail, but they are never boring.Herioc, honourable and yet flawed in some way, the heroes in Winter Warriors are eminently likeable. You can't help but empathise with them, their quest and principles. There are so many shades of gray in the book, it is a breath of fresh air in an overcrowded fanstasy genre.Highly Recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Greatness of Gemmel: Narnia's Next","review":"Winter Warriors was the first David Gemmel book I became entranced in. If there are any readers out there who have already been absorbed by the magic of Narnia, I believe you will find an even more scintillating, awesome adventure here. A good compare to Narnia, David Gemmel vividly maps out a world, a land of good, evil, and as one of his characters puts it, \\"the shade of grey inbetween\\". But unique is this book in that never before, not even in the fantastic tines of Tolkien, have characters been developed, fleshed out, and woven together by destiny's bonds than in Gemmel's reads. Winter Warriors is one of his best. In fact, he causes his readers to become so attached that the emotion conveyed in the text leaves the page and becomes sentient. There were points in this novel where I cried, sections that made me laugh, and parts where I felt dread and horror. Can fantasy really be so powerful? Reader, it is up to you to find out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating and Great Story telling...","review":"Once more David Gemmell catches my imagination... but Winter Warriors is a cut above other Drenai Sagas. I liked Legend a lot... but this book goes a step further ! Gemmell is a master and this book brings his world back to life... with new myths and new legends in the making.I can't recommend this book enough.

Coming from my first handgun, it was a 12-shot Colt Mk4 that came with a spring rifle. Decided to get this handgun because I was getting sick with how difficult it was to fire my old handgun (after about 20-some shots it hurt the hands to continue pulling the slide to shoot). This handgun is still a single shot, but it's much easier to pull the slide back, which is surprising to see with how much power it packs behind every shot. The magazine size jumped from 12 shots to around 25, and I purchased a couple extra magazines that allow me around 75 shots before I need to reload everything. It's plenty accurate for the ranges I've used it in (something like 10-20 feet). Overall, a great sidearm to have for any airsoft shootout."},{"rating":"2","title":"...hot tunes","review":"i would just like to mention ,for any body who may be comtemplating this CD that it totally kicks *** .It has all the classic Black Dog atmospheere of BYTES and especially THE TEMPLE OF TRANSPARANT BALLS, in my opinion this cd is an essential part of any BLACK DOG collection.The first track is SUUUUPERB!P.S dont buy MUSIC FOR ADVERTS ...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whistle Lanyards","review":"What can you say: it's just a lanyard.

Hawley also plays a great bridge piece on his red Gretsch (I think it was a Gretsch).The non-LP \\"Dark Road\\" increases this new CD single's appeal. And you get the video, only it should be noted that it is a Region 2 DVD and doesn't play on American Region 1 DVD players. But don't let that stop you! The single version of \\"Born Under a Bad Sign\\" and \\"Dark Road\\" are worth the small price of this new Richard Hawley CD single."},{"rating":"1","title":"I think it was edited","review":"Before I purchased this, I saw cutouts for Heidi Marks role.

While I was working my way through this, I wondered if the rest of the class would be this slow. Moll does not command respect, pity or admiration. The scenes for the most part are not really memorable, and the supporting characters are not really convincing. Perhaps this is my biggest complaint. Charles Dickens can keep my interest even in an 800 page book. Yet Defoe could not hold my interest in 250 pages. The only reason I could give for reading this is that it shows a primitave stage in the development of the novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderfully Human Work.","review":"Defoe has written of a wonderful woman with his \\"Moll Flanders\\", and he has also created a book that is entirely enjoyable while outlining her exploits and her life. Moll was quite a remarkable woman in her time. He covers her earlier life of crime and the punishment that ensued from that right up to her later days where she reformed. She made quite a few marriages, and learned and grew from these. Although most of her marriages and her intrigues were undertaken in the pursuit of money, she was actually not without passion or generosity. There is quite a bit of moralizing throughout the book, but it is totally enjoyable nonetheless because Moll was so human and Defoe has created a living, breathing heroine that is as realistic as they come (especially during this era). Quite an accomplishment, especially for a male author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moll's a doll--especially at $2.50","review":"Daniel Defoe, hot on the heels of \\"Robinson Crusoe\\" came under considerable fire when \\"Moll Flanders\\" was published.

The fact is, the public adored her and the novel. And it continues to do so to this day.But, as I've repeated in other reviews, the Dover Thrift edition makes it even more of an attractive purchase.

For a writer to take such incredibly complex information and present it, not only clearly and understandibly, but also enjoyably, one has to be uniquely gifted. Kaku and Behe can do this and remain my favorites. It's been years since I read this and to this day I can't forget it. So, here's my point.

Reading Kaku's book is similar to reading a science fiction novel or watching an episode of star trek - things that have nothing to do in practice with physics.

I find myself in the 1- and 2-star minority.\\"Hyperspace\\" is the kind of book that makes people think they've learned something without actually having done so.This is the problem with \\"learning\\" by analogy. The presentation of many -- perhaps most -- of the concepts covered in this book might help one learn to talk about them, but not to actually understand them. Analogy goes only so far. Experiment is the crucible and if you don't explain the experimental and theoretical basis for results, then you have taught nothing. This is a flaw of much science writing (e.g. the second half of \\"A Brief History of Time\\").\\"Hyperspace\\" started out interestingly enough, but the farther it went, the more it lost its bearings.

The concepts are explained fluently, and they are in a layman's terms. Sometimes the author repeats his views again and agian and it becomes boring. However, I have to admit that your view about the universe can be influenced by this book. You are forced to challenge some simple and basic concepts. Is space a void? is it flat? It is hard to beleive that \\"space itself can curl due to gravity\\". But it was even hard to beleive that earth was not flat.You can appreciate Einstein's work in this context.

That might be due to the fact that the subject matter is still in the theoretical stage. But, still, much of the book is anecdotal and many of the analogies used to explain the main theories are repetitive and off-subject.

It does a much better job on string theory and it is more current with the latest scoop on the second superstring revolution.The second half of Hyperspace is light on content. There is a lot of filler. After reading it, I thought that it was because there was not much else in the way of superstring theory advances. Hyperspace is truly outdated because of its '94 print date. The second superstring revolution began in 1995 which means you are missing out on a number of recent advances.

It's lighter than the WEGA, so it's easier to move and thinner so it's better for display.

It surely is the best album from an artist who's had big commercial success on the country and pop charts. Every song on this album gives you the feel of the Old West; the gunfights as portrayed in a lot of the popular Western movies at that time, the cattle roundups, and the cowboy life. With his tenor to baritone voice, he sings every song with feeling. The great songs include the gunfighter ballads; \\"Big Iron\\", \\"Billy The Kid\\", \\"Running Gun\\", and the No. 1 epic, \\"El Paso\\". Also, the other great songs like the rodeo staple; \\"Strawberry Roan\\", and the great western gospel track; \\"Master's Call\\". If you asked me what my favorite song was on here, I couldn't really pick one, since every song is just as good as the next. This album is the absolute best album of western music out of any other album of western music that there is! So if you like western ballads, this is surely the best album to buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"MARTY AT HIS BEST ...

If you don't like this as a country fan, you're absolutely nuts. The stories told, the voice that's singing, the no flash/frills honest musicianship is, in my mind as a musician, what all artists of all genres aspire to. My only very minimal gripe is the inclusion of \\"El Paso\\" which is just one of those songs EVERYBODY covers and I'm kinda worn out on, but his version is good regardless. If you like ballads, whether sung by Johnny Cash, Bon Jovi, or Dimmu Borgir, the song \\"Big Iron\\" is something you should own this album for on it's own merit. Buy now. You arent cool if you don't own this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliantly evocative of the mythological West","review":"This upgraded reissue presents potent, early work that is essential to Robbins' catalog. Sony has cleaned up the audio, added new liner notes and augmented the original disc with bonus tracks.Robbins' 1959 LP is oddly anachronistic, having ridden a wave of Old West nostalgia that is now itself 40 years old. Even so, his highly-romanticized images of cowboys and outlaws are as captivating today as the (single!) day on which this album was recorded. Robbins' singing is breathtaking, backed perfectly by the Glaser Brothers and spiced with Grady Martin's Mexicali-flavored guitar. Classics like \\"Big Iron\\" and \\"El Paso\\" linger in the air like the smell of sagebrush, resulting in an album whose allure is as strong as its mythological subjects."},{"rating":"2","title":"An American Classic that stands the test of time.","review":"My father purchased Marty Robbin's orginal Gunfighter Ballads album in the early 1960s -- and I played it so many times I'm surprised the grooves in the record were not worn through.

(Marty Robbins never said where he got the unique Spanish-American name found nowhere else). \\"Cool Water\\" of course was a song written by a hero of Marty's, Bob Nolan of the original Sons of the Pioneers. \\"Big Iron\\" was inspired by an older relative of Marty's who told him tales of the Arizona Rangers, a small band of lawmen from Wild West days. \\"Strawberry Roan\\" had been done years earlier in a Gene Autry movie and is effectively covered here by Marty. He also sung the theme song to the movie, \\"The Hanging Tree\\" which gave it a more satisfying ending. This is a good compilation of Western songs; nobody did it better than Marty Robbins. There could have been others such as Nolan's \\"Song of the Bandit\\" you'll find on other compilations but nevertheless I can recommend this one highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Ballads","review":"This one I ordered from Amazon Prime The Only Way To Go.I can review this one and its Great.These ballads and trail songs all seem to tell a story.So Sit back and listen to Marty Robbins sing of the Old West.You can see what is happening as he sings,the storys unfold as you listen.Very Good CD.Thanks Amazon Prime.M.A.FLICK"},{"rating":"2","title":"MADE FOR THIS","review":"This is a brilliant Cd,it is as if this music was made just for Marty Robbins,great tracks,if you like songs from Cowboy films,easy to listen to or sing along with this"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Essential Gunfighter album.","review":"I remember these songs as a boy.

However Marty Robbins did not write El Paso. It was written by Elizabeth Garrett, Sherriff Pat Garretts' blind daughter. That information used to be on the early recordings of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two Completely Different Books Squashed Together","review":"I'm still amazed that Beth Gutcheon's editor would allow this book to be released. There are two completely different stories here that do not work together, despite the fact that the main characters are touched by both. On the one hand, this is a novel of a twentieth century marriage, with its ups and downs. (And, as part of that story, there is the impact of a indifferent mother on her daughter's own ability to be a loving mother when it is her turn to raise a family.) And then there is the very moving story of Danish Jews during World War II. There is a recurring theme that Sidney, of the \\"first story\\" doesn't have any understanding for Nina's harrowing experiences during the war in the \\"second story.\\" The author cannot even find a way to reveal Nina's experiences and so throws it in at the end of the book, perhaps to make the reader feel that the book had more of an impact that it actually had. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY disappointed!!!","review":"I thought I would like this book as the subject manner and descriptions sounded interesting. But the author would start a train of thought and then abort the idea and move on to another - I seemed like I was listening to an crudely abridged version!

After seeing it in its package, I would never have bought this particular one at a store. I ordered it as new but it looks like someone has played with it and put it back in the package. The tip of the rocket is bent, the paint is scratched and smudged and has finger-like prints on it, it's just very poor quality. I expected a little better than what we got, realizing this was a $12 toy, but it should have been in better shape. I'm asking for a full refund, including shipping, as I think it's only fair since I still have to locate this rocket somewhere else and now only have 2 days to get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great!","review":"It works great - easily sheeting off water from flat surfaces.

After I have finished reading it, I was not disappointed with him as a man. This book is an accurate, though modest, description of Washington's life up-to-date (1994-1996). It tells about his childhood, youth, and his family background. Then, the author goes into tracing Washington's life according to the films, he has been making at the time. This book does not have a lot of good pictures and it is not about a \\"Hollywood Hunk\\", \\"the most handsome man\\", etc. Instead, it talks about a real man, who is very good at acting as well as at living his life of a Hollywood star. If you like Washigton as an actor and as a personality (granted, he is also an undisputedly and exremely charming man), then you should read this book and see how he became what he is now."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book","review":"i just love this series its a great book after reading the previous books its funny how josh and beth fall in love and what the rest of the gang has in store.

After reading it, however, I have to admit I was a little disappointed. It seemed pretty formulaic. I also was not pleased with the \\"suicide,\\" though Mom's reaction and subsequent talk with Caroline salvaged the scene somewhat. I have to confess to a little irritation at the kids-know-best-parents-don't-understand angle at the end as well. May her next book be fresher and more family oriented."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I read this book primarily because it is known as a \\"classic\\" piece of environmental literature. In my opinion, it does not deserve to be considered as such primarily because it is shallow. The basic message that there is value in wilderness for its own sake is obvious. Maybe it was not apparent in the fifties but is obvious now. In terms of preservation, Abbey does not offer any insights other than: stop building roads, stop population growth, keep things as they were in good old times when there was nobody around and i could build fires anywhere i wanted, throw tires in the Grand Canyon, and cut down trees if i felt like it. Not much of an insight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I thought...","review":"I bought this book seeking some insight into my own desire to escape to the Southern Utah region several times a year. Instead of a wise and intelligent 'father' of modern envirolmentalism... I found Abbey to be a hypocrit. He throws trash into the desert, thinks himself above the law, and disturbs fragile ecosystems as much or more than the people he rants on and on and on and on about. Disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too wordy","review":"Author just drifted on and on and on about observations that seemed more focused on showing his percieved intellectual superiority than substance. Reminds me of a sermon from church where the speaker sees how many words he can apply to the concept of sin, dragging the message on and on and on to add time but very, very little substance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Desert Solitaire","review":"I was disappointed with this book. I expected informative and interesting descriptions of the desert southwest, and there is some of this. However, the author gets so carried away with inappropriate political discussion and criticism of almost everyone and everything, it really detracts from the story. I actual skipped through some of these parts. When he does stay with the natural descriptions, the author is knowledgable and actually quite poetic. Some of his descriptions are over-the-top though with tedious classical and cultural references. Would not recommend this book. I'm sure there are much better books with stories and information on the desert that avoid the political extremism."},{"rating":"1","title":"no story","review":"This was just a travel log...almost just a daily journal.

His ideas are fascinating, and as more and more of our national parks and monuments are paved to make them user-friendly, Abbey's book becomes more and more important, especially in light of our current administration's (lousy) attitude regarding the environment. It's not the fastest read, but it should be required reading of all high-school students before they're released into the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read!","review":"A great into to a wonderful part of North America and what is happening to it, to us as well over-develop every square inch.

I have recommended it to one of my sons who lives in Albuquerque."},{"rating":"1","title":"Desert deception","review":"I just read a Kindle version of this in hopes of giving my first trip to Moab some special meaning. What a disappointment. I had read some Amazon reviews proclaiming this book as some type of masterpiece. In all due respect, those readers must not get out much. This book was more than just boring; it rambled on without any structure or cohesiveness. The fact that it was so poorly written could be overlooked if at least Abbey had an interesting story to tell; he did not. Do yourself a favor and skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Full of Hatred","review":"Sorry, but I didn't care much for this one. I could not detect that the author had much love for the desert, just a lot of hatred for humankind. Let the reader be prepared for that, and not expect a pretty documentary about the desert."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Inspirational Call to Action!","review":"I first read this book while spending a solitary winter in the Sawtooth Mountains of Idaho. I cannot imagine a better companion.Abbey had a spiritual connection to landscape that is both intoxicating and addictive, and his plainspoken narrative connects the reader to the depth of his desert experience in an uncommon way. But perhaps the most moving aspect of Desert Solitaire (indeed, all of Abbey's writing) is that the reader, by associating himself with the book, is called to action. This is not a book, nor is this an author, for the passive observer. Someone who wants a nice tale of living in the desert ought to look elsewhere. For anyone who's restless and ready to confront his or her spirit in a purposeful way, inspiration awaits!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply the best","review":"This book is the one that got me started going out West over a quarter century ago. I've never regretted it and read the book about every other year along with \\"Slickrock\\", (another Abbey masterpiece), for old times' sake.Ed Abbey always maintained he wrote to eat. He would have scoffed at allegations that his first book was a brilliant, evocative, militant, sentimental, enormously literate, invitation to help preserve what was left, (even though it is). Lake Foul, behind Glen Canyon Damn, broke his heart, but he remained a vibrant influence for free thinking until his death. This book, though it was his first, is still his best memorial. If you don't read it, it is your loss.There may be people who won't like it because it presents a viewpoint too easily eschewed in today's Enron-ethic climate. They are the ones who should read it most."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Read","review":"Bitter, subversive, and entertaining, Edward Abbey creates a masterpiece. Abbey's focus on the slip-rock country of Utah assigns a new valuation to this seemingly useless desert. Delving into the depths of canyons and gorges, Abbey unveils a beautiful landscape, encroached on by the likes of tourists and engineers building dams."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must reading","review":"An early environmentalist even before the term came into use. Ranks up there with Sand County Almanac and Silent Spring. A must read for those who care about the environment. Abbey predicted some of the water problems that now face the southwest."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of My Favorites","review":"Ed Abbey was easily one of the best authors to write about the American Southwest. His humor and wit contrast nicely with his love of the desert. DESERT SOLITAIRE allows the reader to drift into a much simpler, slower life for a short time. Mr.Abbey's polemic about the National Parks is quite entertaining, as I am sure it will just be a matter of time before we have rubber rocks in Yosemite!"},{"rating":"2","title":"an excellent narrative that everyone should read.","review":"Edward Abbey tells of his adventures as a ranger in the Arches National Park with humor, eloquence and a passion for the vanishing wilderness unmatched by any contemporary author in my experience.You'll laugh at his adventures and misadventures all the way through the book - and then be left with a lingering sadness that the area he describes with such affection is already changed.Buy it or borrow it, but read it if wish to touch a unique part of our wilderness heritage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forget death, forget taxes","review":"Reading this book is, I feel, an unspoken duty of all peoplewith any interest in what allows them to live. Unlike some readers, Iinterpret Abbey's vision of the best lifestyle as a balance between roots (nature) and future (society). He is not a Luddite, nor is he an anarchist. This book offends many due to its strong views (name one person that made a difference about something they were ambivalent over). The key to understanding Desert Solitaire is; (yes here comes the platitude); keeping an open mind. There is no better way to phrase it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Feel the passion of a man in the wilderness.","review":"Are you one of those city-people? Working all day in buildings surrounded by steel and stone? Read this book and you wish to be in that wilderness. With poetic words Abbey makes you dream of deep canyons, hot deserts, powerful rivers and high mountains. Feel the heat, thirst and happiness. This book contains the personal and critical view and the experience of an outdoor man in an industrial world. It tells stories about dangerous adventures full of action an humor. If you have ever been in the canyon country this book is a must."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thus spoke Edward Abbey","review":"This book stinks of Neitzsche. Mr. Abbey was as much a loaner as Fredreiche ever was. While staying at the Lazy Lizard Hostel in Moab, I read this book for the first time and discovered the greatness of this desert land in my two week stay there. The desert of Utah is uncompromising and incompassionate, not to be taken advantage of. The small area of land known as Moab is not for the faint of heart, its for those who love nature at its extreme. Unfortunately, the street (there is really only one) of Moab is now lined with 4x4 rental places, a Wendy's, a McDonald's, and all the other garbage that comes with civilization. Abbey's premontions were correct, this place has sadly turned into a Mecca for tourits and 4 wheelers who have no respect for this land and those who came before them. If you go here, pay close attention to the rock and how time has played its cruel tricks upon it, clockwise as the Arches deteriorate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great topic but brought down by the ranting","review":"When Edward Abbey writes about the natural scenery of Utah it is splendid and a joy. When he moves on to his philosophy it is a struggle to stick through to the next page. The level of his hypocrisy is only matched by the level of his misanthropy. I could respect his opinions if he had quit work and moved to the desert, but he took a job for a capitalist government to tend the needs of the tourists, so all his rants about the same ring hollow. His ideas are what you would expect for a first year college student angry with society, not the deep thinker he takes himself to be. The number of glowing reviews really surprises me. I suspect many of them maybe didn't get passed the first couple chapters (which are great, great chapters). It's a wonderful topic but there are probably better sources out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Desert Solitaire Review","review":"This book arrived promptly and is in good condition. There were no torn pages and the print is clear. I am satisfied with this book. Thank you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Desert Solitare - a good read","review":"Desert Solitare was recommended by an avid hiker since i was planning a hiking trip in Moab. Though the author has some radical thoughts you take them in stride as they are just personal commentary.

It reminds one a little of listening to the \\"Star-Spangled Banner\\" as delivered at a football game by a narcissistic rock star.

Others (6, 18) were written by English/American including music by Michael Smith, the performer. Hardly a Spanish song or lyrics.Rozhinkes mit Mandlen (20), is to the best of my knowledge an Eastern European (Jewish?) song. I wonder about its relevance to Spain.Worst of all, all the songs are performed a'la the great American folk style of the 60'.

I have tried to use it twice now and it certainly does not work as described in the instructions. The water turns blue within a couple of minutes and all the granules in the sprayer disappear within the first 5 mins. The instructions say that if the container only has blue water without granules that means you need a refill of the fertilizer. I would stay away from this. It was a waste of money for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"USER ERROR! Is the problem here. Lack of instructions","review":"The reviews appeared justified however, after several user error factors on my part this product gets 4 stars because they need to provide clear instructions.First mistake..Honestly...Put it somewhere on the label to remove the plastic film on the container holding the fertilizer. I popped it on my hose and started going, nothing coming out. Ok my fault im an idiot should have checked.Second. Fill the container and let the water fill up completely. Once you do it works. HOLD IT LEVEL. If you start tilting or shaking the sprayer you get inconsistent amounts of fertilizer and it also starts emptying the water from the container needing it to wait to fill back up. Give it a try."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only Lasted about Three Uses","review":"The product didn't mix well in the reservoir,so I shook it up, and kept spraying. I knew it wasn't applying evenly, but that was okay. Miracle-Gro doesn't burn my plants if I get a little too much on one or the other. But then the sprayer started leaking on the second use. I made sure I had the thing closed correctly and on right, but it leaked. And then the plastic switch on top where you switch from just water to water and fertilizer mix, completely quit working. I wasn't mis-using it or switching it back and forth a lot, just watered some after the fertilizer was gone, so the whole garden would be watered. Small garden. I was very disappointed, since I'd stocked up on Miracle-Gro for plants, tomatoes, etc. I love how easily it mixes and that it doesn't burn plants, but I'm afraid to try another sprayer.Does anyone know if I can just buy another sprayer/applicator and use it with Miracle-Gro?Thanks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Valve sticks open","review":"After about 5 uses the valve sticks open when I release the trigger and will not shut off.

They've greatly increased onvenience over the previous version by adding the various controls, and the handle. It's VERY hard (in this, or the previous) to actually see the water coming out as blue, but you can eventually see the water in the jar turning pale. Yes, it takes a while to fill, that's the way any of these types of sprayers work. I have no problem with leakage (I will watch for that, based on the bad reviews), mine had the washer where it belonged (if it didn't, I would have added one). The instructions for the old one said to use it for 12 minutes, and then done, even if the water was blue. These instructions imply that the mixing will take place as you spray, meaning that shaking it to dissolve the crystals is counterproductive; some clarification might help here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Miracle-Gro 100410 lawn and garden feeder","review":"Good idea but poorly made. I followed instructions and hooked the feeder to my garden hose using city water. All was good till I let go of the trigger, then water leaked badly from the handle and trigger area.

Why they put their name on something like this is beyond me"},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"This has to be the biggest waste of money for the dumbest concept of a plant feeder. My main complaint is that the thing doesn't even have an intake tube/straw to pull fertilizer into the feeder nozzle. The tank also does not fill completely. This means that you have to turn it upside down or sideways to get any fertilizer out. Next, the sprayers are horrible. My previous sprayer had a vertical fan making it easier to sweep inclined plants from left to right. It's not a big deal, because I have to keep this thing sideways to use it anyway (which means I can use the horizontal fan) haha. I also got better range on my previous sprayer. That could be partly because of the poorly designed nozzles on this sprayer, or the fact that the cheap plastic parts sometimes leak, relieving what little pressure I apply to it. I guess it's back to the old sprayer..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easier to hold","review":"My wife likes this feeder compared to couple other ones I had purchased because its easier to hold and seems very functional.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed in Scotts","review":"This product is new and replaced one that also leaked, but the old one only dripped and I managed to hot glue spots where it dripped.This one LEAKS in several places.It is unusable.I emailed Scotts and they defended the product and said they had very few complaints.I suggested they read these reviews.I guess they want us to buy the premixed products which apparently have a much higher profit margin.Anyone find something to replace this product?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm vindicated!","review":"I didn't buy this from Amazon. I bought it locally. Having used it, I thought I'd check in on Amazon just to see if anyone else had the same problems. Good grief! I wish I had read the Amazon reviews first! If the growth of the plants has anything to do with the randomness of the blue spray, every other plant will be gigantic and the others will starve. I even did the upside-down, shake, off-and-on routine that others did (funny we all tried the same things), but nothing helped.I do love the product Miracle Grow, but I don't understand how they could get the sprayer so wrong.I also got spray all over myself. I wonder if I'll get taller.

When I FINALLY got it working properly, it dribbled constantly during and in between use. I checked all washers and retightened everything to no avail. The trigger has to be contantly depressed during use, and you have to squeeze AS HARD AS YOU CAN, regardless of the water pressure. It was exhausting. Do they bother to beta test these things? The old one dribbled a little if it tipped over, but otherwise was fine. It also had one switch and stayed on without having to constantly apply pressure. I'd still be using it if the container hadn't blown away in a wind storm."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too hard to handle","review":"I much prefer the Miracle Gro 'pellets' as this contraption is too hard to handle while dragging a hose to all parts of the garden."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor idea","review":"I have used the old Model #100409 garden feeder and was pleased.

By watching the color of the discharge it is apparent the delivery of dissolved fertilizer is very inconsistent. It fluctuates from clear to blue randomly. Tilt it down and you sometimes get a short burst of dark blue. I had little confidence that individual plants and shrubs were getting proper feeding. It's also difficult to know just when to reload. My impression was that the solution became progressively dilute well before all the particles were dissolved. Frequent shaking is necessary.

Miracle-Gro makes GREAT plant foods -- but they just can't make feeders that work worth a darn. So, this is what you have to do. Step one .. don't buy it. Step two .. buy an ORTHO Dial 'N Spray Multi-Use Hose-End Sprayer. I've got two of 'em. One for weed killer, and one for Miracle Gro stuff. Pour your Miracle Gro lawn food (one packet) into the Ortho Dial Sprayer. Fill it with water. Stir with a spoon (one that you will use permanently with this sprayer) Put the lid (top) back on. Set the dial to 2 and 1/2, then hook it up to your hose and blast away.When the blue water in your container is all gone, you're done. No guessing; no turning upside down; no wondering ... period.

The most annoying feature is that unless you keep the rig totally level, the jar leaks blue liquid all over everything (yes, I tightened the crap out of the lid, to no avail). I'd work around this if the thing actually worked. Two problems: 1) though the jar filled with water as it was supposed to, I could never tell whether what was coming out of the sprayer was water only or fertilizer plus water. It was clear, not bluish; 2) At least an inch of undissolved fertilizer remains at the bottom of the jar, meaning plants aren't getting the required dose.

I wrote down the poem from the book, and had memorised it, so for the past nine years I have been able to recite it and hope that I may find this book again someday. Well worth the effort of searching for, trust me on this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"For those with an interest in Philippine or World Music","review":"This album presents an impeccable recording and beautiful instrumentation and some very pleasant vocals. Like the country itself, the music represents a mix of the hispanic, asian and malayo-polynesian sensibilities. For those who have a deeper interest in Philippine culture, this is a must-get. But also for those who love authentic musics of the world, check this out. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading title","review":"The title of this CD is misleading because what is supposed to be kulintang music, entitled Ka-singkil, Vinta, Tahing-Baila, Malong - dance accompaniment for Southern Mindanao dances are not the authentic kulintang music as played by the indigenous peoples of this region. Likewise with Dinuya - dance of the Mountain Province indigenous people. These pieces in this recording are percussion instrumentation as performed by the Bayanihan Dance Company quite different from the traditional percussion (kulintang and gangsa) music of the indigenous tribes."},{"rating":"2","title":"beckysue","review":"Bought the star version of this necklace and it was lovely.

I completely regrett that I purchased it on accident. I couldn't even listen through the whole thing. Ten seconds was enough for me to decide that it lacks creativity, sounds straight up annoying and is thus total and utter crap. I would have given it zero stars but, amazon made me put at least one.

The book's introduction says: \\"I use the terms 'nun,' 'sister,' 'consecrated woman' and 'religious' interchangeably, although there are differences according to Church canonical law.\\" (For the layperson, \\"nuns,\\" strictly speaking, are members of religious orders, usually monastic, whereas \\"sisters\\" are members of religious congregations, generally working among the people.)

If there was any original research in this book, it could not be found. Pictures were dated and can be found elsewhere in several other sources. All were all full body shots with little or no detail. Perhaps strangest was the Glossary of Church Terms, few if any were used in the body of the text. What that had to do with the main topic is still a mystery.

A refreshing family movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One Of Shirley's Most Touching Films","review":"Some people have said this is Shirley Temple's best film. It's not my favorite but I admit it is very good....and it has some of the most touching, wonderful moments of any of her films.The mean old lady, \\"Fraulein Rottenmeier,\\" played by Mary Nash, has too big a role in the second half of the movie making for a number of unpleasant scenes. I had gotten so involved with the story that I couldn't stand to see this mean woman so nasty to \\"Heidi\\" (Temple). Also, there was only one song-and-dance number and that's not enough for a Shirley Temple movie, in which we come to expect songs-and-dances.The other characters were fine. Arthur Treacher provides good humor; Jean Hersholt is great as the gruff-then-loving grandfather and Marcia Mae Jones is nice as the young invalid.This is a true classic story and ends with perhaps the most gorgeous and sweetest smile I've ever seen on Shirley's face."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wholesome/Heartwarming","review":"Shirley Temple gives a wonderful performance as Heidi, a very likable and unspoiled child. She lived with her aunt, after her parents die, for a few years. The aunt then in turn hands her off to her grandfather (Jean Hersholt), who is living in the mountains. He has a reputation of being a mean, violent, cruel man. Heidi turns the tide and his heart warms to her. Her aunt returns to steal her, sells her to a rich family to entertain an infirmed child. Heidi wants to return home, but the rich family won't allow it. In the end the grandfather finds her, she helps the infirmed child to walk again and they live happily ever after."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fox owes Shirley Temple and her fans better","review":"I've always loved this movie and was thrilled to get it on DVD but the picture quality is horrendous. This is the worst DVD I've ever seen from a major studio. The colorized version was done back in the 80's before the process was refined and it looks awful. The black and white version is even worse. It looks like someone dragged the film down the street and then transfered it to DVD. Shame on Fox for leaving this version the only one available.Postscript-I picked up the remastered release in the pink package and it's a fine transfer of the movie-about time Fox! Hopefully the rest of the good Temple vehicles will be released in as good a shape as this one. Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A CLASSIC I WATCH EVERY CHRISTMAS SEASON","review":"This is the definitive version of this movie, I have read some reviews below and would like to clear some things up. First off, this is the full feature and nothing was cut, second the print transfer is very good. Maybe there is a better print, but I have not seen it.There are only a hand full of her films that I will always remember and this is one of them. Curly Top, Bright Eyes and The Little Colonel were the others. The DVD has both Black and White and Colorized versions included. I am not a fan of colorizing anything, but since they kept the original intact, I did enjoy watching both.Now on to the film. This is a family classic that should be added to your Christmas movie collection. The film is so full of great characters and charm that it is easily watched year after year. Shirley is at her best in this beautifully crafted film about love, devotion and the Christmas spirit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heidi, starring Shirley Temple","review":"I rented this 88 min. long DVD. Very disappointed that it did not tell the same story I remember seeing as a child. It seems that Paramount has cut the original so that much of the character building scenes are no longer present. That is what really made the story of Heidi have an impact. If I had never seen it before I would be sorely disappointed in the story. As it is now, I am only disappointed in what has been done to the movie. If anyone knows of a full length version that is available, I am there! Could it be the one referred to by your other reviewer (Jake Marsico) that Fox has done?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Americanized version of a Swiss story","review":"I was pretty disappointed when I saw this movie. I have read the book, seen quite a few Heidi movies, but this one is not close to the book. The first part is ok, but the second part is totally made up.Chasings, prison, Fr. Rottenmeier is very evil and ( spoiler)tries to sell Heidi, etc.If you look for a Heidi movie that portaits the book, don't get this one. If you want a movie about Shirley Temple, this one is fine then. Being from Germany, this one dissapointed me. My favorite Heidi movie is the 1956 w/ Elsbeth Sigmund. It has a few changes from the book, but in generell is close to it and also gives you a feel of the time and place where Heidi would have lived."},{"rating":"1","title":"Miserable mis-rendering!","review":"As one who finds Johanna Spyri's \\"Heidi\\" to be one of the best children's books, I find this transition to melodrama dreadful, and totally untrue to the book's text. The independent Heidi, whose warmth and faith are such that she is fearless and completely kind, is reduced to a picture book moppet. Worse yet, characters such as Dete and Fraulein Rottenmeir, who, in the book, are respectively rather self-centred and puzzled at the lower class child, are depicted as totally wicked - ready to sell Heidi to the gypsies! Clara, who in the original is disabled more because of her elders' fear and over-protectiveness than because of her unnamed illness, now is the target of a wicked governess who has a financial interest in keeping her ill and weak.This dreadful film is suited only to those who are die hard fans of Shirley Temple."},{"rating":"1","title":"only one!","review":"The best part of this film was the scene in which she gets knocked down by a goat! LOL it was funny, that's worth a star"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Movie!","review":"As someone who loves the story Johanna Spyri created, this version of Heidi is the worst production of the story I have ever watched. Number one, it does not follow the wonderful written tale that Spyri penned. Two, the painted scenery is a real mockery of the beautiful Alps in Switzerland and three the acting is very affected, even by Miss Temple. If you want a true authentic version of this story, order the Disney DVD starring Jason Robards as the Grandfather, Patricia Neal as Peter's Grandmother, Jane Seymour as Fraulein Rottenmeyer and of course Noley Thornton who gives an outstanding performance as Heidi."},{"rating":"2","title":"SHIRLEY AS A SWISS MISS","review":"Temple is wonderful in one of her best-remembered roles as the waif who goes to live with her broken-hearted grandfather (Jean Hersholt) Both bitchy Mady Christians and Mary Nash (as the mean governess) give memorable performances as does the fragile Marcia Mae Jones as the crippled girl Heidi befriends and helps to walk again. This was just what the public wanted in 1937; 63 years later, children continue to be enchanted by this film which is based on the book by Johanna Spyri.

I have a sensitive skin prone to spots and blemishes so I stick to oil-free foundations. Usually I find them too light and with low coverage but this foundation covers perfectly well and hides any blemishes on my face. Moreover a little goes a long way so it lasts but again I have to admit that the price is rather hefty and for this reason I don't use in on a daily basis but save it for weekends and special occasions.

It tells you why YOU should repair your own credit and not pay someone else to do it. It tells you WHY you should do it. It gives a good bibliography.... but it does NOT tell you HOW to do it.

Like the above review, I know families and people like the Gallaghers. They exist, but to act it and make it believeable is another thing. William Macy, I have seen many of his movies and to be able to have his character in this series make me forget his other roles is the sign of a very, very talented man. They don't give Oscars for TV show actors, but he deserves one. He nails it, I have a friend who I went to school with and now at 59 years old could be Franks twin. Not sure if the writers of this show may have met my friend. Macy plays it to perfection.

It's one of those movies that you really have to suspend disbelief, because it's not real what-so-ever.

I really do think that the two main characters were great. It is not easy to play in a movie like this one. As you probably have noticed I have \\"only\\" given this movie 4 stars. My reason for this is, that though the film is UNBELIAVEBLE FUNNY, it is, and I think we all can agree on that, superficiel.

Dude, is absolutely ridiculous, stupid, pointless, basically, a classic stoner comedy. While it has no real point to it, it does have some pretty funny lines and that's what earns it 2 stars. In my opinion, the movie is nowhere near as raunchy as it has to be. Movies like this are based on cheap laughs, and when it's PG-13 without a single boob or F bomb, it's just nothing special. By the end the film, it was just totally out of control. I should have just turned it off, but I suffered through to the end. Basically this movie was the foundation for Harold & Kumar.

I can't wait for American Pie 2 to come out and I hope that's a lot better then this piece of [...]. This was the worst movie I have seen since The Stupids.

Most of the amusing stuff is in the trailer and even there it wasn't that amusing. And there are lots of jokes in this film that if I told you about them, they would sound humorous and like you might get a chuckle out of them. You'd be completely wrong. I didn't see Battlefield Earth, so I can't say unconditioanlly this is the worst film of the year 2000.

Sure, they don't exactly rack your brain, but they're a fun way to pass an hour and a half. Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure is one that springs to mind. It wasn't Citizen Kane, but it put a smile on your face, and maybe even made you laugh. Dude, Where's My Car? on the other hand lacks any amount of charm or humour. Not once did I laugh or find any of the protagonist's antics amusing. Their stupidity wasn't charming, it was absolutely mind-numbing. Besides, in what kind of a movie do the two main characters claim to be \\"stoners\\", but neither of them actually smoke any? The answer is a bad one. In fact, it was absolute torture to sit through this movie. After about five minutes I wished it was over. Unfortunately I saw it in the theater so I felt obligated to sit through the entire thing.

It consisted of semi funny jokes that went all entirely too long. \\"And then?\\" \\"And then?\\" \\"And then?\\" \\"And then?\\" \\"And then?\\" Yeah, we got the picture. It's not funny. I also felt like the script writers thought they were just too clever by having the characters recap the movie every 10 minutes.

While I've never watched B & B (thankfully) I still noticed a lot of juvenile B & B nonsense throughout the film. I'm all for slapstick comedy when it's done well, but this one looks like it was written by a bunch of 2nd graders. I'm sure the creators found it hilarious, but they must be the only ones.There were several points during this movie in which I debated whether or not to continue.

They then go on an adventure trying to find where their vehicle is. The plot is absolutely rediculous, but this is a comedy aimed at the teenage audience who want to waste about 90 minutes of their time. The amazing thing is \\"Dude, Where's My Car?\\" is funny. Ashton has always been known as a great comedianne and Seanne has always been wonderful in the \\"American Pie\\" films, and once they come together in this movie the results are a funny and laughable flick that makes you forget all your problems. If your a gay guy you will love the car scene in which both Ashton and Seanne lock lips for REAL!The DVD features commentary by the stars, 7 extended scenes, and a music video. Subtitles are in english and french."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dude...wheres my money?","review":"Unless your obsessed with Ashton Kutcher then there is no reason to see this movie. Its retarded and has no intresting plot line. There is no substance in this movie. Basically... its sucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Movies Like this Should Not be Made","review":"I honestly don't see the appeal in this movie. I went to see it in the theater with a friend when it first came out, and I absolutely hated it. This movie is not funny. It is not even unintentionally funny because of how dumb it truly is. It is just a movie that we sbould have been spared of. I wish I could give it less than a 'zero' rating because I cannot find the words to describe my distaste for this movie. It is a horrible waste of time and money, and I'd like to have a slittle as possible to do with it. In fact, the only reason I am writing this review is to warn anybody else interested in seeing this to give it a second thought."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the effort it's taking to write this.","review":"Every review here must have been written by a brain dead 14 year old. My brother recommended this movie to me (he was in 8th grade and I'm in college). I went with a friend and left after half an hour to go see \\"Castaway\\". THis is the only movie i have EVER walked out of. I used to think that was for pissy old parents who couldn't understand the movie. I even sat through Battlefield Earth to experience what is the worst movie of the young millenium. But this thing I could not bear to watch or listen to for it's breathtaking stupidity.Anyway when I got home I ...made (my) brother ... reimburse the 8.50 I spent on this steaming hunk of crap. Honestly if the rest of my generation finds this even remotely funny or entertaining, I worry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was This Supposed To Be Funny?","review":"If you were looking for a good comedy to make you laugh, well this movie is not it!

Dude, where is my mind?? Most likely I wanted to get away from it all, which is not much: for me it is mostly work these days.

I do not know what it is. Probably another flop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dude,Where's My Car?","review":"Dude,Where's the movie?First off we start with a ridiculous dream sequence opening.The movie itself makes you wish you were in a dream sequence.\\"Calgon take this nightmare away\\"It's too bad,because Ashton Kutcher and Sean William Scott are pretty funny in other things they've done.All in all a very dissapointing and useless experience.So if anyone says dude watch this movie,take my advice run screaming."},{"rating":"1","title":"........BUT THE ENDING WAS..............PANTS!!","review":"ITS O.K BUT THE ENDING WAS.......PANTS!!

This one has Ashton Kutcher and Sean William Scott doing the \\"Keenan & Kel\\" routine with the word \\"Dude\\" thrown in as much as possible for good measure. If you couldn't figure it out from the title, the plot centers around the two moronic leads trying to track down their missing car. The fact that this cliche-driven mess and its non-existent script got greenlit in Hollywood tells you that perhaps the crack epidemic in the movie industry is worse than we thought. By the way, Jennifer Garner shows up for a small role as one of the bonehead's girlfriends. For shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Funny, I Forgot To Laugh...","review":"This is without a doubt the most retarded movie I've ever been plagued with watching... Ashton Kutcher has the I.Q. of a steamed carrot soaked in morphine. This movie had no plot, It's like they friggin' made it up as they went along! I read a review that gave this movie FIVE STARS!!!(?) This is all they said: \\"i like this movie becuase it's cool\\".... Which shows how this movie was ment to appeal to stupid fifteen-year old boys who sniff glue. Ashton might be able to make a decent movie if he would pull his head out of his ass, and think of an actual plot!!! ASHTON KUTCHER IS A DUMB-ASS!!! Charlize Theron is an incredible actress, Marlon Brando (R.I.P) was a remarkable actor... Ashton Kutcher isn't fit to appear on Nickelodeon! Jesus Fxxking Christ, I hate Kutcher!! Don not buy this movie! I will cripple you if you buy this. Buy: Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back. Now that is funny.. Fxxk Kutcher.. He's an Idiot.P.S. Punk This!!

The prints are very, very good on all these films and certainly better than any releases by this company so far. Anybody expecting all Spaghetti Westerns will no doubt be disappointed but as a Hill/Spencer collection this is the best I've ever seen. And I've seen/bought a lot.

It may not be a big deal if you are a huge Bud Spencer and Terence Hill fan but to market this as a \\"Spaghetti Western Bible\\" and having the guys in their traditional western garb on the cover, gives you the idea that this is a DVD set of westerns when it's not.

Working Kelpies are the work force in Australia's pastoral farming system and should be given their due. By concentrating on the shorter-legged, heavier-coated and basically non-working show dogs, Mr Sloane has doen the forefathers of the Kelpie breed a serious disservice.

The book is bad I don't know where to start. Probably my biggest disappointment is in Moody's zombies. They are NOT a threat. They stumble along in almost as slowly as the pace of the book. And the book is SLLLLLLLOOOOOOWWWWWWW! The zombie threat is only in numbers. But they are NOT aggressive. Perhaps Moody is saving the good stuff for the 3rd book. I can only hope so, as I was stupid and bought books 2 and 3 together.Do yourself a favor and SKIP this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"The walking Dead and the people who love them","review":"Not the most technically sound writing in publication but very far from the worst. For zombie fans, there really is no such thing as a bad zombie story, but David Moody's work really is something special. Its not your run of the mill flesh eating frenzy type of story and that's refreshing. The Autumn novel's power resides not in their ability to disgust or in the description of violence, but in the psychological despair and utter hopelessness that would be felt by the survivors of a zombie apocalypse. Very emotional, very disturbing, utterly wonderful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read","review":"I purchased this book and was glued to it until I finished it. And once I finished it, I was sad.

I recommend to anyone who loves zombies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top notch","review":"This is a top notch series. It is post apocalyptic lit (dare I use that word?), not strictly zombie horror. Don't get me wrong, the zombies are horrifying, but this is less focused on detailing zombie violence than other series. This is more about characters' reactions to the zombie violence, and less about gore. So if all you want is gore and violence you won't like the parts of the story that advance the overall plot of how mankind reacts and how we survive. But if you want to know the answers to these two questions, keep reading !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Suspenseful & Scary, but still lacks Teeth!","review":"This book was much, much better than \\"Autumn.\\" This story had better character development (Altho, it still could have used more depth to the folks we're supposed to care about. But, still an improvement). And there was much less of folks sitting around talking and talking and talking about what they should be doing instead of doing something. I liked how we revisited the main characters from the first book. And the zombies were scary, except they didn't bite. Still, this was a great improvement and I'd be interested in reading the books that followed. This book had a good ending too. It was satisfying."},{"rating":"2","title":"MASTERFUL WRITING 10/10","review":"AUTUMN, THE CITY, takes us back to the City in AUTUMN and introduces us to not only new characters but explains the outbreak from their perspective. Cleverly done by MR MOODY, is the fact that this novel runs parallel to the first.The realism is still there, the believable characters and devoid of gratuitous violence that some novels seem to revel in, the psychological horror is far more realistic.

This is fun stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Music that stands on its own","review":"Many times, I have made the mistake of buying a CD based on the singles released to the radio and MTV, only to find that the singles are the only decent tracks. Occasionally, however, I am rewarded with a gem such as Play. When I made the purchase, I had only heard the tracks Run On and Bodyrock. Was I surprised! Those two are now my fourth and fifth favorites after Everloving, Why does my Heart Feel so Bad, and Natural Blues."},{"rating":"2","title":"The album is awesome, and still doesn't do Moby justice...","review":"I have all of Moby's albums, and with the exception of the \\"Everything is Wrong\\" remix album, \\"Play\\" is my favorite. It has everything, from folk/native indian flavor (\\"honey,\\" \\"natural blues,\\" & \\"everloving\\") to breakbeat/techno (\\"bodyrock\\" and \\"machete\\") to softer love songs (\\"porcelain\\" and \\"why does my heart feel so bad\\")to ambient (the majority of the last third of the album.)

His music truely touches your soul."},{"rating":"2","title":"multilayered and intriguing","review":"This is the best album I have heard in years!

I won't get into it, but if you knew of all of the other cds I own, you'd probably be very surprised that I not only own, but like this album. I would actually rate this cd 4 1/2 stars if I could. I really like the smash hits \\"Southside\\" and \\"Natural Blues\\". I also enjoy some of the slower songs on here as well. Also, even though I'm not a vegetarian or a vegan, I think that Moby has many great views about the world and is a class-act role model. The only reason I took off half a star was because since the album was so long, I just thought that there were some songs not good enough to be on the record."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intelligent, fun music, what an album!","review":"Brilliant music by a brilliant guy. He has original and remixed music that will simply blow you away. Moby is simply the most intelligent musician to come around since REM. He holds the listener spellbound with his mixes, his originals and his beat. Simply put, if you want to hear music that is not built for instant Top 40, corporately approved, or tweaked by producers and mixers simply to catch your attention on the radio, Moby is for you. Play it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sound god","review":"This is a truly edgy, hypnotic display of techno-trip-hop grooves backspun into the eerie cosmos of sound and rhythm. Moby has a masterful gift for song crafting and this is just pure math, formless and metaphysically beautiful. In each turntable spin and moan, groan, wail, echo you can feel the earth move in the world of imagination and soul. An enriching form of melodic dreamscape. Like a neverending dream, you pray no one wakes you up from. Moby entangles you in his universe, his extreme and patient universe with the symphonies of solar systems. He's speaking the hymns of the spirit, it's up to you to listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"impressive","review":"this may be the most relaxing, soothing, calming music i have ever heard. one of the editorial reviewers said it sounded earthy, and while i dont really know exactly what that means, it sounds right. this is worth getting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moby's layers are thick","review":"Play gives me the same 'lost' feeling when I listen to Orbit's 'Pieces'.

The album often frightens me, then I turn it off and wonder when Moby looks serious."},{"rating":"1","title":"MOBY = PLAYED","review":"Come on.

Especially, the piece on MOBY'S PLAY CD Track # 3: Porcelain. Buddhists should be aware of Moby's diveristy and interest in preserving his choice of living a life in devotion to the inner spirit and awareness of himself. Moby is a vegetarian after I read through his CD's booklet, I learned what kind of person he was. His music talks to the spirit and provides a sense of inner peace. I highly recommend this album to those who are interested in thoughtful and question answering music. Moby is truly a talented individual who seeks inner peace within himself and share this music with the world. Beautiful music!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Eclectic mix keeps you on your feet","review":"With Play, Moby has demonstrated in spades his musical talents by taking multiple influences and mixing them into a single album. I love the \\"idea\\" of what he was going for, but the product seems lacking. For some, this will be far from true. Each song is well constructed, with a good rythym that makes you want to \\"play\\", but the cacophany of ambient style music back to back with \\"techno-rap\\" doesn't work for me. Give me an album of rap or an album of ambient and I'll pick and choose; but together it feels like I've put Vivaldi and the Beastie Boys in my player and hit the shuffle button."},{"rating":"2","title":"relaxing, entertaining listening","review":"This is no hardcore techo album, but has many great tracks.

So I thought since this was #1 at the Virgin Megastore, I'd check it out. I ended up like the first track, so I bought it to further listen to it. I listened to it, and it was kind of boring, until Run On came on. Run On is simply a masterpiece. One of the best songs this year. This whole album is worth it just for Run On. But Honey and Bodyrock are also very good tracks. But almost the rest of it is kind of boring, but it is still a great CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"drivel","review":"A complete waste of time and money.

You might want to look there first.\\u0018I've only been able bring myself to listen to it a handfull of times. The album has no energy, no spark. None of the songs had that \\"play it again\\" interest. Several of the songs were of the \\"let's not go there again\\" variety.I bought other albums at the same time and they are wonderful: Olive 'Trickle', BT 'Movement In Still Life' and Delerium 'Karma'.

However, because it is techno, it's AWFUL. Every track here is about twice as long as it should be, and each gets boring after the first minute. I despise techno because it's always the same thing over, and over, and over. And over. And over. The sampling just rips off other artists, and what little new musical ingenuity exists is buried so deeply in the mix that all you hear is the damn drums and the same samples replayed indefinitely. A little bit of lyrical change would be nice too, instead of \\"Rock y'all, gonna stock y'all, to the beat y'all, the bodyrock y'all\\" twenty seven times over. And over. And over. And over. And over."},{"rating":"1","title":"simple but scary","review":"If I didn't know any better, I would think that this album was put together in a day as an afterthought. I've always been a firm believer in simplicity, but I have also been a firm believer in talent, which in the case of Moby, is nonexistant. If become a recording \\"artist\\" is this easy, what the heck an I doing? \\"Run On\\" should of been the name of all the songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"MobySignalsTheEndOfAllLifeOnEarth","review":"This review will never see the light of day, nonetheless it must be written so that hopefully it will have a negative effect on the 4 1/2 star rating Moby's album currently has. Sadly the world is ripe for the likes of Moby. Millions upon millions of mindless, musically impaired twits, who think that DJs like Moby are actually musicians, sing (out of key) the praises of this modern adaptation of The Emperors New Clothes.His album, Play, is a testament to the depths of human suffering. Surely no man could have more accurately put to disc the sea of emotions present on Play. From boredom to depression, rage (at his inability to create new music) to madness, Moby knows pain like no other man in history.That said, Mobys \\"album\\" is horrible excrement that epitomizes everything that's wrong with music today. On the other hand if you enjoy repetitious samples and funky drum beats and have an inability to whistle in tune, then Play is right up your alley."},{"rating":"1","title":"How the hell did this album get on the Best of 99!","review":"It's a moderately good dance record with a couple of stand-out tracks. It's nowhere near as good or as ground-breaking as 'Everything Is Wrong'. It's sample overload. It's a unfocused. It works in places and not in others. It's 'clever'.If you're dipping a toe into the murky waters of dance music, and you want a 'safe' CD from a North American artist to play at dinner parties, buy this. It's better than Deep Forest or Vengaboys.But seriously, how is the Best of 99 list made up? Who decides? It's like a dance music equivalent of a rock list including The Eagles, The Rolling Stones and Pink Floyd. All good acts ... but not in the running any more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unoriginal piece of boring work","review":"I bought this CD by reading the comments of few of the other reviewers and to say that I am disappointed would be less. This album in no way can be classified as Techno/Electronica or be compared to Prodigy/Chemical Brothers. Also the music is hackneyed and seems to be inspired by Enigma. Moby has lot more work to do to get into the genre of Prodigy or Chemical Brothers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed...","review":"As my title suggests, I was a bit disappointed with \\"Play.\\" Before I listened to it, I had heard so much about Moby and was expecting a treat.The one song that really delivered was \\"South Side.\\" Simply put, it sounds great. It is catchy and upbeat and has great music. I loved this song. But the rest of the album isn't as skillfully made.Songs like \\"Run On\\", \\"Honey\\", \\"Bodyrock\\", and \\"Natural Blues\\" COULD have been great, but are weighed down by excessive repetition. Eventually, it gets to be too much, and I don't even listen to those songs. Listen to the 30 second samples of those songs...and you have it all.And then, to top it off, there are those songs that are just completely horrible. I'm not sure if \\"Down Slow\\" or \\"Inside\\" can even be called songs. They don't really seem to have any sort of structure, just a few minutes of drum machine beats and wavering background music. They are just no fun at all to listen to.Get \\"South Side\\" off of iTunes and leave it at that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love ya Moby!","review":"Moby music is awesome. I pity the fool who does not like it. If you don't have it, buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Play is brilliant","review":"Play is probably the best album I've ever heard in my life, though I admit I wasn't too happy about the song Honey when I first heard it. The brilliance falls into place when you realise that the looping vocals and the background pianos aren't done in the same studio all at once. Find My Baby is okay.Arguably the best songs on the album are Porcelain (one of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard), South Side (ditto, but only for the Gwen Stefani version), Everloving (a three minute instrumental piece that blew me off), and My Weakness (which sounds like a group of children singing).Creating your own music is good, but remastering other's into a masterpiece is better."},{"rating":"2","title":"finished sympathy","review":"Moby finally achieves his potential, on Play he gathers everything he has done before together ('cept maybe the thrash) and blends it into an excellent, ecclectic chill out album. The stand out track (why does my heart...) is a perfect partner to the greatest dance tune of all time - Massive Attack's beguiling Unfinished Sympathy"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stalked by the Universe","review":"His name is not Moby for nothing. Underlying the irony of \\"Play\\" Moby knows he is being hunted by Ahab. Like few people he agonizes between the ties of the body and the call of heaven, always trying to pull off a reconciliation. We are angels with one wing always searching, searching for that other half so we can fly. But creatures with one wing can only fly in a circle. Hence the deep melancholy in many of the cuts. Even on the cover he is trying to leave the earth but by the end of this work he stands mute on the back cover. Then again i could be wrong, what do you think JD?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Producers everywhere take note!!","review":"From the point of view of a producer - this album is a masterpiece. The official amazon review (posted above) is right on the money! As for the next review - sure, fat boy slim is more top 40 oriented, but that's not the point here. Don't buy this album thinking you're going to hear a ton of radio hits - buy this album knowing you're taking home a truly superb work of musical art. (of course, it's fun to kick tha' jams on \\"Bodyrock\\" too!!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hey, beautiful !","review":"Track #2 & #17 are definitely my favourites bringing manly sounds/lyrics representing the hunting for love/sensual feelings.

Awesome!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Has been","review":"This was such a great album when it came out, but maybe I just got sick of hearing the songs played over and over again in commercials. It's just not happening any more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could've Been Better","review":"I listened to 30 second clips of every song on this CD that this website would let me and I was dissappointed because I REALLY wanted to hear that pretty song on that one car commercial. I really like that song but I don't know what it's called or anything else about \\"Moby\\" except that he or that band is totally warped and psycotic...Although these charateristics may seem too vile to display the overall effort put into this CD being noticible; I feel that a 5 star rating thoroughly represents the talent and foreward recognition of this wonderful band. Figuratively Speaking"},{"rating":"1","title":"Snooze tunes","review":"drool continues to fall-out my mouth, for this is unoriginal, insulting to women, and the same old tires blues-rip-off, vomit-inducing flava of mtv."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste Of Money.","review":"The only half decent song on this CD is \\"South Side,\\" and probably the only reason that song is half decent is because Gwen Stefani sings most of it. The other songs are just plain horrible. No excitement, no nothing. Listen to more than two minutes of this and expect to be asleep. Moby can't even sing. This CD is pure trash. I'm sorry I ever bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"not as good as all that","review":"this album - overated? yes. Overhyped? yes. overplayed? yes.are there any redeeming features? yes. the end.short, but to the point, this album is overated tripe, worthy of nothing but burning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shame.....","review":"It's such a pity that so many 'top' artists today have to rely so heavily on the work of others. How can sampling the work of someone else be classed as original? Once again, this is an album created more from the effort and skill of others than from any new input. Sure, it's well put together, and it does have it's moments, but sadly, they owe their origins to other artists rather than Moby."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow...","review":"So I finally downloaded this entire album because of all I heard about it. Yet another shining example of why I should never trust mass opinion when it comes to music. Firstly, this is not techno. If you want techno, go listen to Underworld or Juno Reactor. This is ambient / electronic with soul / R&B samples. A rather intresting idea, but it comes off as remarkably cheesy and not very catchy either.If self-help books came with musical accompinaments, this is what they would sound like. Nice non-thought provoking, non-challenging background music for the masses to lap up. Yum!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fades Fast","review":"Initial I loved this CD, but it didn't last. Soon the tracks started to grate and seem just a to predictable and calculated. Maybe I'm being unfair, I am comparing to Leftfields Leftism, which still sounds original and fresh 6 years on. Compared to them Moby is twiddling in the sandpit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drowning in the stuff","review":"I, a techno fan, hate it. My two best friends, who are avid blues fans, hate it. The songs drag on forever. In fact, the only good thing about this album is the Bodyrock. An Moby's shiny little head."},{"rating":"1","title":"Certainly does not belong in the \\"techno\\" section","review":"I do not understand why Moby's music is always placed in the \\"techno\\" section. For those of you looking for some high energy, up-beat electronic music, this is not the CD to buy. Upon first listening to Play, I was shocked. The whole CD is incredibly bland. Most of the music has very little keyboards in it at all. Play belongs more in the R&B or even Easy Listening category than anywhere else. In addition to the mellow music, the samples thrown in everywhere are repetitive and annoying at times. If you are in the mood for something slower and different though...you may want to give Play a listen. There are a few tracks that are OK if you like Ambient/Contemporary music, but it's still not enough to warrant a purchase in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE MAN HAS ARRIVED","review":"First of all, those who rank this album anything less than a five haven't a clue. This album teases the senses of all music genres. Full of beat, soul, and sounds, Moby has proven himself a musical genius. I cannot recall a time when so many tracks off one album (all of them if i am not mistaken) have been used for commercials and/or sountracks. Eclectic, for sure........ingenious, without a doubt. You will find yourself listening to this album, track after track after track. Without a doubt, his strongest album, and easily one of the overall best albums in the last five years."},{"rating":"2","title":"OHHH LORDY! Is this CD great or what!","review":"For those of you who have followed Moby, ROCK ON! For those of you who have just found out about him on a commercial, movie, or MTV...WELCOME to the FABULOUS world of MOBY! This man is outstanding! This CD really doesn't sound like his others... it has a lot of different styles that Moby can just throw at you when you're not looking... The Sky Is Broken touches me deep down... his voice... the words... PURE POETRY! If you're looking to give Moby a try, I recommend this CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A new take on techno music","review":"This is one of my favorite records now. This is a new direction for techno music. It is essentially Moby's take on the blues. It samples old field recordings and jazz records and makes them into songs that only amplify the feelings expressed in the original samples. By just using one or two lines throughout a whole song, it still makes an amazing emotional impact. this is a landmark album"},{"rating":"2","title":"ImMOBYlized","review":"I'll never stop thanking a friend of mine who almost chained me to the chair and forced me to listen to this astonishing cd. imMOBYlized! I just couldn't believe to my ears: past & future merged together, neither techno nor dance, this is the sound of a \\"pure\\" heart guided by a thoughtful mind! GREAT"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Defintive Album of the 90's","review":"In an era dominated by Grunge and Hip-hop, Moby managed to create an album which will arguably be placed on the best list of the 90's. He introduced the Blues to Electronica and made it commercially trendy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes! Moby!","review":"I have to tell you I haven't heard one single song by moby that I did not like.

I am still listening to it. It does not get old. It may NOT be musically ingenious; it may NOT be advancing music... but it does make me happy. Let me clarify that last statement with an example:I am upset;I listen to this Cd;I am no longer upset;Very few CDs have this effect on me (Grover Washington's Winelight being the only one that surpasses it). Not ALL the tunes on here are great. But about 2/3 of them are, IMHO... and seeing that there are 18 songs, that means you get around 12 good songs. For me 12 good songs = 1 good CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"shares the art in dance","review":"I like this album especially \\"Porcelain\\" and \\"Run On\\" I have the new one too, but I have to say he's my favorite dance/rock artist out today \\"Play\\" is a good experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another hit","review":"Nothing like anything Moby has done before, it is a great album still, I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Dance Album","review":"This is a great dance album from 'Moby'. \\"Why Does My Heart Feel So Bad?\\", \\"Run On\\" and \\"Body Rock\\" are really cool dance songs.

'Play' is fantastic. 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"60's & 70's Rhythm Revisited","review":"Like James Taylor, Joni Mitchell, Barry White? I'm nearly 50 and this is one of the best CD's I've heard in a long time. Wonderful driving music, ethereal melodies, sexy beat--The Sky is Broken is tops. The CD photos of Moby mask the real gifts in this album. I think it will be timeless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Booorrriiinng","review":"This is one of the most boring albums I've ever heard. I've read some of the reviews, and this is not even close to techno/trance/electronica. Not only that, but most of the album wasn't even done by Moby. It's old recycled stuff with a bassline and drum beats spliced in. It does have its redeeming songs like Porcelain, Natural Blues, and the radio-friendly, Bodyrock, but on the whole, this is NOT the album its been hyped up to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"music for car commercials","review":"i don't have this cd, but it was playing everywhere between mid-1999 and early 2001 - in stores, on tv, at work.....this is just \\"pretty\\" music that takes itself way too seriously. it's nothing original either."},{"rating":"1","title":"who knew?","review":"who knew that there was such a big audience for 93 style trip hop and adult lite jazz. i would recommend just about any electronic cd over this one. Hell, I would even recommend jock jams over this cd.MOBY is serious wack. he failed at his late attempt at switching to grunge rock and now hes jumped back into dance music with a seriously dated style. i gues there are a lot of people who have no clue about dance and electronic music. very dissapointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacks imagination and very uninspiring","review":"I'll try to be even handed about this album. On one hand I accept it is very pleasing to the ear and has sold millions of copies. But does that make it a good album?To many people I'm sure it does, but to me it doesn't. For, in essence, all Moby has done is taken samples of old blues tracks and placed a drumloop and some piano melodies underneath, there's nothing good about that. In fact it's very, very lazy.Now I do accept he has done it very well but that doesn't change my opinion. I'm not totally against sampling, but he does it on nearly every track with no use of innovation, then what's the point? At least DJ Shadow knows how to 'use' a sample.The way Moby has shamelessly sold the rights of every track on this album, bar one, to advertisers means also you have probably heard every track already, therefore you may not need to purchase this 'recycled' album.Well of course it's upto you, but I prefer the originals!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Moby CD","review":"I like Moby but when I purchased this CD I listened to the songs and could not find one that I liked.

Unfortunately, in my opinion, they are the ONLY tracks worth listening to on the entire c.d.. Two tracks out of eighteen... Pretty sad average if you ask me.That is, of course, unless you like listening to old blues and gospel remixed with a techno-feel.But I do have to give credit to his label for picking \\"Bodyrock\\" as the first, and so far only, single to be released. Had they picked from the other anthing-but-sweet-sixteen pieces of trash, I honestly don't think that the c.d. would have sold more than 100 copys.But, to each their own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Electronicrap","review":"lets put it this way: if you want to buy the juggling alchemists under the black light, or IFO by etnica/pleiadians, you can expect to pay hundreds of dallars. probably more if you want it on vinyl, or care about condition. i just saw a mint condition IFO on vinyl up for sale for a fitting $604.00. (goa). it's not a limited edition vinyl, it's not signed, it doesn't have extra tracks, most if not all of their fans have a downloaded version of it on their harddrives, and it's not pressed from solid gold. it's just a regular old IFO album. and people will buy it for that price. they will buy it because the pleiadians/etnica are genius. no one's spending $604.00 on a moby album. at this point you may be thinking that no album is worth hundreds of dallars. if so, that's because you listen to moby, and think play is a good album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"I was dinning with some friends of mine when I took a liking for the track that the bartender was playing.

To me, most of the first few tracks are unlistenable. The best song on the album, South Side, is terrific. A wonderful duet with Gwen Stefani of No Doubt, South Side can find a place in everyone's library of music.Porcelain is another good song, with a very relaxing string orchestra, and although it may not be better than South Side, it delivers very well.Don't be the album, just buy those two songs.It'll save you money and stress."},{"rating":"1","title":"Noise","review":"When I first listened to this album, I was startled to hear raspy voices and clunky piano sounds combined into what sounded like obnoxious noise. I thought, \\"The whole cd can't be like this.\\" I was right: the rest of the songs are even worse. Moby has taken samples of gospel singing and thrown them together with syrupy, maudlin new-age sounds. The gritty texture of gospel voices does not compliment the wimpy, synethesized \\"muzak\\" - somehow, the ill-fitting combination makes both styles seem ludicrous. The best way to enjoy this music is from under the influence of some kind of mind-altering substance - but only if you're the type who enjoys having a bad trip."},{"rating":"1","title":"mosy","review":"this is a commercialized ambient album suited for a soundtrack. i couldn't see someone wearing headphones and having a listen to \\"play\\". however this lackluster sound of moby's, complements the products it provides a soundtrack to, rather well.with little phonic creativity and a lot of factory-setting sound, i suggest you do not play \\"play\\". press stop then eject."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just another CD for a collection..","review":"Well, I gave this CD a listen and it became just that, merely another CD in the collection.

Those that accuse Moby of ripping off blues/gospel are in one word..jealous! Sorry you nay-sayers didn't think of it first.

Always deep, always thought provoking, \\"Play\\" should be a part of everyones music collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible","review":"Moby takes incredible beats and mixes it with classic blues and folk vocals to create a terrific CD.

An amazing moment in cinema history. I remember hearing snippets of this disc all over the place-way before I knew it was Moby. Finally, all the hype got to me I guess, and I bought it. I was not disappointed. This is a wonderful collage of old rustic blues samples, heavy beats, and melancholy keyboard work. I'm not sure I go quite as far as some in praising this disc, but it is mighty good. There are a few throw-away tracks for me, but on the whole it is solid and compelling. A MUST."},{"rating":"2","title":"takes the R.L. Burnside approach to a poppier level","review":"This album is a spirited blend of old blues styles with electronica. It kind of reminds me of R.L.

This is not as tough as R.L.'s record but it is still a great record."},{"rating":"2","title":"everything is RIGHT on this CD","review":"This is what music means. Moby manages through (really pretty sparse) beats and samples to evoke a whole range of emotions on this excellent CD. Bought it for \\"Porcelain,\\" which is excellent, but other highlights include \\"Why Does My Heart Feel So Bad,\\" \\"Natural Blues,\\" \\"Bodyrock,\\" the very beautiful \\"My Weakness,\\" and I have to mention my personal amazola song, \\"The Sky Is Broken,\\" which is basically Moby talking ina dark, moody voice over a naked background beat that shows up once in a while to punctuate the spooky darkness that Moby creates. Sounds like it should be in an episode of the X-Files. Maybe it was and I missed it. After that, Moby basically weeps through the music on \\"My Weakness\\" 'S a brilliant album. Definitely reminds you that sure, you can sing along to Brittany, but real music will evoke emotions in you. In this area Moby scores bigtime."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moby's Tour de Force","review":"Moby's latest CD \\"Play\\" is an incredible collection of music that moves your feet, mind and heart. There's not a weak cut on the album, although a couple of the songs come in at under 2:00 long. I'm hard to please when it comes to music and this is the finest I've heard in YEARS. Buy it and love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great surprise!","review":"I bought this CD without having any idea what to expect. I had never heard of Moby. I simply had read a review of the \\"Best CD's of the Decade\\", which cited Spin Magazine's claim that Moby's PLAY was within the top 10. Well, I felt brave. Willing to take a risk and try something different (I loved Fatboy Slim, so I figured, what the hey), I bought it. LOVED IT IMMEDIATELY. What an excellent CD. And as some other reviewers stated already, you can't put a label on Moby's style of music. I recently caught part of an HBO \\"Reverb\\" during which Moby made an appearance. I can only hope that he will return to Columbus for a repeat performance. He is so talented. Multi-dimensional. This CD is great for anyone who wants something a bit different. It's fun, funky, mellow, everything in between."},{"rating":"2","title":"Generally, it's an exceptional CD","review":"Moby is a genius when it comes to creating, mixing and layering sounds. Some songs on this CD exude with a ghostly nostalgia,(track 4 and track 18) echoing the kind of emotions that feel more and more surreal as they intensify. He also manages to create frantic, fast-paced beats without resorting to the kind of audial flashiness that sound like they belong at some dance club. \\"Play\\" is by turns soothing in it's simplicity, beguiling in it's originality, and rousing in it's sensationalism. I was really impressed with the way Moby's songs unfold in a very natural way, the noises and sounds entwine gracefully 100% of the time. You don't have to be a techno fan to appreciate this kind of music, it's pretty much a mood language that anyone can indulge in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Play on!","review":"I bought this CD because I read on this web page that this was the best selling CD and there was a lot of good reviews. I have never bought or really heard Moby before but I have read some interesting stuff about him. Right away I recognized a couple of songs. I noticed when browsing for some new techno that many people who bought the CDs I did, also bought this one. My friend told me \\"its kinda slow at first so give it a listen to\\". Personally I like the first few songs the best. They are worth the price of the CD. I think the end gets a little slow. Good sound on this recording - excellent production from beginning to end! Good music to get the ladys dancing. Good music to chill with your woman (like smoke some hoochy and get your groove on, ya know what I'm sayin?) then after y'all have been at it for a while, the end kinda mellows out as you smoke your last cigarette and go to sleep. I want to buy some more Moby!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like the samples that Amazon has provided, buy it!","review":"I'm a stick-in-the-mud who doesn't stray far from my favorite genres of classical, big band, and swing, so I was reluctant to give in to my son who HOUNDED me to buy this CD after hearing \\"My Weakness\\" on The X-Files. Well folks, Moby's music has knocked me off my center--the music is full of tradition and innovation, blended beautifully. It feels like warm day with friends. I cannot stop playing it. Please try this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant and Hypnotic","review":"Finally there is an artist who know's how to describe what it is like to fall in love."},{"rating":"2","title":"score","review":"this is an excellent album for anyone. its definitely a two part album, with the first half filled with the unique field holler/blues sampling, the second with slower and more emotional tracks. watch for porcelein, southside (good guitar solos), bodyrock, if things were perfect, and inside."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"This album is enough to make you want to go to sleep. With the exceptions of tracks 1,5,7, and 9 (which rock and save the album)this album just drags on and on with boring ambient techno (which is cool, but the ambient techno on this album is just a waste of Moby's talent). Moby's worst album in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Most of the reviews I've read say that this is Moby's best album. I think that Everything is Wrong is a much more interesting and varied album. Play is too long, and the songs all tend to run together. I have never been able to listen to the whole thing, because frankly, it gets a little tedious. It's true that on the tracks like Honey, Find My Baby and Run On, where Moby samples blues and gospel vocals, the CD really picks up some steam. Unfortunately those tracks don't really represent the entire album. Check out Everything is Wrong if you're just coming to Moby's music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Moby takes a great idea out back and shoots it","review":"Is this the dullest CD of all time? I'm not sure, but it certainly is a candidate. Moby is on to a great idea -- the combination of found sound sources with beats -- but the problem is that this is well-tread ground. Many many many have been here before. Moby adds nothing to the genre. His source material is also mined from the same veins that have been used so much before. This is kind of like Fat Boy Slim -- but not as catchy.There is a great record yet to be made with this concept. This isn't it."},{"rating":"1","title":"One huge R.L.BURNSIDE ripoff--the rest pretentious drivel","review":"Another overrated record. Moby found some old blues recordings and slapped them on top of disco, probably because they are in the public domain and he doesn't have to pay any royalties. Sure he's ripping off the man, just like all the white boys of the past, and all the kids will buy it not knowing where to find the real thing.

All tracks are good-sounding, maybe not lyrically enlightening, but a good album to simply hear. Forget listening to it, but most music of this genre isn't really big on lyrics. Overall, a good purchase--worth the purchase price"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cannot stop listening to this brilliant CD","review":"I buy lots and lots of CD's all year long. To be quite frank, most are a disappointment, a few good tracks (if we're lucky) and the remainder is filler. NOT THIS ONE! This could be my all-time favorite CD of the year. Get over to your listening stations and you'll hear what I mean. One listen and you can't stop. BRAVO MOBY! To everyone else, ENJOY."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ambient/Techno with Soul!","review":"Moby creates a sensual audio masterpiece with this album. The tracks herein are both groov-alicious (\\"Honey\\") to thoroughly meditative (\\"Guitar, Flute, and String\\"), so there's a little bit of everything for anytime. With Play Moby proves that you can use synth and turntables to express desire, sorrow, and hope.This album is constantly being listed in the top 20 or 25 albums of the 1990s; there's a good reason for this, and it came out at the very end of the decade. I see it as a nice musical closure to the 90s, so don't miss it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must-have.","review":"This is a must-have album. I bought this album for one song, and that song is \\"Natural Blues\\". I never really paid attention to the other tracks until I listened to it in a CD player that can't fast-forward through tracks, and let me tell you, this is AWESOME. I ended up liking most of the tracks. I'm a fan of R&B, Pop, and Rock, and this album has all of those, not to include some of the sweet sounds of ambient music (that i've just discovered with this album). Stand-out tracks: Find My Baby, Porcelain, Southside, Bodyrock, Natural Blues, Outside, and My Weakness."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST ALBUM OF '99","review":"I cannot get this CD out of my player!

The piano flourishes are in no way clever or interesting. This is merely ho-hum dance hall stuff without any real depth. You want enlightenment? Check out ANYTHING by Orbital; they understand and employ technology and polyphony better than just about any group. Also, Moby's proselytizing in the liner notes are just so annoying!"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed in the lack of \\"content\\"","review":"This album is just awful. I bought it expecting something completely different, like content. It's just a series of sampling tracks, as if Fatboy Slim teamed up with the mid 90's group \\"Beautiful People\\" for a duets album. It has one redeeming quality...I think it would be a valuable resource for an avertising exec for commercial music. I recognized two tracks that are currently background music in TV commercials. And don't get me started on the liner notes. Moby missed their audience with my purchase. My dog liked it though, he's crunching on it now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ehhhhh...","review":"Moby chose samples dripping with soul, and threw sterile beats around them. The work was already done for him. He didn't write a lot of this, he just arranged cute little sound collages. Yee haw. This record should come off as blasphemous, but it is just an honest, silly record."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good stuff","review":"A friend of a friend got me listening to Moby and I really enjoy \\"Porcelain\\", \\"Why does my heart feel so bad?\\" and \\"Honey\\" to name a few.

The fact that it's so popular just proves how bad pop music has become and how little people actually listen to music.

Maybe it was my bad for not doing more research, but Play is boring to me and I hope I can help others with my taste avoid it.If you are looking for upbeat electonic stuff, (Prodigy Fat of the Land and Orbital II are my favs) stay far away from this.

Some girl begged me to pop it into my cd player one day when this album was still kinda fresh. I heard Moby was dorky, but I actually liked some songs from here like Porcelain, Machete, GuitarFluteString, and the last one. I thought a couple songs from Everything is Wrong were decent too. Now I heard a live rave album that I downloaded by Moby from Audio Galaxy from a few years back... NOW THAT WAS GOOD. Moby should stick to that type of stuff because otherwise his stuff all sounds the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"play","review":"after listening to this album a couple of time, I got so sick of hearing it, it not one of those albums that grows in appreciation the more u listen to it, the only half decent tracks, would b towards the end. i can just say-i',m glad i got it off a friend because it's not worth paying the money for. it blues with a facelift that didn't seem to work out too well."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Everloving\\" is a rip off of The Cure's \\"Apart\\"","review":"Hello Readers-Now I know why I was hypnotized by the sound of Moby's \\"Everloving\\". If you're a Cure devotee like me, you'll notice that if you sing \\"Apart\\" to the beat of \\"Everloving\\" it fits perfectly. Now I don't know if Moby had \\"Apart\\" in mind when he composed \\"Everloving\\", but it sure sounds like it. Either way it's a great instrumental w/ a tinge of new wave/gothic-just like The Cure!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Most Overrated Album Of 1999","review":"Upon getting this album I was incredibly exited because of all the good hype that I had heard. However little did I know that I was in for a horrible disappointment. This album is terrible. The only reason that people rave about it so much in my opinion is that they think that it is \\"new\\" and \\"fresh,\\" when infact it was a poorly made album by a poor artist. Moby takes old southern gospel tracks and tries to turn them into some sort of \\"original techno.\\" Instead all he has done is take a bunch of dated songs that aren't very good to begin with and do what he does best, make them sound worse. Every Moby album that I have ever heard has been painful to my ears and Play seems to keep the tradition alive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Moby's Repetitive Hand Gesture","review":"The only track worthy of praise (and 2 stars) on this album is the ephemeral \\"Porcelain.\\" Everything else is just remixed computer-samples spun a few hundred times too many. Put some old gospel and blues songs in a Roland washing machine and this is what you get.B o r i n g . . .You'd think someone with only one name would be more interesting. \\"Play\\" is an example of what happens when you sign with the big money record producers. Pop goes the weasel..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just really terrible","review":"At first I kinda liked the album although it wasn't much to listen to . After a few more listens it just fell apart . Added to this was that the feeling you had heard all the songs before and by now it had really begun to grate on your nerves . It has the feeling of one song been sped up and slowed down and there are incidental words just thrown across it every now and then without thinking of the consequences . If you are a pop loving soul , then by all means buy this album ( if you haven't got it already ). If like Eminem ( which I also don't like but I think he's got a point with Moby ) then just don't listen to this . If you are looking for some really nice ambient dance music may I suggest The Orb or Boards Of Canada .

I can't deny that he's terribly influencial to the rest of the techno/dance/electronica world. After listening to Honey and Run On, I wouldn't be surprised if we hear more music like this from other artists. Play is another fine album with music similar to that of his album Everything is Wrong, one of his absolute finest. And his social comments found in the insert are always a treat to read since I couldn't agree with them more. Props to you, Moby."},{"rating":"2","title":"'E's done it again.","review":"Another unbelievably brilliant album from techno's self-professed Little Idiot. Much is being made about Moby's sampling of old-time R&B and folk recordings on this record; sure, they're fantastic pieces of work (and for me personally the most fulfilling-- \\"Run On\\" is just SO damn catchy), but if you're some kind of bizarre techno-purist then you've got plenty to go on with PLAY, from the fast-paced cascade of \\"Machete\\" to the sprawling electro-rock brothers-gonna-work-it-out fable \\"South Side\\". I sound like some kind of propaganda machine, but heck, maybe I am; God knows this album deserves promoting. Listen and buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"MOBY KICKS SO MUCH ***!!","review":"I am a huge fan of Moby and I love this CD. It's a little different from his earlier stuff but it's amazing anyway.

Yes, I thought the album was interesting the first time I listened to it, but the novelty wears off quickly. Any CD that, during your third time listening to it, you start skipping to the next track halfway through the song because you've HEARD ENOUGH OF THE SAME THING, ALREADY, needs to get dropped off at your nearest CD trading post ASAP. For electronica that truly moves body and soul, check out UNDERWORLD, and leave the ponderous, pretentious Moby on the shelf for the next sod."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of unrealized potential","review":"I bought this thinking I'd like it a lot. Every review I read made it sound like the type of music I'd like to own, esp. the idea that this was groundbreaking genre bending man-machine melding music. The clips sounded good too. Unfortunately, the clips pretty much summed up the album, and when I stuck it into my stereo expecting more content than a few 30 second real audio samples could provide (which I usually get, even from albums I don't like) I was disapointed. Moby takes some good ideas and goes nowhere with them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vastly overrated","review":"I bought this CD and was struck by how souless it is.

I wanted a clock with butterflies and they are difficult to find. I paid about $30 for it and I could have gotten a better quality clock at Target for $5. The clock was poorly built,noisy,and we could see through the faceplate to underlying numbers that had nothing to do with the clock. The first clock I received stopped working after 24 hours. I emailed the company to request my money back. The owner of the company contacted us by phone and email to resolve the problem. We should have insisted on our money back but we thought the owner was being fair so we accepted the replacement. The replacement clock unsurprisingly was just as bad as the first and now we have it in our garage where we don't care if it is poor quality. I wish the company had better quality clocks since the owner was obviously concerned about making his customers happy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long Lasting Ott Lite","review":"I received this OTT Lite around 1999 or 2000 and to this day, I haven't changed the lightbulb once and it still works!

I spend my time studying 4 to 5 hours at a time on week days. Lately I've noticed that my skin specially around my hands start burning when I'm doing work under the lamp. I tried placing it further away but the burn slowly built up as long as the lamp was turned on near by. Once I made this connection I immediately unplugged it and started using my old regular lamp and what do ya know, no more burning skin. It's a shame because I really liked the quality of the light, kind of like sun light. Unfortunately it seems to carry similar radiation properties because the skin burn from the lamp feels just like a skin burn from the sun.

I bought this particular Ott light because it mentioned in the product description( in fact, in three places) that the lamp could be attached to a wall.It cannot be attached to a wall unless you want the light to face straight up. There is a keyhole type hole in the base of the light for a screw to attach it to the wall, but it is in the wrong place, and there is no way to change it. Wish I had known that, I would have bought some other type of light. Customer Service got back to my query right away, but said that they did not advertise using the light by attaching it to a wall. Hope they remove that part of their manufacturer's description. Otherwise, the light is bright and the fixture is good looking, it just can't be attached to a wall."},{"rating":"2","title":"I may not need new glasses!","review":"I'm back here to order another Ott desk/task lamp.

That only lasts a few seconds, like most of the concert footage.This DVD is a documentary of the Syd Barrett years and a very entertaining one at that. It's well worth adding to your collection if you're a Floyd fan.The bonus features are interesting, but could have been much better. Concert footage (featuring entire songs, not snippets) from the early days of Floyd would have been perfect to add, and would make this DVD a 5-star masterpiece.

Lucky in Love is bound to have you going 80 in a matter of no time. This is one of my first true blues CD's that I have ever owned. Tommy Castro gives all his energy into this CD. He also has one hell of a voice, and when the sax gets played with it, you can feel the soul and power that he has. Every song on here, is worth giving a listen to. I'll tell you one thing, this is definitely worth your money!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's groovin, it's blues and it's great","review":"Hey all, don't listen to that first *one star* case of mistaken identity. Tommy Castro is the REAL DEAL, one of the hottest performers anywhere in today's BluesWorld. Sure, he may not be the songwriter of your dreams, he might not be the guitar slinger that keeps young boys awake at night... but he is the total package that hooks you solid, sinks his passionate blues blend hook smack dab into your soul while makin' your body wiggle and toes a-tappin' all night long. See him live and you'll know what us TCer's already know - he's one of the funkiest, tightest and hip blues/soul/funksters around. That's it, buy everything he has out (they're all great) and hit the highway with the volume control maxed out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Electrifying!","review":"This cd should bring The Tommy Castro Band all the recognition they deserve.

It somehow looses all its rythum after getting started, and sounds like a pop singer trying to find what the blues are.

Don't buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This game is bad","review":"I bought it thinking it would be a great game, not knowing Titus' lousy reputation. When i got it home and started playing it i was supprised at how bad it was. How bad? Only some of the cars are licensed, and all the other ones are real cars but the physics are way off. No damage, and when you ram into another car, that car doesn't slow down' you just bounce of. When you hit a tree, the tree bounces of the ground and disapears. What really stumped me was how on the back of the game CD, there is a picture of a Porsche Boxter and a Shelby Cobra racing. Well guess what! Niether one of those cars are available in the game! The worst part is the graphics. You'd be better off with Mario Cart for Super NES for good graphics! Do not buy this game! I bought it, and i traded it in for Test Drive 6. If you already bought it, I suggest you do the same thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could Be Better","review":"The game was almost unfinished, like they had to get it out by a certain deadline.

Roadsters is by far the worst gameavailable for the Dreamcast. Potential buyers beware, the cover artis the only thing this game has going for it.The graphics and sound are terrible, but what really irritates me is the pathetic play action. It's almost like trying to play a video game that's on demo mode. You have minimal control at best. Nasty stuff. Don't even rent it.Crazy Taxi and Speed Devils are much better driving games for the Dreamcast, buy those instead of Roadsters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much to offer","review":"Roadsters has poor control, and the graphics dont push the Dreamcast. It has a pretty good concept, but everything else is bad.Buy a game like Metropolis Street Racer, Tokyo Xtreme Racer, or one of the Crazy Taxi's instead of this."},{"rating":"1","title":"could be better","review":"This game is alright. The turning is practically impossible using a controller. I suggest getting the steering wheel hook up thing. The boards are cool and the cars are better, but the gameplay is pretty difficult."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"Yes I like racers, and I love my Dreamcast. However I am very underwhelmed with this title. The graphics are sub par for a DC title. The car handling is pretty spotty, nowhere near Sega Rally 2. Yes there are some neat jumps/shortcuts and weather effects, but that has already been done on Speed Devils, which was released months ago and is far better than this title. The \\"attitude\\" of each driver is only a couple of highly annoying and VERY repetive 3 word phrases. Nothing special here.Why did I buy it? - well I was hoping for decent 4 player racing. I tried it out, and it is no good. You just cannot see the track ahead in the tiny window, so it is too frustrating to race. Revolt is a much better 4 player racer despite the tricky handling.Overall this is not a recommended game. It has some redeeming points, but is not as good as the other racers released months ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kinda dated","review":"This DVD set is geared towards older high school students or college students wanting a review. It moves quickly through a lot of excellent information. It would be good for an individual review where frequent pausing is possible. It is also dated. It doesn't mention the Bush/Gore election in its examples of a candidate winning the popular vote but not the electoral college vote. It also uses Geralidine Ferraro as its only example of a woman running for an executive office. And there's no mention of any minority candidates."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very useful review!","review":"I got this for my GED/high school students to review their history in preparation for the social studies exam.

Like the other reviewers, my phone sporadically and frequently goes into channel search mode, which breaks up phone conversations. Intolerable.

In fact, this was my first disappointment with cordless phones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of ...","review":"This phone is a piece of .... It beeps at people when you're on the phone, which causes a moment of silence. The battery is terrible!

Do not buy this phone; you will be very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"jog dial runs away","review":"I bought this phone quite a while ago. It was great at first, but now the jog dial has just gone crazy. The slightest touch causes it to jump wildly (or not move at all), rendering it close to useless. I rarely get channel searching or static as some others have mentioned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality Product","review":"I've had great luck with a Panasonic and decent luck with a Uniden, but based on bad reviews, I went with the Sony. I've had it about 1 month and it's working great. Caller ID works fine, clear calls, and you can understand messages on the answering machine. I would like to be able to have the names that I enter for cell numbers, etc. appear instead of just the callers' number with the state. The price was also a bit steep, but all in all, I'm very satisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"People Can't Hear Us!","review":"I have never had more people complain that they cannot hear us than with this phone! The sound quality is horrible. Whenever I call home I have to tell my husband to speak up until he's practically shouting. The same is true for incoming calls. I can't say that I hear static, and I'm not aware of the channels changing. People voices are just muffled, like they're talking through a wall. Also, as another reviewer mentioned, the caller ID has some quirks, and doesn't always show a new call. The answering machine also cuts out frequently. There are many features with the caller ID and number storage, but they are not very user friendly. Overall, this is the worst phone I've ever had."},{"rating":"1","title":"A phone that rots","review":"Very similar experience to most other reviewers here. It started out great, with some \\"fuzz\\" on the receiver's sound but still clear and audible. I used it happily for many hours of teleconferencing. Now it mysteriously drops out frequently, the voice quality has degraded, and the battery runs out too quickly. We've only had it for 6 months or so, and it is too soon for it to be ... out like this. I would give it a chance and buy a new battery, but from the other reviews here it sounds futile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good phone","review":"This phone didn't meet our expectations. We used it in the kitchen for a long time, and found that it is very hard to get clean, even with normal cleaning fluids.Battery life is an issue for this phone. Two new batteries lasted 9 months before they wouldn't hold a charge.When power goes out, there is no electronic memory for time, so when we have a power outage, which is frequent, we have to reset the clock. The outgoing message doesn't erase, so why not the clock???There is no speakerphone capability either."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor sound, quality","review":"Bought this phone several years ago; should have returned it at once. Sound quality is poor and by about a year later, the LCD display began flaking out. The display and the selector wheel are now both useless. Battery has already been replaced twice and is dead again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"I have the exact same problem one of the other reviewers noted. The phone will just die out in the middle of a conversation. The only way to keep talking is to run over to the base and move the phone by the antenna. What's the point? Calls to Sony provided absolutely no help. When the phone works, it's cool, except the quality on the recorder is pretty bad. I'm out here looking for another phone to replace this one. I love Sony products (I've got TV, DVD, VCR, TIVO, Receiver, etc,) but I will never buy a Sony cordless again. I'm not the only one, either. Everyone I know that has had one has been disappointed. I guess they can't be great at everything!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Very Poor Product","review":"This is a very poor phone and answering machine combo. Friends complain bitterly about the sound quality of the outgoing message. The sound quality of the phone is also substandard when compared to Panasonic & AT&T models. Finally, the incoming messages are almost incomprehensible. I own a SONY DAT machine and a television with which I am happy. But I have had consistent bad luck with SONY's other consumer electronics and I have recently learned of others who have had similar complaints with this phone. Don't buy this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!","review":"I loved this phone at first, even though the sound quality was poor on the answering machine, both incoming and outgoing. Sometimes I couldn't even understand what the caller said the sound was so muffled. Running a business from home, this was unacceptable. But I was willing to live with it because of the investment and I loved the handset caller ID and the directory that was very handy in the handset. Now, however, approx. 9 months after purchase, it constantly does this \\"channel searching\\" while I'm talking, and it mutes what I'm saying and what I'm hearing until it \\"finds\\" a channel, even though there was no need for the \\"channel searching\\" because the connection was good. There is no way to turn this feature off. I even bought a new battery hoping that would solve the problem but it did not. Now the LED readout on the handset is blank sometimes. In short, DONT waste your money on this. What a disappointment from Sony."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sony SPP-A973 Not Up To Par","review":"I've been a loyal Sony fan for many years which is why I bought the phone. Owning the phone for just over six months, there is some static while talking and occassionally cuts off.

I would pass on this Sony product."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like em...","review":"I personally like these wipes, I use the fragrance free ones and my 7 month old son who has sensitive skin has not had diaper rash yet.

At stupid bosses or needless paperwork or silly policies or stupid fax machines that break down all the time. You don't even have to work in a cubicle to enjoy the humor. You will laugh your head off anyway. This movie has become a cult classic. I can't beleive how many people at my job will quote scenes from the movie.I first saw \\"Office Space\\" on a pay channel a few years ago and I kept thinking about different parts of the movie long after I had seen it. Then recently I realized that I needed to buy it and add it to my collection because it is the kind of movie to watch over and over again.And if you have a particularly bad day at work, it's fun to put in the DVD and play the ending credits that features a hip-hop version of \\"Take this job and shove it.\\" Then you can dance around the living room and I guarantee your bad work day will fade to just a distant memory."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT REALLY WIDESCREEN","review":"Do not buy this DVD if you are an aspect ratio purist. I believe this is one of those tragic cases where the FULLSCREEN version was cropped to create a fake widescreen version (as was done with Terminator 3) . You are getting a twice cropped film here, and thus, much less picture than the already cropped fullscreen version.This \\"widescreen\\" version has chopped off heads in every shot and in a couple of scenes the characters are chopped off from left to right.

Too many great bits -you'll be repeating many of them amongst yourselves- to list.

Office Space is that rare movie that meets both these needs. Everyone who has worked in an office will relate to someone in the movie. This brilliantly low-key and low-budget film manages to mock life as a corporation myrmidon in America in just about every possible way.Have you been downsized? You'll love Office Space for its brilliant take on consultants. Have you lived in Dallas, Texas, the capital city of Generica? You'll love Office Space for its acerbic portrayal of life as an apartment rat. Have you been the pawn of intraoffice political power struggles? You'll love Office Space for the character Milton played by Stephen Root.The only people who won't love Office Space are those with IQs in the sub-100 range and corporate vice presidents.

Office Space is a pure example of comedic genius. The acting and story line take back stage to outrageous laughs and gags that never fail to deliver.It's honestly the most unreal story in the world, but it's a way that the common man can live vicariously through the actors. Who hasn't wanted to really just sluff off at work? Who hasn't felt underappreciated?

This movie had me cracking up.I saw similarities between this movie and the company I use to work in.Mike Judge had created a hilarious masterpiece from the beginning to the end in \\"Office Space\\". It makes you take a second look at Corporate America and see all the flaws it has. Ron Livingston is great as the tired of it worker, while Jennifer Aniston is very likeable as his girlfriend. I thought the whole Michael Bolton thing was hilarious, as was the murdering of the office equipment in the open field. Gary Cole played his role as annoyingly as anyone could have, and John C. McGinley was funny as the new staff hand. This movie should have done well at the box office, but anyone who's seen it knows how good it really is. This movie is definitely worth having."},{"rating":"2","title":"Freakin' funny!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"If you hate your job and are tired of seeing the jerks promoted, you've must see this film"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie!

Well, I will be calling for a refund on this DVD...no sense of wasting money on something that doesn't work. I have seen the movie and I love it...very funny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incisive and funny critique of organizational life","review":"I agree with those who find this a superb comedy. And, as with most great comedies, it is so largely because of its extremely incisive and insightful view of contemporary society, in this case of the absurd, boring, oppressive, and meaningless character of much of contemporary life and work as experienced by those who inhabit American corporations and organizations, especially those of a high-tech and bureaucratic character. Thus it is high-quality social criticism in addition to being deeply humorous (as such other great comedies as Modern Times and The Apartment were in their times)."},{"rating":"2","title":"comedic gem","review":"Anyone who has worked an office job in corporate America can relate to this film.

This is also the best role of Jennifer Aniston's career."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny as heck","review":"When my friend and I rented this, it changed our world of inside jokes and punchlines forever. This movie is halarious.It's not really the funniest movie in the world when your actually watching it, I only laughed out loud at a half dozen or so scenes, but all of the little puns are the kind that you think are funny for ages afterwords, and unlike most comedy films, Office Space actually had re-view value.

I was busting up frequently during this because so much related to the hell hole I work in. The cubes, the zoning out, the hating of the job, etc. was easy to relate to. I thought the other two guys were funny too. If you work in a cube cage, you will totally relate to this movie. Mike Judge rules."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for all of us in the cubical farm","review":"This is the great movie that anyone who has ever worked in a corporate environment can relate to.

Good commentary on the corporate culture, in the same satirical league and philosophical bent as Dilbert.

The humor is just so spot on. From the gawky white ultra geek who thinks he's down to the so perky you want to strangle her receptionist, he really captures what its like in white collar America these days. And to top it off the films filled with classic, quotable lines (\\"Why should I have to change my name? Michael Bolton's the one who sucks\\").

This was Mike Judge's live action directoral debut, and he hit this out of the ballpark. Known for bevis and butt head and King of the Hill, Judge placed together and excellent cast to bring out the best humor that many of us can relate to in a close quareters office based setting. From the Fax Machine to the Memo's, to The overall dissatisfaction and unfulfillinness of the job. The there is Milton...just an awsome character. Laugh until it hurts.

This movie is much more true to life than I had expected (don't fear the dog who barks, fear the dog who quietly growls). Almost every scene in this movie has happened to me in some way, shape or form (\\"PC Letter Load?!?! What the ---- does that mean?!?!\\"). Anyone who doesn't find this movie funny must either: Never have worked in a large company, gone straight to middle management, or be utterly humorless.

It is a story of something we all wish we could do, leave our workplace and not have a care in the world. In addition, the supporting actors provide lots of comedy for the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not That Good","review":"This was recommended by a coworker a while back. I was expecting something like a Dilbert expose of corporate America, but this was not that good. I do not know whether the role of the boss, the regional VP, was supposed to be a parody of a typical Silicon Valley boss, but it seemed to me to be merely lame acting. And worst of all, the central theme pivoted around an illegal act, which was very depressing and disappointing. I can hardly believe that Jennifer Aniston ended up in this cheap flick. Very dated, with some ancient computer equipment featured."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous","review":"A slow moving slapstick comedy. Jennifer Anniston has again demonstrated that she is a third rate actress and is taking parts in \\"B\\" movies like this. Along with the rap music backgrounds and weak plot, poor direction and marginal acting, this is barely a two star movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Perfect","review":"This is the one film in the entire history of cinema that I can wholeheartedly endorse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cult Classic for Cubicle Cadre","review":"This movie endures as a favorite in corporate (and government) circles because, unlike Dilbert, it's still funny after all these years. The characters are fresh and engaging (except for the one name, Aniston somebody), the storyline is edgy (if logically flawed in parts), and it made me laugh several times. A great rental. Not to buy. No.It's also pretty vulgar, though I admit I don't get out much, being the father of two small children (my most important job, bucko). Do what I did--see it at home while on sick leave."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Top Comedies Ever...","review":"This movie is absolutely genius in several ways. The first one being that it relates to us all. The viewer of this film doesn't even have to have worked in an office in their entire LIFE; they just need to have worked in some type of environment. You'll see plenty of familiar characters of everyday life. The second reason this film is brilliant is in its dialouge. The jokes are cleverly inputted and lead on to other jokes. You have to pay attention to the film and really be interested in what's going on. My third - and final - reason for being why this film is really good is simple: it's clever. This movie is terrific, fantastic, super, incredible, and just plain fantabulous. If you don't own this movie on DVD, you're just missing out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent and Funny","review":"This is a classic movie and must have for anyone who has ever worked in an office of any kind.

The trailers, as is often the case, showed the majority of high points in the movie. It had its moments, but it dragged on, and the male lead had no energy at all and brought nothing to the film.

Surely she could get more important parts than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"unwatchable","review":"however, being somewhat obsessive, i couldn't seem to break free...jejune, almost entirely empty, and nearly identical to a very bad and lengthy sitcom episode, except for the absence of the obligatory 50s laugh track...in the first two hours of my promised and blissful afterlife, i may very well look back upon the final two hours, and realize they were wasted in advance on this deeply malformed creature feature."},{"rating":"2","title":"uh... yeah...","review":"this is a great movie. really great. it's one of those quoteable comedies you can watch over and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fractions of Pennies!","review":"I believe that for anyone who has had to work in a cube environment you will not only be able to relate to this movie and empathize with it's characters but I almost believe that this movie could be considered therapeutic. If you haven't worked in a \\"REAL\\" office environment then I could see how some people might have jokes go over their head. This is a movie that I believe is equivalent to Charlie Chaplin's movies of working life during his times. It is poignant and is a must for anyone who enjoys a movie that not only has good comedy but can also be an insight into the follies of what was and is considered a good working environment. ...and to think there was a time without cubicles...Yeah...I'm going to have to ask you to come to work on Saturday...thaaaaaaanks."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best Comedy Movies","review":"Office Space is one of the funniest films created.

WOOHOO!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"OH! face\\" Funny","review":"Mike Judge has taken his great \\"King of the Hill\\" humor and put it in every office cubicle by this very funny and smart debut. Relatively unknown Ron Livingston gives a perfect performance as a getting-sick-of the-nonsense-around-here computer drone who is changed by a hypnosis suggestion that he just not worry about his work. So he doesn't-literally. Leads to a promotion. He teams up with Jennifer Aniston is a classic restuarant scene when she asks him what he does \\"I don't like my job- I'm not going back\\"-- \\"so you're quitting?\\"-- \\"No, I'm just not going back\\".

I have seen it probably close to 30 times, and it's still a pleasure to watch! This is one of those rare movies that actually gets better the more you watch it. If you haven't seen this movie, do yourself a favor and go ahead and buy it. Don't bother renting it, because you will just want to watch it again and again. Unfortunatley, the DVD is lacking.

Think Dilbert on DVD using real characters.I absolutely love this film, but the DVD itself is pretty bland. There are hardly any extras (trailers don't count), and the DVD edition sorely needs some outtakes. No cast interviews, no director's commentary, nothing.... To make matters worse, I believe the DVD encoding is flawed. I've played it numerous times on my brand new Toshiba DVD player, and sometimes the screen will distort or colors will wash at certain spots in the movie, particularly in the beginning. But considering this is the only edition available on DVD, it's a marginal flaw and one that shouldn't prevent anyone from enjoying it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious!!!","review":"I don't remember the last time I laughed that hard... \\"Office Space\\" is a great flick, poking fun at daily life at the office.

This is a corporate world and you should go pee before you see this movie because you will laugh so hard you cry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely Funny","review":"Almost every scene in OFFICE SPACE has some sort of humor in it, and it is some of the more subtle humors that make this movie so hilarious. This film covers a wide range of everyday happenings in the office with typical office characters, and is held up by an interesting plot.The cast, while Jennifer Aniston is the only famous one, is great. If you like this movie the first time you watch it, you will want to watch it again and again. Then you will surely find yourself quoting a variety of lines from the many different characters.

OFFICE SPACE will most likely satisfy (at least partially) your sense of humor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellente","review":"Though I don't work in an office environment, I still have to put up with idiots everyday.

I don't care about the performances (all of them good. Including Jennifer Aniston. This woman is gorgeous, astonishingly beautiful). And I loved the idea. Any piece of movie, paper, text, joke, about that awful consultants, that awful corporations, is to my pleasure. The movie shows waht happens when consultants are hired to \\"aid\\" the company: all the company wants them to do is to fire employees.But this movie is not funny. It's low budget, of course, but that's not the point. Livingston is not a very brilliant actor, and his performance is boring.

I must have watched it at least 10 times since then though, and each time I like it more. Now I'd describe it as a comic masterpiece. I love what they've done with the music, and many of the less visible characters, such as Lawrence the neighbor, are hilarious. I absolutely love all the characters in this movie, with the exception of the stapler guy, whose meek and mumbly humor I still haven't managed to appreciate yet. I think what makes this movie really extaordinary though is that it does such a great job of parodying the ridiculous aspects of the office environment. As outrageous as much of the material is, it really hits home with the millions who have suffered through similarly stupid situations at their own work. Not good for young kids due to some language, I'd recommend it to anyone else who is looking for a good laugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"it was aight","review":"I saw the bonus features&didn't really get the Hype of this film.Any film with Jennifer Aniston alone means the film is gonna lose some points because you the acting is gonna be kinda weak.i got some things of the film,but on a whole I didn't get what all the Hype was about.it had some funny moments,but it was fairly predictable to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Left us a little cold!!!","review":"I don't quite understand some people.

Lafave manages to sing songs by the likes of Dylan and Springsteen better than Dylan and Springsteen, as if they were his own. Going Home, by the way, is on it too.

For the 11 months that we have owned this toy my son still can't crank the handel. I myself find it kind of awkward to do so. The toy is cute and hasn't broken (yet). The star on the front turns and clicks. My 4 month old loves when I turn it. The button for the squeaker on the back is kind of hard to push (for me). My two year old hasn't tried playing with the button because it's so hard to push (he has other toys that squeak when you push them and he can do it just well).So, in conclusion, because the toy is so awkward and hard (for a child) to manipulate our toy has been not much more than space taking up my kids' toy box."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not especially engaging!","review":"Altho I love the looks of this toy (bright colors) it isn't very engaging.

This compilation also features her stunning version of \\"Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)\\" which was used so effectively in Quentin Tarantino's \\"Kill Bill Vol. 1\\". I think her version is superior to Cher's. My favorite track is Nancy's \\"Good Time Girl\\" which is unabashedly cheerful pop.

This game is very realistic to be a space game. It has really good graphics and sound. The cut scene videos are interesting and it helps you get into the game. But there are draw backs to the game, such as, the controls are all over the keyboard. You pretty much use the whole keyboard to manuver your space ship. But after a little while of playing it, you will find out that there are about 5-10 keys you will ever need to use. Over all, the game is one of the best I have ever played.

Kurt Vonengut filled each page with detail and imagery (honestly, I felt the cold and damp that Howard Campbell was physically feeling - it was that vivid to me). But I never knew WHAT Howard Campbell REALLY was - Nazi sympathizer or spy - sending secret messages through a hate-filled radio broadcast?? Did he become so good at what he was pretending to be that he really started to feel that way? Hmmm...I guess that was the purpose of the story - to leave you guessing. Maybe there was something I didn't catch that answered the question?This book is an emotional roller coaster for a reader as well, as you follow Mr. Campbell's ups and downs with friendships, loves and a helpful \\"contact.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome book","review":"Solid Vonnegut.The description that the cover gives doesn't really do the story justice.This is a twisted and dark love story, involving an empty man and his memories.Dark satire is woven throughout, as only Mr. Vonnegut can do.Not quite 5 stars, but only because I've read SH5 and Cat's Cradle.If I was new to this author, it'd be a different story.However, I know what he's capable of, and this isn't QUITE his best.CLOSE though!Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mother NIght","review":"All I can say is, this book changed my life.

The main character and his life as a playwrite is excellently done by Vonnegut, with his usual twists, turns, and sudden revelations. This book is a must to read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"so Kurt, how do you really feel about the war?","review":"Man, if any of his books really reflects his views on war, government, and patriotism, this one leads the pack. He lays the satire on pretty thick. Unlike _Bluebeard_, he handles the fictional biography idea well. The book is structured very nicely. Like _Bluebeard_ though, he provides one of the more satisfying conclusions to his story. Many of his books are weak when the end hits."},{"rating":"2","title":"At his best!!","review":"Mother Night is Slaughterhouse Five without time travel nor aliens. It's hysterical and puzzling. A great book for any fan of Kurt Vonnegut."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Great One By Vonnegut","review":"Vonnegut did an excellent job in this story. There wasn't any science fiction in this book like many of his others, but the character Howard Campbell was great. The story has great twists to it and it makes for quick reading. I had a hard trying to put this one down, and I think it is a must read for any Vonnegut fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vonnegut at his most likeable","review":"Vonnegut is one of those writers whom everybody either loves or hates--there's very little middle ground. He's like vanilla Coke.\\"Mother Night\\" is situated right on that narrow little line. It's a book that just about anyone can enjoy, even the most ardent foes of Indiana's favorite son. It was his third novel and, as such, represents the sort of pre-caricature phase that ended with the breakaway success of \\"Cat's Cradle\\" two years later. Here you see Vonnegut at his most human and, in some ways, his most vulnerable as he switches off the bombastic humor and lets his reader see the man behind the curtain.Of course, the characteristic Vonnegut still shines through, but it's muted by a disarming candor about love lost and the stagnation it breeds. If you don't know anything about Vonnegut, this is a great place to start. If you love him, this book will make you melt. If you hate him, well, it might at least give you pause."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply one of the best books I've ever read.","review":"This book was awesome (not in the slang sense).

There is slapstick and farce here; great fun and entertainiment. What saves this from craziness is Vonnegut's ability to write so well about noble things such as love and kindness, friendship and decency. So one laughs and one thinks and one feels as he reads here. . .and in almost everything else Kurt Vonnegut wrote."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moving piece of literature...Vonnegut with another winner.","review":"Mother Night is one of my favorite Vonnegut books, along with The Sirens of Titan and Hocus Pocus. It is different than the majority of his works, as Vonnegut does not rely on obvious comedy, or space travel. In this account of an accused Nazi war criminal, Vonnegut lets the reader deep within Campbell's mind, in order to allow the verdict to waver back and forth between guilty and not guilty. This is a brilliant novel, and it deals with issues deeper than Vonnegut lets on. A must for Vonnegut fans..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very important book","review":"This deserves to be a modern classic, right up there with Slaughterhouse Five, The Naked and the Dead, Catch-22 and 1984. It is a disturbing and relentlessly insightful book about the human condition. A man agrees to act as a Nazi propagandist during WWII in order to be able to transmit coded messages to the Allies. But when we look beyond the good intentions, there is still the question of which side he aids most - the side he proclaims to profess to, or the side he secretly tries to aid? As mr Vonnegut writes himself in the introduction: \\"We are what we pretend to be, and therefore we must be very carful of what we pretend to be.\\" Read it - don't see the film."},{"rating":"2","title":"A New Perspective On Nazi Germany","review":"This book is fantastic. The plot itself is worth the price of the book but the ending will throw you for a loop, I know it did for me.The book is a very quick read and doesn't really have alot of historical facts or detailed descriptions. This book is no different than any other Vonnegut book in that its very ambiguos. We never find out why the Nazi's decided to give Campbell his own show or why the OSS decided to use Campbell as a spy.Despite this the book is a very fun read. Its funny and often hilarious (especially when describing aging racists in America). I would reccomend this book to any reader of any age. Its, quite simply, a good story."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Book with an Important Message","review":"In the end, you are what you pretend to be [so be careful what you pretend to be]... What a message. What an impact this book had on me... Many people might see a weak story here, and indeed I do, too, but the underlying message is highly important.

Winback: Covert Operations offers an exellent training program to teach you all you need to know how to do in the game. The \\"Crying Lyons\\"(the terrorists) show some artificial intellegence. Winback's multiplayer mode isn't as great, but offers more ways to challenge one another. Overall, if you were to buy Winback or Goldeneye, go for Winback. Goldeneye is horrible compared to Winback."},{"rating":"2","title":"The WinBack reveiw","review":"Win back is perhaps the best shooting game ever to hit my life. It's a game that is so realistic with a awesome storyline.If they would to make a movie, it would probably be greater than Termenator 3. I mean think about this game. It's exciting, because your thinkin is one of my team mates goona die. And the leader of your team, actually works for the bad guys. Now That's a Classic. This is a must have.

THE WEAPONS ARE COOL AND REALISTIC. YOU WIPE OUT THE ENEMY WITH YOUR HANDGUN, SUBMACHINEGUN, ROCKETS, M16(SECRET WEAPON), SILENCED HANDGUN (SECRET WEAPON), AND SHOTGUN. THIS GAME IS NONE OTHER THAN THE BEST GAME OF THE YEAR.(MY OPINION) IF YOU BUY OR RENT A GAME IN THE FUTURE, THIS IS THE GAME THAT YOU SHOULD GET!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay, but not worth the money","review":"This game is bad. If you liked James Bond, like I do you might like this game. I disliked it because of the slow targeting and poor weapons. Some positives are the red dot scope, but don't be confused. James Bond's auto aim helps immensely this game requires many different buttons to be pushed. When you are shot you are incapacitated for about 1 and 1/2 seconds. Which is an eternity with how fast the computer fires. It takes forever to find your friends and when you do, they usually die. All in all this game is ok, but the storyline is bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Fun Game","review":"I think this game is pretty cool, the game has a lot of good and interesting areas where the main character goes.

Its like Metal Gear solid for N-64.The reason its not 5 stars is because,I found this game to be VERY long and its very annoying playing this game if you dont have a save pack.Also Becasue There are all of 5 weapons in the game!It's a pretty cool game just not the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for the casual","review":"This is a fun game to play, but it's freakin' hard. I've never been able to progress past the first level because I can't really make the adjustment from GoldenEye-style play to MGS-style play that you need to get along.Multiplayer is, however, a joy. The levels are small enough that it's pretty much constant mayhem for two players."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait for Perfect Dark","review":"To sum up this game it should have been titled, GiveBack. Seeing as how I am about to give it back to the store I bought it from. It's poor on all accounts, graphics, game play, acting, camera work and above all AI. I have never seen such 'dumb' enemies. I have also purchased Medal of Honor for the PSX and it by far has the most intelligent enemies on a console game ever. If you are thinking about getting Winback, stop, rethink your decision and wait for Perfect Dark."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it...","review":"Don't buy this game. I've been playing it recently, and although the graphics and gameplay aren't bad, everything else is, especially the cameras. When you're playing, the automatic camera angles are horrible, and I find myself often readjusting them manualy. It becomes almost impossible to fight more than two other men at the same time without dying, because you need to see them to shoot them, and therefore have to readjust the cameras; two shots later and I'm dead. Quite frustrating. Also, the game only has 4 guns, a pistol with unlimited ammo, and shotgun with little ammo, a automatic but not very powerful rifle with limited ammo, and a rocket launcher, with only four rockets. There is also C4 explosives. This does not make for very fun gameplay. If I were you, I would put your money towards another first person shooter, such as GoldenEye 007 or something newer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Winback lacks several qualities","review":"WInback is a good game, but because of the difficlut controls, bad camera angles, and Jean-Luc's (your character) stupidity makes it only a so-so game.Because of the manuel cameral you have to continously switching the angles to see who you are shooting at (if any one at all), who's shooting you, or where youa re going so that you don't run into those damn lasers.Your character also lacks basic moves that almost every other 3rd person shooter has. He can strif (move from side to side), crawl, or even jump. the most impressive move he has is that his is allowed to crouch. you would thing that i specially trained, counter-terroist unit would atleast be able to preform those simple ablilties"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not His Best Effort","review":"Unlike the other volumes in the Spellsong series, I felt the characters in Darksong Rising were predictable and offered no depth. It seemed that Anna is faced with the same issues she faced in the last book. The villains are all one dimensional, power hungry, bigoted males. While these characters no doubt deserve their punishments, I would not want to read about them over and over again. This book was a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly thought out","review":"I enjoyed the first two in this series, but this one was, frankly, just stupid in places. Not only were the characters black-and-white cutouts rehashed from the previous books, but the sorceress herself was just plain dumb at times. If you know the Bad Guy uses huge drums to amplify his magic and you have this convenient spell that rains fire from the heavens, it might occur to any sentient being to hit the drums with the fire while the Bad Guy is asleep, instead of waiting until he wakes up and tries to defend himself. Apparently that's too much to hope for.Also too much to hope is moral ambiguity and any chance that someone the sorceress dislikes at first glance will turn out to be anything other than a Bad Guy (possibly temporarily tolerated for Political Purposes).I had high hopes for this series. Pity this book is in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review - This Hallowed Ground","review":"Bruce Catton is one of the best history writers of the Civil War. He writes in a fashion that is easy to read yet leaves no doubt what he is saying. Very good way to enjoy history. It is almost like reading a novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good overview of the civil war","review":"I was half way through the first volume of Foote's epic 3 volume \\"The Civil War: a narrative\\" when I paused for a breather and read Catton's Hallowed Ground.So, compared to Foote's 3 volume The Civil War, Catton's Hallowed Ground provides a good overview of all the major battles in the Civil War. He had also included quotes from letters soldiers had written to family which I thought was a nice touch as it provided a different view of the civil war and illustrated how tough things were for them. What I also liked about Catton is that he had referenced the quotes and pointed to other books if you were interested in that particular regiment or battle.For someone new to the civil war, I would definitely recommend reading Catton's Hallowed Ground first then refer to Foote for more detailed description of the more interesting battles. However, as another reviewer here points out, there is a hint of bias in favour of the confederacy in Foote."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book for learning the Pagemaker program.","review":"This book is easy to follow, easy to find answers and takes you from beginning to end in a painless fashion.

Sensitively handled, but doesn't really have that post-colonial edge which would have made it outstanding. The 'Africans' in this story are presented as little more than caricatured plot machinations, dragging the film toward its conclusion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Subtitle Nightmare","review":"Looks like a great film, only... can't understand a word. Germans hear and understand all the dialogue while those of us who know only English have to figure out what's being said and, more importantly, what's being felt. Subtitled questions go unanswered. Beware this DVD. My wife saw this film in a theater and swears the subtitles helped her follow the story. This DVD does no such thing. Know German, or else."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Love Story","review":"Although much can be said about Jews leaving Germany prior to Hitler sealing the border, it has all been said before.The thrust of this movie, pardon the pun, is the husband's desperation for his wife's love and support. He wants to be something and do something with his life and yet, here he is self-exiled to Kenya to sit on a farm. He wants his wife to desire him but she is aloof and remote. At times his quiet desperation is palpable.For me, this view was different and interesting with the back-drop being the age-old tale of the Holocaust (rather than at the forefront of the story).This tale will resonate with anyone who has been adrift at life from their home, their family and the person they love. Truly touching film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good movie.....very bad subtitles!","review":"I wasn't able to enjoy the movie as much as I would have if only the subtitles were adequate to support the power of the movie. As a result, I wasn't able to fully appreciate the deepness and complexity of this cultural diversified movie. Anyhow, I still would like to recommend this to everyone especially those who can understand German.

I really like the scene with the two little foals, Beauty and Lucky, playing together. I liked the girl. The scenery in Africa is stunning, too. The horses are beautiful. I got this movie for my sister's 12th birthday. She really enjoyed it too. Some scenes are scary and sad for kids under 7,(like when the stable is set on fire with the horses in it, and when Lucky's mother is killed by Caeser) which is one of the reasons that I gave Running Free four stars insted of five. The names where not very creative, most horses where named things like Lucky or Beauty. Also there is a couple parts where horses do things that a horse would not do,(like when Caeser kills Lucky's mother. A stallion would not in a million years kill a mare.) I like this movie, and it was only $6.

Snow skillfully illustrates to us the politics of small groups, and how very different those politics are from politics in a broader sense. This book is one of the Strangers and Brothers series, but it reads very nicely as a stand-alone work. The Masters is a good read, in which we follow the partisan manuvering of two factions seeking different candidates in the school election. Snow's style is straightforward, almost a latter-day Trollope, and his ideas are very insightful. This is a classic, which deserves to be more read."},{"rating":"2","title":"no title","review":"Another terrific book , supposedly the best in the series (\\"Strangers and Brothers\\"), but I think that several others are possibly better. And, really, it ends so dismally. Although I guess any other way would be too trite, and I'm quite sure that this is based on some real event in Snow's life, as I feel all the books are. The dons are all so sharply drawn, each clear in his own character. And the eating and drinking they constantly did! I guess they walked a lot. I loved it. The intrigues and politics that Snow writes about, are worthy of any Washington lobbyist. Except that here we are at Cambridge."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Would Think This Book Might Involve More","review":"How does an assortment of 13 professors at an English university choose the next head of their college? \\"The Masters\\" examines the personal and university politics that shape this decision through the narrative style of C. P. Snow. This captures a brainy professorial world through heavy reliance on complex and conditional dialogue, acute but unspoken observations, and highly abstract character analysis. Here's an example of his approach: \\"His manner was deliberately prosaic and comfortable. He was showing less outward sign of strain than any of us; when he was frayed inside, he slowed his always measured speech, brought out commonplaces like an amour, reduced all he could to the matter-of-fact.\\" Still, the story, while minutely imagined, doesn't go deep. It's a tempest in a teapot."},{"rating":"2","title":"A step back in time","review":"I first read the Strangers and Brothers series years ago, and avidly went from one to the next. I vividly remember loving them, the situations, the people, the writing. So, I thought I would read them again, several decades later.I was struck by how very much of a time and place they are, and how the English reticence and manners in the first half of last century shaped the conversations and relationships in the novels.Much is made of a glance, a start, or an averted face.Events unfold in their own pace, and the life and customs living in Cambridge and within a college are detailed and evocative.The Masters is about the succession plans for the leadership in a college when the master is dying, and when he does die, how the decision is made by the fellows. It is decidedly a period piece, but once into it, there is something compelling about the world and the people created by Snow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Have not received it as yet","review":"It has been a month since this order was placed I have not received it as yet"},{"rating":"2","title":"paula brings it.....","review":"paula pours her heart and soul into this fun,high energy extravaganza.it's more than just your run of the mill concert,all the elements are there.great songs,a tight band,energetic dancers and of course amazing choreography.if you're not a paula abdul fan, you will be one after you watch this."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you love Paula Abdul...","review":"...then you've got to get this tape!

So, although incredibly entertaining and informative, he does not travel the Oregon trail in the traditional sense but wanders far and wide from it, and does not cross the Rockies; so anyone looking for a narrative history of what it was like to travel the full length of the Trail might be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Generally exciting account of the Oregon Trail","review":"The Oregon Trail by Francis Parkman is an account which further enforces the history of the Oregon Trail we had learned about in [U.S. History] class. The book portrays what it must have been like to travel on the Trail, never knowing what the next day would bring. The buffalo hunting which took place throughout the book became monotonous and boring after the first exciting few, but other than that repetitiveness, the journey was well depicted. I especially enjoyed Parkman's in-depth descriptions given to the reader of the people he meets on his journey and his observations on their actions as well. His vivid imagery of scenes from nature such as animals, prairie landscapes, and the weather, place the reader right next to Parkman in his adventuresome expedition. There are some dull, repetitive points in the observations made by the author, but aside from that his autobiographical telling of his journey is unforgettable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting","review":"The book puts the reader on the wagon trains and provides great insight into the day to day travails of the Oregon Trail travelers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnum opus","review":"This is a lively, energetic and realistic account of life in the 1846 American West. Parkman's \\"Oregon Trail\\" is considered a timeless, historical masterpiece and rightfully so. Only twenty three years old, he and his friend Quincy Adams Shaw went west \\"on a tour of curiosity and amusement to the Rocky Mountains\\". Stopping off at Fort Laramie, we acquire a taste of what life was like there in those early days of overland emigrants, trappers, traders, Indians and \\"ruffians\\". He then spends time with the Sioux, observing and describing their behavior, culture and customs while in the Laramie Mountains and Valley, and the foothills of the Medicine Bow Mountains. From here, Parkman and Shaw travel down the front range of Colorado to Pueblo, Bent's Fort and back to St. Louis via the Arkansas River. Being a very descriptive writer, we gain an insightful and vivid look as to geographical landforms and the characters who lived in those days.

With this toy, once you put a shape in its cavity, you can press the animal to hear a lovely song or an animal noise. She adores it. The shapes are little mini rattles too that make a nice sound when you shake them. Our daughter learned how to turn the toy on and off and would say \\"off\\" when she turned it off.
