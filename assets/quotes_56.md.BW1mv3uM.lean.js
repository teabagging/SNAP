I've had it for about 2 years, and I initially thought it was inaccurate because my child was smaller, maybe she had smaller ear canals, etc. Now at almost 4 years old and staying perfectly still, this themometer will give readings of 102.0 to 104.5 in the same sitting. Luckily, at this age, taking an oral temp is almost doable. I'm a pediatrician, and tracking the height of the fever is sometimes important. Before trying one, I never recommended ear thermometers to any of my patients. Now, after using one, that hasn't changed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inaccurate readings","review":"I have only ever been able to get accurate readings on this thermometer once. The rest of the time the readings tend to be on the low side and can fluctuate by a number of degrees from readings taken within seconds of each other.

I have tried using it with the probe covers as recommended and in desperation tried it without the covers. I still got inaccurate readings. I would spend my money on something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely useless!","review":"I bought this thinking it would be great since I have 4 kids and taking temps under the tongue is a nightmare. This thermometer is a bigger nightmare! It is extremely difficult if not impossible to get an accurate reading.

Then I would take the child's temp with a digital thermometer to find out they have a fever over 100. I even bought extra covers thinking maybe the covers were an issue. Same problems.

The music is very healing and includes titles such as \\"This is Love\\", \\"First Love\\", \\"Lord, I Love You\\", \\"Simply Said\\" and \\"My Beloved\\". I was going through a hard time when I found the song \\"My Beloved.\\" It made me cry to think that God considers me to be His beloved, the one He loves.

However, I found this book to be very disturbing.It wasn't the one brother's death that bothered me, or the fact that his twin brother is trying to talk to him one last time. What bothered me was that I felt children were being encouraged to turn to the occult to deal with death.In one of the other reviews, a teacher said she had read the book to her class. If my child had been in her class, I would have been extremely upset. When you write a book about witches for children, there needs to be a sense that this is make-believe.

It would be better of course to read the Edda in the original, but if you don't speak Old Icelandic yet, this is the translation to use. It has the convenience of having numbered stanzas and doesn't simply omit stanzas, like some translations geared toward those wholly ignorant of the traditional lore of the Nordic people, and so is suitable for study. If you are unfamiliar with the Poetic Edda's contents: The poems, dealing with the Norse Gods, are to the people of the North what the stories of Moses, Abraham and Isaac are to the peoples of the Middle East.

Tracks like \\"connected\\" (my favorite)and \\"music for children\\" feature female vocals and incorporate numerous layers of synth and guitar. Other songs like \\"forgive\\" and \\"for $ale\\" lean a little to the darker side of things while still maintaining a musical freshness. Down tempo cut \\"Haunted City\\" can only be described as Miles Davis playing trumpet over ghetto beats and sirens. The last track, \\"Muzack for the Death Star\\" sounds like a crazy, whacked out Atari 2600...fun stuff! All in all it's great to hear an artist release music that isn't boring.

These things are certainly not easy and the Hahn's show us that.Don't expect a theological treatise as to the truth of Catholicism, this book does not do that. In fact, all the reasons for conversion are not spelled out completly because to do so would take a thousand more pages. The Hahn's have helped thousands of Catholics become affirmed in their faith and helped thousands more come to the fullness of faith. This book is their story on how they did the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"Intellectually dishonest","review":"Having read Scott's book, it occurred to me that Scott missed the true meaning of the central points of reformed theology. I researched Dr. Gerstner's follow-up comments to Hahn's book, and indeed, Gerstner feels Hahn was rebelling against something he never completely understood to begin with. Furthermore, there was no hint of humility in his writing. His attitude was, \\"I was right then, and I am right now.\\" Sadly, he has turned away from a personal testimony that was rich with witnessing and sharing the gospel to a practice of self-serving theologizing. I feel sorry for Scott and Kim."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning - Dishonest Reports Contained!!!","review":"Highly recommend AGAINST this book. Scott Hahn's theological conclusions are faulty, oftening borrowing from arguments already defeated by the Reformers (i.e. the legitamcy of pope, and church dictates Scripture). His dialogue with Dr. Gerstner is phony as 1800-phychic report; he repeatedly dismiss Dr. Gerstner's response in order to pretend he stumped Dr. Gerstner. Dr. Gerstner thought he never understood the Reformed faith. I only recommend this book if you like to read for yourself how to go down the wrong path of faith and fall into bad intellectual traps. Talk to an orthodox Reformed theologian and he will show you how ridiculous his arguments are. I personally feel sorry for Scott and Kimberly Hahn who eventually got trapped by mysticsm and medieval fabalism, especially for Kim."},{"rating":"1","title":"A sad tale from a man who turned his back on truth...","review":"Mr. Hahn's book reads like a biographical infomercial for Roman Catholicism, but astute Protestant readers will be able to conclude that Scott never really understood the Reformed Evangelical faith he once claimed to embrace. Sadly, he left the truth and embraced a false theology, since that time he has become an active apologete for the Roman Church.Don't be fooled by the rhetoric, Mr. Hahn was convinced by his own presuppositions and his own faulty understanding of what Reformed theology teaches. The tale of struggle and transformation that Hahn weaves comes accross as a saccharin icing for that sad process. God willing, someday he'll write another book entitled \\"From Rome to the Truth\\".My advice?

The author found out that what Luther taught was in direct conflict with Jesus's teaching and the teaching of Paul, James and logical common sense. It should be read by all anti-catholics who are not afraid of learning the reality about Christianity. All the fundamentalist churches are bound together by one belief - the hatred of Catholicism. The author comes to the certain conclusion that Catholicism is the only true religion . Sola Fide and Sola Scriptura were merely created by Luther and contradict the Bible and historic Christianity on every single front."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great chronicle of a great spiritual journey","review":"This is an excellent chronicle of a spiritual journey. It is more biographical than theological, and should be read as such, but the Hahns do take the trouble to explain (even if only briefly) the Scriptural and theological bases for their new-found convictions. True, those who want a theological dissertation will have to look elsewhere, but this book can stand on its own merits. No one with an open mind can read this and ignore the fact that becoming Catholic involved a real struggle for the Hahns.

Mrs. Hahn discusses her sadness when her husband announces his desire to covert to Catholicism, due to her desire to be a minister's wife. This is about as intellectually challenging as this book gets.For a much more compelling and challenging story of a convert's path to and life the Catholic Church, read the many books by and about the great activist Dorothy Day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow","review":"One couple's story about their spiritual journey from the evangelical protestant church to the Roman Catholic church. This book reads like it was taken from transcripts of speeches by the Hahns. There's not much meat to it. The book seems to function more as an advertisement or PR tool for Scott Hahn's books and tapes, than anything. The book briefly goes over how, one by one, the Hahns overcome difficult issues of the Catholic faith until one day Scott, then later Kimberly, each convert. The reader is provided with very little explanation of how their minds and hearts were changed. For example, Scott talks about one day just picking up a rosary to pray. How does a \\"former Anti-Catholic\\" make that leap? Another example is how he comes to believe in the power of a relic of a dead person, which he implies (but does not explain) was instrumental in his wife's conversion. Lots of similar leaps are made and in the end, the book is merely an unconvincing collection of vignettes and anecdotes."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Epiphany","review":"I found this book to be a wonderful telling of the trials and tribulations of Mr. Hahn's and his wife's journey to the Catholic faith. What I did not find is why he gave up the faith he was raised in and became a minister in to become Catholic.He gives a number of examples in the book where he argued Catholic vs Protestant with an expert voicing the Protestant stance. In each and every case, Catholic either won the day or, at least, the contest ended in stalemate, but he never once shares the winning arguement.The main positive I take from his story, is that Catholicism is not the bugaboo that most Protestant churches denounce it as being.However, his all too quick, it seems, embracing of Catholicism shows not so much the truth (and it may well be) of the Catholic church, but rather it showed me a man who was not as strong in his faith as he believed."},{"rating":"2","title":"But I'm not Catholic.... do you want to be?","review":"I have read dozens of conversion stories by people converting to one brand of Protestantism to another. Most, if not all of those are very emotional descriptions of being \\"saved.\\" This story has that emotion, but it's not JUST emotion, it is also a story of a search for truth.I would recommend this for any one who has left the Catholic church for Protestantism and wonders if they have done the right thing; for any Protestant who believes the Catholic church is in \\"apostasy\\"; any one at all wondering why someone would leave their comfy cosy Protestant pastorate for the Catholic church.A really \\"easy read\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story","review":"This book is such a great story told by both Scott and Kimberly.

I found it filled with trite anecdotes and personal observations but nothing of substance. I quickly tired of the emotionalism the Hahn's keep piling onto the tale of their journey. It becomes boring, maudlin, and very unconvincing.I also have to say that Scott's observations on the Catholic Church before his conversion left me shaking my head.

Sure , \\"Bottom Of Your Soul\\" and the title track are vintage Toto , but the rest of the CD is just nothing what I have expected from Toto the past 26 years.

An instant classic from a classic band. The boys have never rocked harder, sang better, and grooved groovier. I can't get this CD out of player. I can't get the hooks out of my mind- I go to sleep at night humming one of the tunes, usually the Joseph Williams-sung chorus on \\"Bottom of Your Soul.\\" I absolutely loved the guest musicians on this record- James Pankow(Chicago)and Ian Anderson (Jethro Tull) especially. I don't know if you can Call Steve Porcaro a \\"guest-musician,\\" especially with artistic work with the overall sonic \\"canvas\\" and cool timbres he is able to evoke. He is a genius. Why these guys can't get any radio airplay in the States anymore is beyond me. They are so much better than all of the crap that comes out on the radio nowadays.

For example, the book is not clear that the WAAS is ONLY available for the US and nearby areas, so much of the accuracy claims are irrelevant for most of the world.However, for newcomers it does provide an electronic option and is written in an easy to read style. Like many electronic books it suffers from a poor ability to move/ flick quickly back and forth over more than a few pages to recheck material or come back to reread areas to recheck how to do stuff. A hard copy book does make that easier.But overall, a lot of interesting information that is, useful.

If you like that type of music you should buy this CD. I've seen the band live a couple of times and I can tell you that they are almost better live.

I just put the metal piece in the hot spot under the arm, hold them while it is reading and beep all done. I misplaced my first one and actually just picked up another today and it says 30 second readings, and yes it was that fast and so was my older one.

My husband had no problem getting it on or off. We recently went on vacation and used it to transport 4 bikes (2 adult, 2 older children) and were able to get them on fairly easily. 4 adults size bikes might be a tight fit. Our trip was 2 hours mostly highway driving going approximately 65-70 mph and we had no issues with the bikes coming lose. The bikes did bounce a bit but stayed secure to the rack. We used the black rubber holders but it also comes with another fastener which straps everything together to the rack for added protection just in case a strap comes lose or lets go. As for people stealing the rack off the car, we vacation on Cape Cod and left the rack on all week and I'm happy to say we still have it. I've already had 2 people at work ask about the rack because they liked the looks of it so much. I've recommended it to both."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading advertising and hostile customer service","review":"This was my worst online shopping experience that I can remember.

Two Janstransformed the city into a Nazi like state. I agree with the review that the final chapter was a stretch in how it related to modern movements.

Shawshank Redemption was merely okay, with nothing standing out about it. Apt Pupil should have been a novel, to better show everything, with some things omitted...that story was plain disgusting...ugh. The Body should have been a short story, maybe half it's size...too many details that don't matter!!!

Everyone likes the Shawshank Redemption but it infuriates me due to the writing flaw of too much coincidence and luck. Frequently King wraps things up too neatly, his characters SUDDENLY know exactly what to do as if a lightbulb goes off or something.

I was apprehensive when our reading group chose this as our October selection. Luckily, I was wonderfully surprised at how excellent the stories are! I did not know, or had forgotten, that Stephen King wrote 'Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption'. Hearing Morgan Freeman's voice in my head as the narrator of the story made this a most pleasurable read. The depth of character and unexpected twist in 'Apt Pupil' made it a surprisingly interesting story. I liked the small connection to 'Shawshank' by having Andy be Dussander's attorney! My favorite story, however, is 'The Breathing Method'. Most reviews I read say the opposite, but the lasting mystery and plausibility of the horrible ending of the story are quite gripping.

Wow, is this book something! Hail to the King indeed! \\"Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption\\" is beautiful and so well-written. \\"The Body\\" is a terrific coming-of-age tale. But \\"Apt Pupil\\" was truly breathtaking. The ideas and imagery from that story will stay with me for a long, long time. I think it is King's best novella by far. This story alone is worth the price of admission. \\"Breathing Lessons\\" was all right to finish, although it didn't make as great an impact as the others. _Different Seasons_ is definitely a keeper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting, hope filled, yet twisted","review":"I bought this for \\"Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption\\" which is the novella that \\"The Shawshank Redemption\\" is based on.

A very gentle and uplifting story that is exciting and not too long (only about 100 pages), that breaks the image of Stephan King being a stereotypical horror writer. The final pages of the story sum up all of its feeling. I also read \\"Apt Pupil,\\" an incredibly different story that I also liked though not as much as RH&SR. I didn't read the other stories. But I did read the opening paragraphs of \\"The Body\\" and immediately burst into tears! Wow! His words rang clear and true.

He is at his best when he writes \\"short novels\\" and the stories in this book are without a doubt his finest (but \\"Four Past Midnight\\" is also quite good). With the possible exception of the last story here, each of them is a real treat.What makes these novellas so good is that each presents a profile of a character at a defining moment in his life. These characters are well developed and believable so you care about the outcome and get involved in the story. He then takes you through a series of events that is fascinating, and in the case of \\"Apt Pupil\\", disturbing and shocking.\\"Apt Pupil\\" is the best thing King has written and actually deserves something closer to a 9.

All three are outstanding stories, especially \\"Rita Hayworth\\" which tells of a wrongly convicted man trying to survive and keep his sanity in a brutal prison.

I haven't seen the movie for \\"Apt Pupil\\", but most people tell me it isn't that good. I enjoyed \\"Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption\\" and \\"The Body\\" immensely, but I'd already seen the movies and have to say that I enjoy them better. \\"The Breathing Method\\" was intriguing, but disappointingly short and left me wanting to know more about such an unusual \\"club\\". So for me the stand out of the four novellas was \\"Apt Pupil\\" where King shines with his usual amazing characterization. Todd Bowden is the epitome of the typical American boy and his descent into darkness is so well-paced and real that I got sucked right into it.

So I bought a 2nd one. I've barely used the 2nd one, but less than 6 months later it's not working, either.

I bought these, but I am very dissatisfied. They are very cheap. My specific grief are the clips. They are very \\"bendy\\" and they don't lock the connector into place when you connect them to a port. I am constantly having to reseat/push in the cables I made with these connectors.

Plug the connector into the computer and then see if it works. If not then cut it off and try again, and perhaps again. I make them fine with another tool and connectors so it is not user-error. I just have not tried some other connectors with this tool yet to validate the problem with the connectors, but at this point I would not purchase these again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"I bought the Alpinestars Reflex Knee Guards for riding motorcycle, and have been using them for several months now. They suck. Are too way too bulky in order to use them inside any pants, jeans or trousers. Extremely uncomfortable. The velcro straps get stuck between themselves causing a mess and everything come unravel. Besides, it slides around all the time, just by walking. I don't want to imagine what would happen in a fall. Already buying a different brand."},{"rating":"2","title":"If all you're wearing are riding pants or jeans, get this","review":"This isn't top of the line knee guards but it can safe you in a crash. If you're just riding with regular jeans or riding pants with no knee padding, this is definitely worth the buy. Not the best, but for the price, can't be beat. Not too bad wearing all day (took a 7 day trip a couple of months ago with a total of 3k miles), but I wouldn't go to work and wear it around the office.

Bad battery!!?! The battery has started to expand destroying the whole unit. It doesn't even boot now. For the amount of money I spent I would hope that the unit would last at least a year. It didn't. I would never spend another dime on Archos gear having dealt with their horrendously bad customer and repair service - you can forget about an ARCHOS warranty completely!

If you plan to put two or three files in your 80GB player, it will work fine, but when you start putting more files to the player, it will break. I know someone get a unit that works, but tons of people have problem with this player when I ask the customer service lady about this.

I saved all my very important files onto it and then, after about 50GBs were used up, it was unable to establish a connection with my computer. I figured it was my computer that was causing the problem so I rebooted it without saving any of my files to CDs or floppy disks. This was a very bad idea because after that I still couldn't establish a connection between my computer and the AV400. I emailed the archos website and told them this exact story and they just told me it needed to sent in for repairs and they couldn't even garuntee that files would be saved. This really made me mad because I spent $700 on this thing and it doesnt even work and I'm going to lose all my files. Does anyone out there know of anyway I could fix this problem and save my files?

I've been using this for about a month now (3-6 pills a day) and have seen a definite improvement. It doesn't eliminate cellulite -- nothing can -- but I'd say mine has been reduced by about 30-40%. Another benefit is improved circulation and vein health. My hands and feet tend to be cold and purplish in cooler weather, and that's much less of an issue now.

This is truly one of the worst-sounding CDs I have ever heard. Absolutely brutal! The first album, And Then He Kissed Me, is by far the worst; Blame It On Love fairing a little better. To top it off, the inserts are skimpy and don't reproduce any of the original artwork. No (re)mastering credits, or blame, are given. This whole production is a real shame and a disappointment.

When using it for calls, it works well, and it's not uncomfortable, but they're earbuds afterall and they're just a little bigger than iPod headphones, so maybe some people don't like that.

But, I think I paid a few dollars for it which is worth it, but the shipping is what makes me feel ripped off because the item is so inexpensive which wouldn't bother me normally if I had just bought it at Walmart for about the same price. Maybe $4.99 which would have been cheaper than what I paid for it on Amazon after shipping. So, that's my fault but the item really is a piece of junk.

Once he began developing a charter he killed them off. It almost seemed like he was afraid to take his charters to the next level or lacked the ability to create depth. The story line was predictable the only unknown was which charter was going to live through the adventure. And after dragging the story for 335 pages he concludes with a 2 and 1/2-page epilogue.

Once you get past that, it's hard to put it down.I started looking at our own roads in a much different light. Imagine where we were 1000 years ago, and imagine where we will be a 1000 from now. Add to that a major catastrophe that destroys all records of history -- what would people think our roads were used for? Beyond roads, what about cars, trains, shops, etc?

Here, he breathes new life into the post-disaster re-building civilization genre. The characters are compelling, and the book has haunting images. The book is chock full of exciting adventure.I agree with other reviewers that the book runs out of steam, and the ending seems anti-climactic. Often, the characters behave in absurd ways. For example, in their quest to retreive the lost secrets of the 21st century, they (for no apparent reason) decline a perfectly good opportunity to download an encyclopedia from a sentient computer.Nevertheless, the book has enough virtues to overcome these flaws. Although the book has an often wistful mood (that sometimes becomes maudlin), it also has humor. My favorite scene involves the robot who still stands guard at the bank - a scene you can't recall without smiling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jack, what happened dude?!","review":"After enjoying McDevitt's well written, exciting, and imaginative \\"Deepsix\\", I was shocked and dismayed at the ineptitude of this book. It has an interesting premise and starts off ok, but then goes downhill fast. The reader is told, not shown what's happening in this poorly written book, and character development is virtually nonexistent. At one point I was informed that a couple of the characters had \\"changed\\". Well, I had to take his word for it since they kept going through the motions the same way as before. And two of the characters fell in love even though they had barely spoken or interacted! Also, mundane details kept getting described in detail while important/interesting stuff was completely glossed over! Ugh. I skimmed through to finish but it was a chore, I didn't really care what happened. If you want my advice, avoid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Abrupt ending; not up to the quality of his previous work","review":"The problem with the ending of this book isn't that it isn't \\"heroic\\" or upbeat, but just that it is poorly developed. It's almost like the author was suddenly told he had to wrap everything up in 15 pages, and just dumped off the characters and wrote a quickie ending, without much detail to back it up. The final 'chapter', reads more like an outline than anything else - X goes off to get married, Y set up a shop.. I would rather have waited for a sequel that dealt with the rest of the story more fully than to have the ending that this book has."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Post-Apocalytic Sci-Fi","review":"I have come to respect Jack McDevitt's work and thoroughly enjoyed Eternity Road. Like his other fiction, he writes in the sci-fi genre but doesn't get caught up in the technology. Instead, he focuses on people and their situations.Eternity Road reveals a fragmented, future Earth where all technology has been lost, and no one seems interested in reclaiming it, or even wondering what happened to those who came before them. Except for a too small group of people who decide to look for the source of all lost technology: The Haven.Although McDevitt's novels contain small plot holes, this book was no easier to put down than any of his other works. Highly readable and highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Roadmaker's world is that of intrigue and mystery","review":"McDevitt has done a great job with this story. He creaated a world that pulls you in and will not let you go untill it is through with you.Note: The world of the Roadmakers is one that definitly could use returning to. Please come back Jack."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as bad as other reviewers led me to believe","review":"After reading the other reviews, I decided to read the novel anyway, and just be prepared for an abrupt ending. The ending didn't bother me and didn't seem any more abrupt than the ending for ENGINES OF CREATION. I enjoyed the book, and think it is definitely worth reading if you have enjoyed any of the author's previous works."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book dragged way too much","review":"The first few chapters really dragged. Too much information without really moving the story forward. Then when they start out on the expedition the pace does pick up for a time. But then the ending is a big, boring let-down. It was a great concept but the author really didn't follow through and present it in a way that made it readable."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book sucked!","review":"We had to read this book for Engish class and I hated reading every last word. I enjoyed reading Julius Ceaser or Homer or William Shakespere better than this book. I was totally lost around the part from page 1 to page 400 something. I couldn't even stay awake for 5 minutes while reading this book. It had a good summary on the back off the book. That's why i bought the stupid thing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing relative to his prior works","review":"I had expected more after reading The Hercules Text and Engines of God. It seemed like a standard post-apocalypse story, with very few surprises, not particularly interesting characters, a romance which is tepid at best, and an ending which is so dull as to be unexpected in a science-fiction story. I can only hope the next book is up to his usually high standards."},{"rating":"2","title":"What will the future look like?","review":"I liked this book, although I had several problems with it. The book proposes that all books had not survived the 1000 years time after a plague wiped out almost all of humanity. Yet the dead sea scrolls and egyptian papyrus have survived far longer into our time. The characters show some modern attitudes and handle situations that a \\"primate\\" post-apocalyptic society would, I believe, react to differently. The ending is a bit of a let down, and the mysterious Ksrik Endine's reaction, destroying all those books!!! was insane, and the boatmen just watching him destroy them is nonsense. Other than that, the book does present an interesting future and interesting characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"An engaging read, but not my favorite McDevitt book.","review":"\\"Eternity Road\\" Jack McDevitt's post apocalypse novel, while not his best work, is nevertheless completely engaging. I read the entire work within one day.This is a classic \\"quest\\" tale -- and, like many such quests, the answers at the journey's end are not quite what was expected by the participants in the quest.I found many (but not all) of the details believable. A sentient computer still runnning trains -- but only a handful of books surviving the disaster. An apparently immediate rediscovery of religion -- and virtually no remembrance of the belief structures of only a few centuries before.But for these minor flaws, the reader is treated to a group of engaging, well developed characters, profound love, interesting speculation, and high adventure.This book is definitely worth the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent idea, poor story","review":"Eternity Road is a novel set long after the End of the World As We Know it. Civilization is coming back, and wondering at the ruins of what came before. One young woman gathers up an eccentric group of explorers and sets out to find a lost library, guided only by some sketches and a thought-lost copy of A Connecticut Yankee In King Arther's Court.A decent setup. But the book completely fails to live up to its promise. Stilted, flat characters, a world you can't bring yourself to care about, odd little side lectures about society told half from a narrator's perspective, half as if it was a history book, an abrupt ending that changes NOTHING in the world despite the promise of changing everything..Skip it. This book is a poster child for \\"Good idea, bad execution\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"A haunting and chilling experience.","review":"As I first read this book it was very haunting and chilling that it left me with a sense of loneliness that I cannot explain. A sadness for the characters who embark on a journey to find the truth about a lost civilization of the Road Makers.Eternity Road is a great read for any reader who wants to get lost in an adventure or a journey. A perfect soul searching story that will leave you breathless. Eternity Road is also perfect book that is hard to put down."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite McDevitt","review":"Eternity Road follows the trip of a post-apocalyptic group of people who, for a variety of reasons, are following in the footsteps of a previous expedition that sought a trove of artifacts and knowledge of the pre-apocalyptic world. McDevitt's no Hemmingway, but his novels are fun and intriguing. Eternity Road captures the wonder and outright confusion the characters feel as they try to understand a past that was lost to them because of a devastating plague that occurs 70 years from now. There are details one could quibble with, but McDevitt sets up and plays out the mystery nicely.I normally look for hard sci-fi centered on space exploration, but this was a nice diversion and I actually prefer it to Engines of God and Moonfall (although I liked them as well)."},{"rating":"2","title":"great cd","review":"this is a great cd of Elvis recordings for his 68 tv special and this is a must cd for Elvis fans that love his music from this tv special..nice outtakes from this sessions..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a bad little picture","review":"An agreeable time killer that mixes comedy and suspense, although the latter element is cut off short by an abrupt ending.

It was taking toll on our lives with this Vicks Ovitrack. Once the battery is gone, replacing would not help. It just give you error message. There is no back light, no memory for previous temp. I switch to Terumo C-531 from Japan. It costs $18 to $24, but it has back light to show when it is ready to take the temp, reads after 20 seconds with quiet 3 beeps with memory. It is smaller and water proof, so you can wash it each time. I wish I had this all along."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reading Discrepancies","review":"Because I am a little high strung when it comes to accuracy when taking my temperature, I tested this thermometer by measuring my temperature on both sides of my mouth -- every day. Fortunately, when I ovulate my temperature jumps SIGNIFICANTLY, so I am sure when there has been a change. But for women who have less significant temperature changes, I found this thermometer consistently inconsistent with its readings -- even when taking my temp on the same side twice in a row the readings were different enough to be statistically significant for many women.I also had the same difficulties with turning it on and off with the little push button at the end that other commenters had. And the lack of lighting is a frustrating non-feature as well.

It grabs your imagination and takes you away. Alice, the game, is faithful to the concept, but adds a few dark twists here and there (which don't detract from the Alice theme). Gameplay can be quite hard if you're not used to first-person shooters, but it's worth it to go through this whole game. I thoroughly enjoyed it and was left in awe at the graphics. Alice uses the Quake 3 engine, which should stand up to scrutiny graphics-wise for at least 5 more years. The price for this game is a steal considering the amount of gameplay within. It'll keep you busy for many many hours.

Rose came to America in 1836. She was taken by the ideas of the utopian Robert Owen and was a socialist for the rest of her life. She was one of the most prominent players in the abolitionist, freethought and suffragist movements in the middle of the nineteenth century. Conventions were common back then, and Rose was often a featured speaker and/or organizer for these conventions. Eventually she returned to Europe, where she remained an active suffragist and freethinker until her death in 1892.Kolmerten's informative footnotes appear at the bottom of the page, which encourages the reader to refer to them. No fault of the author's, but the book is somewhat repetitive only because Rose steadfastly concentrated on the right to vote, for a change in the divorce laws, and an end to slavery.This is an interesting and well-documented book about an unsung hero of the nineteenth century."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back up source.","review":"Clymer books are well worth the money.

I'm not one for violence and some of the violence is described quite graphically. To be fair, I must say that the final days will probably be as wicked as they are described here.

This is without a doubt the worst book I have ever read. I had read Saul's book Black Lightning and found that one rather interesting so I decided to give The Homing a shot. I figured it was a bestselling novel so it has to be pretty decent. Wrong. The only reason I kept reading was because I just kept telling myself that it had to get better. Unfortunately, it just kept getting worse. The ending of this book was beyond ridiculous. I guess this book is considered to be in the horror genre. The only horror to be found in this book is that John Saul could conceive of something so absurd and that anyone could actually find this an enjoyable read.

While some of the book was entertaining, it certainly wasn't frightening, and honestly, not riveting. I almost gave up on it early on. The serial killer subplot seems to be worth it, but even that becomes ludicrous when we find out more about who we're dealing with.The whole problem with the book comes down to implausibility.

Little did she realize that her dreams could turn into a nightmare that she couldn't fight.I used to read John Saul's books when I was younger. I quit when I got tired to reading the same theme over and over -- usually children in danger from ancient evil. Then he brought in tech as a method of endangering them. I am a mother and have nightmares enough about my children's safety.I enjoyed this book -- kinda. I would have enjoyed it more if he could have decided on one plot and stuck with it. Dealing with the serial killer should have been enough -- some of that was chilling. However, I found much concerning the homing silly and hard to suspend disbelief.

He definitely has no problem with eliminating major characters to drive the plot. I have read other reviews, and I agree that much of the stuff was repetitive, but I did enjoy and feel for the characters, especially the doctor. Mr. Saul has no problem killing kids, and has always been unnerving to me, especially in his first book, \\"Suffer the Children\\". Other books, like \\"Shadows\\" and \\"Cry for the Strangers\\" killed off kids as if it was a natural thing. Sure, it's not pretty prose, but Mr. Saul spares no one to move the plot along. \\"The Homing\\" had good characters, solid drive and an interesting premise, as well as the really bad requisite bad guy. I enjoyed it. Saul spares no one. Everyone is fair game. Unfortunately, just like life.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome summer reading book.","review":"This book was great!

I have never before been so glued to a screen. Lem's fate was wrenching; this strong, brave, simple, loyal, truthful man. Perhaps it's a deficiency on my part, but Vic's deeds never seemed so bad to me, until the guard is killed at the warehouse; after Terry he didn't do anything really bad for quite a while. He has so many admirable qualities; in spite of his crimes he seems to have a brilliance missing in the detached Dutch, the angry Claudette, let alone the disgusting Kavanaugh, who are all certainly much more law abiding. Like another favorite character, Barry Lyndon, Vic's strengths lead him inexorably to his doom; certainly an analogy for the human condition. I'm so sorry all their relationships went so bad; I wanted to see them with a true partner."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Shield, 5th Season","review":"This is very, very sad (quality, content). The majority of the CD component is reruns from previous seasons. All they added was a very brief 1 minute segment where Danny is in the hospital with the baby and talks to Vic. Next the only other thing that is new is a minuscule segment of a poorly attended funeral for Lem with Vic opening the casket lid to put in the arm wrestling award. I wouldn't call this a \\"season\\" at all, just a review. A very poor ending for all of the drama in the previous series. Would not recommend buying.There is a very lengthy tribute for the deceased executive producer which shows that he was well liked and respected."},{"rating":"2","title":"SAD OLD MAN 2","review":"The shield came to uk in the wake of a number of other us series.

The story has a good pace from one sequence to the next, but at the end I didn't really feel like much happened.The only major flaw I can find is the abundance of made-up words, many of which are too similar to each other, and a few of which serve no purpose and shouldn't have made it to the final draft."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book","review":"robert fanney came to my school and told us about this book and how it took him nine years to complete it. when he told us that luthiel took her siters place for the vyrl i automatically thought about the hunger games but it turms out that this book is different from what i expected when he read a part of it for us. he says that he is currently working on the third book. so for all those who like fantasy novels with supries around every corner, this book is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!!!!","review":"Wow...

Luthiel is an orphan with an uncertain past who was adopted by a loving family. The family has a younger daughter and the two are lovingly devoted to each other; the book opens with a scene of them playing in the friendly woods around their village. Their life, briefly described, is very ordinary in a small and intimate village in the middle of a big and mostly unknown world. The village is beset by evil that appears during their woodland play; Luthiel is drawn into it. Luthiel starts on a frightning and lonely journey to try to save her sister and her village. Her adventures reach a temporary conclusion as this first volume ends. A very satisfying read. Even in my busy life, I had to read a chapter a day, and I didn't want to read faster so as to make it last longer. Highly recommended and waiting anxiously for the second volume."},{"rating":"2","title":"Luthiel's Song","review":"A thoroughly enjoyable book. Mr. Fanney's characters, creatures, and storyline made the book hard to put down. And unfortunately, when I did put it down (three days after I started it), I quickly went to Robert Fanney's myspace, I thanked him for Luthiel's Song, and asked when the next addition to Luthiel's story was coming out.There are few authors who's books I've read more than once (Tolkien, Kurtz, King, and Eddings), Robert Fanney is the newest author on that list."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent balance of common sense and detailed legal advice","review":"Every Landlord's Guide to Finding Great Tenants manages to strike the perfect balance between legally correct and thoughtfully pragmatic advice.

We are fairly new to the landlord business and just have a single unit that we are leasing out, so while this book is directed almost more towards multi-unit dwellings and multiple listings, it certainly does not exclude those leasing on a smaller scale. I really appreciate the legal charts, for example the one on deposit return timelines, that are broken up by state and list the law for easier reference. The examples of forms and letters are a great help and will be key in being better organized when it comes time to find a tenant again. I also found it helpful that it deals not just with finding new tenants but also dealing with the one leaving. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone with property to lease, and even to people who are looking to rent, for an easy-to-read, very thorough look at the rental process."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of legal information","review":"This book is somewhat different than the other similar books that I've seen. The other books seem to give you a lot of information from the standpoint of an investor, or a real-estate agent, this book gives you the perspective from a lawyer. For me, the legal issues are what has been concerning me the most, so I've found this book to be very useful.The book contains information on: Choosing tenants (screening, credit reports, applications, criminal backgrounds etc.), discrimination laws, how to handle a move-out situation, negotiation, advertising, and more. There are also samples of suggested forms to use on the included cdrom.This book as helped me a lot, and I'll be keeping this one as a reference for when I put my house on the market, and on an ongoing basis as sticky situations arise.

Now everytime I turn my computer on, I get a Windows message saying that ZEngine has stopped working. And my keyset does not work. The keyboard just works as a regular keyboard. Ideazon sent me 2 possible solutions to my problem, but none of them worked. They say they are working on a fix, that should be ready in a week. No news yet.

I loved the Photoshop keyset and the gaming keysets- HOWEVER- the actual hardware had ISSSUUUUEEES!!!! Like for example I'd be working away and all of the sudden a key I HADNT PUSHED would be going ENDLESSLY and in order to make it stop I had to remove the whole Keyset!! This started happening more and more frequently and cost me alot of time and effort when I had projects ruined or crashed by this keyboard. I contacted the manufacturer, got no response- downloaded the latest drivers and all that junk- but it never got any better- in fact it got worse! Finally I removed the whole thing and went back to my old keyboard- not nearly as fun, but it WORKS RIGHT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Seems to be a fine gaming and regular key board","review":"I think Zboard has gotten all the kinks out of the board now. I find some keys a bit difficult to find at times, but overall I am glad I have this key board. Now there are other gaming key boards out there, which maybe better. I don't expect this key board to last years and years, but I am four stars pleased. If you spent $3500 or more for a gaming PC what's 50 dollars for a key board or even a hundred dollars for that matter, if you can not find the game key in-time, that 3500 dollars rig is not giving you much of a return on your investment, is it?

If you want a solid gaming keyboard for your money that won't die on you every 15 minutes after two days of ownership, strongly consider a Das Keyboard.

These guys are like Nickelback with better guitars. Granted there are some nice riffs on here and it's good to hear a guitar solo now and then but this band is nothing special. They are just typical radio rock. Don't buy all the comparisons to Skynyrd, Zeppelin, Sabbath or any of that.

Highly recommend this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Spreading the BSC!","review":"These boys are amazing! Their debut CD is GREAT, but you don't get the full effect until you see them live. Some of the best songs on the album are Lonely Train, Rollin' On and Hell and High Water. I also recommend going to their MySpace and listening to Big City Lights. It's not on the album, but it's a great song. Also, if you can catch them live, GO! (They're currently touring with Hinder!)They're the nicest guys out there and they put on a great show. They meet with their fans after the show and they're so nice...it's like you've known them forever.And I have to say...if you think they're a \\"boy band the label turned into rockers\\", you're sadly mistaken.

From groovy hip-swayin' to head-bangin' metal, the tunes and riffs are the hardest hits yet guaran-damn-teed. Hell ya! Buy the CD, go see them at a tavern near you. and leave your daughters at home.

Starts out really heavy, in the vein of Black Sabbath, AC/DC, classic 70's rock and roll; then hints of more modern heavy influences with lots of double bass drums and staccato guitar, in the vein of God Smack (especially track 3 - \\"Lonely Train\\" which got some radio play here in Pa.). Then moves into a slightly lighter realm with more Southern Rock influences, more precise guitar work with less muttled distortion, and still sounds great. A little light in the end (think lighter side of Collective Soul, which isn't bad, just not as serious as the begining), does not have a strong finish, but still worth the purchase for everything up the end songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great southern rock","review":"I was introduced to these guys on, of all things, Headbanger's Ball.

Scripture makes a clear distinction between how to handle unbelievers/pagans that sin against us(Matt 5:39-42), and how to handle fellow believers that sin against us(Matt 18:15-17; 1 Cor. 5:9-11). John lumps everyone into one pot and draws the unbiblical conclusion that we should always turn the other cheek. He also seems confused about the repentance/forgivness relationship. He makes the assertion that forgiveness can come without repentance. The biblical model, and God's own requirement for forgiveness is a repentant heart(Luke 17:3-4; 13:3-5). True biblical forgiveness doesn't come without repentance.

I'm reading it a 2nd time today. Yesterday, I thought of those who have offended me; today with marker in hand, I'm thinking of those I've offended. This book delineates one of the most important principles of Christianity, forgiveness. The enemy knows this and uses offenses to move us away from the Will of God. This is a thoughtful, thought-provoking book. The world puts a high premium on vengeance and getting even, but we are commanded to forgive as we were forgiven. The gift of forgiveness keeps on giving to both the donor and the recipient. We are taught that forgiveness is a MUST in the Christian walk.

Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen. FOR IF YE FORGIVE MEN THEIR TRESPASSES, YOUR HEAVENLY FATHER WILL ALSO FORGIVE YOU: BUT IF YE FORGIVE NOT MEN THEIR TRESPASSES, NEITHER WILL YOUR FATHER FORGIVE YOUR TRESPASSES.\\"(Matt. 6:9-15, KJV) Just something to remember . . ."},{"rating":"1","title":"The usual tripe...","review":"This bookis one of the many books that merely makes a buck from the Satanic Hype.

Mediocre and that's being to kind.As a vocalist of this genre myself, the lead vocals heard on this album lack emotion and range. Lead vocalists that inspire me these days and the guitar tones that have a new fresh sound come from true power metal virtuosos like Russell Allen/Michael Romeo(Symphony X), Fabio Lione/Luca Turilli(Rhapsody), Timo Kotipelto/Timo Tolkki(Stratovarius) & Khan/Thomas Youngblood(Kamelot)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful cards","review":"I am not a believer in the Tarot.

Once this is accomplished reading other books for more in depth knowledge of tarot is a must."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Cards and Easy to Use","review":"I have been using this set for a couple years and find the cards to be beautifully detailed and the book easy to use with accurate, precise interpretations. Anyone can pick it up and get an incredibly good reading with no previous knowledge of Tarot.The only reason I didn't give this set a \\"5\\" rating is that leafing through the book to find the proper interpretation can be distracting...I have solved this problem by applying tabs to the sections of the Major & Minor Arcana and the suits. For anyone beginning with Tarot or wanting an \\"unbiased\\" interpretation .....this set is terrific!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Did Your Eyes Roll Back in Your Head....","review":"when you first began to learn Tarot? Or are you NEW to the whole concept? Yes, learning the stories of 78 cards, plus how they all relate differently to the cards around them and so on and so forth is just plain HARD! YIKES! Well, Amy and Monte have created the perfect solution for newcomers and frustrated Tarot readers alike! This set of cards has a book that will tell you what the cards each mean, in the position they are in in moments! Before you know it, you will be refering to the book less and less often and then BOOM-it all comes together! I do find this book helpful and once you get used to flipping through the pages, I just bet you will also!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for those who are just beginning","review":"I found this book to be very easy to understand. It talks about three different kinds of readings (1 card, 3 card and the celtic cross) with an easy layout and explaination of each card. The cards come in regular deck size. I rate this book with 4 stars because I have only looked through the others. I would recomend this one for beginners and beyond.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Instant Tarot Reader","review":"I really like this set. Every reading has been very accurate! Some times I find that this deck will not answer the question that I ask... but even though it does this, I still find it extremely helpful because there is something that I really needed to know. I find this deck to be motherly. Meaning if I ignore what it is trying to tell me, its almost like it's saying we cant move on until you deal with this. Now, I am focusing on letting the book go and reading them intuitively."},{"rating":"2","title":"Instant Tarot","review":"This is great to start out with.

I found this book and I have never been so pleased in my life with book!! The format is wonderful. It is not overwhelming like so many others I bought. It covers heart healthy foods from A to Z. It has a magnificent synopsis of each food, why it's healthy and even has suggestions of how to integrate the food into your diet. I read it cover to cover in a matter of an hour and felt wonderful about what I learned. It also has a cholesterol counter in the back which has become invaluable to me.

Chicory is a diuretic which it fine if you have a problem with edema but it could possibly cause dehydration if taken too often and not drinking enough water is a major cause of high cholesterol. Guacamole is made with avocadoes, Avocadoes contain high amounts of saturated fat, although it is vegetable based. I don't think it matters. Flaxseeds are waxy based seed. What do you think wax would do to you blood or even your digestive tract? What is actually in the seed itself is beneficial but extracting it would be costly and therefore unaffordable for most people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea, poorly written","review":"Our Sunday School chose this book for a study and we were very disappointed. Toward the end of the book, we had dropped from 12 people to 4 people. The idea of the book was great, but it was not well executed. The main complaint from the group members is that it was not well written and very hard to follow. The author would make one argument and then present the counter argument in the middle of his evidence for his primary argument. For example, \\"Jesus says you should do X. Jesus did X here. Jesus did the opposite of X here.\\" Other times, arguments for the author's point just did not make sense. For example, the author argued that the story of the prodigal son was supposed to be funny. In the end, we skimmed the chapters and spent about 5 minutes discussing them in order to just finish the book.If you are going to use this book for your study group, I would strongly recommend having one person buy the book first and read through it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing with the citations","review":"The concept the writer tried to develop is unique and pertinent to growing Christians.

Maybe it's the name. In any case, this is another in their run of classy, traditional metal albums. Tad Morose does not really need to be classified in a sub-genre. I suppose you could comfortably sit them next to Wolf or Primal Fear. It's mid-tempo metal with a focus on quality songwriting and professional playing. Production is right on (to my ears). I haven't really heard a bad album from these guys. Recommended if you appreciate straight up, well-played metal."},{"rating":"1","title":"A entertaining episode","review":"Ok.

All of the acting in this movie was overdone. I was surprised at just how bad it all was....story, acting, directing. It was so predictable and the characters were so elementary. The saving grace and the only reason this got 2 stars from me (and the reason I continued to watch even after I realized how bad it was) was James Marsden. His acting was good and the guy is beyond gorgeous. I think he puts Pitt and Clooney to shame. I'm surprised we haven't seen him as a leading man in more movies. I'm not sure that being able to look at this exceedingly handsome man for over an hour is enough to recommend the movie to anyone though. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"27 Dresses","review":"Except for one part of the movie - probably necessary to the story - I liked it very well"},{"rating":"2","title":"Super girlie, but I enjoyed it","review":"Hey, What can I say.

The 27 dresses refers to the amount of times she's been the bridesmaid for various friends.Heigl's character is both likeable and also a little annoying. She's got a great job, life, friends, and so on. She just lets people take advantage of her. Bridesmaid for two weddings in one day? Too much.Heigl and James Marsden have good chemistry. The romance was predictable but I still like it. Heigl the organized girl and Masden's a care free guy.Then their's the needy superficial sister - Tess (Malin Akerman) and her boss - George (Edward Burns). The two are cute together and also predictable.The movie can be a little predictable but I think it was one of Katherine Heigl's best."},{"rating":"2","title":"27 Dresses","review":"27 Dresses, this is a very nice story.

I loved it! Katherine Heigl reminds me of Doris Day--beautiful, classy, funny, an \\"everywoman\\" and a great physical comedienne. To those reviewers here who complain that this movie is predictable, is that such a bad thing? When you order a hot fudge sundae, it's pretty predictable: you anticipate a pretty darn good time, right? Same thing here. A wonderful hot fudge sundae of a movie. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I cannot understand these positive reviews!","review":"This movie was terrible. I did not buy that there was chemistry between the main characters and I thought that Heigls acting was sub-par at best. Usually with these types of movies you at least find some sort of connection with the characters. This story seemed like a poor attempt to imitate Runaway bride. The only reason I gave this movie 2 stars is for the supporting roles. The supporting actors performed well. I laughed at a couple of lines that Judy Greer had, she did great. Overall I found the movie to be predictable (like I have seen this before). It offered no new ideas and the characters, especially Heigl, were stiff. My wife who loves these types of movies was not impressed with this movie either! Especially after watching P.S. I Love you which rocketed up her list of favorite movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Sparkle","review":"27 Dresses was a horrible movie. The romance was cold, and the comedy was lacking. Katherine Heigl was cute and is probably a wonderful actress, however, there wasn't any chemistry between her and her leading man James Marsden. Romantic comedies need strong romantic ties. Romantic enough to make the watcher feel that sigh of yearning for the same kind of relationship. Not once was there a kiss that would make a viewer shudder or dream of having a similar one. Katherine's biggest epiphany was to throw out all her dresses. This was a formula movie. It was very predictable and boring. The best shots were of the ugly dresses that the heroine wore to all the many weddings she had attended. Throw this movie in the can and burn it at the next Hollywood set fire!"},{"rating":"2","title":"G8 ESCAPE","review":"It was a very cute and very romantic movie. I am a big Katherine H. fan!

I hope so."},{"rating":"2","title":"I really enjoyed this movie! Marsden and Heigl have great chemistry!","review":"I loved this movie. While it is predictible, Heigl is wonderful at moving on from her \\"crush\\" and finds love in an unexpected place. She still cares enough for her sister and her boss to set things straight, even though it seems crazy. She finally stands up as a bridesmaid and does the right thing by saying \\"no\\".

They're like junk food: predictable but satisfying as long as you don't expect too much from them. And I don't, so I'm rarely disappointed. But this movie is an un-engaging borefest. Anyone who says otherwise is a terrible, terrible person who likely eats babies, so don't believe them. The characters were, in a word, dull. You never really feel the love, or the anger, or the cheesy humor that in turns marks every romantic comedy. I didn't laugh once. Even the typical climax with the protagonist rushing to find the lover and declare her true feelings ... even this most reliable Romantic Comedy plot device fell flat. Do yourself a favor by skipping this movie and watching, or re-watching, Bridget Jones' Diaries. Bridge Jones would never hurt us. She cares for us and wants us to laugh.

I am a mom of teens who would have been very uncomfortable viewing it with my own or any 13-year-old. I watched it with a 15-year-old and wondered if we are so numb or desensitized that we assume every teen over 13 years wants to see and hear about sex with strangers and getting drunk.As another reviewer said, this is a chick flick, yet quite a put down for women who aren't or don't want to be married.

I recommend seeing it, it's a chick flick but it's funny enough that guys will be able to watch it too.*spoilers ahead*This is a cute movie. Katherine Heigl plays her beautiful a and neurotic self (why do they always make her neurotic?) in a typical rom-com that revolves around a woman's competing desires for two different guys.

Comedy is about a girl who is always a bridesmade and never the bride in spite of her honesty, punctuality and ability to take care of everyone. She is desparately in love with her boss, until her sister falls for the same guy. Her impulsive affair with the local journalist turns out to be the real love regardless of the fact that he may be less than a perfect man she was hoping to meet.

It \\"looked\\" good but I was wrong. I was really bored for most of the movie and it's just as predictable as other chick-flicks. I love romantic comedys but this is just crap. See Bridget Jones Diary or When Harry Met Sally instead if you haven't seen it(love those movies).I didn't see any chemistry between Kate and James either. Katherine played the role fine but I just don't find her funny. Sure she was in Knocked Up which was hilarious but not on her part. I think drama's are her best bet, that is where she really shines!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected...","review":"This movie was just okay...

A girl who doesn't know how to say 'no'; A sister who is so completely self-involved that she doesn't care to notice that her sister is in love with the guy she hooks up with; and a guy who is a cynic on the outside but a total romantic when he meets the right girl.

The movie was okay, but I was overall disappointed. I thought the Tess person, the sister, was really a poor actress; simply put, trying to copy Carmeron Diaz's acting style. I lacked pizazz and was just an okay movie.

However, I was pleasantly surprised and I got my husband to watch it as well and he liked it, too. I laughed at most of the parts that had to do with her being a bridesmaid while he laughed at the best friend of Katherine's character and James Marsden's character.

But it majorly peters out, and I think it reflects a basically lazy attitude on the part of the author. While there is a nod and a wink toward Rashi and Maimonides and a little later Gershon Scholem, Jewish attitudes and thinking are frozen around the second century. No attempt is made to sort out the various Hasidic and other Jewish approaches to the original texts as they occurred over time, or to explore how Talmudic scholarship grew and changed in The Pale. Quakers and millenarians are absent from the Reformation, as are Unitarians later. The book has no index, and the argument, after the first couple of chapters is relatively difficult to follow.It's a great subject, but awaits a better treatment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Mr. Pelikan is a renowned expert on this subject. He is erudite and his words are chosen with an eye towards accuracy that is rarely seen today. Maybe that's my dilemma with this work. Mr. Pelikan's gentle style lacks a firmness and directness that I typically appreciate. He writes so subtlety that I find it difficult to explain what this book was about and what its implications are except on the most general of terms. Several times in the course of reading this book, I had to re-read a passage multiple times to grasp what his point was. It can be argued that I may be obtuse or lack knowledge in this subject.

That said, this 1994 guide is in desperate need of updating, as it does not deal with short films in the digital medium. Now that digital video has made it even easier to produce a short--not to mention that it's opened up the possibilities of what can be accomplished on film on a budget--the process of making a short needs to be addressed in the current context. In addition, with the number of internet sites specializing in shorts, and the practice of most film festivals of accepting digital submissions, the possibilities of making and distributing a short have far outgrown what this book covers.

The best part about the Smashing Pumpkins' music was the music, and lyrics. The vocals totally stank--Billysounded like a puppy being tortured half the time.

Has any publisher bothered to re-typeset Ciardi's translation in the last 50 years?Why, oh why, did I pay ... for the 3 volumes when it is such a horrible edition?

Man, did I underestimate Dante! I couldn't put the book down. Ciardi's translation is excellent too. I was most impressed by how he maintains his rhyme scheme throughout the translation, without ruining the ease of reading. I also enjoyed the endnotes for each chapter so much that I found myself reading them straight through. Another reviewer mentioned that they would like to see this as a movie. I had the same thought while reading it. The imagery is so vivid it would be great on the big screen. But then again, it's disturbing enough that I'm not sure I'd want to see it."},{"rating":"2","title":"An annual read","review":"The easiest, most informative, and fun version of INFERNO I've come across. I've only read a few others, but Ciardi's translation is not only easy to read and well-constructed, but the book is arranged so that a first-timer can understand without taking a class.Each Canto begins with a short modern English paragraph explaining the major points that will take place in the Canto. After each Canto are several pages of endnotes which explain everything from arcane words to characters to history and are an interesting read in and of themselves. Additionally, simple and informative maps of Hell and Dante's journey are placed throughout for a visual guide.Short of a version of this translation paired with Gustav Dore's etchings, I can't think of a better version of THE INFERNO."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unconscionable Errors in Kindle Edition","review":"Let there be no doubt that Dante's Inferno is a true classic.

As I got deeper into the book I noticed many similarities between torments of different classifications of sins, which leads you to understand the similarities of these sins.

My God, how could these boneheads have decided to create a dictionary about the Swedish language without this essential information? It makes the book nearly useless, and I have had to start over and buy a new one. I don't have any recco's for a dictionary yet, but I am going to try Prisma.

The Elanor chase scene should have been 10 minutes not 40. No other cars worth looking at get any screen time besides the Mustang.

Even if you aren't usually into movies that focus around \\"blowing stuff up\\" and that are clearly targeted to the usual crowd of adolescent males, this movie adds a balanced mix of comedy and action. While Gone In Sixty Seconds probably won't be granted Oscar nominations, it accomplishes something which is often lost in more serious films: It's entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Mustang!","review":"Big series of unreal crashes, a Mustang that withstands anything, and a lousy theme."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gone in 60 Seconds","review":"Unfortunately I have not seen the movie.

GREAT FUN!Oh, the movie's not available anywhere I can find but you can rent it at reel.com!Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must see for ANY car guy or gal","review":"The muscle car era isn't gone. It's caputured forever on film by H.B. Halicki and his crew. This is not a spoon-fed glossy holywood film. It's gritty and fast. It's about the cars. Forget the limited plot and stiff acting. That's not the point. If you want a \\"slick\\" production with subplots and great acting set in a backdrop of cars with dubbed sound (I didn't know that the Shelby GT's used Chrysler high tourqe starters; but I digress)see GI60S(2000)with Nick Cage. If you want to see real muscle cars in action in the wild, see this one.

This film can be watched over and over and each time you catch something new--a line, a certain nuance, the names of the stores, what everyone is wearing, etc. And, you wonder where are they all now. You don't see current films that have been filmed on location with actual people and on actual streets like this film.

Though one slight drawback is it only holds 99 songs in a folder, so you have to create different folders to make full use of it. Still its far better than creating CD's and lugging around a portable CD player. This fits in my pocket nicely. Plus it has come in handy since my CD player in the car quit working, rather than get a new player for the card, I simply got a cigarette lighter FM transmitter and I'm enjoying my tunes with this little device.Highly recommend if you can to pick one of these up.

It is pretty clear that the artist is not a professional musician, nor are the lyrics memorable. Her voice is best on the softer tracks, namely This Morning and Third Day, but she comes off as forced and untrained in most of the others. She is a bit overpowered by her studio musicians' accompanyment. She seems to be aiming for every genere in hopes that a producer, be it rock, country, or pop, will like what they hear. This is not a great album as the other posts here would suggest, but a ok effort by someone who seems to have recorded one and only one album.

One you can password protect, and the other you don't. I didn't need this or want it. I was hoping to use True Crypt. But to remove Imation Lock proved almost impossible.

This album of work, in particular, is a testament to great songwriting. The harder songs are well crafted and deft, but its the mid-tempo melodic rockers that really put this cd in my 'desert island 50'. The lyrics are often achingly poignant, and heartfelt, but without feeling sappy or self serving, and, most importantly, still rocking.

I leave off a star because unlike \\"Herb Albert Presents...\\", \\"Look Around\\" and \\"Fool On The Hill\\", the song selection doesn't cover a lot of territory. As a collection, it doesn't quite stretch the group's awesome talent the way the others do. Still, the songs are infectious in the inimitable Brasil '66 way...I can't figure out why the whole collection of original Brasil '66 LPs aren't available in CD. \\"Fool On The Hill\\" is now out of print, apparently, and I'm not sure 1969's \\"Crystal Illusions\\" was ever made into a CD....curious/dumb.

Britney's performance and intensity looks so poor when compared with Lady Gaga. She should play live, and not use recorded voice. When she dances it feels like a robot she should put more emotion. All in all, the songs are good, but I can't find the spirit of this show."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST POP TOUR","review":"BEST POP TOUR EVER!

I loved the concert when I went and saw it in Portland, and I can tell you at our stop she sang live to nearly every song, it was amazing, but this DVD is kind of saddening to me since they take her live vocals and just throw most of them out the window. Despite this though, this DVD was amazing. I watched it and it really rushed back the feeling of going to this concert, and now I can experience it over and over again. Overall I really do enjoy this DVD! And to everyone whining because there aren't any bonus features, get over it. The concert itself should be enough, it certainly was for me.*The bonus CD was great too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun to watch","review":"Eventhough the whole concert is Live lipsynched (that is the way it was designed, not because Epix chose to do it that way), it is a fun an entertaining experience, and it makes me dance everytime I watch it. Some of the old songs have a very powerful arrangement, and it is a firework/powergas extravaganza. No surprise it was Rolling Stones Top 2011 concerts. So watch it with a 'I want to have fun and smaile' attitude, and enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth Renting","review":"What a train wreck. I don't understand the myriad of good reviews! BS obviously screwed herself up so much she has to fill the stage with talented dancers, flashing lights and ridiculous props to distract you from the lip-synching and stiff dancing.While I understand she's older and cannot move the way she used to, she dances worse than Madonna, but Madonna is effing 50-something! So I don't buy the age excuse. I'm thinking she's on medication for Bipolar Disorder making her movements stiff and uncoordinated looking. Could I do what she does? Nope, but damn sure, if I was getting paid untold amounts of money, I'd be like Madonna rocking it like nobody's business.I felt bad for fans that paid outrageous ticket prices. Maybe now is the time for BS to try acting.

The dancing and choreography are superb, and the visuals look amazing. Who cares if Britney lip-syncs? That's Britney. She has admitted for years that she lip-syncs to put on a better show, and most fans are fine with that - that's no reason to give the concert a bad review. This is a must-have for any Britney fan!

She barely seems interested at all and seems to hand-dance in slow motion. She used to be a powerhouse performer (even if she never actually sang) but gone are the wicked-hot dance moves and unshakable confidence. She barely moves her lower body and is in pretty bad shape. The entire production looks cheap, from the costumes to her jacked-up hair extensions. Sad to see a former superstar just going through the motions (barely) so she can make some more money. I'm pretty much a former Britney fan at this point."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the best Britney can do?","review":"I bought this for a BIG Britney Fan who attended this concert recently. Her problem wasn't so much with the dvd but with Britney's performance. She remarked that Britney seemed to be walking through the show and how little Britney put into the performance when compared to her back-up dancers. If you put out a concert dvd, you want to make sure that it's the artist's best performance. Unfortunately, this isin't it."},{"rating":"1","title":"They covered her live vocals...why??","review":"I'm one of the rare people that is giving this a low score not because of bitter dislike for Britney, because I'm quite the opposite and have every disc and have seen many of her shows. This rating is specifically for the production value of the DVD/Blu-Ray release of the Femme Fatale concert. If you saw this concert in person, then you'd know that she actually sang a hefty portion of the show live, which is what fans have been asking for (especially after she lip synced the entire Circus concert). However, on this DVD/Blu-Ray, when she does sing live, you can only faintly hear the actual vocals underneath pre-recorded tracks that were NOT heard at the actual concert (even the YouTube clips will prove this). Why the producers of the disc would choose to cover her live vocals and continue to feed the \\"Britney lip syncs because she can't sing\\" myth is beyond me."},{"rating":"1","title":"lip sync all the time","review":"i love britney spears. but i think she should sing live. it is embarrassing to see an artist lip sync all the time over her concert."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really poor production values","review":"I was at this concert and thought it was pretty amazing.The DVD, however, is totally lackluster.There is no reason why a good director/editor couldn't edit this show to be much more exciting and high-energy. Instead, Britney appears slow and disinterested in the entire performance. Also she looks like she is completely off in her lip-synching, which is ridiculous because even if she WASN'T lip-synching perfectly live, the editor should have been able to match her lips up to the audio track."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love my femme fatale DVD!!

Since I like to read books in order, if they have an order, I read \\"Fifty Acres and a Poodle\\" first. All the way through it, I kept thinking to myself, 'she writes the way I think'! She makes me laugh and laugh out loud!! I also have an adopted daughter from China, and so I could totally relate with a lot of things she was going through throughout the book; and therefore, at points, it also brought me to tears! I highly recommend this book! And especially so if you've been through the adoption process!"},{"rating":"2","title":"3.5 stars, charming & enjoyable","review":"What may I say that the other reviewers haven't mentioned?I purchased The Exact Same Moon: Fifty Acres and a Family after reading Mrs. Laskas first installment Fifty Acres and a Poodle, which I would recommend reading first. After the author has established herself at Sweet Valley Farm she decides she wants more in life. Namely, a child. She and her husband Alex try to conceive, but they have no luck. They finally decide to adopt a child from China. I believe that many women will identify with this story & all the emotions Mrs. Laskas experiences.While this is a charming and enjoyable read, I preferred 50 Acres and a Poodle. This book felt a little forced to me. Obviously, this one wasn't as carefree and funny, as it dealt with more serious issues. It's still a great book and one I'd still recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quaint and homey!","review":"This follow up book was cute, but a tad slow at times. The author talks about her life on the farm, like your chatting with an old friend. You think (and wish) you were there as well!

The first scene seems so funny that I thought I was in for a treat. Unfortunately that was it as the director of the movie shouts out 'CUT' and the movie stars revolving around the cast and crew that are making this film.The movie turns into a serial killer movie about the lead actresses. All of them seem to be getting murdered. Enter in Edy Williams as the new actress.Some mild who dunnit, lots of Edy Williams disrobing and that's about it for this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great looking women","review":"I can't tell you anything about the plot because I was too busy watching all of the skin... There is nudity at least every 5 mins or so. A great girl-girl wrestling match that of course is topless.... I thought it was some good skin for the buck. Lets face it, you're not gonna buy a movie like this for a plot or story..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can you say fast-forward?","review":"A failed spoof on Sci-Fi genre luckily, this is a movie about how to make movies. It is designed to teach you how to keep your actresses from losing their heads, or from losing any other appendages.The movie's main thrust seems to be concentrated on upper torso frontal extensions (several pair). While observing this movie, I learned about the fast forward button. And suggest you do the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good book but the price kills it's value.","review":"This really is a good book. Lots of new monsters to add flavour to a campaign. Anything that adds to the campaign is a good thing. But for this product the cost is very high. Roleplaying books have always been expenisve. But this one pushes it too far. I walked away from D&D over 10 years ago. The only thing that has got me excited again was when I picked up the players guide and saw the content and price. I bought it and the DM's guide and I am certainly going to buy more. I am VERY excited about the new look and the new direction the game is taking.But this one book leaves a bitter taste in the mouth. If you don't have it buy the Monster manual instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth it if you have the Monsters Manual","review":"and if you don't then still get MM... this book has good monsters and nice art works, but its not that essential, the price is even more than the MM, and its merely 100 pages and a paperback! the monsters here are kinda rare and strange, so if you are a DM, just use the MM monsters cuz its more known and is adaptable to the Forgotten Realms setting...even if its cheap, I would give it 2.5 - 3 stars... better get Magic of Faerun or Lords of Darkness instead!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough to warrant the cost","review":"Anyone who is anyone enjoys the mystique and familiarity of the Forgotten Realms. So when any material labeled as such comes out of course we are all drawn into learning more about this fascinating realm. Well do not be spell bound by this product. Yes it does add more monsters for your gaming pleasure, but not enough real monsters to be worth it. Many of the latest products presented recently by Wizards of the Coast are solid, that is why I was very dissapointed by this one. This book was truly written for nothing more than to suck more cash from the gamer. Really should have a hardback to make it more worthwhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Monster Mania","review":"An excellent book with a nice mix of monsters... ranging from creatures that were forgotten in the 3e Monster Manual, and adding a few more surprises.Want to fight a new dragon? Fang? Song? Shadow?Great templates also. And check out the monster that takes the round to coup-de-grace someone in combat to eat their heart. Now THERE'S a monster for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Verbatim Mini DVD-R DL 3 Pack","review":"This is a very good value considering the comparable product is much higher in the big box stores.

That would be the best thing for high def cameras that use the mini dvd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless for me - Not compatable with our camera","review":"This product should be called \\"Canon\\" Double Layer discs.

Reading the varied writings contained between its covers will have anyone who appreciates barbecue drooling like Pavlov's dogs.Elie has done a masterful job of assembling some of the most vivid food writing-on barbecue-imaginable. The depth of subject matter is both stunning and satisfying in what it brings to the table.It is my opinion that including Smith's Rhetoric of Barbecue treatise is alone worth the investment in this book. Often quoted as snippets in other books,here it is in it's entirety for the very first time.Quite simply, this is a book to be treasured by anyone who loves barbecue, southern culture or U.S. history. I can safely bet that once you begin reading Cornbread Nation 2, you'll find yourself becoming ravenous for some good slow cooked barbecue!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well rounded Book on ASP","review":"The book is organized, easy to understand and provides the information you need to get an asp site up. More examples would make the book even better."},{"rating":"2","title":"ASP without all the junk","review":"As much as everyone seems to love Homer's ASP book, I must say that I like this one a little better. The writers have an edge and aren't a bunch of Microsoft lackeys. This book is smaller than most other ASP books because it gives you what you need to know not every single property of the Recordset object. I found this refreshing and it was easy to get my web app up and running. For more advanced (and sometimes esoteric) topics you should couple this with \\"Teach Yourself Active Web Database Programming.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Lack of information","review":"No to many examples using DHTML. Need to cover in more details the full features of the Server Objects that ASP offer. The CD with code examples is pretty empty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book. Solid information on Active Server Components.","review":"The two-star slam on this book is unwarranted. The treatment of database access is not its forte, but rather its concise treatment of a variety of technical ASP topics. It contains difficult-to-find information on creating Active Server Components in C++, and is one of the few ASP books to illustrate (and recognize the value of) using ASP internal components from within custom components. The book is direct (e.g. very little fluff or tangential filler), but certainly not written at the level of a two-year-old or an insult to one's intelligence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Publishers, read this","review":"This book handles databases worse than any book I have ever read. It's examples are shoddy at best, and it's reliance on it's own .dll's which aren't where it says it will be annoy the hell out of the reader. The book is written at approximately the two year old reading level, so if you want to have your intelligence insulted, this is the book for you. In fairness I have yet to see a book better than this on ASP (a truly sad prospect indeed)."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite ASP book","review":"This book is concise -- it will get you going without boring you to tears! The authors have also looked outside the MS world; the information on PerlScript is especially appreciated. Professional ASP is also a good book, but if I was only going to get one, this would be it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the product in teh picture","review":"I sent the first product I received back because the parts I was sent could not even be assembled and quite obviously the feet are missing from the box.

It is significantly simpler. The product I received has no feet on it at all so the stability basically makes it useless for table standing. The finish is matte not gloss. There is a whole wooden piece with screws that does not obviously relate to the other pieces at all.I am massively disappointed by this. Not worth the waste of time and money.

They are great stories about a child coming of age and learning that good will always defeat evil and that loyalty and friendship go hand-in-hand.The book in question here, Mr. Dollins ignorant opus on the occultic messages of Harry Potter, is full of half-truths and outright lies and is not worth the paper on which it is printed.

The Mafia fairy-tales, where the mobsters go to church, eat gourmet food, where Gucci suits, and make billions in crime, all the while ascribing to an honorable oath, and only hurting those who defile the oath.Then, there is the second type, which, judging by descriptions by former real mobsters like Sammy the Bull, portrays a more realistic world where the mobster's dirty business is nothing but glamorous.If one wants to believe in the mob as a flashy world where somehow ethics and shaking down mom and pop businesses coexist, this book is perfect. If one is truly interested in how the mob is really run, I'd suggest Goodfellas or Casino."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work","review":"I plugged it in and it didn't work.

The basic premise is we cannot afford progress and have too many expensive new medicines and interventional methods now. Tell that to your spouse, mother, father, son, daughter, sister, brother, etc... when they have a diagnosis of cancer. More progress in medicine is needed not less.

I've been a fan of Cobain and Dougan's Future Sound Of London for ages - but this album is just plain brutally bad. Their ersatz psychedelia involves taking a musical cliché and piling on swirling layers of stuff, ad infinitum, with no respite - salted now and then with awkward lyrics delivered with a suprisingly amateurish bent... Is it a parody? As a joke, even then it might be interesting if it weren't also so terribly recorded - it sounds harsh and muddled. The last few tracks are an improvement, musically and sonically, but it doesn't make up for the hackneyed and derivative stuff that preceded."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Integrative Revisioning","review":"This work helps to reformat our understanding of a paradigmatically transitional period in American cultural history.

All do not hold up to the bright light that is Picket Fences. (Patrick McGoohan\\"s THE PRISONER is in the ballpark but that 40 year old gem is closer to a mini-series.) In watching my recent purchase of Season One I was astounded at how fresh and relevant, not to mention glued-to-my-seat entertaining, this series has remained. It's easy to see now the impact this landmark series has had on subsequent programming.

It's written very poorly(even containing the odd completely unnecessary curse word!), and does not really stand to benefit the reader in any aspect. Any topics that are raised are simply discussed, and to gain any benefit whatsoever, you would have to refer to further material on the matter. On that basis, reaing this book does nothing but annnoy those who are looking for a good insight into managing your finances, on the grounds of it being severely 'unprofitable' as an educational asset, and a very poor return on time invested reading the book.Ultimately, as the other reviewers have expressed, it would be a much greater use of your time to look elsewhere for a better book on managing your finances, and based on the quality of this books content, that shouldn't be too hard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vida Exposed?","review":"More like In Ya Face records exposed.

Long lag time between plugging in the transmitter before it is recognized and the ipod starts playing. Froze up on me several times and would not respond. However, the main problem is the signal tansmission is very weak and low quality.

Initially, I found it frustrating to use as I would pick up interference from cell phones and cb radios, causing my music to cut out.

I am terrible at remembering names like these. So that feature is perfect for me.I like the on screen transmitter frequency control. I get great reception in my area. When going to bigger metro areas, I have to change channels and the three select buttons plus the ability to adjust with a simple click makes it easy to find a clear space.The only problem is the lighter socket of my truck was a little shallow for the Kensington and it didn't want to hold a connection.

The real problem is the headset's total lack of shielding between the speaker and microphone.

I bought it because was the same brand as my LG VX8100 phone, so I assumed it would be the best. It is not. The earpiece is too big, so it causes discomfort and pain when using it longer than 5 minutes. The volume does not go high enough to hear anyone over road noise when driving.

I googled him, read a lot of articles and saw a lot of video clips and I got more and more intruiged. Then I ordered the book and waited. Got it on a monday and finished it by friday. Every chance I got I read. Dean isn't the greatest of writers, but he writes in a way that ordinary people would write. I smiled a lot at his adventures and recognized myself in many of his thoughts and situations. Some gripping moments almost brought a tear to my eye.Read it if you're a runner (at every level), read it if you're not a runner. This book is not about running, it's about not giving up and about following your heart.As a newborn runner since 1 year, I wasn't interested in ultrarunning before I \\"met\\" Dean, but next year I'm aiming for my first 50K."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspirational","review":"This book is an inspirational read if you like to run but wonder why you spend so much time doing it. The author describes enough of his life to set the stage for why he became an extreme running and he provides a inside look to why he does it.I think this is a great book for those of us trying to get in touch for our own reasons for running. When I turned the last page, I immediately got out my running gear and had one of my best runs in a while."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating Insights","review":"Karnazes's book is lots of fun. His story is interesting, his take on his own obsession reflects a fair amount of introspection, and it is filled with great anecdotes. As a life-long runner and veteran of nine marathons who is contemplating my first ultra, I found this very worthwhile reading. Some of the critics here at Amazon are an odd bunch. Sure Dean comes off a bit vain - to write a book about your own achievements requires a little bit of that, but to take a couple sentences from a book and make sweeping generalizations about his character defects is way off base. Lighten up and enjoy this inspiring story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and Inspirational","review":"To be honest, after reading some of the negative reviews, I had second thoughts about purchasing this book. In fact, I decided to get it from the library instead, so if it really was just an egotistical treatise, like some have implied, then I wouldn't be out any money.However, I didn't find the criticism to be warranted. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. It was greatly inspirational. I especially enjoyed the coverage of Dean's Western States 100 race. He covers the glory of races well run...and he also talks about some of his DNF's as well. There are even a few parts that are \\"laugh out loud\\" funny! I docked the book 1 star because he gave only cursory coverage to his successful Badwater race. The book would have earned 5 stars if there were about 20 more pages devoted to describing this race."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW","review":"Some books and some people cannot be adequately described by words. Therefore, all I have is --- WOW.An amazing runner, and a great book. Most athlete written books are so horrid I have to put them down. Well I didn't particularly notice the writing, it was good enough not to interfere with the exciting stories.I am recommending this to everybody.

Sadly I found this book quite repititive and dull. Basically it is the same story told in diffrent race settings over and over again. He enters a race, goes through an inordinate amount of pain that no other person can stand and finishes it the majority of the time. I do admire him and the other athletes who compete in the events but just felt that this book was quite cliche. Also I found it interesting that Dean says he likes how underground the sport is, but have seen him on late night tv, magaines cover etc and he made sure to include the picture of him from the Sports illustrated sexiest man issue."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great Inspirational story","review":"This book is what it claims to be - \\"Confessions\\" of an Ultramarathoner.The book comprises of Dean Karnazes memories and experiences being a runner and athlete in his younger years and re-discovering the joys and challenges of running, right after his 30th birthday celebration.The story is told starting out with a smart and captivating intro of ordering food on the road while running and then flashbacking to his early childhood memories. The book seems to be a mixture between autobiography, race and course reviews, training advice and a little on diet.While not shy to brag about his accomplishments and ambitions, Dean balances these out with candid accounts of his mistakes, limitations, and struggles.This book is truly a great inspirational read from a great athlete. I read the book in two afternoons and when I was finished I went out on a 3-hour run. A great reminder of why I've always enjoyed running."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read","review":"As a fellow endurance athlete, I thoroughly enjoyed Dean's book. He has inspired me to further my journey and continually test my own limits."},{"rating":"2","title":"He just gave me the inspiration I was looking for....","review":"Coming from a person who dabbled in ultra marathons a decade ago, Dean has motivated me to make the jump from the mundane marathon to the longer races again. This book would not let me put it down, and I ended up reading it in one long session (and I'm not a fast reader). I have a fear of jumping from the 100K to the 100 mile race due to running at night and Dean told the story of how difficult it is to achieve the 100 mile limit and beyond. I'm amazed that you can make money doing what you love and admire him for doing it. Now there is a role model (not your role of the mill)."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible","review":"I appreciate Dean Karnazes as a gifted athlete but I was thoroughly disappointed with this book.

I have run for years, but this is the first book on running I have ever bothered to read, and it was fantastic. I've recommended it to everyone that I know and I encourage you to read it as well.

I'll see you on the road!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you want inspiration...","review":"I really wanted to like this book, but no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't. It is just filled with so much self-indulgence that it literally makes your head spin. Rather than cover off many of the points that have already been made, I'll make several other recommendatins:1) Running with the Buffaloes: true account of the 1998 Colorodo Varsity cross country team. Lots of drama, humility and implied training advice2) Once a Runner: Fictional cult classic.3) The Greatest: Autobiography of one of the world's truly fittest men, Haile Gebresellasie. Undefeated over 10,000m for 8 years.I've read each of these books and everytime, I was dying to get out for a run."},{"rating":"1","title":"Filled with hyperbole and bravado","review":"I had to get the book, since there aren't many books on ultra running. You'd think that somewhere in his book he'd mention the names of some of the greatest ultra runners of all time, such as Ann Trason or Yiannis Kouros. There's not even a hint that there have been others quietly doing what he does and even more. If he had, I would have liked him a little better and would have been more likely to put up with his hyperbole and bravado.As others have noted, I lost most of my respect for DK when he started trashing the Boston Marathon when comparing it to the Western States 100. After that, I found it difficult to get past his exaggerations without wondering how much truth there was behind his words."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ultra Ego Man","review":"By any definition, Dean Karnazes has incredible endurance, but no less impressive are his mammoth ego and complete lack of humility.I found the book interesting to a point. I also found it tiresome, reductive, sexist and borderline offensive and I ended up feeling sorry for his children and wife, barely mentioned in the book except in the most unidimensional terms and reduced to spending every vacation schlepped around in a motor home to watch daddy run.A passage, presented with great intended humor, relating to his sending a tampon to a friend as a gesture of the man's weakness left my jaw on the floor with disgust and shock. I also found it ironic that he mentioned so little related to the birth of his children, an endurance event that most women would gladly trade for an overnight run.Since ultra endurance athletics is becoming so much more mainstream, I'm certain that many more interesting and well written stories will soon emerge. I look forward to that."},{"rating":"1","title":"ultraboring man","review":"run with your heart, push your self, run 100 miles eating a huge pizza and cheese cake on the run etc etc.... he might be a natural running talent but the author has not much to say, ultra thin, ultra boring, ultra about nothing bookish money trap!! try scott jurek or macca"},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disappointment","review":"I was expecting some useful and inspiring information here like I found in other books such as Eat and Run or Born to Run. However, I've just found a series of achievements poorly described and not very interesting to me.

It was hard to decide to keep reading or put down and go running! Great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read","review":"If you are a runner and have been inspired by other running books, this one is worth a read. Tells some very funny stories about the progression from a non-runner to someone who finds passion in running and takes it further than most people would even imagine."},{"rating":"1","title":"not as good as I hoped","review":"This book includes a bit of biographical background plus descriptions of several races that the author has run. While the idea of running 100 miles is astonishing, the simple truth is the the motivation is hard to pin down but the method is simple (Nike co-opted this in their advertising, but it rings true for the author: just do it). I had hoped for much more, and the author floats ideas such as this: running long distances in the middle of the night makes him closer to his family. Uh, huh? I don't think so. Wait for the paperback or get it at the library; not worth twenty bucks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Karnazes makes running a marathon look like a joke.","review":"Runners and non-runners alike will enjoy this book if they enjoy reading about exceptional people who go beyond what is ordinary in the athletic world. Karnazes is no ordinary human! This book is basically a biography of someone who shows the world what someone can do when he believes in himself. Karnazes tells the story of how he became one of the greatest ultra-distance runners in the world. He tells of running distances that most people wouldn't believe possible. At times while reading this book, I felt as if I were there running next to a super human who does things most people couldn't imagine. This book is very motivational and may inspire you to go out and run like never before!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Motivating","review":"An amazing story for anyone who likes anything running. It made me feel so lazy and motivated me to stop reading and get running!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Coulda been better, coulda been worse","review":"If you like reading about extreme sports, there is probably enough here to hold your attention for a while. But if you like a good read, then I wouldn't expect that much. There's a fine line between a good author who could say something fascinating about a petrified turd and an average author who could make a great story fall a bit flat. Unfortunately, we're dealing here more with the latter than the former, which is kind of a shame, since Karnazes' story, if put in the hands of a better author, could have made for a great read. But what can you do? I found myself skimming a lot, moving past the repetition and filler (and periodic bouts of boasting), hoping to reach the end soon and get on to something else. I definitely respect what Karnazes has done athletically. No doubt there, and I am not trying to take anything away from him. Impressive guy. I'm just not sure that this book translates his experience all that well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self Centered","review":"The book is nothing more than Dean telling us what an incredible athletic Dean is.

Apparently other people have been having the same problem with receiving a product that comes in a \\"Megaware\\" box with the wrong item. This particular listing didn't get any negative feedback so I thought it might be okay.

It is a little small for what I expected but then I can't complain because for the house our size it fits just fine.

However, it all depends on what you're looking for:)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Nice Vanity","review":"This is a beautiful vanity. It is easy to assemble and takes about 20 minutes. It arrived nicely packaged with no problems and it arrived very fast. Everything you need to put it together is in the package except for a Phillips screw driver. It even came with extra bolts and washers which is a nice surprise for once. It doesn't have great directions but they are really not needed too much. It is small enough to fit in the exact little nook that I planned for it to go in my bedroom. It is not black as the picture seems to portray. It is a dark brown. I did want black and that is why I purchased it, but it is beautiful and elegant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beelow cd","review":"The cd was new and it came quickly.

I like the hand writing input on the Z22, neat for quick notes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best game ever according to my sister.","review":"Basically, my sister borrowed this game and almost got in deep doo-doo with her friend because she would NOT return it, she was having too much of a blasty with it. Now, I wouldn't call this a game for the hardcore gamer, or even a fan of the original toe jam and earl series, but I would say get this if you're a casual gamer, love platformers like super mario and banjo Kazooie and basically any movie game, and have a good time."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Book is Changing My Life","review":"I say \\"changing\\" because the practices outlined in this book are ongoing, and self-transformation is constantly unfolding. Doing these practices over time has transformed my life. I no longer experience much anxiety, I feel ever freer from anger, depression, and negativity in general, no matter what the circumstances. I strongly recommend this book to anyone who is truly looking for guidance in how to change his or her life in these very challenging times. Sylvia Bennett has given me hope for a beautiful future regardless of outer events. I'm learning to be true to myself, thanks to the wisdom contained in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good... but missing the key! Can you help me find it?","review":"Ok I'm not really 13, I just couldn't figure out how to use the original review form... too complex. This CD was great, it was everything I was hoping to find in a great mix for any mood. But the only thing was, I was looking for this album so I could find that song that plays in the opening credits, the trippy version of \\"my favorite things\\" sung in harmonies by several girls. Perhaps I am thinking of the wrong film completely but I was sure it was used in the opening of this one. I was disapointed that this album didn't include that song, so if anybody knows what the title of the song or who wrote it or even if I am on the right track, (...) Even still, this was a great album to listen to, you should go out an buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"hheeeeeeeeeehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhyyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!","review":"Great soundtrack to a great film. This disc rotates non stop in my car. A great selection of oldies, filmscore and a Dead Kennedys song (???). I happen to love the Dead Kennedys but I really wonder why this was put on here seeing the song was made 9 years too late but it fits great in with the film.Some of the songs are on hundreds of other soundtracks out there and some aren't. This is a pretty cool soundtrack. It still can't beat the wacked out soundtrack to Terry Gilliam's other film Brazil."},{"rating":"1","title":"CRUDE","review":"We had heard that the music from this movie was great....we were shocked at the crude/horrif language. Wish we hadn't ordered it...and will never play it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Arrrrggggh...","review":"Exit Holger Czukay, and drag Rosko Gee to the fore, and what do you get? Well, in this case, you get an unfocussed dog of a record that only has personnel to link it to the Can releases that go before. If I could give this zero stars, I would. This is the absolute nadir of a creative slide that began around the time of \\"Landed\\", with the band's adoption of multi-track methods of production, and sees Can tossing out well-held ideas like their creative improvisatory process to work on actual set 'songs' by Rosko Gee in places, and at other points working out in directionless, meandering jams. It bears noting that this, of all of Can's official releases, is the sole one not reissued on their Spoon label."},{"rating":"1","title":"avoid","review":"I disagree with others here; Serpentine is aptly titled with Karoli's classic sinuous lines, and terrific funky bass from Gee. The whole thing is mellow like nothing since Future Days. WARNING: This CD edition is mastered off an LP played on a poor quality turntable. Crackles are clearly audible, there is little dynamic range, and very poor definition. Therefore: music 4 stars; release NO stars. Avoid. Come on Can, put it out on Spoon"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Good Record","review":"The problem with both \\"Out of Reach\\" and \\"Inner Space\\" isn't that they aren't good records it's just that they aren't really Can records. Both releases feature ex-Traffic members on bass/vocals and percussion so the tunes are a lot more more funky than typical Can and a lot less improvisational / experimental. With that said however, had these two records been released under a different band name rather than constantly getting panned they'd be both praised and highly sought after. My recommendation is to ignore the elitists who trash them and add them to your collection because they're excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this one","review":"The recordings Can made following the departure of founding member Holger Czukay (such as this one) were consistently weak and uninteresting compared to the phenomenal output the group made in the 1960's and '70's. The albums _Ege Bamyasi_, _Tago Mago_ and _Monster Movie_ are strong and inspired and won't disappoint. _Out of Reach_ will."},{"rating":"2","title":"floss","review":"Excellent product and excellent delivery...dentist insists this is the best on the market, however very few stores carry it.

Personally, I would recommend other brands because of this flaw."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great floss bad shipping cost","review":"American Wholesale who sells this product has one of the best prices on it. However, once you check out the shipping cost - which is horrendous - you should look elsewhere. After seeing the price for shipping at checkout to be all but $28 for a bulk pack of 6 that weighs only a pound or two, I shopped elsewhere! Found 3 times the amount at the same price on Ebay with FREE (imagine that) shipping. I sent them an email about this and received a short unsatisfying reponse \\"we sell a 6 pack listing to save you on these costs.\\" Well you won't see that in the checkout price.

Parts of this CD have been released on other bootlegs. It is about 65 minutes long and the sound quality is OK. It is a bootleg, not professional sounding, but in some ways is better than many live albums released today, like those by Dave Matthews.This CD consists mostly of the same musical piece (I forget the name...maybe it is Uncle Meat)played at 3 different concerts in 3 different ways. The pieces range from 14 to 17 minutes long.The worst part of this CD is the horrible 6 minutes of Wild Man Fisher screaming his head off. It is just painful to get through. This is probablby a 3 to 4 star CD but I knock it down because of this Wild Man Fisher crap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad for just wanting one song....","review":"I bought this album about a year ago, cause we wanted the song \\"Ice Ice Baby\\" for a school talent show(This was the only album that had it...we couldn't even find the original Vanilla Ice CD!)

You really have to have grown up in the 80s(or early 90s) to enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the hell is this??","review":"As both a Punk fan and a Metal fan, I must say that this CD really sucks, especially the feeble remake of Jump In The Fire.

What were these people thinking when they covered these songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Common Ground For Punkz And Metalheads!!!","review":"This cd totally rocks!!!! I am not really familiar with most of the bands here but I can say that this is an original concept (whilst some would beg to differ). Punk covers of metal. Every Metallica album is covered from here except \\"Reload\\" (wonder why? :-) Anyway, the best songs on here are \\"Sandman\\", \\"I dissappear\\" (way cool) and even one of the covers that Metallica covered from Diamond Head \\"Am I Evil\\" is covered here. It is always good to hear covers of Metallica (Think Korn, Kid Rock), but being a punk album, the cd sometimes suffers from that \\"punk production\\" but then again, what better way to do Metallica songs? They are a band that always has reveled in the fact that they played punk songs by the Misfits and Anti Nowhere League in their garages in the early days up 'till now. But still and yet, because of few such flaws, I give this album 4 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Tribute album ever","review":"After hearing this, I was compelled to at least write something on how terrible this album is.

None of them behaved like real people. And nothing happened! I didn't understand why Lottie felt disassociated from her husband, and I didn't understand Elizabeth at all. She was shrill and silly. I understand what the author was trying to say--I think--but it just didn't work. Too dense and wordy--which is fine when an author has something to say--but not when an author writes just for the sake of seeing her own words."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow going","review":"I made myself finish this because I had bought it. I bought it because I had previously bought and enjoyed \\"While I was Gone\\" but this book just didn't gel. It could have done with a lot of editing out of excess words and adding in of character development. Neither the characters nor action ever seemed to be wholly developed. I also felt that the jumps back in forth in time and the use of the present tense were done awkwardly - they came acoss as a creative writing experiment which really didn't help the story to move."},{"rating":"1","title":"a long book that seems to get longer as you read it","review":"The relationships between the various characters weren't convincing and I failed to connect to the main character, Lottie, at all.

I would not recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm afraid I forced myself to finish this book!","review":"I had a really hard time with this book and I listened to the audio cassettes. It was a very long story about one incident, the wreck, that was drawn out way too long. This is my first taste of Sue Miller and I'm afraid my last.

This one, though, was excruciatingly bad. It felt like she wanted to be Jodi Picoult.

Of course the ending didn't surprise me, contrived and downright stupid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost there","review":"There is a lot to love about this novel: evocative prose, an insider's look at Washington and an intriguing plot that McConnell launches into right from the start. Evidence of Love doesn't add up to enough, though. McConnell guards her characters so closely that it's tough to feel for them. At first, the premise of this story reminded me of another recent novel, Now You See It by Allison Lynn, which is also about a character whose spouse disappears. Lynn's book is more haunting, and gets deeper into the issues (do you really know your loved ones?), but Evidence of Love is still worth the ride for McConnell's beautifully descriptive writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm your Huckleberry!","review":"I have ordered from Huckleberry Haven before and have intact order their pie filling.

The pectin set nicely and the filling after backing was both moist and firm, not runny. While the berries were mostly crushed in the pectin, there were berries, round with skin on, that could be detected by sight and on the tounge.

I did not know there were other options at the time that may be better as you get faster at completing but either way it doesn't really matter.This cube is great. It is not a speed cube, so it is not designed to move seemliness and fast as a DIY cube or a specially made cube. That being said it does have the benefit of being durable and standard. It is a great learning cube but if you want something faster for speed cubing DO NOT get this one even the website tells you not to get it if you are trying for speed. They have other options which are great as well.One downside to almost all cubes though is that the stickers always seem to curl up after awhile. They have a few, however, that have fixed plastic insets."},{"rating":"2","title":"Old Favorite Comes Back","review":"If you get stumped, like me, I recommend going to the official Rubick's Cube website to get the most efficient algorithms for solving the puzzle.

Shoot, it isn't even worth $5. It's really stiff, and you can forget about corner cutting. I've owned about 5 Rubik's brand cubes, and they were all bad. The stickers started peeling after about 10 solves. The design of the cube is really bad too on the inside. It's blocky and rough, and the springs (which keep in mind you can't adjust) are way too tight. Just don't even buy this cube at all. If you want a good cube, then I would recommend Dayan or ShengShou. The Dayan Zanchi is $2 more, but is the best 3x3 on the market, and ShengShou is only about $5 and is top of the line too. Rubik's isn't worth it anymore. Maybe in the past, but not now."},{"rating":"1","title":"not durable","review":"I just got this and have only solved a couple of times.

My 4 year old wanted it because he saw one at his older cousin's. I first overpaid for one at a retail store, not realizing it didn't turn like the traditional rubiks cube. It was electronic and made a bunch of noises. I can't figure out how to use it, let alone a child. I then found this on Amazon and it was just what I needed. My child doesn't yet understand the concept of it, but he has fun with it and hasn't harmed it in any way."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am just disappointed","review":"I bougth this toy for my kids as their first Rubik's cube.

Upon its first release, the stickers stayed on, the plastic squares didn't break off, and it just seemed like a higher quality piece. I beleive the plastic might have been heavier.But now, twenty years later, the stickers peal off, the squares pop out.

The plastic is notoriously \\"crumbly\\" and the stickers will peel off. I owned one of these for several years, however one of the center pieces snapped off. Other cubes have removable centers held on by screws, making them easy to adjust or replace. This cube has the centers held in by irremovable pegs, making it impossible to repair.I also have a 5x5 rubik's brand cube, and after a short while of using it one of the corners snapped. From my experience with Rubik's brand cubes, it seems the plastic used is not the best type for this toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for a whim, but not for speedsolving","review":"The Rubiks brand of puzzle cubes is arguably the worst brand for solving the cube quickly, or speedcubing. If you're looking to get into speedcubing, I suggest getting a different brand than this. It doesn't turn corners well, and its sluggish to move (even after lubricating it).However, this cube is very sturdy and difficult to break. Great to buy on a whim for some cheap fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"bought two, both crappy","review":"I'm just a beginner, and even I can feel how stiff and narrow this thing is when you try to rotate a face. I could be doing it wrong, but the cube gets all crooked when I spin a face quickly. You have to align the cube just right to get this darn thing to turn, otherwise, it'll get stuck in position. Even forcing it will make the cube feel like the corner piece will break off. I tried using spray, but it did not make a difference. Works sort of okay for beginners like me, but totally not recommended for speed cubers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Peice of Garbage","review":"I recently bought each of my boys one of these Rubic's cubes.

The video is necessary only if you need a visual in learning the signs, otherwise, the book tells you everything you need to know to begin signing with your baby. Just be warned that this is a very long process and you must be patient. I began signing with my baby at 7 1/2 months and she did not sign until 10 1/2 months and she wasn't consistent until she turned 1 year old. Now she signs without a problem and I am able to understand what she wants now.

It also connected the proper brain circuitry to give her the ability to learn her alphabet (upper and lower case) at an early age... and now read and write.

I LOVE my old pan, and am happy to now have two of them. I have learned that the 18/10 stainless steel is very high quality, and practically indestructible. I recently badly burned some beans in my older pan, then hurried outside with it and sat it down on a piece of carpet on the porch, melting it completely through the carpet and backing,leaving a seemingly ruined pan with a carpeted bottom! Believe it or not, after a week of scrubbing with all sorts of cleaners, including oven cleaner, was able to clean it up like new--unbelievable. These are the best pans on the market. The size is perfect for most everything, from small to large quantities."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love This All Purpose Pan!","review":"Where has this pan been all my life?

It is still very good quality but much more lightweight than my Multiclad pans, so it is much easier to handle when filled with water.

Next I saw that the inside bottom of the pan was full of black spots too.Something else that was bad was the lid. The description says \\"tight fitting lid\\" but it was not tight fitting at all. I'm going to try to exchange mine for a new one and see how that goes. Will up date this after I get the second one.**UPDATE**Amazon sent me a new pot and I used it A LOT for Thanksgiving cooking and had no black spots with the new pot. What I really love about this pot is that nothing has stuck so far and it washes up nicely.

The base plate is aluminum, which heats quicker than I am generally used to. I especially like the shape, more like a bowl than a traditional stock pot, so that the smaller base covers the burner completely. Stockpots usually extend beyond the burner and are thin, resulting in burning at the center and lack of heat on the outside edges. Great soup pot, and good for things other that just soup.

The pot has been used on low-medium heat and I cannot understand why this would happen. We always wash it by hand as well, so I am very dissatisfied and feel like I spent money on a brand I trusted.

Maxwell would agree. In his book Winning With People Maxwell states that relationships are the foundation of achievement and the core of a fulfilling life. Ironically, many of us wind up taking these important aspects of our lives for granted, which can be crippling since fostering healthy relationships is a critical skill that benefits every part of life - our people skills ultimately shape our success. Soundview recommends this book because Maxwell explains how anyone can improve their relational skills and interpersonal abilities. The author lists 25 \\"People Principles\\" that show how relationships can be created and strengthened to help us succeed in the things that matter most. The bottom line - Winning With People is a winning formula for success."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Winner!","review":"First of all I want to confess that I am John Maxwell junkie. I not only thoroughly enjoy his books but they help me in becoming a better person.This book is written where every chapter is golden and yet able to stand alone. You can simply open the book to any chapter and it will enrich you. Even though the chapters are segmented into 5 logical sections.I especially liked the chapter entitled, \\"The Pain Principle: Hurting people hurt people and are easily hurt by them\\". This chapter increased my empathy and sensitivity for hurting people. It just makes sense that those that lash out are really hurting people.I gave this book 4 stars simply because his best work by far was, \\"21 Irrefutable Laws of Leadership\\".As helpful as this book was I simply tried to read a chapter each evening before going to sleep.

The reading on this audio book is done well and enjoyable to listen to. I didn't have an expectation of hearing the author's voice, so this did not turn me off in the least.I very much enjoyed what I learned through this audio book.

Although Winning With People is worth the read, it does not jump out at you like several of his previous books. The book has no new ideas or concepts John is famous for bringing to the forefront. I think the book will do well for training organizations how to deal with each other but unlike his two previously released books Thinking for a Change and Today Matters, Winning with People leaves me not wanting to immediately reread his work.

It is fun to see Klingons from an outsider's perspective, true, but it's fun to see Klingons period. \\"A Matter of Honor\\" showcases Commander Riker and it is Riker at his very best. The only comparable Riker episodes (in quality) might be \\"The Pegasus\\" and \\"Second Chances\\". As Riker attempts to fit in with a Klingon crew as their first officer, he first must gain the crew's respect. This is no easy task for a \\"weakling human\\" but Riker succeeds is showing the Klingons that he is no weakling and will not be bullied. Riker learns a lot about this pround species and, in the end, the Klingons learn a bit about humans, too. The result is that both Riker and this crew of Klingon ruffians grow and mature. And when Riker returns to the Enterprise, there is a sense of understanding and camraderie between him and the Enterprise's resident Klingon, Lt.

Many of the social references are of course outdated, but the underlying attitudes towards class and gender are much easier to pick up on. The writing and storytelling was nothing spectacular, and the way the main character speaks of and acts towards women is appalling. Auntie Mame, if written differently, could have come across as an intelligent and warm hearted soul. Instead she is portrayed as a flighty rich woman looking for pet projects.

Lots of code snippets and incomplete programs that aren't terribly clear.

Epson charges you a lot for a printer that only does a fair job of printing photos then they raise the ink gigging to a high art form. It not only goes through ink like water goes over Niagara but heaven forbid the heads need cleaning or the jets get clogged. They will tell you to run the head cleaning routine at least three times, which uses up a ton of your expensive ink. Then if that doesn't work they tell you to put in new cartridges and do it three more times. Only then, after you have gone through enough ink to buy a new printer, do they tell you to get it serviced.Do yourself a huge favor and buy a different printer. We have a HP PhotoSmart 2710 that does a much better job printing photos, does a good job scanning photos, is wireless, reasonable with ink and does a whole lot more besides."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm in love!","review":"I have owned many printers...but I have to say I love this printer the best so far. It's so versatile. The prints on Epson photo glossy paper look like they just came from the lab. I'm still amazed after two weeks.Prints on coated inkjet CDs are a bit under saturated. Also if you want the best quality and water proof photos you have to use Epson paper.This is a wonderful printer for photo enthusiasts and the geek who wants the novelty of printing on CDs. However if you do not intend to print on a regular basis do not buy this printer. The pigmented ink will clog the head with infrequent use.I would give it five stars if it were a bit faster. I still love it though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what it seems","review":"I was using an Epson 890 for a couple of years and began to run into paper handling problems. Believing I had worn it out I was attracted to the R800 as a quality replacement.How very frustrating to find that, after a few months of use, this expensive inkjet can only print on glossy photo paper and basic 80/100gsm matt stock. It will not handle matt art papers of any substantial thickness, will not feed matt greetings cards and is a huge disappointment. Epson Support are very unhelpful, just saying you must use Epson papers which leaves you with very limited possibilties.I bought this printer because it has the potential to produce sunlight resistant prints from original art works but its paper handing problems negate this possibilty. It also guzzles hard to find and very expensive inks at an alarming rate.At this price and after all these years of development I expect perfection from Epson but I find my $60 Canon is a dream to use compared with the R800"},{"rating":"1","title":"Heads never stay clear","review":"The printer worked well for about a year. Great pictures. Then the heads started clogging. It would take a few cycles of head cleaning that seemed to use up half a cartridge worth of ink (on all 7 of the cartridges). So it got to a point where printing 3 or 4 copies between each set of clianing cycles for a few times might give you a one good quality print out of 10 tries. The only problem is it took you a couple of hours and at least $50 of ink and paper. We now just use it to print black and white docs. It does a great job at this because we print enough to keep the black heads clear. I have read a few reviews on Epson high-end printers where they say they are really reliable, but they also use them daily. If we had put a full 8X10 color photo through this printer every day, maybe it would have ended up being OK.Another minor point: Epson has not got around to making available a 64-bit driver that can use the firewire port."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total waste of Ink","review":"I've had this printer for about nine month, and have purchased ink three times.

This case has now been setteled. After spending alot of money on ink. I decided to purchase another printer istead(an 89.00$ canon)and, Im now printing my pictures at target.

I am still amazed at the fact that whether of not I used an Epson daily of weekly it delivers great prints without having to recalibrate, or clean the heads etc. I do like the roll paper feature it has and intend to use it, I am a serious amateur photographer and take photos of sporting events, so I may shoot 500 photos at one shoot but quality is still important.

If you want to buy substitute inks that are cheaper than Epson's stay away from all but especially those from X-print and the online dealer Clickinks. No support from them at all and the cartridges print fewer pages than Epson's.Epson has since come out with the R1800, but the experience with this one has put me on hold for further Epson printers.

Yep, it's capable of amazing print quality as long as you use Epson's most expensive paper and ink, you have infinite patience, and you are intimately familiar with the difference between ICC, ICM, sRGB versus ARGB, and of course the various Gamma options you must select for each print. Being a Ferrari, I just printed some pictures for my Mom and I had to reload the (expensive) Epson paper no less than 13 times to get the one print I needed. For me, it's much less of trial to upload pictures to an online service for great quality pictures, than it is to buy ink at $130 a pop and spend an afternoon screaming at my printer, which by the way thinks that human flesh is actually orange tinted.

HOWEVER, at some point in its life one gets an error message that says \\"your printer has reached the end of its service life.\\" At that point it locks up completely and cannot be resurrected. There's nothing really wrong with the printer; Epson has obviously got a line in its software that limits its use to so many thousand copies, and then it self-locks.

The pics aren't as vivid as dye-based inks but are still acceptable.With digital printing there are variations in how a print will appear depending on camera settings, printer settings and how your software interprets the preceding info. It took a bit of trial and error to print pics of my daughter that didn't look like she had bubble-gum all over her lips. Once it's figured out things work well.Only thing I'd add to the wish list would be the ability to print over 8x10.

For a while it produced nice prints, although it did have some trouble feeding paper. However the print heads are now clogged and won't print properly even after loading brand new ink cartridges and running multiple cleaning cycles. All printouts have streaks and gaps and I have to print three or four pages just to get one good copy. And get this - every time you run a cleaning cycle on this printer it uses up about 10% of the ink in EVERY cartridge. It costs about $100 to replace all the cartridges, so every time you do a cleaning cycle it costs you $10! Maybe you will have better luck than I did, but I do not recommend this printer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was very disappointed in my new Epson R800. My Epson Color Stylus 900 printed better pictures. This model leaves a film over the pictures even when using the photo glossy paper.

This is a trimmer, NOT a razor - it just keeps things \\"in check\\". It comes with a travel bag, which I really like. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is that it eats batteries like crazy! I highly recommend storing this with the batteries taken OUT to preserve life. That's why I like the travel bag so much - I just take the batteries out when I'm done using it and keep all the small parts in the bag along with the trimmer.

Oh, how I long for Escape NY & LA, The Last Man nominees Logan & Max & Legend & Eli, anything ... Dead, Beaches on Waterworlds, Postmen on Roads, anything ... Later, Resident ... anything, Terminator ... anything, Apes with Zombie ... anything, Soylent with Time Machine, many with Dead in their title.Made for TV style acting with a fragmented disjointed formula storyline. Just plain boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"female truth","review":"I found the book intriguing. It is amazing to me that females still have to fight for rights like Missy did. More power to her."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fascinating account of problems with Naval Aviation","review":"This book takes a fascinating look at the gender stereotyping issues that plague the US military today.The story is compelling and shows many of the problems that are affecting all of out military services. Lt. Cummings seems completely justified in here indignation at the behavior of the US Navy and yet still demonstrates her pride in the service she called home.More importantly, Lt. Cummings story is important for all military officers and political leaders to read due to the growing role that women will have to take in the future of the US military. With the continuing decrease in military enlistment causing a subsequent increase in the need for females to fill necessary military billets, stories like Lt. Cummings should be taken to heart so that when we need to services of both our country's sons and daughters, we will have them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Facinating book of real expericences","review":"this book is definatly one of my favorites. I especially liked it because i am considering being a fighter pilot and to read this book is a good expericence. You wont get bored with this book, the stories are entertaining and give you a good idea of what life as one of the first female fighter pilots is like. As Missy Cummings takes you through her naval academy days and her times in the phillipines and all over you will get a great idea of what like is like for her and for others like her while you have fun reading an inspiring book."},{"rating":"1","title":"One sided","review":"Seldom have I ever read a book that is so one-sided. \\"All their fault\\" mentality. I was looking forward to this book, but its a dissapointment. Its a non mea culpa. Its sad to see a person who can't come to grips with their failure. We read daily in the news how women are serving successfully in the US Air Force and US Navy. Many have served in combat. Including Miss Cummings contemporaries. Don't get me wrong, the book reads well, but its more like fiction than fact.As a woman in corporate America, I have faced virulent sexism. But when I see women succeed where other's fail, its hard to chaulk it up simply to sexism.This book was a dissapointment because it was so lopsided."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Terrible Pilot that won't take accountability","review":"The real truth to Missy Cummings is she was a terrible pilot that couldn't hack the program. She was dangerous and was rightfully washed out. Now here is the interesting part...when most people get washed out they go away. Not Missy, she goes to her senators and congressmen and accuse sexual harassment. She gets reinstated due to her senators and washes out again due to her utter incompetence. Her response??? This time she goes out and writes a book on how everyone was unfair to just her. Interesting that there are plenty of other females that made it through just fine and are very good pilots. It must be the conspiracy of the Navy that wanted poor Missy out. Don't waste your time with this book, it's full of nothing but lies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waaaaa","review":"Don't waste your money on this book. The title of this book should be \\"Waaa\\" or \\"It's not my fault\\". I knew this particular female in the Navy personally. I know quite a large number of people who feel the same way about this person.Don't get me wrong....I encourage the recruiting of female aviators in the Navy. I know a few that have performed well and are shown due respect from their male peer group. This particular female is not one of them.

I am a long-time user of Kerastase products in the Oleo Curl line, and have been using the Oleo Fusion conditioner for years. After purchasing this product from this seller, I believe that it is a very watered down version of Oleo Fusion. It's not nearly the same potency as I have received from salons or have purchased abroad. It's as though the company purchased this product in bulk then watered down each container in order to get a better profit. Be advised that the price is indeed too good to be true."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shisha Glass Embroidery","review":"I recently purchased this book because I have become interested in Shisha embroidery. I was looking for a book that would show various techniques for shisha embroidery.I was extremely dissapponited with this book.

Mine came with an Extended battery/cover ($50 value) which easily gets me through the day, and though it does increase the width and weight a bit, it's still very pocketable.Small keyboard is pretty easy to type on with good feel and button reaction.Big advantage is the low cost of the Data Plan.

Sure you get a new battery, but when you are on a conference call or on your way somewhere in the car, it's not that easy to change. I have been charging with the ligher charger in the car and switching battery 1/2 day through. I use it a lot for email- but truly only make 3-5 calls a day on it. The email sucks up the energy everytime it syncs.Keyboard is tight, but not an issue for me.

I enjoyed this movie but overall i think the message they were trying to get across never showed up to me. The whole movie i would be thinking why are these people friends with him. As much of a wonderful man i am sure Rockets was this movie does not show it and at the end it leaves you with a overall \\"what the hell?!?!?!?!?!\\" kind of feeling.

In fact, I am tempted to quit reading reviews in order to determine which books to buy since the reviews were quite fine for this novel...and I am not sure how these reviewers could possibly be talking about the same book that I tried to read. The sexy scenes were so poorly written and constructed that they could not thrill a love-starved teenager let alone a more mature audience. Two thumbs down for this one and I will not be attempting her other novels either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"Like a previous reviewer I was very disappointed in this book.Maybe if I have never read other books of this genre I wouldhave found it stimulating. But, as a reader of romance novelsfor many years there was nothing new here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the price.","review":"This lens works as indicated in the description and is a fun lens to have in my collection. However, if you are a 'PRO', you probably already know you don't want this lens because its not as crystal clear as your $800 500mm lens. Also it does not meter, or auto-focus. However for me, and for the price, you can't go wrong. Its not really fair to compare it to a lens of the same focal length, because of what you pay for it. Even Nikon's own mirror lens sells for near 500 dollars on Amazon. If you still have doubts, do a search for the lens on Flickr, and look at the results. If you are looking for birthday gift ideas, this is a great suggestion... it worked for me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't recommend this lens","review":"This lens is far to difficult to use to ever make it worth while taking it on a shoot. I can't get a good shot of anything, moving or stationary, not even with a tripod and remote."},{"rating":"1","title":"You Get What You Pay For","review":"Lens works about like you would expect. In no way does it come close to a Nikon lens with VR. That being said, I can't wait to shoot at the coast of Monterey using a tripod. The pics clean up nicely with Picasa (free download)...using the \\"I feel lucky\\" edit option for batch photos. For the cost, it's a good toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for...","review":"This lens is a great buy if you want to go on the cheap. But, in general, I'd say save the money for a decent lens for your camera. I have the Nikon D40x, and I wish I'd waited to buy a real Nikon lens with autofocus and Vibration Reduction.For the Opteka 500mm you need a lot of light (a lot of light). You also need a stable platform (tri- or monopod) and patience. It takes time and energy to make this lens work right and produce clear images. If you're a weekend birder who wants to get closer, hold out for a better lens or be prepared to get a lot of blurry images for every decent one."},{"rating":"1","title":"First Hubble Mirror","review":"The lens is like the very first Hubble photos out of focus. I had to shoot every thing with manual settings on A Nikon D40X (all exposures were trial and error). As with the first mirror for the Hubble Telescope - I think that the mirror is a fraction off, making it out of focus no matter how accurate your camera is. I have taken far superior photos with a fixed lens Digital Zoom Camera. I've been in photography for over thirty years and can truthfully say this is the worst lens ever purchased."},{"rating":"1","title":"500mm f/8 Not for beninners","review":"I use my D40 mostly for school pictures football, band, etc. It did not fit my needs. Night games I can not use it. Trying to follow the action I could not use it. There were no instructions on what settings to use it on had to play with it for about 3 days. However it is a fine lens for still life. I am not a pro just a regular guy who wants some close up of his kids at events. Guess I will have to try a 2x converter.

I can't begin to say all the things wrong with it. The attachment ring does not always stay on, it does not work that well with the D70, you must have a ton of light (I know it is f8, but acts like it is f22 instead), does not do color well, and all around SUCKS. Did I mention that this lens SUCKS?!! I would return it, but they charge a 15% restocking fee plus shipping fee, so I would be lucky to get half my money back. Lesson learned: always try out a lens before you buy it. And make sure it does not SUCK! Avoid this lens like the plague and stick to Nikon or Sigma."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why 5 Stars? Read on...","review":"Yes I know this is not an award winning lens that will pass all those technical tests you see in the photo magazines with flying colors but what do you want for $75? I've paid more than that for a filter. At this price you can feel free to experiment with a long telephoto (this lens should be 750mm equiv on most DSLR cameras)I say try this lens and if you find that your creative skills start to exceed its' quality and features then by all means invest in a lens costing 10 to 20 times as much... If you are like most photographers out there (me included) I think you will find this lens perfect for the few times you need a long reach telephoto."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great lens for the price.","review":"For $75 on special I found this to be a good bargain.It works strictly in manual mode, so you have to know how to actually work your camera! Don't expect anything automatic: if you are a point and shoot photographer in full-auto mode, then this is not the lens for you!Images are of reasonable quality. I have not detected any distortion. The lens is wonderfully compact for a 500mm telephoto, so I can add it to my collection of lenses in a fairly small camera bag - Otherwise I would not be carrying a telephoto of this magnitude around, and would miss those occasional moments that this can capture.It also does a great job with macro - So I don't have to carry a separate macro lens around.Only negative - At a fixed F8 you have to have very good lighting conditions for the lens to be useful at faster shutter speeds - With lower lighting you have to slow the shutter, which can add a lot of shake."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for","review":"Of course I didn't expect the same kind of performance as a $$$$ Nikkor lens would give me. So I wasn't disappointed.But I had hoped for better results -- I put it on a tripod to avoid vibration focusssed as exactly as possible onto a high-contrast banner at a race track. But still I never could a sharp edge from that banner.Using the same setup & procedure with a different lens, sharpness jumped a lot. Price of that lens also jumped a lot.I cannot recommend it on D80 and lower as this is a non-CPU lens and metering will not work so it is 100% manual and try & error. The D200 can meter in \\"M\\" mode."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong Adaptor, Unwillingness to Send Right One","review":"This was my first attempt to purchase a 500mm mirror lens for my Nikon. It arrived quickly, but instead of a Nikon adaptor, it came with a Canon adaptor, even though the ad said it was for Nikon. I called the seller, who basically told me that they couldn't or wouldn't correct the problem. So I sent it back. Then I tried to buy a Rokinon 500mm Mirror. That one didn't even have an adaptor despite the fact that it was sold as being for Nikons. I am about to give up on Amazon.

This material was actually recorded in the early eighties after the proper Amon Duul II disbanded (this line up is actually popularly known as Amon Duul UK). All of the material this incarnation of Amon Duul released quite awful. Possibly the worst song on the compilation would have to be \\"Marcus Leid,\\" in which a female vocalist (who sounds as if she is twelve) sings miserable lyrics about being \\"Joan of Arc\\" while the band plods on much like a tortoise munching a quaalude while encountering the gravitaional pull of Jupiter.

Superbly written from first page to last, Sugar House Hills is a welcome and accomplished novel that will touch the heart and linger in the mind long after it is finished and set back upon the shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tom Jones International - Tom Jones","review":"UK Maxi Single Track Listing for :'TOM JONES INTERNATIONAL' - TOM JONES1) Radio Edit2) Shanghai Surprise Mix3) Punch Mix2002"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sam's Saboura Real Style is a Fashion Find!!","review":"I attended Sam's presentation and book-signing in Torrance, California, and I had a wonderful, informative time. Sam is full of great fashion insights and has a terrific sense of humor. I broke out of my usual wardrobe style of jeans and boots for the evening, and really dressed up for the event. Needless to say, Sam noticed the outfit and made some nice suggestions!! Of course I bought the book, and I'm delighted with all his practical style tips. I never realized how little a change here or there can make such a dramatic difference in the way an outfit looks. Now I need to purchase at least one more copy for my daughter's freind, because my daughter isn't willing to let go of ours!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple but excellent","review":"I love this book. It is so simple. I couldn't count how many books/articles I've read on this subject, and while it is the same stuff rehashed, it's better. And it works!

IF you were just introduced to the band this is the one to have. For all others it is my reccomendation to purchse the entire two-disc set of Space Ritual while it is still available. For the beginner this is essentially disc two of the set, If given the prefference I would have this over the beginning of the show( disc 1 ), but never fear this can stand on its own without tieng in to the mandatory purchase of the set."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"The very Best Law Show on TV of all times.\\"","review":"I just truly LOVE this TV Show, I never ever miss it and if I am ever not home to see it live both my VCR and my DVR are programed to record it. I currently have Seasons 1 and 2 on DVD and I just cannot wait to receive Season 3 on DVD which is currently on back order with Amazon.com.I agree with a previous Reviewer; Why do we have to wait so long for it to be released on DVD? Not good. Truly one of the very best shows on regular TV. I thought \\"LA Law\\" was good but this is much, much, much better by far.To the entire cast especially to Candice Bergen whom I have always loved, to William Shatner whom I have always admired and followed from the days of Star Trek, and to James Spader whose \\"Closings\\" in court I have found to be the very best in any Law Show to date, to the directors, producers, writers, remaining cast and to the entire crew keep up the very excellent work. I am looking forward to Seasons 4, 5, 6, 7...........may it never end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great season","review":"My only complaint was that I wished that they didn't get rid of Coho. I thought he was was very good. Clarence and Jerry seems to be taking over the show. Denny Crane is always a riot and I see absolutely no use for Brad. Does this man even go to court? The pretty women filter in and out at a mind dizzying pace and Alan's character is really just a facet for Kelley political rants-nothing that is really based on law or facts. Still, the laughs just keeps coming."},{"rating":"2","title":"ALWAYS GUILTY ............","review":"The David Kelly team & cast are always guilty of phenominal drama/comedy with a message.

No surprise there. This was a piece to complete the series.The big surprise was the \\" Like new\\" listing with the discs having obvious scratches and scuffs and the box looks like someone sat on it.

I had not watched the show at all until it was off the air, but I've caught up with it now. The best part is occasionally, they wink at the audience with references to William Shatner's past as Captain Kirk. Very funny if you were a fan of the old Star Trek show."},{"rating":"2","title":"BOSTON LEGAL 3","review":"I think David E Kelley went a bit off the planet here. I enjoyed the second series much more. Season 3 improves remarkably after episode 6 although there are some incidents in the first 6 episodes which are very very funny. The episode titled Angel of Death certainly justified JamesSpaders win at the Emmies. Can't wait for season 4!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Huemac a fantastic read","review":"I am an avid reader of biography, history and historical fiction, and \\"Luck of Huemac\\" by Daniel Peters is one of my dozen favorite books in this class. The characters, both real and invented, are extremely well drawn with great depth, all totally alive and believable. Likewise, the gods and places. And, thank goodness for the glossary, which helps those of us with poor memories keep track of all those characters, gods and places. I was particularly impressed with the author's treatment of the Aztec spiritual world, which was made believable even to skeptics. The story ends just after the arrival of Cortez (nothing given away here), and a brief history of this great catastrophy is presented with appropriate sadness and finality. A really terrific book."},{"rating":"1","title":"not usb ports","review":".I received my package on time. Shipping was fine.

I noticed that after polishing a new pair of shoes that there were dark streaks on my shoes. Since the shoes were new and had never been worn I suspected there was something wrong with the polish. I took a paper towel and ran it around the top of the polish. To my surprise, in addition to the color of the polish the paper towel turned cherry red in spots. Since the polish was brown there was no reason for there to be any hint of red in the polish. I'm convinced that the red substance in the polish is what ruined my shoes. I'll never touch another Kiwi product again and I'd suggest that you shop for another brand of polish from a company that actually cares about quality control."},{"rating":"1","title":"mediocre 2nd lp","review":"This second album from 1969 is inferior to the debut of the year before. Only Jon Pierson and Wyatt Day were still around from the first album. While there is a variety of styles explored on the album, from jazz to folk rock, ballads to pop, the songs aren't as consistently intriguing. It isn't an awful album, the title track is pretty good for instance. However, like the first it was commercially unsuccessful, and it's easy to see why as this is a bland release for the most part."},{"rating":"1","title":"dissatisfied","review":"never recieved item seller said it was listed wrong but could sell me same item at a higher priceCAN NOT RECCOMEND THIS SELLER"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another voice in the chorus of BOOs","review":"I felt I needed to contribute this review to drive the average rating further down. No offense to the person who gave this two stars, but this disc doesn't deserve ONE. The info on its dubious origins was new to me but not surprising. This one has almost an identical song list to one I have on vinyl but didn't see listed here (might've missed it among the other 121 entries), called \\"Live 70-74.\\" That one is not the greatest recording either, but it's an audiophile's dream compared to this terrible offering. It would be worth it to get a copy of the hilarious \\"In The Egg,\\" but find it on another release and don't bother with this one. In addition to the overall poor quality, the recording levels are almost nonexistent. Unless you crank it up to maximum volume you won't even believe there is ANY sound on this disc at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bring me the Head of the Guy That Released This Turkey","review":"It's pretty hard to believe that this is an Official record company release - perhaps Hawkwind's first for a Live show - but apparently it is.

This is a release from Dave Anderson, who played bass on one, count 'em, one Hawkwind record; In Search Of Space. (And there are some people who dispute that; the bass on ISOS sounds a lot like Lemmy to me.) This is some kind of tape of the band he got from somewhere, and is not approved by anybody legitimately in Hawkwind. Anderson is quite a card, apparently; he was with Amon Duul II for one whole album also, and created a band in England in the late 70s/early 80s which he called \\"Amon Duul,\\" even though he was only in the band for one record. As a result, the members of Amon Duul had to reunite and put out a record to avoid Anderson laying claim to the name. So as we can see, this is a pretty questionable recording, both sonically - and morally. Hawkwind has gotten hosed enough; don't buy this record. Have to admit that the record has a cool title though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dave Mason","review":"I just want to say, if you like Dave Mason; you will enjoy this CD. His songs are when he was with traffic, but they also follow his solo year. It's hard to put more songs on just one CD. It's a must!!! P.S. I also enjoy Daves 2 DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Quite Definitive","review":"Well, it's a good overview disc of Mr. Mason's earlier solo material, but it's hardly definitive. Plus, a good chunk of this disc is simply the bulk of the Alone Together album. If you have that one record you've duplicated almost half of this one. There are three songs from his days in Traffic but they seem selected more for their ability to fit on the disc than for their superiority in the canon. (not to say they aren't good songs- they are- but not the best.) If you don't have any Dave Mason recordings this is a fine place to discover him. There is lots to enjoy and ponder. If you are a musician some of this album is required listening. If you really dig it you should move on to some of his later records like Let It Flow. Dave Mason continued to make excellent records with hits on them after the time that this disc chronicles. If you just want a nice overview of the most likely Dave Mason songs to turn up on classic rock radio this is a great one."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Definitive Collection - Dave Mason","review":"What can I say...it's Dave Mason.

The book is good in terms of giving you lots of practice problems, but does ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to teach me the math! It is a good companion for a textbook, or something of the sort, but it will not be sufficient to be used solely as a math review book.I bought the book expecting to be taught math.

It does have a lot of good practice and explanations. However, this book was published even before the New SAT came out, which leaves me a bit skeptical because they don't know FOR SURE what problems or what type of problems will actually show up. It seems like they're going on what everybody already knows -- the College Board added Algebra II. There's also some spelling errors and typos. If you're looking for some practice, see this book. But I'd feel more comfortable in trusting a book to know what to tell me to study after the New SAT has actually been unleashed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Math SAT Prep","review":"As a Math Tutor, I really appreciated the specialized nature of this book.

Still not great, but better than most of the Liberal Arts majors at the state college.I owe it all to Kaplan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cosmos is A Whole Education in itself","review":"This is science dressed up in the garb of poetry, made infinitely more interesting than it ever seemed back in high school. I really wish my teachers had cared enough to have made this compulsory viewing followed by posthoc class discussions. If I had a choice, I would rather make a child just watch these videos than endure a creativity-killing, curiosity-sapping, fact-stuffing, spoon-feeding \\"formal education\\".Yes, the series does appear dated visually, and the \\"spaceship of the imagination\\" may seem amateurish to today's younger audiences, yet the concept itself is entirely ingenious. For the genuinely curious, who can look beyond these minor quibbles, the sense of sheer wonder in the beauty and grandeur of the universe that Carl Sagan still manages to evoke even in jaded minds, is worth it's weight in gold."},{"rating":"2","title":"value","review":"why is it that over 1600 minutes of the outer limits first complete season is about half the cost of cosmos and the complete first season of the original star trek has well over 20 hours on it at about 20 dollars less than cosmos and cosmos with only 13 hours costs more. doesnt our tax dollars cover enough of space exploration. this dvd set shouldnt cost any more than 60 bucks. lets make it affordable so everyone can enjoy it. other than that, its a must have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Star Stuff & Books from the Ships","review":"Carl Sagan stood in the imaginary Library of Alexandria (in the first episode of Cosmos) \\"frustrated\\" that perhaps as many as one million papyrus books had been forever lost to science and future generations.Using the same analogy, a future civilization finding \\"Cosmos\\" will marvel that at some past point in time, there was a teacher who attempted to explain the \\"Universe\\" to those who would listen.

HOWEVER - I refuse to buy any large set of programming like this. (I would love to own \\"I, Claudius\\" too.) But I won't allow this much shelf space to be taken up!! If they would *use* the technology they have available to them, and make the discs dual-layer and double-sided, I would be all over this. They could fit all 13 episodes onto *two* discs! Three if they had a lot of supplementary material. But any more than that is *ridiculous* for 13 hours of programming, and this has SEVEN discs! Stupid! I rate the show five stars but this presentation 1 star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too slow, goofy and EXTREMELY outdated","review":"Sagan is a mix of William Shattner and George W. Bush - talking with GREAT pauses, emphasizing on MANY words, while using many words that don't make any sense (and using them multiple times over a short period of time). Animation and pictures look very outdated. Sagan as a captain of a starship is very goofy, especially with those [disappointing] effects. Steven Hawking's Universe is a modern version of this, and much more interesting. This may have been a breakthrough in 1980, but today, entire class of Astronomy students was asleep, and for a good reason."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply one of the best!","review":"I was privaliged to see this series when I was very young.

I like the old Star Trek, it was a great TV show. But to draw somekind comparison of a TV show of Fantasy and Science Fiction to COSMOS which questions our very existence on a spiritual level tells me SUDOKU completely missed the message. Obviously SUDOKU was someone that watched the show simply for the 'special effects'. People like SUDOKU are the reason why America is so far behind the rest of the world in Science and Math. I bet SUDOKU voted for BUSH and thinks he's doing a great job too. Carl Sagan embodies the marriage of spirituality and science in this DVD set as well as all of his work. Physics/Cosmology was his religion...and it is mine as well. This is definitly a program that i will show to my children.

I almost gave up on the series until a freak event allowed me to view Episode 13 in hopistal (I ran across a six lane highway and got hit by a car, so I watched Episode 13 in my bed while my leg was in a plaster in hopistal.)I was so amazed and awed by that one episode that I wanted to see the 12 episodes I missed. I had to wait until December 2003 to order the DVD box set. I have now seen the entire box set twice it is worth every cent. Even after 20+ years it is still revelant and important viewing, especially about the human race reaching for a golden future of self destructing in madness.

Since I received the DVD set, I have been watching it every night. Carl Sagan has the best narrative I've heard ever, warm and friendly, easy to understand. I find it relaxing and calming after a day at work and coming home with a busy mind. The series was updated in 2000, so it's not really dated. I am extremely happy I bought it, even though it sounds expensive, I am sure I will continue to watch it for years to come.

It's only within the last few months that I've rekindled my scientific flame, and I owe it all to two men: Carl Sagan and Neil deGrasse Tyson. Carl Sagan's naturally poetic prose combined with Neil deGrasse Tyson's intense passion combined to create a knockout punch which has finally set me in the right direction. I owe a great deal of gratitude to both of these men.Back on topic, however, considering the incredible speed at which science evolves, it is simply amazing that Cosmos is still relevant in this day and age. This fact alone gives Cosmos a five star rating! This discounts Carl Sagan's natural ability to inspire his audience, and if I could I'd give Cosmos an extra star or two.I'd continue, but there are already enough reviews of this outstanding product!Carry on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bringing Clarity to a world full of Foggy Ideas.","review":"This should be required for all middle school students in America.

He is a true hero of our world and he speaks for all of humanity. If you take the journey through all 13 episodes of COSMOS episodes I assure you it will change your life. COSMOS hits almost every topic from astronomy to physics to biology to neuroscience to UFOs to religion, superstition, skepticism, and more. You can't put a price on the insight and knowledge Carl Sagan gives in these 13 episodes, and he does everything with humbleness and humility. Truly the greatest scientist to have ever lived.

I havn't seen this production for nearly 30 years and there have been enormous strides and discoveries made in cosmology and physics since then.

Most importantly, it realizes that while each person reading the book is coming from a different situation, all readers have the same aspiration: control of your financial future. The book is non-judgemental and teaches readers not to judge themselves based on their past money-management successes or failures. It helps readers re-program their thoughts to become their own reliable financial advisors."},{"rating":"1","title":"News!!!

From the box and product description of this CD edition, you can't tell what you're getting. The answer is LEVEL 1, apparantly revised. My impression is that this is a pretty good course. But the text book has a MAJOR FLAW : no index. This means you can't look-up anything easily. My advice: stick with the cassette version. You can get both LEVELS 1 and 2. After all, you haven't really had a chance to master French until you complete both levels!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Still the best","review":"I've lived in France and studied college level French classes.My take on these tapes...Yes, these lessons do not have a pronunciation guide. This is an important drawback and is the reason I only give it 4 stars. And true, the book does not have an index. So what...this is minor drawback.If you believe that the only way to speak a foreign language *fluently* is by speaking it, these tapes are an absolute must.The rote drills are sometimes tiresome, but they work. I learned to speak French in France because I repeated the same sentences over and over. Rote is boring, but is still the best way.Don't be fooled, there is no easy, painless way to learn a foreign language. It takes hard work and effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic wipes","review":"These wipes are wonderful. They work well and have a nice, light, fresh scent.

This is a must buy product and keep in the bathroom. All my friends that come over love it and they have started using it too.The best part is you can flush it and the wipe is big enough that you can fold it and you can use it in layer to make sure the hands dont get wet.It prevents the area from getting dried and cleans it perfectly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"This product has proven itself to be convenient and EZ to use!

There is no excuse for such shoddy work in converting this book to the Kindle format. There are numerous spelling errors and stray letters, symbols and characters everywhere. The formatting is abominable. One of the biggest problems (found by comparing the Kindle version to the hardcopy) is that all footnotes are mixed into the text and it is almost impossible to separate them from the main text while trying to read.

I could see both sides of this arguement, for I'd probably feel the same way if my dad (who knows nothing whatsoever about horses) came to my stable and tried to help. This pony club concept seems so appealing in this book that you just can't help but wish your stable had a pony club program. I sure wished my riding stable did.

For instance, Mr. W. needs to review his concept of the dirsync process and what happens during each time slice.

The only main reason I bought it was for the deleted scenes and the animatic episodes.

The first two volumes where whole seasons (volume one was 2 seasons). Then the real fans of family guy BEGGED the makers to add commentaries to all of the episodes in stead of just one in about 8 episodes. they have fulfilled that request in the last couple of volumes. so it is not just 13 episodes, but 26 when you add seth mcfarland and his crew's hilarious commentary. People who gave this product one star before even looking at this product are not true fans and should not review any family guy products."},{"rating":"1","title":"Family Guy Blows.........","review":"Family Guy sucks.

Both half-seasons add up to more $$ than a full season would. This stinks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Two halves don't make a whole","review":"At its best Family Guy is the greatest animated comedy ever, outstripping standard sit-com fare at every turn. At it's WORST, it's a collection of boring or tasteless gags that must tickle Seth's funnybone, but I've come to believe he and the writers are writing strictly for themselves, not the fans. Price point out of the equation, just the frustration of not being able to buy full seasons at the same time is getting old. I've bought the first four volumes when I could catch them at a discount, but looks like from here on out it's just me and the Philips DVD Recorder. Face it, the commentaries are usually without value and other so-called \\"extras\\" just don't justify purchasing the sets. Hope Fox gets its act together; you'd think they'd be more humble selling to the fans whose support through Adult-Swim convinced them the value of their product. Half the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak","review":"Enough of a rip-off that it deserves my first review after 10 years of buying from Amazon. The fact that the set only contains 13 episodes wouldn't be so bad if they were up to the same standard as previous series, but the jokes are getting stale, and the 'classic TV' references and repetition gags are growing tiresome. The first disc is especially bad; the second disc does at least have the benefit of Brian finally getting lucky. Kind of."},{"rating":"1","title":"It just isn't logical...","review":"All issues of money aside, it just doesn't make sense to split a complete season of episodes right down the middle. What's the point? Would they rather call it a volume rather than a season? No problem--just give the consumer the entire season and call it Volume 5. I would love to hear a valid reason (other than money) to justify splitting up a complete season and the purpose that it serves. It just goes against all logic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the funny?","review":"This will be the last Family Guy DVD I will ever buy. I will most likely be selling this one off to a used DVD store to be honest.It's a full price half season. You only get two DVDs with episodes, and one garbage DVD with \\"extras\\" that aren't worth a crap.My main question would be this: Where is the funny?Seriously, who the hell is this funny to other than the writers? I laughed exactly 6 times for the entire DVD set. It was AWFUL. This is supposed to be a comedy cartoon right?The first DVD set of Family Guy was pretty descent, it had more story and more intelligent gags. Now it's just random crap.South Park had it right with Cartoon Wars. Family Guy is crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rip Off","review":"I don't know why Fox started splitting up the family guy seasons. There is obviously no reason to do this other than to get more money from the consumers. THe American Dad DVD series (fromt he creators of family guy) started doing that with there first DVD set. However, they corrected that problem in the second DVD set and gave us the remainder of the first season with the second. Anyway, Family Guy is great, but don't get roped in to buying these DVDs. I will not buy this one unless Fox repackages this one, or corrects its mistake with the next release."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cooperate America Fox Sucks!!!!!

I mean, who wants to watch TV anyways? Commercials ruin television!!!!Also, Family is getting a little predictable with their catch-phrase joke set-up line \\"remember that time....(flashback)\\" or \\"that was almost as bad as the time...(flashback)\\"Whatever..I hope they keep making more episodes of course, but Volume 5 looks like a ridiculous money-making scheme..After all, these companies aren't in business to make us laugh, THEY ARE IN BUSINESS TO MAKE MONEY!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"At this point it's just pathetic.","review":"Wow, it was good for a while but Fox really never should have brought this show back from the dead. The jokes are lame and drag on forever, the non-sequiter cutaways are more obsecure (the parody of them on South Park was dead on) and the plots are running very thin, even for Family Guy standards. After five seasons this show has already run its course and is no longer fresh, which amazes me because after eighteen seasons The Simpsons is still sharp and funny, maybe not as much as it use to be but definetly much more so than Family Guy. By the way, for all you people that haven't caught on yet, this show IS a huge rip off of The Simpsons, admit it. The family is modeled after The Simpsons and entire segments are just ripped off of them as well. Please put this dead dog to rest and cancel Family Guy for good this time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Always hilarious","review":"There's nothing much to say in a review about Family Guy.

I own every season on DVD. But I will not be buying this volume.It was understandable that they split Season 4 into two separate volumes--it made the season numbers and the volume numbers identical.But splitting Season 5 into two separate volumes and charging more for one volume than a previous entire season costs is just greedy.You will not be getting any more money from me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"still good","review":"Granted, there seem to be some episodes missing, why, I don't know, but in response to an earlier post, there are 13 episodes, not ten, the shows is still fresh, not stale, in fact I like it better then first couple of seasons, so pick it up for a laugh, ponder the missing episodes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Family Guy jumped the shark long ago.","review":"This series should not have been brought back to TV, The network guys were right and all the fanatics wee wrong.

Thirteen episodes for $40? That's absurd. Especially for a show that owes its resurrection to supporting fans and DVD sales. This is a spit in the face. They should be selling 4 discs for the price of two, not the other way around. They should be making Dane Cook look like Kurt Cobain as far as fan appreciation goes. They shouldn't be selling a three-disc set (that should, by all rights be a two-disc set, as the third is entirely special features that would've fit onto the other two quite easily, thus saving the packaging fees) for an outrageous sum. This is another egregious misstep after the \\"movie\\" debacle, in which they strung three episodes together, tossed a few curse words in, and marketed it as an uncensored, saturnalian romp. It's ridiculous and unfair."},{"rating":"1","title":"The show is awesome, the price is tragic!!!","review":"Come on, this is Family Guy we are talking about. A truly great show, no question and the DVD's are great too. THE PRICING IS WHAT SUCKS!This is just another FOX, Inc. Rupert Murdoch screw you good for your money ploy.You are not getting the full season. You are getting half a season. Just like they did with Season 4. Two different DVD sets, 2 huge prices.I do not blame anyone behind Family Guy, this is a real ripoff tactic by the scumbag Rupert Murdoch himself and his Fox executives (evil minions).I will not buy this until I find it on sale at a drastically lower price. Of course, there is always NETFLIX!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Your Welcome!!!","review":"I was a huge fan of Family Guy and I was until recently. I have my reasons, but here we go:Since Family Guy came back, the jokes have been horrible. The episode where Peter's dad dies is just awful. That was fine, I can deal with some subpar episodes, but how much is this DVD for that amount of episodes?Eric Cartman was right. Family Guy must be stopped. Wait...Lets just place the blame on Fox. They cancelled 3 great shows in their prime...Arrested Development, Futurama, and Family Guy. Plus they charge up these DVDs...Fox is just a horribly run network."},{"rating":"1","title":"I knew it would happen eventually","review":"Shame! The makers of \\"Family Guy\\" have a huge debt to their fan base. Who saved their butts when the show was cancelled? The very people they're now gouging with the shameful product division. You owe us, you Fox ingrates! I don't know if it's Seth and his buds or the money-hungry leeches that run Fox or the subsidiary video release company who's responsible for this, but remember, what goes up (Family Guy's popularity) certainly must come down. Along with the less and less funny material you're slinging over the airwaves, this scrimping of episode releases stunt could certainly be the bell tolling for your fall. If this is how you're willing to treat the people who made you rich and famous, then it couldn't happen to more deserving folks.Shame!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THIEVES AT FOX!!!!","review":"The reason for the full price for half a season is simple. When Fox realized they made a mistake when they cancelled it, they basically begged the creator to come back. The show was already picked up by Cartoon Network, so McFarlane raked Fox over the coals to get as much money as possible. And I don't blame him a bit. In an effort to recoup some of their losses, Fox decided to split the seasons to double their profits. Why do you think the first 3 seasons were NOT broken up? Because the show was not picked up by anyone yet. Typical Hollywood theivery, plain and simple."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame.","review":"I have purchased the previous family guy DVDs.

Did i buy them, yes, but hearing that there are only 20 episodes in this season, and they are going to put them out in two volumes?!?! You know damn good and well that they COULD HAVE put them onto one volume if they really wanted to.I love the show, but if what i hear is true, doing this is nothing more than ripping off the consumers, and fans of the show.I love the show, but i will not be buying this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great show, Bad price!!","review":"I only give 2 stars to Family Guy, not because of the show but because of the price. I don't understand why these companies are splitting up the series the way they are. It's not right. I would gladly pay a little more for the whole season of Family Guy. It's become a money thing with some of these companies. They really need to start paying attention to the consumer because they are going to lose big if they keep cutting these shows in half. Just read some of the reviews. It's not the show that people are unhappy with, it's the fact that they are being split up & the cost of half of a season that's the problem. Other than that I really enjoy Family Guy, It's a funny show."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong Disc","review":"I'm a huge fan of family guy. I watch it with my entire family. I ordered this season and the second disc was \\"Nim's Island.\\" It had the family guy logo on the disc and everything, but when we put it in the DVD player, \\"Nim's Island\\" started. This was a short enough season as it is. Now we only have the first disc of 4 or 5 episodes.

Imagine a book about C++ where operator overloading is at page 40! Normally, books about programming starts with a brief introduction about object-oriented development, and some about the language itself. However, in this book, the author starts from the point that you're a master in C++, you know everything abou classes, instantiation, constructors, destructors, virtual functions, operator and function overloading and overriding, and so forth.Due to this, it's an excellent book for programmers who knows C++ and need to know more about C++ Builder tool, and how to extract the maximum power of this tool to implement professional resources in their applications.

That must mean something.","review":"This is boring music and the lyrics are 80 percent filler. In fact, I hate this CD. It's pathetic. The songs are too long. They're boring. Take a look around at how many people despise this album. The rest are just idol worshippers trying desparately to find something to like about it. Bob could have released any rubbish and you idol worshippers would give it five stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a work from himself","review":"I'll agree that Bob Dylan has never had an amazing singing voice, and if anything it has gotten worse over the years. But what Dylan did have was a knowledge of music that no one could contest, originality, and pure substance. Dylan's music was HIS music. It had meaning, color, emotions that were vivid and beautifully expressed and, singing voice or not, no one could sing his songs with the same feeling that he could.Everything that Bob Dylan was is lacking in this album. The style that was his own has been replaced with traditional Louisiana corner blues, and the meaningful lyrics that always struck the hearts of his fans have been replaced with cliche's and emotions that don't seem to belong to him. For these reasons, this album was disappointing to me and will never mean as much to me as his past albums or as Ray Charles' or Beethoven's works have meant to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Stunner","review":"As a longtime Dylan fan, I always think he won't be able outdo himself, and then watch as he does just that. With this terrific album, Bob proves once again that he's one of our greatest poets, musicians and songwriters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Personally I like Modern Times better than Love and Theft","review":"I know that will come into disagreement to those who said that this CD is the weak link in Bob's latter day trilogy, but I feel this is better than the last outing. To me, more songs are memorable than Theft, I mean, I like that album too, but I thought some songs there was only held together by the Bard's lyrical content, not by the song itself. Granted Bob has borrowed a couple of Muddy Waters songs to make new ones, but that is not to say Muddy probably did the same thing himself, and I seriously doubt that Zimmy will be hearing from the estate of Muddy Waters any time soon. The music is more snappy and he is singing with more clarity and distinction. He has learned to use his voice better now, or maybe I am getting used to it, I don't know. If you any reservations on buying this, forget them and buy this, no one puts out CDs like this except Mr. Dylan himself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charmed Away My Brains","review":"Having been a Dylan fan for the past thirty years or so, I am amazed how creative and tireless Bob continues to be. Modern Times continues this tradition. It's a fascinating synthesis of American song-forms fused with Dylan's always-lyrical musings. The preoccupations that were first evident in World Gone Wrong (in which he described modern times as \\"the New Dark Ages\\") are prominent again: corruption and decay, the treachery of women, the dread of impending judgment, world-weariness and loneliness. Dylan borrows liberally from the blues and folk traditions to capture the moods perfectly. \\"Rollin' and Tumblin'\\", for instance, echoes Robert Johnson's \\"If I Had Possession Over Judgment Day\\" and Muddy Waters \\"Rollin' and Tumblin'\\", but bears Dylan's own distinctive twist. Bob Dylan is the Ezekiel of American music: a wandering exile proclaiming his prophetic--and sometimes quirky--visions to peoples who have lost their way.By the way, the playing is great too--a superb ensemble."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Dark Yet","review":"This is the first Dylan album in thirty years where I've taken pleasure from every track. The voice, once described in his youth as sounding like a dog caught on a barbed wire fence, is at its most expressive. An old dog now, but not asleep on the porch, and still with plenty to howl about. On first listening I wasn't sure at all, then downloaded the lyrics and listened again - and was hooked. This isn't easy listening (although it will grow on you) - it's poetry, not a line is thrown away or wasted. Shivered my spine more than any recording since Blood on the Tracks. Much, much more than can be reasonably expected from a very rich sixty five year old. But, be warned, if you're not into Dylan already you probably won't like this. Like a fine old wine it's probably an acquired taste."},{"rating":"2","title":"I heard the deafening noise.","review":"This is Bob Dylan's 32nd studio album. Most of the songs are adaptations of older songs (mostly blues songs) with new lyrics by Dylan. The music has a rather \\"rootsy\\" feel to it, while still sounding modern. I won't get into a song by song analysis, because many more knowledgeable people than me have already done that. I'll just call it a damn good album of Dylan singing the blues and leave it at that."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst version of \\"Johnny B. Goode\\" ever heard (under a fake title)","review":"already \\"Love and Theft\\" was more of theft than love. How many shillings may he have payed the family of Chuck Berry??? Obviously, some like to to listen to their master's voice (authoritarian characters). Sorry, what Jagger said in a different context applies surely to Dylan: Can't sing, can't play!"},{"rating":"2","title":"as strong as ever","review":"I am amazed at how Bob Dylan keeps producing amazing albums year after year. Really it is not that surprizing since, like Zappa before him, Dylan can call on the best musicians around. When you combine a genius lyric writer like Dylan and great musicians, you come up with great songs.Depending on my mood, I think Blonde on Blonde or Highway 61 Revisited is the greatest album by Dylan but at times, such as days which don't get above 12 degrees outside, I almost prefer his newer records.That is a sign of a great artist, that he can to produce great material. I just wish he would branch out into World music as Ry Cooder and Peter Gabriel have. That would be really interesting!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dylan is LEGEND!","review":"This guy never ceases to amaze me- he just keeps getting better and better. My brother told me that Dylan ripped \\"When The Levee Breaks\\" off of Led Zeppelin but he's dumb because Dylan was around before Led Zeppelin- DUH!

This is the best album of the year because it takes your expectations and body slams them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent album","review":"As a fan from the time of the \\"Bob Dylan\\" album, I have experienced all of the transitions Dylan has made in his long career. Some of them I liked more than others, but the changes were always intriguing and well-crafted.

I've listened to this record many times since I bought it."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"The Best Ever\\"","review":"I am 66 years old and have been listening to Bob Dylan for longer than I can remember. I probably have everything he has ever recorded. This, however, is my favorite Bob Dylan CD of all. He, quite simply, does an outstanding job and pulls at my heartstrings. In my humble opinion, he has never sounded better. I play this each and every morning to get motivated for my day.When Dylan leaves the sunshine of this life, I'm going with him."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent album from a living legend!","review":"I liked this album as much as \\"Time Out Of Mind\\" which is a big compliment...this album is lighter and happier that the bluesy tracks on \\"Time Out Of Mind\\" and reflects a brighter honest side of Mr. Dylan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Beautiful","review":"Here comes along another wonderful album which was well worth the wait and sure to please any Dylan fan. He has certainly found his mojo these last ten years.The highlight of the set is a truly beautuful track- Workinman Blues #2. which will make you melt with a fine vocal performance and a great lyric. This is album that will go over well in concert. No reservations with this album at all!The DVD could have be packed a bit more footage - a tad short for the extra amount."},{"rating":"1","title":"Feel Guilty For Not Liking It...","review":"I keep listening to this CD hoping to start liking it. I readily admit that I am in the minority, but I don't get this album. To my ear, it sounds like one long, monotonous song from start to finish. When I am playing it in my office, and people walk in and hear it playing, they usually ask \\"What the heck are you listening to? It stinks.\\" It sounds a little like Bob is about to keel over and die. As a fan of his from the 60s, I feel stupid for saying this, but maybe it is time to retire. I'll keep listening and keep trying to like it..."},{"rating":"1","title":"One star because it IS Dylan, afterall","review":"This was a complete and utter disapointment. Almost as bad as his self-serving autobiography--poor, poor Bob. Unless he can come up with something different, he needs to just fade into the past when all of his best work was made.

I am an old Dylan fan from way back and old and middle Dylan is one of the things that makes me truly happy and I know every song, every line, every story, every story behind the story, so on to Modern Times. After several listens, I couldn't stand it. The lyrics meant nothing and were so trite that they were Kevin Federlineish. The music sounded so cold and emotionless, like a band I'd never listen to again. And all the songs sounded dead, like garbage maybe from Nick Lachey or someone like that. But Dylan? He should send me a refund, and also pay me for pain and suffering. I suffered listening to this. I'm also wondering if I'm insane, since everyone else praises this album so highly. Or maybe these are just the masses who keep the Olive Garden in business, thinking they serve real Italian food, and who voted for Clinton, thinking he was someone to respect."},{"rating":"1","title":"He can't sing.","review":"He never could sing, but twenty years from now,a certain select number of his followers will be raving over his latest album.Why? I have no idea. He can not sing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Things Ain't Going Well","review":"After 4 spins, I've decided that this is not my favorite of Dylan's work. The only track with which I somewhat connect is the final track \\"Ain't Talkin'\\" where the somber mood seems portend a revelation, \\"They say prayer has the power to heal, so pray for me mother; In the human heart an evil spirt does* dwell, I'm trying to love my neighbor & do good to others, but oh mother, things ain't going well.\\" The rest of the songs have almost no melodies with arrangements that blend from one into another. This week, Bob's son Jakob's \\"On Up the Mountain\\" is #1 in my personal top ten. Seeing Things is a far superior set to \\"Modern Times,\\" if it's fair to compare. At this point, Dylan can of course do whatever he wants and it will be published; but this is his weakest set in quite awhile. Because it is Bob Dylan, it will have an honored place on my shelf, which I will faithfully dust from time to time.

Dylan really needs no one but himself to write good songs and deliver them. And yes, having the touring band makes it that much better. \\"Only ten songs?\\" I thought. Ah, but these songs are lovely loose gooses that are just here to play a bit, and that can take, you know, five, six minutes apiece. So relax. So don't be afraid to jump on the railroad tracks and let your hair trail a bit in the salty breeze. Bob just ain't gonna let anyone get cynical on his buttocks -- uh-uh, not yet, or probably never again. He's still our prophet. Don't muzzle the ox that treads out the corn... Yeah, go ahead and buy this one and let it take you from an irresistable shufflin' dance-step energy all the way down to that loungy stuff when your poor old feet are tired.

His songwriting and singing are spirited and accessible, and his back-up band sound very comfortable with the materials and arrangements. Critics and reviewers can argue until the cows come home whether this is one of his greatest albums or not, though certainly it will stand the test of time as well as previous efforts such as \\"New Morning\\" or \\"Planet Waves.\\" Initially I bought the regular CD edition but came across this delux version, which looks great. So i'm buying it again, and will give the extra CD to an amigo. Dylan's worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is It Worth Buying - Yes!","review":"I love this CD and listen to it often.

Beyond the Horizon is one of my favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album","review":"Dylan just keeps getting better. This album easily ranks as one of his best.

I can't imagine he needs the money so why is he recording this stuff? What this CD doesn't need is another review-159! But here's mine anyway-first off-I have never been a Dylan fan (his voice grated on me) and in my youth only bought and liked Blood on the Tracks. My husband, on the other hand is a fan, and he thinks this album sucks. Well-it is nothing special for a formerly brilliant poet (and is basically reeking with co-dependent lyrics-the world doesn't need more of those-Country provides enough)although I agree with the other folks that think his voice has improved with age. I gave it 2 stars because it isn't a bad listening album, it is just a bad Dylan album. And I was hoping I could convert."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why is this so overrated?","review":"I'm a HUGE Dylan fan and really just don't get this and all the hype. \\"Time out of Mind\\" was a mood, songs were generally good...same with \\"Love and Theft\\". On Modern Times it just seems that there are re-worked blues songs. Bob Dylan KNOWS what he's doing...he has songcraft ability. He can do much better. He can even sing much better...he just doesn't choose to. Dylan himself said never to give the public your full 100% effort. On this album he's giving about 25%. Of course, I bought the deluxe edition....that just means he has my ear (and my wallet). Honestly it just isn't that great."},{"rating":"1","title":"mediocre dylan","review":"One user review says \\"If you don't like it, you just don't get it.\\"I guess the 'it' referred to here is the notion that everything Dylan does is genius, and if you think otherwise you don't understand genius.You could just as well turn this around and say \\"If you like it [Modern Times], you don't get it\\". In this world view, not everything Dylan does is genius.Main problem with this album, as I see it, is that the music lacks teeth. Is it the absence of Charlie Sexton? Could very well explain the mild arrangements, but it doesn't excuse the warmed-over lyrics.Mind you I'm glad Dylan is still releasing albums rather than fading into obscurity. I'm hoping--no I'm betting--he's got at least one good album left in him. This isn't it.Best to buy the enhanced DVD package as the best stuff is in the videos, which are apparently pre-Modern Times performances. The 'Cold Iron Bound' video has more intensity and substance than all of the songs on the CD put together."},{"rating":"1","title":"So overrated","review":"A concept in search of an album. I cannot but think that the continual heralds it receives are hero-worship. I love Bob Dylan, but, with the partial exception of a track or two, not this production.

There will not be a third."},{"rating":"1","title":"Out of any new ideas..","review":"Time Out of Mind and Love an Theft were excellent, this CD just sounded like he took all the bad outtakes from those sessions and put them on a single disk.

I won't go into the details, as a search on any internet search engine will give you the track by track details. But the fact is, most of this album is made up of songs that were - at least in part - taken from other artists and not credited to them. I don't give a darn if the songs entered the public domain, he should not have lied and said \\"all songs written by Bob Dylan\\" because they aren't"},{"rating":"2","title":"All Mod Cons","review":"He's still putting us on, of course -- the Grisled, Broken-Hearted Cowpoke Drifter routine is about as authentic as Ziggy Stardust. So it's a good thing his Muse is speaking to him again (albeit through her lawyer, but hey -- at least there's some sort of dialogue taking place.) You'd be forgiven for wondering why Bob didn't just cut the oh-so-cryptic Chaplin subplot monkeyshines and just go ahead and title this tasty platter \\"Love and Theft II\\". And you'd also be forgiven for feeling maybe just the slightest nuance of disappointment at that notion."},{"rating":"1","title":"eh, so so","review":"Sounds just like the last record if you ask me. Always has a great band, arrangements, and mixing, but Bob's still trying to paint the picture of natural disasters, old cars, the dustbowl, Annie, Frannie, Sarah, Ruth and whatever other old timey nonsense he can come up with. God bless him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Modern Classic","review":"I have great respect for Bob Dylan's body of work but I admit I've never been a fan of his nasally voice. However, my 28 year old son recommended this CD so highly I had to pick up a copy.IMHO, the first 5 songs are some of the best work Dylan has ever done. Dylan's voice is getting better with age and, as others have pointed out, there is an unmistakable spiritual essence to many of his songs.This album is a classic! From beginning to end it's the best album I've heard in a long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"The times they are a-changin'","review":"I wonder where is all the philosophy encripted in the song which title I've used to present this critic. He, Dylan, is on the old road and doesn't move an inch and doesn't help in the new one.OK, OK, I like these songs, a wonderful backing group and a horrible voice which never sounded good but never sounded more bad than now. Years before at least he could keep on key, but now...He's a myth, that's all. He should sing only for his devotees."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a mistake!","review":"No voice at all. No real sense of timing. Some old man groaning on in some horrific gravelly voice, and this is supposed to be the blues. Worse than the Christmas album...same sort of thing, which is to be expected I suppose, but blues instead of Christmas music. I wish radio stations would quit playing this garbage. FWIW some of the songs are pretty good, and if someone with some ability had performed them, I might like them, but Dylan is awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly Love Songs","review":"When one of the most gifted writers alive simplifies his life into a series of unending lost love songs, while all around fires burn in the streets of the world, it isn't that the songs are good or not, it's that they take up the space that other, unwritten songs should fill.Robert Zimmerman became Bob Dylan because he showed us a world few others could.

Dylan, along with Sonny Bono could never sing. The only reason Dylan got a recording contract back in the 60's was that there was a hippie movement that accepted just about anything with the thinking that anything goes. Although he had a few good ones back then that he managed to make sound good, the truth is he couldn't sing back then and he certainly can't now. He couldn't hit a high note or a low note because he just never had the lung capacity to carry a tune. With this album, his voice is so weak, he is just kind of talking to music. Ah, the times they are a changing."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best album of 2006","review":"John from Cleveland has placed the best review I have seen on this site, so I will just add my own opinion.

Modern Times is merely one of the best records made in the last 5 years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, good stuff","review":"Bob Dylan has taken a decidedly different turn in his August years. His past three albums have all been excellent, including this one. He has been constantly touring, and documentaries, television specials, and new biographies and introspective books, including one by himself, have all reminded of us of his greatness. Bob used to be one to shy away from the media, but we have seen him on 60 Minutes, read Chronicles, and watched Scorsese's documentary. All applauding Bob. Even this new album is getting rave reviews, often referred to as the best album of the year. I find it frustrating that this could be the best thing offered for the year. For one thing is totally lacks creativity and fresh ideas. Instead, we are treated to a re-hash of old stuff. Nonetheless, it is well done, and it gives us a chance to see Dylan again. Personally, I'd like to see him take a chance, do something that might bare a little Bob. It is good stuff, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not going to waste my time on this review","review":"I needed quite a few locks for my luggages to Europe, and I tested these locks before putting them on however I didn't have time to go buy any other ones.

It was a great deal for 4 little locks that all work off the same key. I've had these locks outside for several months despite them not being made for outdoor use. They have rusted a bit and are harder to open and close, but are still functioning.So, if you need some light security on something, even if it isn't luggage, these may do the trick. It's nice that it comes with 4 keys, because then my wife and I can have a key, and we can also leave keys with neighbors to collect the eggs while we are gone.Unconventional use, I know, but these have done pretty well. As for using them for luggage? These would work great. They are small and light. If you have any questions, leave me a comment and let me know.

My husband got it to work by forcing it really hard into the lock pushing it on the kitchen counter.

Bouncing back and forth between the husbands in harm's way and the wifes, it is all about secrets. I am surprised that most people don't even know the show exists, the acting is superb, the stories are always fresh and new, and the action is intense. The most surprising part of the show is the secrets the wives have and what events they have to go through while raising a family.

This is an entertaining show with value."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great series","review":"I bought the first season when it came out and ever since then I have been waiting like crazy for the second season.

Without the home life portions the show would be boring, nothing but one battle to the next.My complaints are with how unrealistic the end got. I don't know if anyone has read Eric Haney's book \\"Inside Delta Force\\" but he tried to, at the end of this season, force feed people his crazy theory that the CIA and the particular organization portrayed in this series have some kind of miniature war going on.

Hellacopters fury crossed with ACDC/Led Zepplin riffs, Dolf Datsuns voice wailing out of control at times like a feline on mescalin as they find the lost chords of rock 'n' roll. What's refreshing about the whole garage/punk scene as hyped by the British music press is that it has no manifesto or pretense, it is simply about the music and the Datsuns exemplify this.

Unfortunately, this book is now hopelessly obsolete. Barbour's purported steady evolution towards equal temperament, and his thesis that it is the only system worth tuning to, are nowadays not just erronous, but hilarious. The book clumsily describes temperaments in integer Cents. Some all-important early sources and temperaments are missing. No information is given about the temperament to be used for different musical styles. No directions are included for tuning and intonation. The sources are nowadays available in both original texts and modern analysis. Other books fill the above-mentioned lacunae.

Which makes this weak, thin story even more of a let down than if I had picked it up as a unknown author. I expected the usual \\"on the edge of your seat\\" writing and emotional angst that I enjoyed in the other stories and this one was nothing but one big ramble about balloon creatures and long names. The characters were thin and one dimensional, I learned more than I ever needed or wanted to know about AAnn mating strategies. The only reason this rates a space on my bookshelf is that I hate to be one book short of a complete collection of Mr. Fosters work.

Sadly, only the last of my three desires was met. As one reviewer pointed out, this book did absolutely nothing with regard to the first two items in my quest. As a sci-fi novel, it was entertaining with its unusual Jast life forms and an interesting Aann character, but clearly I don't think this was up to Foster's normally high quality work. It seems as though he had writer's block with regard to dealing with the BIG issues in Flinx's world, so he simply threw something together so he could issue a Pip & Flinx novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this one","review":"I love Alan Dean Foster's stories, so I really wonder what the heck happened here. There's a vaguely 9/11-inspired subplot that goes nowhere. The Teacher gets called into action, but then never figures into the plot. It's one thing to suspend disbelief for the hoary old plot device of the series protagonist losing his memory, but it's too much when that memory snaps completely back in place at just the right time. I guess the perfect vacation is to truly forget everything, but this book felt unfinished and pointless.The events in this book are referenced by later stories, but it's not at all important to read them first-hand here. And for heaven's sake, don't let any friends choose this as their first Flinx book; they might never want to read another."},{"rating":"1","title":"stinker...","review":"I have loved this series. started reading the first books maybe 20 years ago... however, this sequel flat out stunk. for those of u who actually read a book before writing the review (as opposed to those folks who think paraphrasing the book cover jacket hype constitutes a review ) pay heed to this rating..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as the rest","review":"The only thing thats wrong with this dvd is that it has no bonus features.

Once you start, you can't put it down. It's a fast moving book and you get into it very much so! Another excellent book by Robert Swindells is 'Brother in the Land' also 'Daz 4 Zoe' which is a modern Romeo & Juliet story. 'Brother in the land' is about a nuclear war. All his books are fast moving and you never get bored. They are fascinating! Stone Cold gives you brilliant knowledge of how it is like for people living on the streets.

The switch between the two narrators was not at all confusing. Using bad language was a good writing technique because it emphasize that Shelter (the murderer) was mad. It includes big words like; scrounger, circumstances and distinctions. This may cause difficulty for the younger generation and may also be disturbing.The author writes the book in a style that I've never met. He changes narrators often. This helps the reader to understand how both characters feel about the situation.To conclude I feel that this book was relatively boring, but I have learned how hard it is to live on the streets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will absolutely cause anxiety to any adoptive parent.","review":"Caution:This Book should not be read by anyone either considering adoption or anyone who has recently completed an adoption! While the story is intriguing and at times gripping, it involves an international baby selling organization that commits the most heinous of all crimes in order to \\"match\\" very high paying prospective adoptive couples with their \\"perfect\\" baby. As the story unfolds, the reader is sickened and horrified by the callousness of this highly successful \\"adoption agency\\" juxtaposed with the vivid descriptions of depraved conditions forced upon orphaned babies in Russia.Overall, \\"White Male Infant\\" is a good mystery story which does alert readers to the very real and desperate plight of waiting babies and children all over the world. However, it also enacts every parents' (both adoptive and biological) worst nightmare and will absolutely cause anxiety to any adoptive parent. Read it with caution!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mystery","review":"The blurb was more interesting than the book itself was.

A lot of people may be disappointed with it, but I adore this album. Each song is beautiful in it's own way.

It is not a bad album, just bad timing."},{"rating":"2","title":"must have if your a faith no more fan","review":"This Faith No More cd is a masterpiece..I never heard one track from it before i bought it,and it has to be my favorite release from them..Pick this one up,you won't regret it.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Album I Ever Bought","review":"Faith No More was one of the first hardcore bands I got into. \\"The Real Thing\\" was a different sound that I had not known before. I loved it. \\"Introduce Yourself\\" wasn't up to par, but it was an earlier album and I liked it in its own way. \\"Angel Dust\\" showed progression, and although different from the others, still really, really good. FNM had a unique sound. When King For a Day was released, I bought it without hesitation. Should've hesitated. I have never been able to listen to it for more than two minutes at a time, no matter how hard I try. Blame it on the old guitarist leaving, but now they sound like absolute crap. No talent on this album whatsoever."},{"rating":"2","title":"This album is, by far, FNM's best.","review":"The vocals are whetting, the drums are thumping, and the rest is just icing..."},{"rating":"2","title":"king for a day (the one you bought it), enjoyable for a ....","review":"As Faith No More began to crush down, not only for musical diferences and Jim Martin's departure, but for popularity, this album comes out as a life saver for the fans and as a golden piece for this musical era.Altough Roddy Bottum isolation and lack of protagonism becomes a fact, musically may be the most impressive and ambitious FNM album of all time. Great production values, musically played down to perfection, diverse music styles, including heavy tunes(4,6,7,9), Rock tunes(1,2,12,13), Ballads (10,14) and other sounds (3,5,7,11).Other important fact is Mr Bungle's Trey Spruance guitar performance which gives the record a more precise, dinamic and rich personality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Faith no more's follow-up to angel dust","review":"This album is just fantastic. All though it may not be as good as \\"Angel Dust\\", it is an underrated album. This album has everything a FNM fan could want. There's heavy metal, soul, punk. Even a little of country and blues! Mike Patton's voice could not get any better, even when he's just screaming nonsense. And just because Jim Martin (the original guitarist) left FNM, does not affect how great this album is. The only problems I have, however, is the song \\"Star A.D.\\" and when I recieved this album, there was this strange dried-up substance on the back of the album. I don't know what it is, and I don't want to find out."},{"rating":"2","title":"not their masterpiece, but still very good","review":"this is faith no more's heaviest album. while it isn't as complex and geniously written and performed as angel dust, it makes a very solid metal album. still there is one big point of criticism: the softer songs. tracks like \\"just a man\\", \\"take this bottle\\" or \\"caralho voador\\" seem totally deplaced between heavy killer tracks like \\"get out\\", \\"ricochet\\", \\"the gentle art of making enemies\\", \\"ugly in the morning\\", \\"digging the grave\\" or \\"what a day\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Ahem: Mr. Bungle with Balls, diversified Rock/cool vocals","review":"Ignore reviews of this CD. If you like diverse hard/melodic music. This cd is it. It flows well from song to song and contains much more than Angel dust in terms of what Faith No More is, which I think is generally faithless to a genre of music? No band with a record contract has anything similar to this music experience. All the tracks have there own style and more than Faith No More fans sould enjoy this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good follow-up to ANGEL DUST, which is in my top 10 (a.d.)","review":"This is an album that takes two to three listenings to get into. After that, you love it. Too bad the guitarist (I believe his name is Jim) left--this album had more guitar. It is a strong album, with the exception of RICOCHET, which is a bit weak. Hearing this album brings back memories of a time, 1995, that was great in my life. That should tell you how cool this album is."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened?","review":"Can someone tell me what happened to Roddy Bottum's keyboards on this album? It sounds like Roddy left the band rather than Jim Martin. The strong keyboard lines were a key part of the earlier albums and without them they sound too much like other bands. Maybe his keyboard parts were mixed out in post-production, does anyone know?If you want the real Faith No More get 'The Real Thing' for their more commercial sound or 'Angel Dust' for their darker sound. The latter is their masterpiece."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage. Easily FNM's worst album.","review":"The fact that it sounds different from previous Faith No More albums is not the problem. The problem is it just plain old sucks. Half the songs are tongue-in-cheek slow songs similar to their cover version of Easy. The other half have some kick to them, but are marred by Mike Patton's cutesy Mr. Bungle-esque vocal ramblings. It's hard to believe this was the follow-up to the incredible Angel Dust. This album is Faith No More well past their peak, completely going through the motions. Luckily they rebounded with the much better Album of the Year."},{"rating":"1","title":"yech","review":"Their worst, by far. On a whim, I bought all of Faith No More's albums. For some reason, I listened to this one first. I considered taking the rest back before opening them. I'm glad I didn't, though. The other CDs are great, especially Angel Dust, the one released prior to this. Check those ones out first."},{"rating":"1","title":"From 1st play into the trashcan","review":"This is a very disappointing CD. I am a huge FNM fan, and this is just garbage. Some songs a just screaming, others are suited to a love movie, and others are just lame. There is not one good song on the whole album, and they have lost their energy and edge."},{"rating":"2","title":"PURE AGGRESSION","review":"This is Faith No Mores loudest angriest record. Patton spews his lyrics out and it also features Bungle axman Trey Spruance. Star AD should be on a Bungle record is so funky and Cuckoo For Caca is absolute Aggression and insanity. Arguably the best FNM song ever. What a day is vintage FNM funk and Gentle Art is pure Punk Metal. There r some jazzy ballads here to like the slick Evidence and the Guns N Roses sounding Take This Bottle. Ugly in The Morning is perhaps the craziest FNM song ever with Patton screaming like a caged animal. this record is a big statement cuz it is the 1st without Jim Martin. Very underrated by critics but true FNM fans love this record"},{"rating":"2","title":"incredible piece of music","review":"this is a phenominal album that is diverse and brilliant,faith no more shows on this album why they write better songs than everyone else,and why they are better musicians than most.from the soft tones of evidence to the meat grinder of ugly in the morning this disc is every thing you could ask for,to bad this ledgendary band only released one more album after this,I highly recommend this,"},{"rating":"2","title":"Plain simple language, just the facts","review":"This book is the BEST one you'll find that could be \\"Bubble Economy 101\\" or \\"Bear Markets for Dummies\\".If you've felt betrayed and blindsided by the stock market declines since 2000; if you have ever felt the least bit intimidated by the economists, the Wall Street pros, and the guests on financial TV and assumed they know more than you do; if you have been arguing with yourself over whether to sell your stocks; if you have been debating over whether to buy a house; if you have wondered if the yields on corporate or muni bonds are a good deal; if you've ever wondered how our economy has gotten itself into the fix it is in; if you've looked around and felt like we aren't \\"bouncing back\\" and wondered why; READ THIS BOOK!The book is practically worth it alone for the discussion of the government bond market, and why confidence MUST be maintained in it.The author has a \\"followup\\" website at www.crashprofits.net."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading title, but story interesting in the beginning","review":"The title of the book is probably the most misleading one I have come across for a while, as it has nothing to do with the books contents. The cover would have you think this is a book about how to make money and give you the strategies promised on the back cover. It isn't. It is a storyline about a CEO and some friends who get caught up in some financial tricks and end up blowing the whistle in a financial thinktank called CECAR. It is designed to be a lesson in macro and micro economics. The problem is that the story is interesting at the start, but drags on and on with the unplausible existence of the thinktank (as no-one would fund such a thing) that grows in size, profile and importance to the point where there is a meeting with the US President. Get the drift ? I read all but the last 40 or so pages.

I just pulled it out again to reread and was deeply moved by the author's conviction about the spiritual nature of life. Even if one has strong spiritual convictions, it is all too easy to compartmentalize work, family, friends, and spiritual life. Bolles reminded me of the \\"integrity\\" of integrated life and work.

The Parachute book has sold millions, so it is easy for the author to piggy back on that for any new book. For one thing, this book is filled with pictures. Almost 50% of the entire book is just that. So, if you want to throw money on something that is just visual and does not offer anything concrete, then go for it!!! I have become a bigger fan of another book titled \\"The Career Journey\\" by Ram Iyer. The tips offered in that book are so much more practical and no-nonsensical that I could relate very well to corporate life. For me, the realism is key. Read \\"The Career Journey\\" and compare it for yourself!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoughtful","review":"This was a thought provoking book.

Bolle tries to excuses himself for his Christian slant saying that it can be universally applied. However, by citing numerous passages from the Bible, he comes off as being \\"preachy\\" about doing this and that for God.

You'll be happier in the long run. These are acceptable for watching movies, actually pretty good, but for listening to music, they outright .... I am no audiophile, and I can't stand them. The sound is flat and weak. I don't know how there could be so much of a difference between movies and music, but there is. I don't recommend these speakers to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good sound, Great price","review":"Now that the HKTS 6's are out, you can get the 5's for just a fraction of the price even though they are the exact same speakers. They just have different speaker wire set-ups according to Harman Kardon. So factoring in any discount, these speakers are well worth the price. It comes with a great sub, which is the building block of any great sound system. Plus, the satallites are a great buy. However, like the other reviews have stated they are not nearly as crisp as some of the ones that you will hear (Bose, higher end Polk Audio, ect.). However, I did not find anything in this price range that was nearly as good as these speakers and I looked everywhere and listened to a ton of different speakers. So if you can't afford to spend [much more money]on speakers, treat yourself to these affordable and above average speakers. The price you pay is worth the sub alone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Without a doubt one of the most captivating & sensual books!","review":"Veronica Sattler successfully blends romance, intrigue, and danger into a storyline that will have you breathless and wanting more!

For those of you who dream of the strong silent worrior willing to go the distance for what he loves and believes in and for those of you who strive to be that special woman who is independent and self assured in her appearance and intellegents yet somehow vulnerable and self-conscience with her own sexuallity, this book is an absolute must.

With all due respect to the author, publisher, and fans, after reading a few chapters I found it to be one of most worthless books I have ever read; and I have read a lot of books. I was left to wonder, \\"How in the world did this book get such high ratings?\\" In my opinion it is full of spiritualist nonsense. In a nutshell it didn't ring true to me. It was also confusing and never seemed to get to the point. The author seemed to me to be pretty impressed with \\"hearing himself talk\\" and spouting off \\"deep thoughts\\" -- most of which made absolutely no sense to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing much to do with the band, but everything by music critics.","review":"Not much useful bnits of knowledge contained here except near the end when this very tiresome DVD FINALLY gets around to actually discussing the songs on the album. I didn't know half of them were from previous recording all the way back to Zeppelin III. Only 8 songs of this double recording were NEW songs. Also on a positive bit - you see the tuning and exactly how the riffs for several songs are played by one of the engineers that worked on the album. Special tunings used like DADGAD for Kashmir. Otherwise, this is VERY long and tireseome in my opinion and NOT worth the price of more than $20.00!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Minimal songs, multiple babbling.","review":"this show wandered around in the memory mines of led zeppelin and came up with lots of people who had lots to say which meant absolutely nothing to me, coming up with constant clunkers and no gems of insight.

I got highly irritated with it about 1/3 of the way through, and glided in with healthy cynicism and disgust that someone would try to pass this off as a lesser version of \\"the song remains the same\\".

Like the evening sun, Christendom is setting in the west, and in this dusk the church has a new opportunity to reclaim the marginal identity God granted it in the first place. If you are a big fan of the Christian Coalition, this book will trouble you. If you believe that church and state go neatly hand in hand, this book will trouble you. If you are searching for perspective on how the church--for the sake of \\"relevance\\"--may lose itself in the prevailing culture, this book will be a welcome addition to your library.Ten years after its publication, RESIDENT ALIENS remains a valuable conversation partner for the church. The task remains for church leaders to enflesh the practical ramifications of the work in Christian community. Ultimately, the success of Hauerwas' and Willimon's work will be judged by that end."},{"rating":"1","title":"No New Insight","review":"Severely disappointed. I had heard great things about this book. I really tried getting into it, but I just couldn't bring myself to finish it. I found it rather boring and it seemed as if the authors were rambling on to me. Even though I ascribe to many of the beliefs of the Anabaptist tradition, there didn't seem to be any new fresh insight gained from this book. Nor, did it seem there was anything new or different than what the Bible already speaks to in regards to living as aliens of this world. However, I am a fan of Hauerwas' progressive views and will likely read some of his other works sometime within the near future."},{"rating":"1","title":"resonating theme; poorly written","review":"This work is overrated. It does importantly remind Christians to stay on task as the Church. However, there are serious problems in its construction. Hauerwas has recited ideas, and Willimon has written them down. The scholarship behind the work is weak; the wording is often sweeping, generalized, and misrepresentative -- particularly in the condemnations of Paul Tillich and H. Richard Niebuhr. Niebuhr particularly spoke out against confusing our Christian commitment with nationalism, but Hauerwas & Willimon present him as someone who cannot distinguish the Gospel from the world. Take their assessment of other theologians with a serious grain of salt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Revived after 4 years on the shelf","review":"Upon my first read of the Diamond Cutter I was so inspired that I resolved to put into practice what I had learned, and the book stayed within arms reach ever after. But I fizzeled, and the closest I got to ever actually living the lessons was frequent self-talk to re-visit the book. Four years later I finially did, but this time with the discipline of a professional athlete. I feel my reality changing around me and I credit the Diamond Cutter for illuminating a simple yet demanding path. Yes, I would buy this book again and again and again as a way to spread the love. Indeed, I have."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't waste your time","review":"Another useless self-help book intended to enrich the author and fleece the reader. If in fact Mr. Roach spent all this rigorous time as a Buddhist monk and later in the diamond trade (how he managed to find a job in this closed-off business stretches the credulity), he learned whatever tenets he learned about business through doing, which is the way most of us learn. If you think you're going to learn anything through sitting and reading what it apparently took Roach years of apprenticeship to learn, I've got some oceanfront property in Arizona I'd like to sell you."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Real Thing","review":"I first have to say that I did not buy this so much for the business angle--I'm more just on the lookout for any new Buddhist material I can find. This is probably the freshest book in the realm of \\"American Buddhism\\" that I've read in the last year. I hadn't heard of Roach before, but I now feel that he truly is one of the most important Buddhist teachers in the U.S. today. (If you haven't already seen it you should look at the interview Amazon did with him.) The writing in Diamond Cutter isn't always so great, but Roach has a superior talent for explaining elements of Tibetan Buddhism in a way that is light years ahead of many other books out there in terms of accessibility. Perhaps that's because he is American born, so he really knows how to communicate with his contemporaries, but even beyond that he appears to have a great mind. This isn't great as a Buddhist primer, but if you are at all familiar with Buddhism you'll probably get some real insights out of this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Profound and easy to read","review":"The Diamond Cutter weaves his life story through the Tibetan Buddhist principles based on a book of the same name. The story is relevant to our businesses and lives today. The amazing bit is how the author integrates the Tibetan teachings into the business world and succeeds in financial and social terms. Furthermore, the author's ability to be creative based on his time away from work is monumental in bringing about positive change.With so many businesses being me oriented it is refreshing to see the Tibetan virtues of compassion and the good of all being implemented and succeeding. A great read on so many levels."},{"rating":"1","title":"if money is your goal then you are not a buddhist","review":"the heart of buddhism is to be at peace and love so why strive for the gain of little pieces of paper. i am not condemning you but please consider your motives and dreams...carry on my brothers"},{"rating":"1","title":"Blood Diamonds","review":"Sort of Buddha for dummies who want money type of book.

Wide variety of topics with differential diagnosis.3. Excellent MRI pictures and color illustrations.CON:1. You need a primary textbook to go with this such as Resnick's Bone and Joint Imaging if you want in depth explanations.

Although anyone can appreciate the exquisite writing of Pr Goldstein, this book is tailored for lawyer who are interested in Copyright and international trade issues.Starting with a brief history, the author asserts that international Copyright has brought the two existing systems of law (the Author's right and the Copyright) closer together. He then goes on with a detailed point-by-point analysis of the right and privileges granted by the numerous treaties. The second part of book is an analysis of the protection of foreign work in the US and the protection of US works abroad.This book is truly a reference for anyone having to deal with the Berne Convention, WIPO Copyright treaty and TRIPS agreement.

Then it revealed itself like the most beatiful ton of bricks. One may not think Detroit techno could posess such a quality. Plus so many musical ideas. Now I know where Theo parrish gets his reputation from. Tempo is the usual speed of contempory minimal. The sound is not dated. Can't say enough, and I like all of the minimal stuff from the last few years or more yet this, it has to be said is way more advanced than most of that stuff(this record is from 2000 I believe).

Almost all of today's Jews are adherents of a religion that would better be called \\"rabbinism.\\" Rabbinic Judaism is not the religion of the Old Testament Israelites, but is a man-made belief system based on the Talmud and other associated man-made rules.

If you don't know what a dispensationalist is, all you have to do is go to the prophecy section of Christian bookstores. For some reason inexplicable to me, dispensationalists like Hal Lindsay, Hagee, and Timothy LaHaye, Jenkins, Dave Hunt etc. have a virtual monopoly of the prophecy book shelves. They disseminate some false teachings which are unorthodox and not in accordance with traditional Christian teaching regarding the Church.

It is full of psuedo-knowlege of Judaism (and, for that matter, of Christianity). Contrary to some previous reviews, it is not \\"courageous\\", but simply, well, odd. It takes no courage to make outlandish charges against the Jewish people or religion, His obvious hatred for both is neither a crime nor unusual.

So when my 5-year-old was the target of some mean-spirited verbal taunting, I decided to find out what WOULD work. The theory behind this book is excellent. Lots of good information. It was also very well-written, and easy to read. But what I didn't find, was a lot of solid, easy-to-follow exercises. It talks about role-playing ethical situations, but doesn't provide scenarios. The more concrete ideas that it does have are much more suited to older kids. So, I definitely recommend this book as a starting point, perhaps even THE starting point if you've got a bullying situation on your hands (either your child is being bullied, or is bullying, or is a bystander).

Chapter Five is excellent in revealing three types of families and how it relates to bullying.She is particularly bold in describing sexual bullying and it'srelationship to sexual harassment.

Bad move -- one false move and the thing skips, pops, moves to the next song then back again -- pauses for 45 seconds while it figures out what it should do next. Pretty much everything except play music. It is rare to get through a whole song without having to check its pulse. I even bought an expensive pack to put it i while I walk thinking that it needed to be more stable.It skips in the car while hooked up to the car adaptor. It skips while I'm sitting dead still. I thought my CD's were ALL dirty, but in fact it skips with BRAND NEW CD's.I would not recommend this at all.The only pro: Excellent headphones -- and when it *is* actually playing music, the sound quality is good.By a Sony -- they work.

Problems I've found are numerous. Most in-dash car cd players resume playing actually where they left off when the car's ignition has been shut off and restarted. This unit automatically starts playing track 1 when powered on. With 11 or so hours of music crammed on the CD, I ownly end up hearing the first tracks.The volume controls are awkwardly positioned on the side, when all the other buttons are on the top.

I use Windows XP to burn MP3 onto the CD-RW disc and MPD8507CP refused to recognize the disc about 90% of the time. It kept reporting Disc Error and when it finely worked it skipped like crazy even though the unit was laying flat on the table. It plays regular CD 100% fine but I didn't buy this to play regular CDs. I am very disappointed with this MP3 player. I wish I could return this thing, I threw away the packaging. By the way, the packaging required you to have utility knife or scissors to rip open the package. Everything about this product is terrible.

He is giving people advice that will set them up for future health problems.

The chapters on the elephants are toward the end (chapters 18-22), and are fascinating: it would be hard for them not to be, the social life of elephants is so interesting. For those of you who are not going to read this book, or parts of it, the two main researchers into elephant behavior are apparently Cynthia Moss and Joyce Poole, and Katy Payne has a book on elephant communication.

Installation was easy, and it is a snap to load and unload the bikes.

You can put it down to open your trunk, etc, however for a Jeep, there isn't enough clearance for the stock-sized spare tire because the rear door swings out. Consider this if you have a vehicle with a similar design.Looking at the base, I can see how they could easily modify the design to let it go lower, however, as it is, you need to abandon the use of your cargo area.

The headset is bulky and doesn't fit my ear well, and the volume is barely loud enough to hear over the car on the highway with windows closed. Connection is mysteriously and frequently dropped, even though the headset isn't far enough away to technically lose the connection. Finally, the buttons are tiny, forcing you to fiddle with the headset to find the answer/dial button. It does mostly work and it is cheap, but that is about all I can say for it.

Just another day for Kate who has to fit this in-between getting her teen daughter to cheerleading practice, getting her 2 year old to daycare, and having dinner on the table by 6. But the twists to this book are what keep the story moving - the notes and quirks that bring back her memories of Eric, her first husband that was killed five years ago, her daughters teacher - who has a few secrets of his own, and Cool - the surfing phenom that has a sudden interest in San Diablo.

Please--these jokes aren't funny, and haven't been for a while. At that point, I just looked at the Kate Connor and every word and thought that came out of her... I just couldn't level with her.

My biggest complaint is that they break so, so easily. We have this set and a few other sets and at least 50% of the dolls have lost their heads. Some have lost legs and arms as well. The dresses have held up better than the dolls, but several of the dress have torn and needed to be thrown away. We've had them for several months and although my girls love them I will not replace the broken dolls. I just can't spend money on toys that I know will break easily with normal play."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun but poor construction","review":"This looks like such a cute toy. How much fun to be able to play with the princesses everyone knows. But after only 2 days of play Ariel's hair came off and two of the other dolls heads came off. The heads do not pop back on. So, that means that we're down to only 2 dolls in the set, of which one dolls hair keeps coming off. My daughter is only 3.5, so the construction of these is clearly poor for this to happen. I recommend buying Barbie dolls - they hold up better than the disney version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dolls heads come off","review":"My five and four year old girls received this as a christmas present.

This was terrible. Now a lot of it is because I'm an adult, and this one was aimed at children. However, the original Muppet Show was a mix of stuff aimed at the family and some adult humor as well.

Oh, Return of Jafar, what havoc you've wrought! Like every single one of Disney's \\"milk the cash cow til it drops dead\\" releases, Kermit's Swamp Years is low on original ideas (let's recycle every previous plot into one huge unimpressive \\"new\\" plot!), low on production value, and low on humor (at least relative to the original Muppet stuff). Seeing a young Statler and Waldorf is nice, and some of the \\"outtakes\\" are kind of funny, but even those feel so calculated. Finally, what's with all of the talk of killing and knife-fights? Since when was it cool for that kind of stuff to be so overt with the Muppets? Sure, I'm a diehard soldier of the nostalgia wars when it comes to Henson, but surely many people must agree that Jim would've never allowed a story like this to see the light of day.

Near the end of the movie one of Kermit's frog pals is strapped down on a table for disection and has a near rabid Biology teacher holding a razor sharp scalpel to it's throat while it squirms in horror. I all but yanked the power cord on the TV to prevent my son from seeing anything further. I am very glad we monitor what our son watches.

Sadly, this film is downright awful. It is filled with toilet humor (one of Kermit's friends shows his rear to the camera in a scene) and it also has a very boring plot.

The 16 mo. old was bored after only a few minutes and the 30 mo. old was frightened. She is very empathetic, so she was quite upset to see the bull frog beating up the smaller toads. Plus, I'm trying to teach her not to hit and this video has puppets fighting!? She was so upset about the bull frog, we never even made it to the disection scene.My parents are also upset that their gift was frightening. They thought it was \\"The Muppet Movie\\".

Try Johnannes Linstead, Luis Villegas, Oscar Lopez, Jesse Cook. Also, the reviewer is correct in their opinion of the Real Player audio.

It is certainly one of Taj Mahals' best.Because of the direct to disc recording process,this is a limited edition of Taj Mahals work and will most likely become as the notes in theCD says a collector's item. So if you are a fan of the man and his music there is no doubt that this album is a must to include with your other Taj Mahal discs. The music itself is a fasinating blend of Disco, Pop, Rock and World beat to it. Take A Giant Step is the best number on here. The other eight songs come in a very close second. The only problem with this album is the fact it is only 40 minutes long. 40 minutes is not long enough to enjoy the craftmenship of Taj Mahal. On the other hand it will be 40 minutes of pure enjoyment for the listener who has the opportunity to hear this disc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple lovely!","review":"This album by Taj is simple great, timeless, full of lovely and relaxed music.

Even after finalizing the dvd's to be played on other players, I get a disc fail message. Again it happened today: I taped something that I thought was recording, since I was able to pause and record, and when I decided to watch it before finalizing it, the dvd would not play. I opened and reinserted the dvd and it was reading it as a blank dvd. This has happened a few times.

I tried the movies in four different dvd players, and found the only one that would recognize the movie was the computer the movie was copied from. And then it only picked up the video, no audio. After some cursing, I made a trip to a local shop and purchased a 30 pack from a well-known brand. It cost me a little more, but considering the Playo discs are ending up in the trash, it was more than worth it. My advice - avoid these discs like the plaque."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is an excellent table.","review":"I have never reviewed a product before on Amazon, but this table deserves attention. Before I bought this table, I did quite a bit of research. It also had to be stored our garage.

This seemed like the best buy, but I read the other reviews and someone wrote that set up is not easy. Ok, so I knew that and had my husband and a friend put it together on a Sunday afternoon. It really did take about 4 hours total and an electric screw driver is a must. But, I would say it is a wonderful table, it just takes some time to put it together and it takes two people to do it. And fits well into our garage when stored.

All it did was reinforce what i do not know."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow and dated.","review":"Admittedly, I bought this book with one focus: learning about DSL -- but then the second topic (after ATM) listed on the book was DSL. DSL makes for 6 pages total in this book and the book says the modems will cost suppliers $1500 and therefore is skeptical about DSL. Therefore, I guess, the book doesn't even really bother to explain DSL, instead focusing more pages on ISDN. I just feel a book that claims on its cover that it \\"Covers all the hot technologies: Internet, wireless, ATM, DSL...\\" should do so. I didn't bother reading other sections since the DSL coverage was limited and inaccurate/dated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Baaad to the Binding","review":"This book may seem like a great intro book to those well-versed in Telecommunications. However, the book does a terrible job of explaining terms and jargon. A word, for example, will be used for several pages before being defined. There are very few practical examples and metaphors to illustrate concepts and add interest to the book. There are no photographs here either, only basic illustrations which do not clarify concepts, but instead require explaination.All of my classmates are disgusted that we are required to use this text.

It is perhaps the most inaccurate book on technology available. Throughout the book there is mistruth and a glowing misconception of how technology works, particularly related to data network concepts. For example, Annabel claims the following four capabilites of network routers:1) Sequencing2) Path Optimization3) Flow Control4) Receipt AcknowledgementLets see... 1) wrong, 2) sorta, 3) wrong and 4) wrong. This is just one of many examples throughout the book where the fundamentals are completely trampled on.Rather than buy this book, send the money directly to the author and ask her to read a few good books about the topics she tries to cover rather than contributing a truly awful book in this category."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT a good guide to telecom","review":"I would not recommend this book to either to a beginner or to someone trying to learn more about the subject. Unfortunately the books has several major problems: 1. It does not explain fundamentals that a beginner would need to understand. 2. When it does try to go a little deeper into a subject, the explanations are so \\"lite\\" they provide very little understanding. 3. There are many errors."},{"rating":"1","title":"ok....I admit....I only glanced at this book in the store...","review":"I thought at first it looked like it might be a great overview for me. BUT then I was flipping through it and came to this explanation of a byte (a paraphrase since the book is not in front of me):A byte is a character and has seven or eight bits.Now, in my little world, if a byte could be either 7 or 8 bits, computers would have an awfully tough time interpreting them. And to say that a byte is a character? Oy. I agree with the review below mine based on that one paragraph in her book. If someone cannot even manage to explain correctly what a byte is, they have no business writing telecom books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Overview for consultant with no Telecom background","review":"I'm an IT consultant with a good understanding and background in network design, and needed to get a quick grounding in telecom for a project. After spending a day in the bookstore,( and actually buying and returning another title), I found this book and took it home. It was the perfect overview of the subject for me! I got a good understanding of the terminology and foundation concepts, and often go back to certain sections to reinforce my understanding.I gave it four stars rather than five because ot does have some flaws. As noted in some other reviews, the author glosses over key data communications topics like routing, bridging, VoIP. For those readers who need depth in these topics, there are better sources (Try titles by Radia Perlman or Uyless Black, for example).For readers who need a strong fundamental understanding of telecom technologies, regulations, and implementations, this is the best general primer out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Overview, but technicallY WRONG!","review":"I was able to read this book from end-to-end, but it was annoying. The author provides lots of interesting data and mentions most new telecommunications products. HOWEVER, whenever she attempts any kind of technical explanation or conclusion she tends to be WRONG. If all the technical explanations and conclusions were removed, this would be a better book. As it is, I rate it one-star because I kept getting angry at the WRONGNESS of the technical explanations and conclusions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good scope but miserable organization","review":"I bought this book because it appeared to be one of the few books aimed at non-technical readers that covered major telecoms concepts. While the scope is not disappointing, this book is so poorly organized that I simply stopped reading it. The book's disorganization and repetitiveness exist at several levels: across chapters, within chapters, and even within paragraphs.On numerous occassions, the author uses a term or concept in a way that assumes a thorough understanding (prompting the reader to ask himself \\"has this already been introduced?\\"), then drops it, then explains it later on. In addition, some concepts are explained multiple times, with no real difference in the various explanations. Finally, often the sentences are so clumsily put together that the style simply prevents the reader from concentrating on the content.A big disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"the information is not derived from the author's expertise","review":"I wanted a book that would explain the basic concepts and show the progressive changes from the telephone to the present hardware,software and its influence .In nearly every sphere this book fell short.After much searching and a bit of luck, i did find :ANATOMY OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS by Tom Smith and ABC TeleTraing ,Inc.

That is exactly what I received. This bookcovered the important topics in telecom from transport to signaling to regulatory. I interned for an RBOC last summer and wish someone handed me this book then. It constantly incorporates topics and ideas from past chapters into the current chapter. Reinforcement is a great way to learn. Suffice it to say that my telecom internship this summer will be more informed because of this book. This book isn't an engineering manual for connecting ports on your DMS-100, but if you're in any way involved with telecom where you work, you'll appreciate this gentle, but thorough introduction to telecom.

I thought the coverage on MSMQ could have been stronger and the project at the end did not get tied together as well as it should have. I like the approach of a lot of the Wrox books that really get into detail WHY they're doing something in their projects they use to tie their ideas together. I felt as thought the author really almost rushed this section of the book, and, in doing so, missed the opportunity to really drive home his points. Hopefully he reads these and will take a page out of the Wrox books in really getting down to explaining his reasoning and what is going on when he's tying his ideas together with a project in his next book.

You can also program the DVD from the main menu to play selected cuts in the order you prefer.It was nice seeing some old favorites as well as many videos that were new to me. 'Lovetown' is great and has been sticking in my mind for days.The extras are good too... a live version of 'Games Without Frontiers', the vintage 'Modern Love' (which I had not seen before) and some trailers from PG's other DVDs.All in all a great collection of timeless audio-visual art.

And in some, like \\"Blood of Eden\\" the music used is not the same version that I remember listening to on his CDs. Some songs let me down and some videos fell short of what I would expect. I liked the touch up on \\"Shock the Monkey\\" video, however.The special features were nice. I liked being able to get a bit of background on each video if I wanted it.Over all, since I love his music, I think it's a great buy and will keep this DVD on hand.

Frontman \\"O\\" was a good friend of both Kurt Cobain and Bradley Nowell (Sublime) and you can hear both of their influences in Fluf's music (think Kurt's catchy arrangements mixed with Brad's killer riffs. The song \\"Pipe Bomb\\" even makes a reference to Brad!) For newcomers this disc is a great place to start.

The hole \\"spiritual\\" and \\"divine\\" part of the novel takes way too much weight of the story and its pretty much seems to be a solution for anything and everything. The only people who would be pleased about this book are Orientalist Westerners who fantasise about the \\"Spiritual India\\".

There is no comparison. That being said, this band does have some potential. In my humble opinion, though, all the songs on this album sound pretty much the same. And the sound is somewhat disjointed. There are enough good things about the album to warrant a look at, but my suggestion would be to listen to at least two or three songs before purchasing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass","review":"I bought this album because Deadlock's \\"Wolves\\" CD piqued my interest in what other female-fronted melodic metal bands had to offer.This one was a disappointment.The singer is completely out of sync with the rest of the band as she seems to stay in the same 3 minor keys no matter what the rest of them are playing. The musicianship is sub-par to say the least and by the end of the album, I could only reach the conclusion that the record companies are in too much of a hurry to sign any band who sounds like Lacuna Coil.Pass on this one and get \\"Wolves\\" instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good at all..","review":"First and foremost, I have NO idea how anyone could compare this.. with Leaves Eyes. They are absolutely NOTHING alike at all.Second, although the vocalist is goo, the music is not nearly good enough to compare with bands like Within Temptation, Lacuna Coil, Leaves Eyes etc..Third, the music would have been okay, but the singer and the band aren't together AT ALL.. they're way out of sync. Its like she's singing a whole different track while the band is playing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome CD...Buy it!","review":"Combine the massive drumming of Fear Factory, the excellent dual-guitar work of Iron Maiden, and the best vocals this side of Within Temptation, Lacuna Coil, and Leaves Eyes (ex-Theater of Tragedy), and you have just a hint of how phenomenal this band really is. What you can't imagine, unless you listen, is how their sound is so totally captivating. This combination of aggressive music and ethereal vocals, transcends Evanescence (Amy Lee is a great singer), and most other music in this genre of female lead goth/symphonic metal. It really is a spectacular debut album; I cannot stop listening...it sucks you in, and just won't let go."},{"rating":"2","title":"A more melodic, more mellow Smashing Pumpkins","review":"With Billy Corgan's mother's death comes this album.

I don't know why, but it just seems that corgan doesn't sing with the same passion that he did on his previous records. the lyrics seem uninspired as well, most of which just fell neatly into the cliched catagory of \\"love song.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"The Great Pumpkin Quietly Arrived","review":"I am so tired of supposedly faithful Pumpkinheads who so easily act ashamed of this album. Billy Corgan is a lyrical and musical genius, and with that genius comes sonic and poetic evolution. Oh no...change! No heavy layered guitars, no delinquent rat-in-cage primal screamings. The people who couldn't grow to love this album, are of the grunge variety. They probably like Pearl Jam more, and think Nirvana is the greatest band ever. Woo-hoo. Siamese Dream was ushered in with this crowd, unfortunately. Adore is a prime example of just how beautiful songwriting can be. Cobain's acid literation can't hold a candle to music so eloquently transcribed from the heart. This album is a companion to the humble, misunderstood soul in all of us. If you want blaring power chords go elsewhere, but if you are willing to open your heart to an album of youthful innocence and frail humanity, you will find a friend within."},{"rating":"2","title":"Underappreciated and I'm Not Sure Why","review":"I never have understood why many critics and fans act as though this release was a failure and not up to their other material. When I first heard the album I was a bit disappointed, but this feeling left me quickly. \\"Ava Adore,\\" \\"Perfect,\\" \\"Tear,\\" \\"Daphne Descends,\\" The Tale of Dusty and Pistol Pete\\" are just some of the highlights here. It's true that this album lacks loud guitars and angst-filled lyrics, but it was not really a time in the band's career when those things seemed appropriate. All the talk of this being a techno or electronica album is also a mystery to me. The band seemed to just want to take a new direction with their music for a while, and not become the next Moby or Chemical Brothers. I enjoy \\"Adore\\" still today along with \\"Machina,\\" \\"Mellon Collie...,\\" etc., and I hope the Pumpkins experiment with new sounds like they did here again in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"A change for the worse","review":"It is hard to believe this is the same great band that put out Gish, Siamese Dream, and Pisces Iscariot. I am all for growing as an artist, but the album as a whole is just routine and spiritless. Radiohead has shown the world what good change is all about. The only song that lives up to what the pumpkins were is the first one, To Sheila, so just download that one from amazon. This truly was the beginning of the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"I sold my copy more than 5 years ago","review":"It deserves only 2 stars from me because out of 16 tracks, it only has 4 wonderful songs on it, To Sheila, Once Upon a Time, Apples + Oranjes, and Behold! The Night Mare. Everything else sounds like uninspiring and lifeless folk music, with a few that are at least somewhat decent. The music portrays a dark emotion and lacks catchiness, unlike previous Pumpkins albums. This is the album that most likely made me lose interest in them, and I stopped following their music in later years. I've only heard a few from Siamese Dream and I have Mellon Collie, and I can tell you immediately those are must have records, if you chose to be a fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"A new Plateau for the Pumpkins","review":"Well, for all you fans that think you know what the Smashing Pumpkins style sounds like, think again. The Pumpkins have decided to go in a whole new direction in this album, and to be honest, I think it was a very good move for them. It is a very experimental album and it flows very well. I personally think it is some of their best works. I admit I miss the grinding guitars and screeching voice of Billy Corgan, but if this is just a small taste of the wonderful music capabilities of The Smashing Pumpkins, then we are in for a treat. Here is to many more Pumpkins albums!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not normal Pumpkins material, but definitely a great CD.","review":"This CD is different from all the other Smashing Pumpkins' CD's in the sense that it's lighter, softer, and less stressful. It seems that the songs contain much less anger than their last album, Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness. I also noticed that Billy Corgan seems to be trying a different technique with the vocal harmonies. It's a little twisted, but I think it's a good CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"This album puts me to sleep. Big disappointment!","review":"Smashing Pumpkins is one of my favorite bands. I have all of their CDs since Gish and love every one of them. I was REALLY looking forward to this CD, especially when I first heard Ava Adore.

Billy, give us back the guitars and screaming vocals!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute Trash","review":"Don't even waste your money on this garbage, if I wanted to hear a lullaby I'd listen to Mother Goose.

I don't know why people would like this one, but if you're into music without drums or guitars, and instead with a lot of angsty introspective whining... still, don't buy it. Can't recommend this under any circumstances."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it","review":"The second song is the only good one.

So, I suspect he had an influence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shatters the Air","review":"This album is more of a work of art than any other album i've heard(and i own a lot) so far.

As a long time Smashing Pumbkins fan, I am very disappointed at Corgan's latest effort. He knows that change is necessary to last in the music business, but the change has to be good. But, as a die hard fan, I have hope that Corgan see's the err of his ways, and goes back to what he and his band mates do best. Rock."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flashes of genius but....","review":"It needs a good edit. After hearing MCATIS I was given to agree that Billy Corgan was God, but now perhaps he is a mere mortal.

Still gets a lot of play at my place, but it takes listening and isn't really a party rocking piece...."},{"rating":"1","title":"It had so much potential!","review":"I love the Smashing Pumpkins. What makes them such a great band is that from the beginning they have always had an incredible mix of hard-rocking songs and slow, beautiful songs. For some reason, the band got lazy and made this CD. The beautiful songs are still there, but without the perfect mix of those songs and the great loud ones that you can really rock to, this album becomes a cure for insomniacs. If you must have all Smashing Pumpkins albums or never liked the louder songs anyway, you should like this CD. Otherwise, it's really not worth the money, and you'll find yourself listening to the older albums still and hoping that they get back to their roots.

The Pumkins were once a great band, but sadly they are no more. Corgan whines about his problems as if we're supposed to care. His hopeless attempt to latch on to electronic music is pathetic. If he wants us to believe that he is delivering something new and different, then he should do something new and different. Instead this is a tired attempt to latch onto the latest craze, electronic music.

I listened to it and thought that it was an alright album. But it usually made me depressed when I listened to it. Although there are some good songs on Adore. Its really a dark album and depressing. Also its all a bunch of electronic music. Not at all like the other SP albums. If you want a real SP album get Sameise dream or MCIS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Go buy Mechanical Animals instead","review":"This album was really dissapointing as there were only 2, maybe 3, good songs. The rest of the album is so wussy I can't believe it's SP. There isn't a single heavy riff... SP has died."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adore-Smashing Pumpkins","review":"The Pumpkins' much underrated release is indeed a departure from previous albums, but its not necesarily a step in the wrong direction. Adore is a beeping electronic pulse, filled with tales of true love, lost love, and everything in between. While it doesn't effect you the way Gish or Siamese Dream does, it succeeds in creating a luscious atmosphere filled with otherworldy sonics. The lead \\"Ava Adore\\" beeps with its obsession and is easily accessible as \\"Today\\" or \\"1979\\". While its not as strong as the previous ones, the pumpkins manage to loop, plop, and scratch their way into your heart. \\"Perfect\\" is a little dull, and it sounds too sure of itself, but other than that, Adore is worth purchasing..I cant really say the same for Machina."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unpredicted then, and underrated still","review":"Most Smashing Pumpkins look down on this synth-ful album in late '90s. At that time, when I first heard this, it was very astonishing because of its difference from their privious albums. However, I did think that this was an improvement from rather pretentious \\"Melan Collie\\". If you're a die-hard metal fan, this even danceable music would not fit in your ears. However, the music itself is, when evaluated by general view, very rich and of high quality. I would give Siamese Dream a 4 and a half stars, and this a 4 stars, rather 3 stars to Melan Collie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring.","review":"Maybe I'm just in love with the older style Smashing Pumpkins, but this wasn't really appealing to me. I know bands change styles and I'm not giving them crap for changing. Many groups change over the years and sometimes for the better. I just don't care for this more electronically and atmospherically oriented sound. It's not so much bad as it is just boring and repetitive. There were some highlights though in 'Tear' and 'Shame'. If you liked 'Tonight, Tonight', you'll love 'Tear'. The same type of melancholy orchestral atmosphere. And I don't really know what to say about 'Shame', it's just one of those songs that I've just loved from the second I heard it.

Overlooked only because it had a completely different sound then SP's previous work. Isn't that what an album is supposed to be? something new and different from previous ones? Yes. Adore has a much more mature sound. some songs sound a little more techno-ish, most songs use a drum machine. All of the songs are either love songs or about Billy's mother's death. There is also use of many pianos, keyboards and interesting sounding beats. There are very upbeat and fun songs like \\"Ava Adore\\" and \\"Appels + Oranjes\\", there are just songs that give you a warm feeling such as my two favorites on the album, \\"The Tale of Dusty and Pistol Pete\\" and \\"Perfect\\", and haunting, epic piano playing like \\"For Martha\\", \\"Blank Page\\" and \\"Crestfallen\\". The Pumpkins make sure this is a full album with 15 songs, (one short filler) and it adds up to over 70 minutes. Pick it up now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmmm...not what i personally expected","review":"Well, this album was a total dissapointment to me. What happened to all their hard rock songs? I dunno, i guess i like it better when a band stays consistent with their sound, it bothers me when they totally revamp their sound. It never usually works for me when bands do this. Their songs really bore the hell outta me. If you like their old, original grunge sound stick with Mellon Collie and Siamese Dream, that's what im doin'..."},{"rating":"1","title":"kinda crappy","review":"I'm sorry, but I once was a hard-core SP fan... untill this album came out. I still LOVE everything they have done untill now, but they have turned into something too much like easy-listening, and right now rank about as high as Celine Dion. They were better as a rock band. Sorry, but I just didn't like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stripped down and excellent!","review":"I don't wanna type much here, but as much as thoughtless criticism goes toward this album by some of you, the Pumpkins managed to put out one masterpiece of a record! It wasn't a huge-*** production like Mellon Collie was, but were many of you expecting something even bigger than that 2-disc album? I kinda think the same way for U2... you think their next world tour is gonna top PopMart? Naw... what the Smashing Pumpkins did was strip down and blend in the cool sounds of electronics and strings. I personally think \\"Appels + Oranjes\\" and \\"Pug\\" are two of the best songs I've heard from them yet. \\"1979\\" was the little sneak-preview to what their next album after Mellon Collie was gonna sound like. Guess they did it, and I call it the best album of 1998! Yay!"},{"rating":"2","title":"SP are perfection in the making","review":"The smashing pumpkins blow me away with every album they put out. Until now, most of their albums have had more an electric sound, but the albums contained a few quieter songs. This new album just happens to be reverse. There are more quiet songs, but still a few eletric hard core songs. To me, the soft songs are the most intense, meaningful, buzz worthy songs. The first song, To Sheila was a complete suprise that hit me very hard, but it was a great introduction to the finest Smashing Pumpkins album ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little disapointing","review":"This album is great, although it was a disapointment. I was expecting it to be a bit heavier. There are some great songs on here, like Ava Adore, Tear, ect. The loast half of the album is extremely long to listen to and seems repetitive. The lyrics however, are good.

You'd think he was a sixteen year old highschool sophmore.What a disappointment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated Darkness","review":"I'm with Music Maestro, this album is a depressing exploration of darkness and self-serving discourse. \\"Bummed Out\\" Billy Corgan really needs to put his self-pity aside and get on with his life. The narcissistic lyrics and uninspiring melodies leave the listener with a great sense of emptiness. \\"Shame\\" and \\"Crestfallen\\" represent the lackluster style that pervades this album. Unless you're interested in an apathetic tour of self-absorded contemplation, save your money and avoid this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"this album is truly a work of art. go get it now!!","review":"Once again, Billy Corgan dazzles us with this album, the Smashing Pumpkins' newest offering. Billy, James, and D'Arcy have charted new musical territory with these songs that send me into such euphoric waves, i cannot possibly describe what it means to me. this arcane blend of personal, cutting lyrics with heavy synth-pop, guitar,bass and drums is truly one of the most amazing, refreshing sounds in this past decade. it is a nice break from all these wannabe alterna-rock-grunge kids that are topping the charts. Long live the Pumpkins, one of the few good rock bands out there, perhaps the only one...."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Lot of Hype for Nothing","review":"I really expected more from the Pumpkins. This album was very disappointing, but it has to be hard to follow their huge Mellon Collie double CD. Overall, the sound is semi-dull and it just didn't grab me the way Siamese Dream, Mellon Collie, and Pisces Iscariot did. I hope for better things from the Pumpkins in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"good, but don't compare to Mellon Collie...","review":"Needless to say, Adore was different. It was ballad-ish...The Pumpkins are great with rock and ballads alike, but I like to see a mixture of the two. If you are a TRUE Pumpkins fan you will enjoy this CD for what it is, as I did. If you just like the stuff like Bullet, X.Y.U., and Tales of a Scorched Earth you will probably be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"too electronic or not, it's a great album","review":"I am really not into this wave of synthisized, drum machined music but this album is beautifully constructed. \\"To Sheila\\" is beautiful. The simple arrpegios layered and overlapping fit perfectly with Corgans whisper-whine. This is the Pumpkin's best album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Hi i think adore is an excelent cd. billy corgan was asome. he could of done better on the guitar. i dont think they should of put 17 on it. but ithink it was nice that they wrote for marth to marth corgan. also how he dedicated simease dream to his grama. they could'nt do the cd whith out the asome work of james iha. d,arcy also revealed the most of her body on this cd. this there most low key cd het. I would give the cd a A+. I think billy corgan is going to be like Kurt cobane. they all worked really hard one this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"OK Adore","review":"I'm not a big pumkins fan. To be truthful, I usually change the station when one of their songs is playing. I bought this album more on a whim than anything else and it's really quite good. It's more in the vein of a Radiohead album than anything else. In fact, I think the drum beat for one of the songs may have been directly taken from Climbing up the Walls. It's really very good though."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of my best CDs","review":"unlike another reviewer i don't agree at all about all the songs sounding the same; this is the only CD where i haven't had any problems knowing which song is which. they all have their own character. i personally love the melancholic sound. if one wants to listen to more rock n' roll, i suggest one buys gish. thats why this record is as suitable for a pumpkins-fan as for a new listener."},{"rating":"2","title":"dude, come on give corgan credit","review":"Adore is a friggin masterpiece and anyone who throws it aside and calls it sh-t doesnt know anything about talent. in this album you really feel corgan's vocals and all the dung he went through before recording the album, i mean come on....dont listen to these numbnutted ignorant people. buy this album, you wont be disappointed....its a work of art. Annie-dog is a personal fav. along with blank page. Dont dl this album you cheapys"},{"rating":"1","title":"The beginning of the end....","review":"..of the Pumpkins. It's ok, and a must for any Pumpkins die-hard, but for those looking for the great Smashing Pumpkins, I suggest Gish, Siamese Dream and Pices Escariot.(Mellon Collie as well,there are GREAT tunes to be heard, but I think that collection's a bit bloated.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"What's not to like?","review":"I think it is incredibly unfair the way that critics (and hardcore fans) compare this album to the rest of their previous endeavours. So it doesn't have a \\"Zero\\" or \\"Bullet with Butterfly Wings\\"? Who cares? Billy Corgan isn't necessarily concerned with over-the-top guitar riffs or extensive drum solos. The reason I became a fan of him and his music was his lyrics; nobody is as honest or blunt about emotions as he is. Adore is a beautiful album. It's perfect for when you're fighting with your best friend and you need to sort out your emotions; it's great on summer evenings with thunderstorms crashing outside. If you're pissed off, THEN you slip in Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness. If you're just looking for a little quiet time, listen to \\"For Martha\\", one of the most beautiful and poignant songs I've ever heard. Rock isn't dead on this album, it's merely taking a vacation."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?!?","review":"Not even a quarter of this album is decent. The lyrics are sappy and poor, as is the music. The only songs that stick out are \\"The Tale of Dusty and Pistol Pete\\" and \\"To Shiela\\" - but especially \\"Appels + Oranjes.\\" Other than that, this album sucks and is close to utter trash.AVOID."},{"rating":"2","title":"J'adore Adore","review":"A poor man's version of Nirvana?! I think not. Adore is beautifully orchestrated and one of the finer albums I've ever heard. Those who can not find the beauty in Adore are those who are blind to art. The way that Billy uses his voice on Annie Dog is wonderful-a tinge of blues. To anyone with an open mind and a clear heart: If you appreciate music in any form, Adore is worth buying. It is true poetry put to music. Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"IT'S THE BEST CD I'VE EVER HAD!!!!!BILLY I LOVE YOU!!!!","review":"I think that Adore is the best cd ever made by the Smashing Pumpkins!It's great because it doesn't include only rock,but other beautiful melodies that can't be found in any other cd. Billy Corgan IS the ROCK GOD!!!!! I THINK HE'S THE GREATEST AND I REALLY LOVE HIM!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The pumpkins do it again!","review":"The Smashing Pumpkins have done it again. It would seem that as awful as the hard times the Smashing Pumpkins had were (the lose of their keyboardist J Melvon and Drummer Jimmy Chaimberlan) it has just put more wonderful artistic views into their work. Many people thought that they had seen the last of the band after the huge success of Mellon Collie and the Infintie Saddness but they were wrong. The pumpkins have proved themselves once again. This is the CD for all people. The music has basicly the same theme, but the sound of the songs changes on almost every one. I hope people will really take the time to listen to this album and apriciate Billy Corgan for the creative genious that he is. kg"},{"rating":"2","title":"Forget the critics..This CD is special and unique.","review":"I believe that Adore is the most underated CD of the year. I am sort of biased, but I know good music when I hear it. Mellow songs like Perfect, Crestfallen and Sheila have a electronic accompaniment which makes them soothing and unique. Annie dog is also a fun, catchy song. Last but not least the first release from Adore, Ava Adore. This song mixes the Pumpkins of the early years with the techno and electronic sounds of the 90's. Great music from a great band."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Album by SP standards...","review":"I have all of SP albums and they all rock! After 5 months of listening to Adore I still do not like it. I can't believe Billy released something like this. The music is slow boring and repetitive."},{"rating":"2","title":"a whole new level.","review":"[1] mellon collie and the infinite sadness: meet billy corgan, the angry, sneering, burn-the-world anti-hero. [2] adore: meet billy corgan, the romantic, passive-but-not-overlooked obsessed poet dude. ha. i love it. very original, very unique."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD grew on me like few others","review":"When I first heard the CD I was puzzled. I'd just heard \\"Ava Adore\\" and thought it was going to be more rockin' uptempo Pumpkins. I was surprised by the brooding...the mellowness didn't, they've had mellow songs on every CD since Siamese Dream (\\"Disarm,\\" for example). So I put it away and gradually started listing to it...and listening, and listening, and listening. The CD gets quieter, yet more intense, as it goes along; like a person with a very soft voice, you find yourself listening harder to catch what they're saying. Every song is a take on phases of relationships, culminating in \\"For Martha,\\" which I take to be a song to a dead or dying lover. It keeps morphing into something else, getting better and better, and finally ending on some \\"Frippertronics\\" type guitar loops. WOW. This is a truly great CD, although for sure one that needs some serious listening to appreciate. It's worth the effort, and can't WAIT for the next release! GO PUMPKINS."},{"rating":"2","title":"OVERLOOKED ALBUM","review":"The problem is Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness was so good that this album gets overlooked. After listening to it over and over again I realize how good it is. Different but good. This album deserves a lot more credit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Missing Adore","review":"I had this album but gave it away to a girlfriend at the time because I thought it was too mellow. Now, 4 years later, I wish I had it back. Like a couple of reviewers mentioned, it deserves another look after this much time has passed and after the backlash it received upon its debut. Also the fact that it takes more than just one listen to get into and appreciate. 4 years after I gave it away, I hear some of these songs, realize I like them, and then realize they were on Adore. This album will definitely be a part of my collection again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Billy Corgan dusts off his 80's record collection for a new direction","review":"Although releasing an 80's inspired, gothic infused record at the height of the britpop phenomenon back in1996 was probably not the best career move, adore the bands forth studio album, found the pumpkins veering away from the more traditional grunge sound of their earlier releases to more textural soundscapes and in places reveals Billy corgans love of New Order and other 80's electronica inspired bands something he would also explore on 2003's zwan mary star of the sea album. From sparse piano tinged ballads (For Martha) and Zeppelinesque (Tear) through to the lilting Once upon A time, Adore contains some of the pumpkins prettiest and most affecting songs an album that proves more rewarding with each play rather than an instant hit those seeking the bands more commercial work should start elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Silent Poetry","review":"Despite the criticism, Adore is certainly a fabulous album, filled with ambient instruments and lush production. It is for the most part a soft album (which is where the criticism stems from), but what Pumpkins album is without its softer side? Mellon Collie, for example, has 15 \\"soft\\" songs on it...over half the album! Adore is a stunning and perceptive piece of art, haunting at times, yet never depressing. It has a vast array of styles (as every Pumpkins album does) ranging from melancholy piano, to up-beat techno, to acoustic ballads, and yes, it even has some heavily distorted rocking moments. In fact, though it is a different sound for the Pumpkins (as every album is), it is slightly reminiscent of their 1989 demos, in that it is hypnotic and jolting, yet beautiful and flowing. The only negative part about this album is that Jimmy Chamberlin (who has since been re-hired and can be heard again on Machina) isn't on this album. Well, I've rambled enough...Buy it! You'll love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I didn't \\"adore\\"...","review":"I've been a smashing pumpkins fan since gish, and I have to say i didn't really like this album the first time i heard it.I had huge expetations after \\"mellon coolie...\\" so i actually found this boring and presumptuos.But after a while, i decided to give it another try and it ended up growing on me like only few other records did.It has a different style from their previous works, which might dissapoint a few individuals, but it's still a very good album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good.","review":"I was sort of shocked when I first heard their songs on RealAudio. The music was totally different than previous albums. But that's a bad thing? Adore is a very good album, with many beautiful melodies and enjoyable songs I listen to over and over again. I wouldn't mind it if the Pumpkins kept their genre like this. Corgan focuses his lyrics on love, friendship, and also tries to find meaning in life. A very good album. One of the best I have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Billy Corgan and the leak in my ear","review":"First of all, I'd like to point out that I really liked \\"Mellon Collie...\\". It was great, but a bit too long. I expected \\"Adore\\" to be similar, having hard rock tunes among slower, more melancholic songs. What I got was the latter. The question remains: has Corgan become too emotional? The songs on \\"Adore\\" are pathetic. If this is what Corgan sought, then OK, but somehow I didn't get that impression. \\"For Martha\\" is a good example: you spend 8 minutes listening Corgan complainig about having \\"a leak in his soul\\". Big deal. Where is the nasal warrior from \\"Bullet With Butterfly Wings\\"?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh boy...","review":"THIS ALBUM IS AWFUL. Not even the fantastic song \\"Appels + Oranjes\\" can save this album from getting the worst rating possible. Most of the songs drag on and/or have lyrics that are either not powerful or are carried out by his (surprisingly) annoying voice. Their earlier albums didn't sound like Corgan had such a whiney voice and I'M GLAD. This album is BAD ELECTRONICA and really isn't worth four dollars. I might have expected something of such disgustingness from another band, but not the Pumpkins. There is no excuse for this pathetic CD. HOW CAN PEOPLE LIKE IT? About 3 of the 15 (don't even call \\"17\\" a song) are worth listening to. I don't know why Pumpkins had to change - BUT I WISH THAT THEY HADN'T... I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED WHEN I BOUGHT THIS ALBUM. Very, very sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Billy Corgan misses the mark, badly","review":"While rock fans awaited a Pumkins disc that would energize the rock community, we are given this lifeless collection of drivel. The Pumkins were once a great band, but sadly they are no more. Corgan whines about his problems as if we're supposed to care. His hopeless attempt to latch on to electronic music is pathetic. Acoustic guitars are supposed to put emphasis on the songs but songs like AVA ADORE and CRESTFALLEN aren't even songs. It's the sound of one man whining. If he wants us to believe that he is delivering something new and different, then he should do something new and different. Instead this is a tired attempt to latch onto the latest craze, electronic music. His next project will probably involve swing music."},{"rating":"1","title":"well","review":"heres the thing, im a huge smashing pumpkins fan but this album only has two good songs on it, perfect and ava adore. if you want a real good smashing pumpkins album go with mellon collie and the infinite sadness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at all impressed.....","review":"Perhaps I anticipated too much this time, but I was very dissappointed. As many other reviewers have stated, I have been around since Gish and turned a number of friends on to the band. This perhaps was too much of a departure. I have always liked the \\"slower\\" tunes, but this was too slow and dark. I will continue to listen to Adore, searching for what many of the other reviewers have raved about...the interesting search continues."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Pumpkins Explore New Sounds","review":"I think we had a clue to the direction the Pumpkins were taking with their songs off of the Batman & Robin soundtrack. When I first heard \\"Adore\\" I was reminded of great cult bands like New Order and the Cure. The sound is definately differnt from the Pumpkins normal hard-edged stuff, and more similar to their softer stuff (a la 1979). It's a definate must buy for Pumpkins fans, and an interesting buy for almost any others. The blend of Corgan's voice and the newly electronic feel (and here, I'm refering to the old 'New Wave' genre) give \\"Adore\\" a number of great songs. And it grows."},{"rating":"1","title":"This cd doesn't rock, it blows","review":"When I listen to the song \\"Perfect\\" I think about what a perfect load of crap this cd is."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worthy of that 1 star","review":"I won't say they sold out. This was anything but a sell out. It was an artist going his own way, which I respect. But please GET REAL. He talked about changing his style and seeing what fans followed him, which is cool, but this is really just too much. Billy has to grow up and learn to deal with life, or put that angst to good use like he did in his previous albums.I think this will sum it up:'Rock is dead' - Billy Corgan'The Smashing Pumpkins are dead' - Rock"},{"rating":"1","title":"The reason for the Smashing Pumpkins decline.","review":"Adore was the Smashing Pumpkins worst album, because it tried to be bring some electronica beats into the band's sound, but couldn't pull it off. I would definently say that if you are going to buy any album from the Smashing Pumpkins, buy Machina: Machines of God, because Adore is a piece of you know what compared to that one, Machina is their come back album and those who buy Adore will be dissapointed in the fact that what I have said is truth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disenchanted Pumpkins Fan","review":"Let me say that I am a huge Pumpkins fan. However, I found this album to be quite disappointing. I never seemed to connect with the messages in these new songs. They are too long and way too mellow for a loyal SP listener. The lyrics seem to drone on without making a complelling statement. I do think Billy has poured his heart into this album. He just missed the mark. Maybe next time. So for the bulk of Pumpkins fans, I'd advise skipping this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninspired Ennui.","review":"This album contains more of the same drivel and melancholy crooning of the sad Billy Corgan. The lackadaisical guitar work combined with the uninspired lyrics create an amalgam that is sure to disappoint. There is absolutely no musical diversity displayed on this album, as each song annoyingly sounds like the previous one. \\"Once upon a Time\\" succinctly captures the unoriginal, derivative style of the Pumkins disenfranchised banter. Frankly, I've had enough of the thinly-veiled commercialism of this MTV-created phenomenon. They have ceased making music for their core, and are now making it for the money. They're laughing all the way to the bank on our dime. We deserve more. Track 13 captures the experience of listening to this album: Behold: The Night Mare!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The most underrated album of all time","review":"When I first got this album I didn't like it at all. I liked track 3 and thats it.Within a day it grew on me so I liked tracks: 1, 2, & 3.Within a week I liked: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, & 13Then by the next week, this album was all perfect. I sincerly enjoyed this album and I cannot see how people, if they give it a couple of listens, won't like. In my opinion, it was better than Siamese Dream and comes VERY close to Mellon Collie.This is my second favorite album of all time, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for depth in their music."},{"rating":"2","title":"These Pumpkins are Smashing","review":"Adore is a perfect album as \\"perfect\\" is a great sound.

This CD is for a diehard Pumpkin fan so buy it already"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best CDs I have heard for a long time.","review":"I don't understand why so many people have put down this album. It was the first Pumpkins album that I bought and I loved it. The more that I listened to it the better it got. Because of this album I have bought their other CDs and each one is wonderful! I love siamese dream and pisces iscariot I have not got Mellon Collie yet but I have heard it and I think that while it is good their other CDs are better. I think that people should stop putting down Adore and listen to the lyrics, it may not be typical pumpkins but it is fresh and new and a lot of the pain that Billy expresses through his lyrics I can and many other people too can relate to. I hope that they use this style somewhat on their next album and continue to play these songs at their concerts."},{"rating":"2","title":"1998","review":"This is not the lightest album the Pumpkins ever made; it's by far the heaviest. It's like wading through a black lagoon and singing to yourself so that you won't fall asleep and sink under the water."},{"rating":"1","title":"5 Star Music, 2 Star Vinyl Issue","review":"This acoustic-ish album by The Smashing Pumpkins is one of their best. If you haven't checked it out, do yourself a favor. This vinyl version is an alternate Mono mix that sounds great and is enclosed within great, colorful artwork on the front.Manufacturing issues:The material of the sleeve that encloses the vinyl is cheap recycled paper that seems ever ready to absorb water. I don't think durability is what they had in mind with this release.The first copy I received has a bunch of scratches, skip-riddled tracks, and 3 loops on side 2 of the first disc. It was hectic to listen to it. Everything else was perfect. The second copy had a loop on side 1 and 2 of the first disc, and a few skips on side 2 of the first disc. While the second copy isn't perfect, I'm not going to exchange it again because it's not worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pumpkins still good, but needs more variety","review":"I loved the Smashing Pumpkins' \\"Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness\\" CD. It had a good mix of the guitar and loud drumbs kinds of songs (e.g. Bullet W/..., Zero, Where Boys...), and then those delicate songs like Cupid De Locke. That's what makes the Smashing Pumpkins different from everyone else, that they can pull it off. With this CD, it's the lullaby type of songs and some that are a little more lively, but I would have liked more variety. All in all, this album is great. If you were a fan of Mellon Collie..., you'll be a fan of this one too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant!","review":"Billy Corgan and his band has done it again, going against the grain,creating a masterpiece of unparalleled beauty.

Sorry, but it isn't up to par with the other albums and never will be."},{"rating":"1","title":"A pathetic album","review":"While this is not a bad album, it is taking a step away from what is good and taken a step closer to what we true music lovers hate. In this outting, Corgan has done his part to put his knife in the back of the dying art known as grunge rock. While \\"Perfect\\" is undoubtably a catchy song, it (like all of the songs on this album) is destined to be buried in the junk pile known as pop music. The music industry today is about selling out to a bunch of people who will all buy your CD and will listen to it for about two weeks and then trash it. This is not what Smashing Pumpkins used to be about and I don't believe that this is how Corgan truely feels. Ifyou want to hear some classic Pumpkins, get Siamese Dream (ranks right up there with Pearl Jam's \\"Ten\\" and Nirvana's \\"Nevermind\\"). Don't participate in the mass murder of true music by buy trashy pop albums that devalue and degrade our music culture. I give this album a \\"2\\" only because \\"Perfect\\" is a decent song."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pumkins+electronica=badmusic","review":"What I don't get is that Billy is complaning everywhere about how 'different' this cd is from everything else they've done. What's different about it. Acoustic guitars and drum machines? So they slowed it down and added the latest trend, electronica. What's new, exiting, or different about chasing the latest trends to sell cds? This is the same old Smashing Pumpkins crap, with a drum machine instead of a real drummer. Instead of spending so much time programming a machine I think Billy should try writing a good song."},{"rating":"2","title":"WoW! A Gothic Masterpiece.","review":"Absolutely one of the most incredible albums of all time. Dark, dreamy, emotional, timeless... incredible.~Raven~"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pumpkins - smashed","review":"The Pumpkins made two excellent albums - 'Gish' and 'Siamese Dream'. Then they were a little over-ambitious in producing the 'Melon Collie...' double-lp, an album which was brilliant in spots, but poor in others. Corgan's prog rock leanings, which were hinted on with 'Melon Collie...', climax on this album and the results are terrible. Gone are the melodic, rock songs so characteristic of them, in their place : meandering prog-rock; heavy on the synthesisers, and highly sleep-inducing. There are a few nice moments on the album where glimpses of the old Pumpkins can be seen, but these are very and far between. 'Adore' is very much a Billy Corgan experimental ego-trip which should be avoided like the plague."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happend??","review":"I know i'm gonna take alot of heat for this but but I think that The Pumpkins have gone downhill...Billy, what happend to the great guitar songs of past albums?What happend to the riffs and the melodies? I know that they have to change but when a rock band goes to synthesizers (I hope I spelled it right)in order to create rock music, you know its not gonna work. I think Siamese and Mellon Collie are some of the best albums but I'm sorry to say I'm dissapointed..."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get it.","review":"I just don't get what all the fuss over the Pumkins is all about.

How ridiculous can they be, they went from one of the best alternitave rock band to one of the worst. This industrial computer music is absolutley obsured. It's like they were getting tired of playing good music. They use to have a great music sense, but then they did this and I have lost all hope in the band."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Sterile","review":"It doesn't take a great musician to arrange music on a sequencer. If this was played with real musicians, it might have touched me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why !","review":"How could Billy Corgan do this. With this album he has betrayed Rock'n'Roll. Seems like it started when Billy got his head shaved. There is only one song I like on this CD, or maybe two. But I really have to ask myself, what happened to the pumpkins after Mellon Collie ? O.k., so they wanted to change or whatever, but not always is a step forward also a step into the right direction. The saying matching most of my thoughts is the one: Never change a winning team. So why did you ? After I bought Adore and the slightly better Machina, I started buying the Mellon Collie Singles, to hear some Pumpkins' real stuff for years. immortal."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Album I have ever owned !!!","review":"I have an extensive collection of CD's by various artists, but there are only one Smashing Pumpkins - Adore CD.

I used to be a 'Pumpkins fan until this cd came out and I listened to it. The guitars and basslines and melodies in general are okay, but I don't like those stupid electronic drum machines. Even though Jimmy Chaimberlin(The Smashing Pumpkins's ex-drummer)was gone, I still expected some good music, but I was wrong and now that thing just sits on my cd rack collecting dust. What a rip-off/disappointment/shame this is. I might take back all the bad things I said about them just then if they get a real drummer.....then again, I might not."},{"rating":"2","title":"90's Perfection","review":"The Smashing Pumpkins have finally found a true 90's sound, and it came too late and with too many burned out on grunge.

I mean the Smashing Pumpkins are capable of so much more and this cd is dark and gloommy.

However, this change was not readily accepted, which is a shame. It might take a bit to get used to, but is an enjoyable album once you do. Not my first choice of SP CDs, but still a good listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"good but not great","review":"I'm all for musical evolution in a band. In fact, I believe that to become a truly great band you have to evolve over the years. However with this cd I don't think the Smashing Pumpkins took a step in the right direction. A main part of this problem is obviously the absense of Jimmy Chamberlain, a drum machine and that other guy just don't compare. Also, this type of music just isn't the next logical step for this band. While there are NO BAD SONGS on this album, there are none that are truly special either. Crestfallen and Tear come the closest but I just can't enjoy it that much. However there are many people that absolutely love this album and you could end up being one of them so you should definately check it out. Let me repeat again, this is not a bad album but I don't think it is what the Pumkins should be putting out. Machina is a great comeback and an example of where they should be heading musically, and <surprise> it's got jimmy chamberlain on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the Money","review":"I must agree with the previous reviewer-music this good can't go forever ignored. Frankly I think this is one of the SP's best efforts. Siamese Dreams is the best but this is not bad, even with the drum machine. As a group I will miss them, but this CD reveals Corgan's brillance. I'm a fan of Billie no matter what his incarnation is taking him to. Don't expect to rock with Adore, expect to simply let it waft through you with gentle grace and angst."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Little Night Music","review":"This album is like a velvet backdrop to the nighttime. Corgan has described it as \\"arcane\\" and that's the truth. While it is probably the most unique album from the Pumpkins, it ranks really highly among us fans. It's about longing, mystery, and the silence within the sound - like the enigma of the slumber of death within life.It definitely will bring a tear to your eye if you're a tender soul or if you have aching memories. However, shining through the darkness, you'll hear hope in this album - as with most of Billy's art. I highly recommend this album as soul-reflective, and really really special."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT!","review":"I have the red set, and I adore it.

This is about ambition, plain and simple, and where it leads those who think they're good. Filled with great characters, all of whom have at least three or four motives, it makes this one great read. Plus the sense of time and place, most of these characters are drawn from real life.

Although McAfee scanned faster than Norton, the security center module kept crashing my internet connection. I know it wasn't the firewall, because it did so even with the firewall turned off. It seems that the security center continually monitors your network connection. The process of that monitoring seemed to change the IP address of my computer and/or router. The only way to fix it was to go to IE \\"diagnose network problems\\" and let it reassign IP addresses. There is no way to disable the network monitoring function, so I gave up and went back to Norton. Very poor software. I'd give it 0 stars if it let me. The McAfee website is also very poor regarding support or troubleshooting.

It's definitely worth a read, and its brevity allows for multiple ones.Kudos to John Loken for his fine bit of research about this important area of assassination research. His book should added to those mythical \\"must read\\" lists of JFK assassination books which, oddly enough, seem to be conspicuously lacking any balance in terms of books that support the \\"lone gunman\\" theory.

Another way to describe it is the bowl ends up inserted in the cover. The problem with this is that it is a pain to clean because nothing will fit in this cover crease but a brush. I've never had that on my previous processors, the cover just fit around the bowl.A worst problem which is why I don't recommend it is that it's the second time I use this and there are rust spots appearing on the blade... cheapy cheapy.

The bowl and the blade shaft melted! She may not have known to pulse when using it on dry ingredients, but I still can't see how it would get so hot that it would melt a hole in the bowl! A replacement bowl is at least $25 plus shipping, and the blade is another $12. It was only $50 to start with.

It looked really nice and sturdy, a quality item. However, the first time I used it I was slicing cheese and it died after 2 blocks of cheese. I believe the plastic on the shaft stripped, because the motor runs but the blades don't turn. I'm extremely disappointed in this product. It mangled the cheese instead of slicing it (and I was doing hard cheeses, not soft). It was also annoying to have to cut the cheese into small enough chunks to fit into the shoot.

Schillebeeckx has been warned and criticized by the Vatican for some of his works.I recently ran across a liberation theology book which quotes Schillebeeckx's interpretation on the Eucharist and conclude that the Eucharist is about brotherhood - a mere remembrance of Christ and a mere meal.If you are looking to familiarize yourself with modern day errors concerning the Blessed Sacrament then this book would be a reference - it helps to understand what Schillebeeckx and Kung are thinking.

I will tell you that I am way over 50 years old and Superman is one of my dearest cherished childhood memories ... and still my Hero. This vision of Superman, as opposed to \\"Smallville\\" or other retellings of the comic mythology, is my favorite. Superman is a Good Guy. He has come to grips with his alter-persona and he IS what he IS. The directors, artists, writers, and voice actors of this series were always spot-on.

On the upside, it ends with some of the strongest episodes of it's run - making the Man of Steel and his world much more interesting and dangerous than it had been before.Not quite as consistently good as the various incarnations of Batman by these producers, I would argue that Superman's best episodes (mostly contained in this set) match the highs of their work on the Dark Knight. (And that's saying something for a Bat fan like me who has never had a whole lot of time for the big blue boy scout) It's also nice that Timm, Dini, et al were able to continue the characterization and plot threads started here in the later seasons of their Justice League."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superman - The Animated Series, Vol 3","review":"Excellent volume that I did not realize I missed most of these episodes when they came out.

What I hadn't realized was there were other authors who had written about the subject before Solzhenitsyn.Herling's book is a very readable introduction to life in the GULAG; he was a prisoner for eighteen months until he was released to work as part of the war effort. Told from a first-person perspective, it's not as detailed and doesn't present as many disparate views as The Gulag Archipelago but is still very interesting and enlightening.It's especially recommended if you're curious about the subject and don't have the patience or the time to work through Solzhenitsyn's works."},{"rating":"1","title":"24 Bit Dolby True HD Surround!","review":"Hello,First let me say that I think Jesse Cook is an amazing artist and a wonderful guitarist.

The lock easily slips through the portage holes of both kayaks and locks up nicely (either locking the kayaks to each other or to a solid object on land). This has given us a tremendous sense of security when visiting stores or restaurants when not on water.While I had been considering another lock from Kryptonite, I trust the Master Lock brand and feel that this was a terrific purchase for my needs.

To creative types he says don't worry about the medium you want , focus on the money you'll make---\\"it's honest.\\" The juxtaposing of ideas with art and photos is well done---I liked the ask for a slap in the face advice(ask others to tell you what you did wrong, not what you did right) with the photo of a woman wincing at the slap to come.

But this one just doesn't work as well as it should. It's definitely big and solid, but it just won't slide underneath a pancake far enough for the size to matter. Instead of drooping over the sides of my square spatula, now the pancakes droop over the lip of this enormous turner -- unless I can manage to get enough traction by squooshing the pancake up against the side of the griddle. The turner's splayed form also makes it hard to fit between pancakes when I'm making several at a time. Other reviewers seem happy with this item, so maybe it's just me.

No matter how careful I was, the other items in pan got messed while trying to turn one item. I have a large frypan & can easily fit 4 good sized pancakes in but with this turner only cooking one item at a time works. Also the pancakes did not easily detach from the turner after flipping. Not a good choice at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silicone is a disaster on pancakes","review":"I love the size of this pancake turner. However, unlike nylon, silicone sticks to the pancake so that it becomes difficult to slide the turner under a large pancake without the pancake tearing or parially folding on itself.

It has a very large flipper, but the handle is a good size - not too long - and fits perfectly in the drawer. I can't find anything wrong with this at all. Although - my husband couldn't wait to point out to me how the the handle had little indented grooves in the handle where 'I' had left the flipper in the hot pan, and the handle melted a little from the edge of the pan.

While this best of collection is very different than those 2 albums that featured Bruce Dickinson on vocals this is still a very strong collection of songs. Most of the songs are bluesy while others sound more like new wave rock and in my opinion the only really weak song on here is Don't Tell Me It's Over. The first 5 songs as well as the instrumental Room 109 and the last song Can't Live Without Your Love are my favorite songs on here.Most of the songs on this album feature great vocals and guitar solos and make this album worth checking out if you liked Paul Samson's guitar work from the older Samson albums.Overall I strongly advise you to buy this album if you like this kind of music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fairytopia Barbie Elina Doll - Ethnic","review":"This doll is very pretty with cool light up wings.

I really wanted to own that song on disc, and thought it a good opportunity to finally check out some more Tull. Glad I did! This album is great. It's hard to describe Jethro Tull other than using the label 'progressive rock', so I'll leave it at that. It's really a shame there isn't more music like this being made today.

First found them at my local hardware store, when they stopped carrying them, I was thrilled to find them on Amazon. My home is in the woods. I don't like killing the mice, but death by cat is the more tortuous way to go in my opinion. I set these up in our basement, away from the cats. Release of the dead mouse is EASY, a one-handed fling as I squeeze the trap open and back out into the woods the mouse goes. I don't love that I have to use mousetraps, but I love that these traps keep mice out of my cupboards."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE!

It could be read by dancers or teachers needing an organized set of exercises, or by those who want a deeper appreciation of this form of dance. There are many good photographs in the book, and many illustrations of human anatomy to assist in the discovery of the muscles involved in dance. The opposition of forces and movements, and the many isolations in the body, give jazz its unique characteristics. This interesting and fun art form is nicely summarized in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book for Jazz","review":"Sadly, this publishing date is too old for curriculum purposes, but it is still a great book for beginners in jazz dance. Sometimes the older publications have the most detailed information. Today it is all about watching DVD's and curriculum committees want nothing over five yeas old, but you still cannot beat a book that you can go back to every time you need help and inspiration to teach, to perform and to understand technique.

She created endearing charcters and did a fair job of keeping the mystery in, but the relationship between the knight and the beautiful woman - never really comes together. They have moments of tenderness that makes you think they are growing as a couple, but in the end, they never really come together. This author worked so hard to avoid anything sexual, that she denied her characters a full relationship. There's nothing wrong with waiting until marriage to consumate, but after the wedding - there should have been some level of intimacy that went a little deeper than loving looks. This author is talented, she just needs to add some depth to her characters as men and women."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleadingly categorised","review":"I love historical fiction.

So for those who don't like graphic love scenes this is a safe book."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Flawed","review":"This book annoyed me. The basic plot was good, but was ruined by the immature, selfish, stupid main characters. It was a never ending round of them fighting and making up, only to fight again over petty things. I kept hoping that things would get better, that they would grow up and start doing the right thing and have some faith in each other, but it never happened.This book is supposed to be Christian themed, but there were some scenes and feelings described that the characters had that I felt weren't appropriate for the genre.A waste of my time and I don't plan on reading the other books in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read","review":"Really enjoyed this book and learned some really interesting historical details of life in Scotland while being drawn in to the storyline and watching the two main characters blunder through a series of events.

I felt it contributed to the realness of the characters and the setting. There's a gentleness and sweetness in the women being called Lass and Lassie that you don't get in other languages.It's a little bit 'fairy taleish' in the way that the hero keeps dragging himself from his death bed to step in at exactly the last moment to save the heroine from peril, but as far as fiction goes, I really liked it. Besides, the heroine Anne, has spunk of her own.

As might be expected for that time frame, superstition is as common as gossip, and when you put the two of them together somebody is bound to be accused of witchcraft. They took a dim view of witches back then, and a simple accusation was as good as a conviction, as far as most people were concerned. But the story holds your interest, the characters were well established, and most of them you will either like or hate. A good read for fans of Historical Fiction, and I recommend it as such."},{"rating":"2","title":"Child of the Mist","review":"This is the 1st novel I have read by Kathleen Morgan. I was immediately impressed with her style and the way she draws the reader into the very moment. It held my interest, didn't want to put it down.

Historically improbable..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much romance female lead character very annoying","review":"The story is long on betrayal but short on sensible females how many times does it take to almost being killed to learn. Her constant attempts to save the clan was annoying at best and the thin traitors plot was less than exciting not the worst but far from best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eye-rolling material","review":"You know the book is bad when you keep rolling your eyes while reading it. The plot is paper thin and contrived. The two main characters feel forced together by the author and the dialogue is truly awful... I read another review that mentions this is a Christian adaptation of a previously written novel... Which would explain why she's holding back with the \\"sizzle\\" I guess... I wonder if the previous version was any better, but I doubt it made any more sense... Not the worst book I've ever read, but that is certainly not a recommendation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Had hopes of some historical background and interesting characters that were in no way fulfilled. The author creates sexual tension between an idealised Scottish warrior Niall, and an all too perfect heroine Anne, with a thin veneer of story line to hold it all together. Anne's nauseating perfection is added to with the overt statement of her Christian faith but the last straw for me came with the reaffirmation of Niall's faith after yet another disastrous encounter. If M/s Morgan wants to project her faith position perhaps she should stick to writing religious tracts."},{"rating":"2","title":"child of the mist","review":"Kathleen Morgan is one of my favorite authors. Looking for a romantic epic taking place back in 1500's in Scotland, look no more. She has a gift for writing. She also has a series set in the Colorado or Montana in the 1800's. Child of the Mist is the first in a three part trilogy and she has another Scottish series as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyed this book","review":"I can't explain it, but I really enjoyed this book. Yes, it was somewhat predictable. Yes, the romance seemed lacking. However, the story itself kept my interest and I found myself cheering for the chieftan to rescue his damsel. I especially loved the descriptions of the Highlands and the time period."},{"rating":"2","title":"definitely a read-over and over kinda book..","review":"the characters come alive in this highlands tale of love between two sworn enemies.Arranged marriage, intrigue, suspense, and one never-ending family feud make this an intense backdrop for the love story that develops. I fell in love with the main characters myself, and love the way the author is able to keep consistent in her characterizations and language. No cheesy flipping back and forth between centuries, but well researched and realistic. Totally a great book for people who want a romance outside of their familiar city backdrop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull and Predictable at Best","review":"Morgan hooks the reader early on in her story telling. I was excited and anticipated not only the rest of the book but also the rest of the series. However, by trying to cultivate some sort of romance between the main characters, Morgan's story quickly became predictable and dull, at best. I forced myself to finish the novel in order to properly critique it and finishing the story felt like work, instead of enjoyment. I ended up reselling the book at a used book store. Save your money and time- get something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"See Spot Run","review":"I've probably no right to review this book because I couldn't hope to finish it. While the dialogue might be a good writing sample for a highschool sophomore, I expect a great deal more for a book for which I'm required to pay.Even the language is bizarre - anything sounding remotely \\"british isley\\" is fair game - celtic, scottish, irish.

The intricacies of Scottish clans and culture were really interesting and the danger lurking around every corner and the love triangle kept me reading. At times I was frustrated because if the two main characters would have just communicated a little bit the book could've ended in the third chapter. I feel the author gave away too much too early and needed more time to fully develop the mystery. All that aside I really enjoyed Child of the Mist and I will be reading the next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Child of the Mist","review":"I really enjoyed this book. It had me interested from the very beginning! I loved the history behind it. The romance was a little steamy for some Christian readers, but waiting until marriage was important to her. It was rather realistic for what good Christians go through before marriage.The only complaint I have is that the ending was drawn out a little too far. We knew who the culprit was from the beginning and needed to just get on with the end. I would however recommend it to others. I also plan to read the other 2 books!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book!","review":"Child of the Mist is a quick, light read. I thought the characters and the story were great.

It started out interesting where you get to learn about the strength of Anne's character as she confront's a band of Niall's men. They also learn from one another when he is taken prisoner and she tends to his wounds. Unfortunately, the book goes downhill from here. There were so many frustrating moments when they were quarrelling due to misunderstandings. Niall is literally as Anne calls him a \\"pigheaded dolt.\\" Part way through the book, I was hoping Niall would come to a bad end so Anne would run off with Ian. But the most frustrating part of the book was the constant preachiness. Was I the only one who missed that this was supposed to be Christian lit? For one, I've read several levels with Scottish Highlanders and I'm not sure if the references to \\"Christians\\" and \\"Jesus\\" were appropriate. Weren't they supposed to be Catholic... Any way, I won't be reading else from this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable","review":"The writing is very ordinary and the plot is predictable and not terribly interesting.

It was an easy read with enjoyable characters. It was a little predictable, so that is why I gave it four stars. I am looking forward to reading more from this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not great","review":"I couldn't make up my mind if I should give it one star or two - I decided two because it was free and there are (probably)worse books out there.The storyline itself is very predictable and pretty much void of any Christian message. It feels like it was supposed to be some romance novel and the author later decided to delete inappropriate passages (well, she missed a few) and randomly add some religious content. That doesn't automatically make it a Christian novel and shouldn't be labeled as such.The characters in the book are shallow and predictable. The mindset of the heroine seems to be too contemporary and not believable to be that of a lady of the 16th century.One of the antagonists is part of the group that historically brought Christianity to a pagan and superstitious Scotland in the 16th century. Why he is the bad guy is beyond me.After reading this book I decided not to buy the rest of the Highland Hills series - it's not worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyed throughly","review":"Very entertaining read. I knew traitor from the start but loved how it spun. Except Iain, thought. Mistrust was not well formed jealousy yes though. Glad 2nd book is about him I can't wait to read it. No sex was handled superbly and glad for subtle Christianity message."},{"rating":"2","title":"Child of the Mist","review":"It was really interesting to see how something as simple as performing what we know today as CPR could have you branded as a witch in the 1500's. In this wonderful historical fiction book we get a look at the past and how far we've come.If you are into Scottish history or you just love reading about feuding clans then this is the book for you. To create a truce Anne is pledged in marriage to Niall. It is not what she desires. The one thing that neither of them counted on was falling in love. But that is just a portion of the story. Read to find out what trials they both must go through and how they handle it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Child of the Mist","review":"This is the first time I've read Kathleen Morgan and I enjoyed the book very much.

The beginning was promising but I soon found myself irritated at all the main characters, especially Niall who was weak, whiny, and an idiot. I could not finish it--written like a high schooler dreaming of being an author with about the same breadth and depth. Very disappointing that Amazon would include this with other historical fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth reading...","review":"I love historical fiction, but this was not historical. It was badly organized story that focused completely on the love/sexual tension between the two main characters. There were references to the characters belief in Jesus Christ, but it felt thrown in and not sincere. The intense moments of sexual tension, references to God, and the historical era and setting did not fix together as well as they could have. This book felt like a romance novel with christian inserts, so to sell to a different audience. The author and story have potential, but I won't be wasting time to find out if there is any in another book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another religious book","review":"I am always disappointed to start on an interesting story, such as this one, only to have it turn into a religious theme."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pumpkins calm down","review":"Anyone who describes this album as techno or dance is wrong by a longshot. The Pumpkins have kept us waiting for 3 years since their double CD masterpiece \\"Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness.\\" although album sales may never top the 7 million mark set by MCIS, it is still a great album. The CD incorporates many forms of music from the fast pace Ava Adore and Appels+Oranjes to the quiet, soothing piano in Annie-Dog. The drum ordeal was solved by recorded drum loops by Matt Walker, Matt Cameron, and Joey Warkoner. The album open with \\"To Martha.\\" An acoustic song with insect noises in the background. The most well known song and the 1st single \\"Ava Adore\\" follows. The Pumpkins 2nd single \\"Perfect\\" is number 3 on the tracklist. Although the songs lack the heavy drums, intoxicating lyrics, and ripping guitar solos, the album is a beautiful work of art by the Pumpkins."},{"rating":"2","title":"i like more of harder rock not slow songs but...","review":"most of these songs are pretty cool. i would say most the album is great for turning it on then doing something else much like third eye blind semisonic. but ava adore and perfect(incredably great songs) i just have to sit down and listen to - probably because thyre so good. most of the songs are just boring i guess but still great to turn down a little bit but loud enough to hear and go maybe do something at amazon.com, or something like that"},{"rating":"2","title":"Otros sonidos","review":"Adore es un disco que muestra el sonido mas \\"limpio\\" de este cuarteto.

If you stay in one place, you die. Nor is this album a \\"progress for progress' sake\\" album: every song is crafted the way Billy Corgan wanted it to be done, and we should be glad he did it this way.

Brilliant stuff, everyone needs this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much narration, not enough whale","review":"With a title like \\"Kingdom of the Blue Whale,\\" one would think that you'd see a lot of footage of the blue whale. However, National Geographic'sNational Geographic: Kingdom of the Blue Whale [Blu-ray] is a documentary about conducting research on blue whales. It had disappointingly little on the whales themselves. Tom Selleck's narration just seemed to drone on - certainly no David Attenborough. If you want to see a scene with awesome blue whales, check outThe Life of Mammals, Vol. 1-4."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"This book was great and I all ways can't wait for the next one. I usually finish these books in an hour or less but still enjoy them. I think the Everworld series dosen't even compare to the Animorphs series. If you like animals then read these books I learned lot from them. I think animorphs are really good."},{"rating":"1","title":"time to move on","review":"K.A. Applegate has done a great job writing these books, but it's getting old. I like it when a series-style writer carries things over from her previous books, and she did that with the addition of Ax, the Hork-Bajir colony, the Helmacrons, and that David guy. I just wish she would have the Andalites FINALLY arrive. What is she waiting for?"},{"rating":"1","title":"WHEN IS 'THE CONCLUSION' or 'THE END' going to come out?","review":"I'm an avid reader, and I've been hooked to Animorphs since third grade (I'm in 6th now). but lately, the series has become quite boring and mundane, and is getting like Goosebumps, which I loathe [just my opinion] Before we get Book #153, I'd prefer for Ms. Applgate to stop the series and make better books. The 'EverWorld' series is a good start."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrap it up.","review":"We've been Animorphs fans for a couple years now, but we're surprised the series is still going, especially considering the success of K.A. Applegate's \\"Everworld\\" series.Animorphs have gone on for too long. It's turned into cookie-cutter formula books. A new discovery, a suspenseful middle, some wisecracks, and the end.Fans of this series deserve closure, before book #100. There are alot of great books out there waiting to be read, and loved. Put the Animorphs to bed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting...","review":"In this book, the Animorphs discover other Andalites on earth. One is a vecol (an Andalite with his/her tailblade cut off) and has been captured by the Yeerks.

The Animorphs and the Andalite thats not captured go to try to rescue the vecol. Will the Animorphs suceed, or will they fail? Read the book to find out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many ideas spoil the novel","review":"I quite enjoy SF in general, including the hard stuff. But this was hard in a different way -- hard to make out what the heck was going on. Seemed like Metzger had lots and lots of coffee before writing this one, and couldn't bear to let any idea, no matter how zany, slip away. It was entertaining, but only because I borrowed it from somebody and didn't have to be mad about the money I paid for it. Head to Brin, Benford, or Niven for hard SF... avoid this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"WRITTEN IN AN INCOHERENT STYLE","review":"I love hard sci-fi , especially stories with grandiose ambitions. However, here the authors ambitions, although grandiose, were not translated into effective writing. Simply put, I never understood what was going on in this book. The author jumps around and never provides any backdrop information. He uses many of his own terms but never explains them. He keeps referring to the \\"Swirl\\" the \\"Void\\" amd \\"Tools\\", but after 400 pages I still dont know what they are. I was very disappointed by this book. I basically was scratching my head the whole time asking myself \\"what the hell is going on\\"? I contrast this type of writing with that of my favorite sci-fi author Robert Sawyer, whose plots are always perfectly clear, and stories are totally coherent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Repetitive, Repetitive","review":"The same information was rendered in the same way so many times, especially in the last third of the book, that I had to guess that Metzger had been tasked to come up with X number of words, so he just kept repeating himself until he had them. Worse, the publisher accepted an obviously rushed attempt without any editing. The book is full of unatributed dialogue and bad grammar. Maybe the editor slept through most of it.Metzger started with a good idea, including some interesting science. Then he treated both the science and the characters as if he were writing a fantasy. Most of the plot twists were no better than having a fairy suddenly appear and cast a spell. If Metzger had tightened it, if the editor had edited, if, if, if.It a sorry excuse for a book that should have been so much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"A let down","review":"This is not a cheap book but with so may 5 star ratings I was sure I couldn't lose. I found it was not worth the price. The pace is unsteady, filled with a great deal of techno babble that is unnecessary, not fun and never properly explained. If your interested in the Sun and the Earth sprouting high-energy jet exhausts and the possibilities, this is not the place. You will be forced to endure endless pages of ideas that are uninteresting and tedious before landing on this topic. The text is nebulas as I was often left confused, wondering when I would understand what it was that I was reading and its purpose. It never happened. I purchased this book based on 5 star reviews... I can't imagine others actually finishing this book of their own free will. It was simply a chore. And I must say this is nothing close to Arthur C. Clarke. Look else where if you want good science fiction. I would not recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Epic ideas, terrible execution","review":"Some of the ideas in the book are great by themselves, but not wrapped into one confusing mess of a \\"book\\" with little to no character development. You can expect to enjoy: time travel, intelligent evil dinosaurs battling intelligent lemurs, vague notions of \\"posthumanity\\", the total summarizing of quantum physics with the single description \\"Zero Point\\" that apparently does everything including smoothing over gaping holes in the plot, a supposedly low ranking general that somehow finagles control over the entire planet, and the total destruction of causality as everyone knows it.

What a marvelous trip, over way too soon.If you like your science fiction with good, hard science, this is the book for you! Mr. Metzger is a scientist, and his science is good science. His characters are alive, and will evoke appropriate emotions. In other words, I laughed, I cried, I got angry in all the right places.One of the best trips I've had in years.

The mental images the author evoked were incredibly ridiculous - there's a scene with Bill Gates, a dinosaur, a little green man looking lemur, and a girl in a hospital gown controlling infinite walls of fire and ice, one on each side of her. It was like a bad science fiction movie, only the author couldn't blame it on being constrained by reality or budget. I was intrigued by the first 100 pages or so, but it went downhill after that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting but boring","review":"This is my first \\"hard\\" sci-fi book. After not reading sci-fi for 20 years, I rediscovered it with Robert Charles Wilson (highly recommended) and thought I would branch out a bit. Well, there are 2 kinds of sci-fi writers. Those whom use the characters to get to the science and those whom use the science to get to the characters. Mr. Metzger is the latter. Invariably the latter fail to engage you emotionally or ultimately psychologically. Strictly intellectual writing bores me. This book is heavy on intellect and light on emotional insight. Interesting but boring....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice size tree, fruiting already!","review":"The company was out of the Big Jim Loquat but they had a similar cultivar so I bought it.

This cd just plain out and out smokes from note one to the end. The trumpet solo on 'A Tyrant's Tale' alone is worth the price of this one. The arrangements are clever the playing from all of the playiers is stellar. I can find very little to fault this cd. The magazine 'Mojo' which is out of England picked this as the top jazz cd of the year and when you play it I think you will understand their reasoning. The trumpet playing sounds like a cross between Miles Davis and Art Farmer and the arrangements remind me of Coltrane at times or one of the classic Hard Bop groups from the early sixties like Horace Silver. Just plain great stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"William Marshall: A Study of Knighthood","review":"William Marshall is a look at medieval knighthood and the man who his contemporaries considered the shining example of it. It works as both a biography of the man and an analysis of the nature of chivalry in the 12th and 13th Centuries. It takes a much more reasoned approach than that of George Duby's workWilliam Marshall: The Flower of Chivalry. In this book William's character comes across clearly, as both a successful knight and a skilled courtier. Chivalry isn't quite how it's thought of today and this book shows how the knight was expected to function then. So for an excellent look at England (and Normandy) in the 12th and 13th Centuries check out this (all too brief ) book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Authenticated Life of the Greatest Medieval Knight Errant","review":"It's through the details of Marshal's life and Professor David Crouch's own methodical research - that he has been able to successfully bring this greatest medieval knight errant to life! Not in some abstract way - but in a way and a time in which 'raconteurs' were valued and prized at court. Happily, that talent is not lost on his descendants which are many - including Americans President George Washington and poetess, Anne Dudley Bradstreet. But for me, it was the historical accuracy of the book which then allowed me to travel to England and Wales to retrace Marshal's own footsteps and see his castles up close. To breathe life into one's ancestor is difficult enough but Professor Crouch has done it with aplomb."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring take on a extraordinary topic","review":"This book was nothing more than a unspired college textbook version of events.

BORING!I adored the The Wind From Hastings by Morgan Llywelyn and eagerly sought another novel about Harold Godwin. I should have kept looking. It has taken me 4 agonizing days to reach chapter 10 (page 61) and I'm shelving it! This book is FAR less about Harold and the Battle of Hastings, and much more about Walt and Quint strolling through the Middle East - NOT the English countryside as I had hoped. The author is long-winded at best with his scenic descriptions and accounts of Walt's time with Harold Godwin are few and far between. Maybe I'm missing out and this gets better - but I'm not willing to waste another day to find out. This book has me breaking my 100 page minimum rule and has been ruled out at page 61!"},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE","review":"I'm sorry but this book was awful, I like reading history books and I thought that I would try this historical novel but I think in future I will just stick to proper historical accounts!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"nothing special","review":"This \\"Rathbone\\" guy sure has a cool last name, but I'm uncertain whether he has any more insights into Anglo-Saxon England that anybody else does.Two big problems I had with this story:1. The characters appeared to be animated by modern sensibilities and worldviews, not those of Anglo-Saxon England. It was a bit like those period movies where everybody's wearing convincing costumes from the Elizabethan Age, except their attitudes, reactions, and approach to life all betray the actors' and writers' sensibilities: mainly, 20th-century London or Southern California.2. I don't think having the story told in flashback added much, compared to the confusion it caused. Did it really convey much that we would have missed out on had the story been related in a more conventional manner?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Zzzz","review":"I really, really wanted to like this book.

I'm doing research on 11th Century Europe, and a factual, historic book was my expectation. Maybe I misread the description when I ordered it, but I was sure it was history and not a fabrication. This is fiction, and not especially engrossing fiction. The author tells of the events in and around the year 1066 from the viewpoint of a \\"housecarl\\", a warrior retained by an English noble. It was not much help in my research project."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware","review":"This is NOT an Ortofon Cartridge. What's for sale is an Ortofone STYLUS. Huge difference.

The authors understand that sometimes you just want some uncensored advice on the easiest way to land a one night stand. The book is filled with plenty of pictures of sexy models, but most of them are small and in black and white. Also, some of the material has been recycled from the magazine, but most of it is original. The book's strength is that it provides a surprising amount of info you never would have thought of, but which is sure to make a difference."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is Brett Mcbean worth 5 stars you might ask?","review":"YES, this is a wonderful suspenseful horror novel, NOT TO BE MISSED. I love a book about 'psychos' it is truly creepy. So, this book was right up my alley. I love being scared by more of a 'true to life' experience. Well, we have all read about real life weirdo's so this was perfect. The novel takes you from character to character. Each chapter is something new. AND, once and awhile at the end of a chapter something makes you hold your breath...and you won't know what happens until you read a few more chapters to get back to that character. True on the edge of your seat writing. Brett McBean is truly a great horror writer and you should have this story added to your horror collection!

Sister Bear is going to be in kindergarten and is a bit anxious about leaving home and spending most of the day in a new and strange place. Mama Bear takes Sister to the school to meet her teacher and look at her classroom. Sister begins to think that school might not be so bad. However, when the bus arrives to pick her up on the first day, Sister is still anxious. Eventually, she comes to enjoy school and in the process teaches Brother Bear a lesson.This book is a great book to read to toddlers and young children who are about ready to start school. It shows them that it's okay to be nervous about going to school for the first time, yet at the same time calms their fears about school, thereby preparing them for when they begin classes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Tale!!!","review":"I read this to my little boy before the first day of preschool. We read several books about starting school because he was a little nervous about starting school. Of all the books we read about starting school, The Berenstain Bears Go to School was his favorite. My son just loves the Berenstain Bears. I love them too because they teach children valuable life lessons. The Berestain Bear Books teach children how to grow-up and be respectful, responsible adults. Obviously parenting is a difficult, yet rewarding task. A book won't solely do the job of ensuring your child grows-up right, but it's safe to say that The Berenstain Bear Books may very well indeed help place them on the right track."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVED THIS BOOK AS A KID AND NOW MY SON DOES TOO!","review":"My son recently started preschool and I remembered I loved this book as a child.

Daughter Bear was very nervous about her first day of school but after meeting another nervous kindergarten bear on the bus and having a fun day painting, playing, etc., she was so excited for school the next day.

The author tries to address a skeptic's real questions, and displays a great deal of knowledge and scholarship throughout the book. And he does solve some of the Bible's difficulties. Nevertheless, as my 2-star rating indicates, there are problems with the book. Aside from the fact that he has missed some significant problems with the Bible, I have found serious errors in facts and in reasoning throughout the book. The book aims to convince skeptics (as it says on the back), but I'm afraid that it has not succeeded with this skeptic. My advice is: read this only if you are already familiar with the historical and archaeological knowledge of the times in question, and can judge the arguments for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Resource","review":"This book will be most useful for fundamentalists who wonder about the contradictions in the Bible if it is read literally."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could Be Much Better","review":"Dr. Archer is well-schooled. He has a law degree, and extensive training as a linguist. Many of the points he makes in this volume would have been more influential if he had only chosen to annotate the text. He presents numerous ideas about so-called bible difficulties that are not mentioned in commentaries by other authors. Due to the complete absence of footnotes or other annotation, it is nearly impossible to determine what ideas were the product of research and which are opinion.

So its very difficult to read the book and its very difficult to look at the pictures, which means the book fails my purpose of buying it.This is sad because I really would like some Buddhist books for children.

China has been one of my favorite characters, and I love the whole herb shop/metaphysical shop combo, but I've lost faith and respect in McQuaid for being a lousy cheat, and in China, for being a total idiot in blaming herself for McQuaid's actions, AND what woman in her right mind would befriend the woman her man cheats with, then sit and joke with her about it? Please. Infidelity is a big trigger with me. I had already bought the next four books, but I'm so let down by both of their actions and the casual way they dealt with it, that I'm donating them all to the library without reading them.

Coupled with McQuaid's mysterious \\"research\\" project, China finds her life unraveling. The mystery involves a former Texas Ranger who dies of an apparent suicide. China has many challenges in investigating the case on behalf of his wife. While the situations were certainly dramatic, I agree with the other reviewers that even under the stressful conditions at the end of the book, I find it highly unlikely that China would befriend the \\"other woman\\". While the mystery is solved, China and McQuaid's relationship remains up in the air at the conclusion. I look forward to seeing what happens in their relationship in the next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tore my heart out.","review":"An intense continuation in the series.

Now I have no desire to continue the saga. This is not the same heroine I started reading about.I'm afraid the Author has made her into a woman I don't care for. I had a very hard time finishing the book because of her whimpy personal life attitude.I can't tell you how many times I put the book down because I was totally disgusted with China. The general mystery was good but my appeal for China is gone! I don't even want to know what happens in the next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"Expensive, I thought. I'll pass. For a week. But you know how it is. Once you've got it in your head, you can't let it go. Finally, I bought it. (Well, it was hard to get, but I have friends who can get me things from the US).And I love it!The two new classes, the prestige classes... the powers, monsters, and psionic items--you could start an entirely new campaign based only on psionics! Especially with the way they've allowed the psion to follow any of six paths. I prefer the telepath, but the shaper is cool, too.Give it a shot, I did, and I don't regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Another Sorcerer","review":"Please steer away from the Psionics Handbook. Its just magic that is labeled \\"psionics\\". The \\"psioncis powers\\" are just lame versions of spells, and anything that can affect a spell can also affect a \\"psionic power\\", including magic resistance, which has been lamely renamed as \\"power resistance\\" when applied to psionic powers. Im sure the first time a dispel magic takes out your Telekinesis, you will regret your decision to play a Psion and not a Sorcerer, which is a far more interesting class."},{"rating":"1","title":"Failed Psionics","review":"WoC made the unique powers of the mind into nothing more than a feeble third type of magic. The spells... oh err powers are nothing more than reworded copies of wizard and sorcery versions. The claim to over 200 different powers is BS, oh there are over 200 if you count all of the minor and greater versions of a given power, as well as all 9 levels of create ectoplasmic construct. They turned useful powers into prestige classes (like mind blade). Overall i am, obviously, dissapointed by the turd editions attempt at psionics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be afraid Very afraid...","review":"...of this book, DONT GET IT. ITs bad bad bad.It seems like it was just an exuse for WOTC tohave fun with really big words that dont actually meananything. Both me and a friend have read it numerous timesand we still dont understand it in the slightest.Although if you already have it you can still get some neat stuff out of it, like:Magic Items and artifactsFeats that you can adapt for normal classesInteresting ideas for new spellsBut even then there are only a few of these that are worth redoing. By far however, the thing I most disliked was power points. I really dont want to keep track of 150+ power points for high level characters when I could just use spell slots.Stick with the magic not brain (besides, magic looks cooler)."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY - BORROW!!!","review":"This book is an interesting variant, but really not worth it.The system used is just a magic variant system, with POINTS spent to cast (manifest) a spell (power).At half the thickness of such books as the DM's Guide or the Monster Manual it's not cheap. I recommend, if you use it at all, that you borrow it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good For some...","review":"This book is best used if the DM in your group has decided it's a good idea to incorporate psionics. If you are the only psion out there, then this book is merely a bunch of ways to stun non-psionic beings. However, if your DM does welcome psionics, then you can picture the havoc you can wreak by \\"casting\\" psionic powers while wearing full plate armor, creating your own demiplane of existence, or playing as one of the nearly all-powerful psionic races! So only order this book if you and your DM have worked out that you will have a world with psionics in it.P.S.-USE THE PRESTIGE CLASSES!!! They can really spice up an adventure!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A sick joke","review":"I was a big fan of 2nd Edition psionics. My favorite class to play was psionicist. But with 3rd Edition, psionicists have become nothing more than wimpy mages.Now, I like the idea of a psychic warrior. That is the one thing the book did right.However, WotC foolishly claims that psionics is magic, when it is inherently not. They then give the \\"psion\\" all the weakness of a sorceror, but with none of the raw power. Psionics is now nothing special. They claim it was for balance, but I think the problem lies on those who do not wish for psionics to have a chance on stepping on wizards' toes.Instead, if you want psionics, I must recommend using \\"Forbidden Kingdoms\\" instead. Their psionics systems use the skill d20 mechanic instead of the magic mehcanic, and works much better and truer to psionics than this...book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Since when is this handbook part of the core rules?","review":"OK, let me put it this way. Not everyone plays with psionics, but this gets released before a number of other \\"core\\" supplements (i.e. rangers, druid, theives, bards, etc.). Yes, the class books are smaller and less intensive, but they're a heck of alot more useful to alot more players and DMs... I suppose this is less of a criticism of the book than of WotC, but I think I make a valid point."},{"rating":"1","title":"They've turned Psionics into Magic and vice versa","review":"I was so happy when they introduced the character class of Sorcerer with spell abilities based on strength of mind. Now they've added this book with adds another character class with spell like abilities based on strength of mind. It's too much and too confusing. The prestige classes aren't that much different from some of the prestige classes for mages and sorcerers either.While there is a great deal of information, I feel they should have combined them into one type (which I've done in my campaign). If you're really interested in Psionics get the book but if it's just a passing interest don't bother - just use the Socerer and expand on some of the mental abilities."},{"rating":"1","title":"a decent failure","review":"Maybe Monte Hellman aimed too high, maybe it just didnt work, I dont know. Maybe it's just what the director in the movie says: \\"the first most importante thing in a movie is the cast, the second is the cast and the third is the cast, It's 90% of the movie and I cant remember the othe 10%.\\" More or less that's what he says. No one plays really good although the main female actress has its moments. There are some great images in the film, and there is maybe a plot and a story behind all this (although you'll have to figure that out). The film is too long, and I waited all these 2 hours for something to give a sense of purpose or to explain what's going on. Nothing. I hope that Monte Hellman do more films, I'd really like to see what he achieves when his film works."},{"rating":"1","title":"For The Pseudo-Intellectual","review":"The mood and tone for this movie is set in the first four minutes, four full minutes, of watching a lady dry her finger nail polish.

There were numerous shots that seemed to last 45 seconds to a minutes which could have been cut down to about 10 seconds and the viewer would have gotten the same message from the shot.The plot is difficult to follow since the movie is about a movie about a crime. Both the leading lady and actor play the criminals and the actor and actress playing the the criminals in the movie. Very confusing... There is also some underlining plot of a hundred million dollar fraud which is never explained. I could go on and on... if I could give this movie less than 1 star I would."},{"rating":"1","title":"From nowhere ... to NOWHERE","review":"I had a fairly in depth review ready for this film but my review now would just be a plagiarism of the previosuly written review by MWT which I now, can now only endorse.

I found the reviews trying to explain and praise this movie more entertaining than the film itself. Shannyn Sossamon's talent is wasted once again on inferior material and i'm sorry to say that whatever promise Dominique Swain showed is now merely a waste. The one star is for the Tom Russell songs.

Long shots of people walking around, laying in bed or just staring into space while a boring soundtrack droned on in the background. The music ranged from opera to outback to jungle to whatever else they had to throw in to take your mind off the fact that the writer must have quit at the start of the movie. The little dialogue was mostly of the charactors being rude to each other for no reason. This was horrible and I would not recommend this to anyone. Save your time and money.

Will work with some modifications."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for the money","review":"I did not want to place a rack on the tailgate of my new Ford Ranger, so I bought this rack. It was, at first, a little cumbersome to install in my small truck but it worked out fine.So far, I have not had more than two bikes in it, so I can't comment on carrying four. It has worked fine in the short distances I've driven with two bikes.If you want to carry bikes in the bed rather than on the back of your truck, this rack will do the trick.One additional note--I contacted the company several times to make sure it would fit in my truck. They weren't always sure but were very friendly and tried to be helpful (i.e., checking dimensions, etc.).I'm giving four stars because the rack is not that solid (again, good for the money). I believe something should only be five stars if it is perfect.Hope this helps."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like it, but...","review":"Like others have said, it works, but it's not spectacular. The concept is great and I really like the idea that the bikes are in the bed of the truck and not hanging off the back. When we bought ours, we didn't notice the line \\"does not fit step side.\\" Of course, we have a step side and it does fit, but you have to use the small pickup instructions (and yeah, they are weak). Our road bikes have a tendancy to shift during turns and the foam pieces don't fit snugly - probably due to our skinny tires, I would think mountain bikes would fit a little better.All in all, I like using it. A few bungee cords to secure the bikes to the rack and a couple more in the front to keep the wheels from turning make everything all right. We've also found moving the chain to the largest chain ring in the front and back keeps the derailleur from banging into the rack."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pickup Bike Rack","review":"Does a poor to fair job of holding Bikes upright.

I would not recommend buying this rack to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"doesn't do the job on it's own","review":"This bike rack fits great in the back of my small Ram 50. However, it is very flimsy and lacks quality. The rack holds 24\\" and 26\\" bikes fairly well but 20\\" BMX bikes don't fit in the slots very well. Using this bike rack alone will not securely hold your bikes in place. The foam pads are absolutely useless and always fall off. I need to use tie downs along with the racks to keep the bikes from falling over. Overall not a very good design.

Aside from use in my truck, it is also a good bike rack for storing our bicycles in the garage. My only complaint is that it will not hold the bikes up on its own in the truck bed.

The installation was harder than it had to be as the battery pack needs to be setup right on the back of the door. Once I got it in, it worked but to my dismay the controller only worked long distance INSIDE the house where the receiver was. Outside, the signal could not cut through my wood door unless I stood right next to the doorknob (where I would use a key).I also bought a Schlage keypad deadbolt and it rocks. This is the way to go.

After collecting the springs and individual tumblers off the ground I called Morning Industry again and let them know what happened. A couple weeks later I received new front and rear assemblies and the doorknob worked properly, for about 3 months. We only ever used the remotes till we went on a weekend trip and the in-laws stopped at house. When they went to unlock the door the tumbler again came out.

Of course, that is more realistic from my experience but with more stepfamilies every year we could use a positive message.

My 17 year old daughter and I watched this and kept saying, \\"Well, it would be nice if this is how things WERE....\\" In reality, I bet it is pretty rare for an ex-wife to have any kind of real relationship with the girlfriend/new wife.

Too bad, I really wanted to like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting Plot, but not much substance","review":"I usually read books in a few days...

I'd wait for this to show up in used book stores."},{"rating":"2","title":"J.V. Jones does it again","review":"I was very pleased with this new book by J.V. Jones. Once I got into the book, I spent a sleepless night trying to finish it! It is refreshing to see another great SF author appear on the scene, and if this book is any indication of future works, I see more sleepless nights ahead of me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"700 pages for a 300 page story","review":"J.V. Jones (like Robin Hobb) is incredibly skilled at writing detailed descriptions of setting, environment, and character.Unfortunately, there should be a limit for everything and this book just goes on and on about the main characters' efforts to rid the world of the Barbed Coil, a powerful magical device which the rather boring villain uses to create powerful monsters who decimate everyone they meet - until they come into contact with our heroes, whereupon they become extremely ineffective.At 300 pages, this probably could have been a crisp, entertaining read. At 700 it becomes a drag. Amazingly though, the author has to rush to tie all the threads together at the end and bring about a happy conclusion."},{"rating":"1","title":"SciFi for the artist","review":"I picked up this book as another Fun read, and i wasn't disapointed. The depth that Jones goes into with the background of illumination and the relevance with the story line had me reading into the backgroung of illuminations to see fow accurate Jones was. This was a great book for the fantasy entheusiast with an intrest in medieval and celtic art."},{"rating":"1","title":"sorry... but It just lacks something...","review":"...but I don't really know what...Well Jones' writes exellent, I won't argue that, and this book is also very well written, but even though it just lacks something.The barbed coil takes place in our world and a world very similar to ours, but which is more fantasy like, there is some cool rogue characters (which is my clear favorites!) and some great ideas, like magic, which is very strange and original.But it still lacks something, and I still doesn't know what...Sorry, but enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit disapointing","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed her earlier books (The Book Of Words series) but was very disapointed with this book. To be honest I found 'The Barbed Coil' quite boring. It didn't grab me like some of J.V Jones earlier work. The whole Idea of going to a parallel place from the present just didn't interest me. I still think J.V. Jones is a great writer but I would prefer it if she stuck to more realistic fantasy if there is such a thing. I look forward to her next book though."},{"rating":"2","title":"The book is great. The audio is awful.","review":"I really enjoy all of J.V. Jones novels, including this one. Her imagination truely is outstanding. However, I am writing this solely as a warning to those who are considering the purchase of the audio in the hope of hearing the story as it should be told. As I have a long commute, I also listen to audios. The audio of this book is abridged and thoroughly destroys the magic of the story, especially the relationship between Tessa and Ravis. Huge portions of the story are completely deleted, leaving one to wonder what is going on. (and thus having to read the book to find out) I would recommend an unabridged version if one exists. In this case, less is NOT more."},{"rating":"2","title":"J.V. Jones writes an interesting story","review":"This book took me a while but after reading it. I found out that it was well worth the time put into it. Tessa and Ravis make up very interesting characters in a tale about mystery and murder. Tessa from the future is pulled back into time to fulfill a density which is to free the barbed coil from its slavery under Izgard of Garizon. My only complaint about this book is the length. She could have cut out about 100 pages here or there and it would have held together even better. But I will definitely read The Book of Words series eventually when I get to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"First time read for me","review":"I noticed that quite a few people thought this book should be shorter. Not me. I think J.V. Jones did an excellent job at devoloping the charactors and the places. I really enjoyed this book. Definitly not a run of the mill fantasy novel. I truely enjoyed the realness of these charactors. You had the chance to get to know them. I liked the story, very unique. I liked how each charactor, even the bad ones, learned to develop their strengths. All and all I think this was a great read.

The restoration of these films is perfect, and for 1930s' programmers, they are surprisingly exciting, with fine production values.That said, Volume Two gives us the poorest MR.

Nasum's not the best band in the genre. Keep looking.

I am 35 years old and do not have a huge experience with action games. But this game did get me hooked in. It's relatively easy in the easiest mode and you can pretty much cruise along the phases until the end. There are a couple really odd creatures that take some time to figure out how to kill them (I looked it up in the web for lack of patience). The story line that stops the shooting and plays a little movie is a pain , but it's not too frequent). The monsters, guns and oponents are pretty unrealistic (future-like), but very creative. Whenever you die, you get back to the last check point that is normally not to far away. However there are a couple that you move back a while and have to repeat the same steps before getting onto whatever you were trying to kill before. This was a bit of a pain. Overall a GREAT GAME !!

Either rent this game or buy it from a brick and mortar store so you can return it easily should this problem happen to you.Do Not Buy this game online, you will be very annoyed when you have to go through the hassle of returning it.I assure you, I am not a crazy person. If you don't believe me, google the terms \\"Gears of war Disc read error\\" and you will find that many other gamers have had this happen to them.YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fanboys shut up already!","review":"Allow me to tell the TRUTH about this game and why Gears of War sucks. This game has horrible level design, every level looks exactly the same it just feels like your playing the same level over and over and what makes that worse is that all the enemies are lame and look exactly the same. Also Lame graphics that old in 3o seconds. Worst of all is the gameplay, grenades suck running sux walking sux cover sux and even getting out of cover sux. Also the stupid big dude you play takes up half the screen which is plainly dumb design. EVERYONE NEEDS TO STOP BEING SUCH FAN BOYS AND FOLLOWING EVERYONE ELSE. THIS GAME IN ALL HONESTLY IS JUST NOT FUN AT ALL, DO NOT BUY!!! there are plenty of other awesome 360 games and this is not one. If you want a similar duck and cover game get GHOST RECON ADVANCED WARFIGHTER. GRAW is much better game and one that actually has smooth cover gameplay. Ive beaten both gears and Graw. Graw is better. Soo get that, not gears of war. GEARS SUCKS!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth Buying","review":"I have a 360... I have an HDTV... but these graphics were aweful. Story line repeated and was very unimpressive. I was super eager for the game to come out and once i bought it I realized it wasnt worth it. It took me no time at all to beat and justg wasnt worth the money"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Deal","review":"This game should not be sold for $90. I bought mine at best buy for only 6$60. Do not get jipped on this deal, it will cost you thirty dollars extra. It is an extremely good game though. Probably the best on Xbox 360 right now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thought it was going to be good....Nope","review":"Let me list the reasons that this game sucks:1. No knife2. Grenade sucks -- You know why.3. Reload Sucks -- You know why.4. Run Sucks -- The screen gets blurry and you can't turn worth a darn.5. Level restart after every kill -- Split screen battles restart after every kill=dumb.6. You can only split screen -- no quad screen.7. Only 8 players at a time online8. Maps too small -- See 8 player online only.9. Guy takes up 1/2 the screen -- terrible10. Weapon selection sucks -- The guns it has are good but there aren't enough.I never played the campaign mode because my friend's 360 blew up before we got that far. I got a picture of it on my phone if you want to see it...Oh, you probably have on of your own, or two."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING!","review":"This game is amazing, everything about it. Graphically there is nothing that matches at this point."},{"rating":"2","title":"ADDICTIVE","review":"I bought this game 1 week ago. There is no other game like it in any way. Very creative, great gory graphics, good sound, sick characters and cool bosses. Online is so fun, fatality style kills. You really can't compare this with Halo 2. The only thing in common is that they're both shooters, thats it. Your crazy if you own a 360 and you don't buy this. I hope all games coming out for the 360 in the future will be half as good as this. Can't wait for Gears Of War 2."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is Xbox 360's killer app.","review":"People will buy the 360 just to play this game. Its simply that good. Not only has this game lived up to the hype, but it is arguable the first true next gen title we have seen on any console.An absolute must own for any gamer."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome","review":"To begin with, this game is not typically the type of game I play. Meaning that I dont like unrealistic games where the enemy is non human.I preordered this game and picked it up after work yesterday. I have to say that this is my favorite game on the xbox 360. The controls are easy after about 5 minutes.Graphics are simply the best I have seen. PERIOD.The gameplay is soo much fun. I mean with all the hype on how good the graphics were going to be, I was honestly scared that it would compromise the gameplay, but it didn't at all.I highly recommend this game for purchase. If not at least rent it. I cant wait for a sequel to come out and I havent even gotten a quarter through the game.Its awesome"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gow is freakin awesome, period","review":"This game is far from being overated just got the game last week when I got my 360. This game is what video games should be it's fun and the graphics are great the gameplay is smooth. The controls are easy and everything flows. I feel like i'm in a sci fi movie playing this game all the character are awesome. If you just got a 360 get this game you won't regret it. GOW rocks"},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost great","review":"For beauty, especially playing at 1080i on my HD tv via my 360 Elite HDMI, I was blown away by the superb visuals. Game play at first was harder than I expected (thought I could handle HARECORE (medium) level right out the gate, but I couldn't). unfortunately, even though there are a few 'choose which direction you go' moments, it's a very linear game for one person. And eventually you know the enemy is arriving when your gun symbol pops up on screen. I haven't tried LIVE or synced games, which probably make this game 5 stars. Definitely worth the hype."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just a Halo appetizer","review":"This game is awesome! Seems as if the creators were big fans of the terran campaign in StarCraft: Brood War. My first look at this game brought back the same feelings as seeing Mario 64 for the first time (in terms of graphics). Stunning!Gameplay is very engaging. Its unique style of duck and cover tactics sets it apart from the rest. A large part of this game is learning how to maneuver your character around your surroundings and finding proper cover. The controls can be a little frustrating at first, but they soon become second nature.THE game for anyone looking for a uniquely styled shooter or anyone that wants to show off the capabilities of their machine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gears delivers on the promise of next gen gameplay...","review":"The cover system (that has been attempted in other games but never very well) works great, the combat is fast paced and intense and the engine a joy to behold."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Game...","review":"simply put... This game is the only reason I bought the 360. Theres plenty of reviews here that provide analysis so I'll just keep this simple: Buy the game, you won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"First off im not a kid...","review":"i just dont have an amazon account. many reviews here are a lot more detailed then mine but let me get to the point. if you aren't offended by gore and language then BUY THIS GAME!!! Its really great. its a lot more realistic then asome actual war games in the fact that you cant stay out in the open or you'll die in like 10 seconds. you have to use cover. unless the enemy is thinning and you sometimes will get the opportunity to use the chainsaw melee attack which is great for saving ammo when possible. the story behind this game is also surprisingly interesting unlike many action/shooter titles.this game gets compared to halo a lot. to be completely honest with you the only reason this happens is because halo and halo 2 were xboxs most successful titles. gears of war and the halo series are two completely different games but gears of war definately has a better single player mode. as for online play, halo 2 and gears of war i say are tied in the fun factor.thats my opinion"},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh.","review":"Not terrible, but nothing compared to the hype. I guess every once in a while there has to be a game with a lot of hype. If you like Unreal, which I admittedly don't, then you'll probably like this more than I did. I wasn't particularly impressed."},{"rating":"1","title":"they ruined their own scores","review":"I had a lot of fun playing this game - I thought how great it was that there wasn't a \\"boss\\" in that you had to shoot 5billion times to kill (because it's so lame to do that). But then I came across RAAM and having to kill that guy and the game designers reverted. That's too bad, this was a 4-5 star game until then. But killing RAAM and the number of times you have to just shoot him over and over and over and over - ranks right up there with using a butter knife to chop down a giant redwood tree - sure you can do it over time, but in the end there's no fun or satisfaction, only the realization of the time you wasted just trying to shoot the same guy over and over. It's almost as though they had one set of game designers for everything but the 'Raam' level, then swapped out for idiots to design the Raam level."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best FPS Ever, Period!","review":"Yeah, that's right. You heard me. Best FPS ever. Better then any Halo, Rainbow Six, URT, or Halflife game. The graphics are even making the guys at PS3 nervous to catch up. The gameplay is rediculously fluid - evading, hiding, rolling, using the chainsaw, and aiming/shooting. Its not as realistic as, say, Rainbow Six Vegas, but its 100 times more fun... Online or solo. I have never had as much fun playing an FPS since URT2004 on the PC. The only game that has come close to how much fun the one player part is was Chroicles of Riddick. Buy this game or throw away your Xbox360! And if FPS' are what you are looking for also pick up Rainbow Six Vegas and Call of Duty 3 (or 2). Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GoW","review":"really easy to learn how to play, But still not easy to beat the game by your self. Great story can't wait for GOW2 or the movie"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gears of War Is Awesome","review":"I love this game and had to buy the other two to complete the set. I cannot get enough of the game and love the co-op so if anyone wants to try it, I say go for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fun, short life","review":"When you play this game for the first time, it's the kind that you can't put down. Great fun, indeed. But it runs a little short, and after you've played through the campaign a couple of times it gets old. Unfortunately multiplayer really lacks the depth to make it replayable as well. Only 4 on 4 play, and not a enough game modes puts a stake in multiplayers heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Own for All Shooter Fans","review":"This game is one of the best games available on the Xbox 360 and is worth every penny. I've owned this game for about a year now and still play it every once in awhile. I have beaten the game on all 3 difficulties (Casual, Hardcore and Insane) and they are all very fun and challenging. The graphics are great, sound is even better and the controls are easy to use and very fluid. Don't spend your money on other games if you don't own this one first!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy Gears of War","review":"There's a myriad of other great reviews for this game, but I thought I'd add my two cents. The only reason(s) not to own this game is if you're under the age of 13, you can't handle violence, you don't own an Xbox 360, your thumbs have been severed, or you're mentally retarded.The Graphics are fantastic. The Gameplay is fluid and phenominal. The Story Line is short but great, and for some reason replaying this game over and over again is like popping in your favorite movie; it never gets old. This game has redefined FPSs/3rd person shooters forever.If you have a 360, and you don't own this game, then you need to buy this game right now. Just stop what you're doing, and buy it. Without a doubt, and I don't say this lightly, this game is by far one of the top 5 action games ever. It's an instant classic. It's right up there with games like Call of Duty, Halo, Metal Gear Solid, and even good ol' Contra."},{"rating":"1","title":"SUCKS......REALLY","review":"THIS GAME I HAVE PLAYED MANY TIMES OVER AT MY BUDDIES.HERES WHATS GOOD--> GRAPHICSHERES WHAT SUCKS--->STORY,CONTROLS,WEAPONRY (IF YOU WANT REAL WEAPONS PLAY RESISTANCE: FALL OF MAN), ENEMIES (PRETTY MUCH ALL THE SAME), CHARACTERES ARE ANNOYING AND STIFF MOVING, SHORT CAMPAIGN, TEAM MATES ALWAYS DYING, AND ANTI-CLIMATIC ENDING.REALLY THIS IS JUST A SYNOPSIS BUT THIS GAME IS NOT WORTH $60."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs more difficulty levels...","review":"Everyone has different skills at video games. I am not very good. I found it too difficult and therefore more frustrating than fun. It would have been fun for me if it had two lower difficulty levels: easy and very easy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Game","review":"This game is a must own for any person who has an xbox 360. I dont recommend this game for kids under 13. It is fun but it is also very gory at the same time. The story line is pretty good but maybe they could have made it 1 or 2 more acts longer than it is. The online play is very good but i was shocked to see no Capture the flag type games or Free for all types either. All and all i spend most of my time playing online with this game. I liked how you have a chainsaw on the end of your gun and chop locust in half. The graphics are the best ive seen in a game so far on the 360. It may sound unbeleiveable and some people will still fight this but Gears of War is better than HALO 2!! Well in my eyes and many other peoples eyes it is. So here is how i rank it in certain areas:Gameplay:5/5Controls:4/5Xbox Live:5/5Graphics:100/5"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best game on this system so far...","review":"This game is the best the Xbox360 has to offer right now. Forget about Halo 3. Forget about Bioshock. This is a must have. This game is the only reason why I got a 360."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome but too short for Single Players","review":"I made the mistake of buying this new, it's way too short for single player only people and is not worth $60, rental or $35 max.The graphics are great, but over hyped in my opinion, I feel sorry for console only people, for less than the cost of a 360 and this game I can get a lower high end graphics card($150) with as good or better graphics and better controls on an already owned PC, not to mention an LCD screen for true HD. HL2 is a 3+ year old PC game and has better graphics on a mid-range PC.This game was awesome to play though, controls are intuitive and it does have next-gen console graphics. The story is pretty typical and uninteresting. Like I said if you are a single player only don't buy this, rent it or buy it at $35, then it's recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good not Great","review":"really fun game but it has some hit detection issues, such as, the only way to get a head shot is with sniper rifle. It usually takes a clip and a half to kill someone from the assault rifle."},{"rating":"2","title":"can i marry it!!!!???","review":"lol. I got into the Gears of War craze LATE... but i luv this game so much. I'm grabbing Gears of War 2 the DAY it gets released.Story unfolds well. Game play is SWEET.

Although not too long, you will fully enjoy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Have for Shooter fans","review":"I bought this game back in January of '07 and when I got it I couldn't put it down. This game is an amazing action game from start to finish. It really does deserve all the praise it got and should be considered one of the best games for the Xbox 360 of 2006. The campaign is a very fun and exciting, and not to mention at times just plain intense. Sure, the game has amazing graphics, but what really shines about Gears is the gameplay, it's just plain fun to go around and shoot up the Locust hoard. The Multiplayer is extremely fun and engaging, and I play it still today almost a year later. If I had any complaint, it would that the story wasn't that deep, but it isn't that big of a deal when you've got your hands full shooting up aliens and taking your friends online. All in all Gears of War is great fun. My recommendation, go buy this game. It's on my FAV games list and I hope you enjoy this really fun game. (I am rocklover_61's son for all of you who wanted to know)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game","review":"The best graphics on 360 hands down. Game play is very good on campaign and live. The only down side is the story is weak (I did'nt play it for the story) and sometimes you get stuck around cover. They have worked out some of these bugs online. This is a very realistic game, much more then Halo. Buy it you will like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"FUN!","review":"Gears of War is just so fun to play. There is lots of action in this game. I think it is one of the best games for the Xbox 360 so far and it's also one of the best third person shooters out there. The game is so intense and it feels like you are in the battle. If you have liked playing halo you'll love Gears of War."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOW","review":"Come on folks, if you dont have this game yet- get it. You would probably be best served to go to your local gamestore and get a good quality used copy. You'll save yourself about 10-15 bucks. The graffix, gameplay, and everything is Top Notch. Unless you dont like shooter games, this is a must have.Bottomline, this is probably in my Top 15 games of all-time list. Thats a lot of games, so rest assured it will likely make your list as well. Trust the Good reviews in front of you right now."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of The Best","review":"I think this is one of the best games out for this system. Story is top notch and shooting under cover in 3rd person is unique experience for this 1st person shooter lover. The graphics on this game even though the game is old now are still great eye candy. I have owned this game seance it first came out and still play it. I don't much care for the online so I cant say anything about that but the single player is worth the look for xbox360 owners. A must have for shooting game lovers that like to chainsaw others!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"I wasn't really a big fan of FPS's but after playing gears of war, that changed.

I was also disappointed that it doesn't have matchmaking for online multiplayer like Halo 2 has.It's fun but I get bored with it faster than some other games."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lets talk about the physics of the game","review":"I only want to comment on the part of this game that makes it feel great to me regardless of all of the other good or bad things about it... The physics. While playing Gears of War, the speed, weight, and motion of all of the characters has a very real feel to them. There is no floating around like in many shooters. While running, mounting/mantling a wall, or in melee, everything has impact. Every time I pick it up, this is what really pulls me into the experience. Yeah, the graphics are good, the multiplayer is intense, and single player is short (but fun), but none of it would work the way it does without the physics. Intense!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Game!","review":"I waited all year for the release of GOW and i must say im not disapointed, the single player campaign is for lack of a better term...Intense. The game is somewhat short roughly 8-10 hours depending on what level you play, i started on the middle one cause it wont let you do intense till you beat it once. The graphics are jaw dropping, its the best shooter ive seen so far. The enemy AI is great, they will try to flank you and even fall back when you flank them. After you beat the game theres plaenty to jump into with multiplayer, but has a drawback of only being able to play 4 on 4, hopefully they expand it though later. Other than it being a little short and only 4 on 4 online, this is one of the best games ive played in a while and a definate must own, for the 360."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reviews gave me high expectations... :(","review":"I heard so much about this game but I don't see what people like in it. There might be some nice pre-game videos but the game play is slow and repetitive. You're this slow moving character that mows down ghastly creatures with your never-ending-ammo machine gun. That's it folks. It's a remake of the old computer game Doom. But some people will pay $60 for that. It's all about taste.The online game play is just as slow.And what's up with you being able to revive your teammates but they can't revive you?Ian"},{"rating":"1","title":"Borrriiiiiiinnnnggggggggg!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Sucks B@[[$ !!!!!!

Sure, the game was okay. I did enjoy the Co-op. But the gameplay and multiplayer doesn't even match the capacity of Resistance fall of man. 40 players vs 8 players online? Come on that's weak. I personally just finish the game and was in line friday getting my PS3.Gears of War is too short. If you don't duck and cover you die pretty quick. That's just weak for a FPS.

The gameplay and controls are solid. The co-op is this game's bread and butter and if you buy it you better have a buddy cause that's how this game was meant to be played. It's excellent with co-op, however, if you play the single player you're taking away some of the magic from this game and your A.I. counterpart will sometimes do stupid things (like not dodge a berserker....EVER) that will make you have to go and save him a lot.Just don't play this game single player is all I ask. You won't be doing it justice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasnt that great...","review":"Rented it from blockbuster, the campaign was pretty cool. The graphics were great. Shooting the stuff up was fun, and kiting around the berserkers was awesome.The multiplayer SUCKS in my opinion. I like telling who to kill and who not to kill, your allies have no icon over their heads. I constantly mistaked enemies from allies. I couldnt take 2 steps without getting sniped. You cant have an all-out slaughter because you cant have alot of people in your game. I like games that allow 16-24 people in 1 match to have a pretty good fight there much better. I can understand why someone would like the multiplayer, it just didnt suit me. Overall though, the game on campaign was pretty awesome."},{"rating":"2","title":"overrated.","review":"fun yeah but over rated.

The other five were excellent, and that's partly why this product is such a let-down. The candied orange peel has a texture like paraffin wax. As well, only on occasion did I actually taste a little bit of orange, and the unpleasant waxy texture kept me from being able to enjoy the chocolate.This is in complete contrast to the dark chocolate with fresh ginger bar, which is absolutely delicious; and their dark with cinnamon is also wonderful.For the most part I prefer Dolfin to Café Tasse, but the latter's orange-chocolate combination is superior by far.Café Tasse Noir Orange - Orange Belgian Dark Chocolate Bar - 54% CacaoDolfin, please rework this chocolate bar to meet your customarily high standards."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring.","review":"One guy with a digital synth and no sense of dynamic range makes for very tiring listening. These re-creations sound very different from the originals. Plus, the beauty of TV themes is that they make their point in under a minute--repeating the same music over and over to pad them out to over 2 minutes each just makes me want to scream \\"ENOUGH!\\" and lunge for the track skip button.10 tracks, each with about 40 seconds worth of music, but padded out to 23 minutes total.

It's timeless. The timing of his variation of tone, the way he can say something completely ridiculous but somehow true, the way he can make you laugh simply by pausing after a build-up, and most uniquely to Cosby his clean, intelligent yet plainspoken style, are all here in this album and do not disappoint."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Bill Cosby","review":"As he said about I-Spy, \\"It's a hit - He doesn't complicate things\\".

Half of the time the PS2 doesn't even recognize it as a NTSC disc. If you do manage to get it to boot up, you're still not out of the woods. If you try reading saves off of the CD, it will lock up. The supplied codes don't even work for some of the games! Adding new codes is a pain, the USB interface sometimes locks it up as well! The support site where you find new codes is worthless, as there are several game that have no codes. Buy a codebreaker, or an AR MAX instead!"},{"rating":"1","title":"don't waste your money","review":"i baught this gameshark and it will not load 90% of the time on an older ps2 system, now i don't know if it will work on the slim ones. but as far as the older fat versions don't waste your money on it. get the older version gameshark with that system."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good","review":"everyone says these things suck, but i had a gameshark for the n64, dreamcast, i had several different gameshark versions for the psone including the very first shark and i had about 3 differnt version gamesharks for the ps2 (and i currently have the newest version which i bought at best buy new for 20.99) and i havent had a single problem with any of them, they work fine, inputting the codes in the things is the sucky part but other than that they work very well. the only reason i can think of why they dont work for some people is because either they dropped them, they took it out while the playstation was on or adding codes or they used a version of the gameshark that is not compatiable with that particular system. as long as you dont do any of the following you shouldn't have a problem with them."},{"rating":"1","title":"gameshark","review":"i never got my order. my rating would be much better if i just got my order. its been almost 2 months since i ordered it"},{"rating":"1","title":"trouble","review":"i bought this product twice from various sources and had the same problem each time, my playstation 2 which is the scaled down version, (the newest one) wouldn't even pick up the disc. it picked up games and movies no problem, but this disc it would not, no idea if anyone else had this problem."}]`),C={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:D},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:O,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},M={class:"card-container"},N=["disabled"],B={key:0},x={key:1};function R(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=y("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your SNAP 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",M,[(a(!0),i(w,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",x,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",B,"See more"))],8,N)):b("",!0)])}const H=d(C,[["render",R],["__scopeId","data-v-21566042"]]),L=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotes/56.md","filePath":"quotes/56.md"}'),W={name:"quotes/56.md"},P=Object.assign(W,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(H)]))}});export{L as __pageData,P as default};
