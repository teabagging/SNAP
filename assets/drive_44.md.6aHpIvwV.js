In fact I'm embarrased to play any of their music!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to the guitar solos?","review":"This album is rather crappy. My main problem with the album is the severe shortage of guitar solos. Secondly, Tuomas's writing has apparently gone to crap (Wish I Had An Angel is the WORST song I've ever heard). Thirdly, Marco's vocals suck and have gotten worse since Century Child. Other than having an annoying voice, he can't seem to sing in key. I didn't think anything could suck as much as his vocals on Phantom Of The Opera from Century Child, but his vocals on Wish I Had An Angel manage to take the cake. The bottom line is that Wishmaster was a masterpiece, and this band has gone downhill ever since that album. Century Child was still ok, but Once is utter crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"CRAPPIEST ALBUM THIS YEAR!","review":"This is the crappiest album I have heard this year. What beutiful vocals I ask? What beutiful ballads? Yer right. I give this a thumbs down. The review system is being totally abused, as I belive a lot of these '5' reviews are coming from the same people. Nightwish are the worst Metal band thats come out in over decade. Period."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please","review":"I don't know what the reviewers are carrying on about here. It's Evanescence-type dreck with an orchestra. Silly people creating really silly music."},{"rating":"1","title":"nightwish are worst than herpes","review":"this album is so bad it makes me want to kick my mum in the face. i hate it. nightwish are the worst band ever. i don't really understand what the other guy was thinking, this is bad plus eight. all the members love gladiator and the lead singer's favourite actor is russel crowe. every song is bad times eight. i hate it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a stupid band","review":"First track, bum, bum, bum. bum, yip! yip! yip!.

Buy this at your peril!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"More excellent music from the operatic metal masters","review":"It is funny to read all the 1 star reviews for this album... as I do think it is the same person (probably a teenager) writing over and over. Anyway, I am in my mid-thirties and I can honestly say that this is quality melodic, operatic metal. If you liked previous nightwish releases, I guarantee you will like this one. I think it is slightly better than Century Child, but not as good as my favourite, Wishmaster. So, please, if you do not like this style of music, don't bother writing negative 1 star reviews for it, what's the point!?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterpiece","review":"This band is where opera and classical meets up with metal..It doesn't seem right together, right?? WRONG! I have to say this album is amazing, and I love how these 3 different genres mix so strongly. I have their other albums, but this tops them all. \\"Planet Hell\\" and \\"Nemo\\" have to be their best songs ever to be released because they show just how these genres mix so well. They, along with their other songs were composed so well and thats why I love this album as well as the band. 5."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just when you thought they couldn't top Century Child...","review":"I'll get right to the point. When the London Philharmonic Orchestra joins forces with Nightwish, you get this masterpiece. \\"Dark Chest Of Wonders\\" opens the album with powerful riffs, which then merges with Tuomas' masterful keyboard playing, creating an incredible out-of-this-world experience. \\"Planet Hell\\". BEST.DRUM.INTRO.EVER! \\"Creek Mary's Blood\\" is a touching song about the hardships of the Native Americans. I have to keep myself from crying every time I hear it. It's the kind of metal that is beautiful, not just heavy. \\"The Siren\\". Wow. I haven't heard anything this original since \\"B.Y.O.B.\\" by System Of A Down. In my opinion \\"Ghost Love Score\\" is the best song on the whole album. The orchestra is used to full efficiency and Emppu's guitars provide the perfect mix to make it heavy.In short, 5, 10, or even 100 stars are not enough to do this album justice. It is completely worth every penny!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This person is \\"utter crap\\"","review":"Hey, I wonder if this guy has anything better to do...

Get a life will you!! Write lame reviews for Clay Aiken or something.Nightwish's Once is a great album! (IMHO)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great skill in every note...","review":"It is really hard for any review to do this band justice. Every song in this CD, from Dark Chest of Wonders to Live to Tell the Tale, is the result of many years of work and skill. Each member, all famous artists in their own right, worked together to create a wonderful, heart beating opera for the dark, cold, side of the human soul. Yet while it has great depth it also seems to have an uplifting effect on my mind and body. The amount of energy, time, and experience that has been poured into this CD shows with every word, every sound, every emotion.

Great vocals, and melodic guitar licks."},{"rating":"2","title":"This album is really fantastic","review":"This album contains some of the best music I've ever heard(not only in metal music, but in general).

Some of the tracks sound absolutely awful. I am surprised this album has so many good reviews. It does nothing for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gets boring quickly","review":"I too am disappointed with this record. I liked the first listen, but then I quickly started skipping tracks and now I don't play it at all because it's boring. There's too much overlapping in it, one minutes it's metal, next minute it's poppy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"Well its just simply an amazing CD. . . I love the band Nightwish and probably my favorite song on there is I Wish I had an Angel"},{"rating":"1","title":"Symphonic Boredom","review":"Why so many reviews? a rave review seems to be followed by a crap one over and over again. Everyone to their own, but there is definately some massive differences of opinion on this album. To some it is simply fantastic or trash. I'll go down the middle, It isn't as good as some people are making out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Months later, I am still listening to this constantly...","review":"I bought this CD several months ago and I am still listening to the songs frequently (as in several times a day).This is a symphonic metal band with a female fronted voice. The songs range from fast and heavy, like \\"Wish I Had An Angel,\\" to the lighter and melodic, \\"Nemo.\\" Later in the cd is a song, \\"Ghost Love Score,\\" which is very epic and somewhat soundtrack-ish sounding and also very beautiful.This song has elements that will make you think of high fantasy and mythology. It's the kind of cd that makes you think of stories like the Silmarillion or Lord of the Rings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing mind blowing","review":"Some of the reviews on this record are strange because this album is no way a 5 star album. In saying that it isn't a 1 star either. 2 Stars is the best I can give this. There have been a few reviews saying that nightwish are unoriginal and I agree with these reviews. It is impossible to put out much music nowadays without it being associated with something thats been done before. Nightwish are no exception. There music was done 20 years ago. Some reviews have attacked the singer. This isn't the best I've heard, but not the worst either, so again 2 stars. If you are into neo-classical opera type rock then you will probably like this. But no way is this as gooda album as some people are making out here, and to be frank I found a few tracks on this album annoying to listen to. Infact some of the tracks with their symphonic overtures, sounded plainly stupid."},{"rating":"1","title":"I agree- 2/12 stars","review":"Wow- wierd- Look at the review below- I feel the same way. One or Two good Songs-thats it. Her voice gets annoying after a while- almost to the point where you'd like to hear someone beat her to a bloody pulp in the middle of a song- just for the listeners amusement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cannot get into this at all","review":"The musicianship is different, but I just cannot get into this at all. Sometimes these bands can just go to far with the Opera influence and the music starts to sound fascicle.

Why don't you bozos do a web search on symphonic rock?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissappointing","review":"I cannot agree with any of these reviews. This album is stupid. There has never been much talent from Finland over the years apart from perhap Stratovariuos. But this band ain't as good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Re: previous review","review":"I am dumbfounded by the comment \\"lyrics are often left to the interpretation of the listener so if you don't get, make up something.\\" Is this why Metalicca has been so successful over the past 25 years? Lyrics need to have a meaning that makes a song. If you are only going for Nightwish because of their rythms then I am sorry to dissappoint you but their music is NOT original. It the same old story, a band releases a song over decade before and then a new band steals it and then re-sells it to the next generation that's none the wiser."},{"rating":"1","title":"A proper review of the tracks with some changes","review":"1.

I hate to say I hate the album it makes me sad.Their levels all wrong. Turning the keyboards down was horrible. Then turning the guitars up and simplifying them. While they were at it they also made the drums dissapear. I dislike Marcos vocals. I hope they go back the direction they came from before this album.It seems like some big producer walked up to the band made them mainstream their amazing music. I hope this isnt the end of the old nightwish."},{"rating":"2","title":"New to NIGHTWISH","review":"I first heard the song \\"Wish I had an Angel\\" in the movie \\"Alone in the Dark\\" with Christian Slater, and I bought this CD, this was my first cd of their's, and I fell in love with it, their sound is extremely remarkable. I was kind of shocked when I heard thru the grapevine that Tarja was fired, because she has a different, and unique sound all her own, and the music just worked with her voice. Annette is awesome, but Tarja is her own, and she own's it. In this cd \\"Ghost Love Score\\", and the rest of the music on this cd has a unique Native American sound to it, and you can really appreciate it. This is one of their greatest accomplishments. Next to \\"Century Child\\" in which Tarja put's her own gothic spin to \\"Phantom of the Opera\\", well done..."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Goriest film since The Evil Dead","review":"It starts out as a kind of typical horror movie with its funny gore effects and hopeless acting, but then it becomes a zombie slasher fest with some of the goriest effects people have ever seen.

If you expect a comedy with so-so special effects, you will love it. Granted, it does have its comedic moments like the arate priest or the persistent headless nurse, but it also has waaayyy too stupid ideas to make it even a decent movie (like the kid that is conceived and delivered by the zombie nurse and priest in a matter of hours or the zombie digestive tract).To me, it was a major dissapointment. I like Lucio Fulci's movies and the Evil Dead movies, but other than the ridiculous gore in this one, it cannot be catalogued as a horror film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lookin' for a decent zombie flick?","review":"Lookin' for a decent zombie flick?

Unfortunately though, the DVD mastering process went horribly wrong. While the quality is actually very good, especially for a 1993 movie, you can basically only touch the remote to start playing but you better not do anything afterwards because the DVD will go out of sync, and will not restore to normal playback. If you skip ahead to a scene, you will only hear some stuttering audio but video will not come up. All the other 83 dvds I own do not expose this problem so it's definately not my player. Wait for a re-release !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Film, Bad DVD","review":"PLEASE NOTE -- This two-star review applies ONLY to this particular DVD edition, not to the film itself, which I'd definitely give at least four stars.\\"Dead Alive\\" is a very clever horror/comedy that's a must-have for any Peter Jackson fan. Don't expect it to be scary. It's not, just riotously disgusting. In fact, \\"Dead Alive\\" is probably better described as a gross-out comedy than a horror film, having far more in common with \\"There's Something About Mary\\" than \\"Hellraiser.\\"Unfortunately, this DVD is very disappointing. It's basically just an ordinary-quality VHS edition burned onto a DVD. The image is grainy and the sound quality poor; the film is only presented in full-screen format, and there are no worthwhile special features. No director's commentary, no \\"making-of\\" featurettes, no nuthin'.Peter Jackson is famous enough now that a \\"Special Edition\\" DVD of this film, one of his earliest, has got to be coming out soon enough.

A young man, that is a \\"momma's boy\\", realizes his mother has been bitten by a Zombie monkey that causes her to want to feed on human flesh.

I had heard a lot about this being disgusting, bloody, comedic, etc. but I had no idea it was this extreme! As for the gore it is highly unoffensive. However, if you like extremely graphic and close-up realistic shots of violence as much as I do, you will find paradise with this movie. The plot? It concerns a grown man named Lionel who lives with this demanding mother. After she gets bitten by a Sumatran Rat Monkey, she becomes infected and dies. However, she comes back to life as a zombie and eats neighbors, friends and dogs. It is then up to Lionel to destroy the zombie population.P.S.If anybody explains to you about how romantic the lead characters' relationships are then don't listen to them.

By the time I actually opened my eyes and WATCHED the movie (months later) I found it was indeed one of the funniest things I have ever seen! The humour is witty (\\"Your mother ate my dog!\\" \\"Not all of it!\\") and the effects are very realistic. I THINK that this movie is actually on record as having more blood than any other film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dead Alive is gory, funny, disgusting, and great","review":"This is one of the goriest movies i have ever seen if not the goriest and it is awesome. It is also funny with scenes like the baby zombie, the priest fighting the zombies, etc. The last half hour is wall to wall gore with no backing down on being disgusting and it has so many classic scenes like when Lionel massacres a whole group of zombies with a lawnmower. It wuz also made in New Zealand by director Peter Jackson who also directed one of my other favorite gory cult movies called Bad Taste. This movie rulz BUT MAKE SURE U BUY THE UNRATED VERSION NOT THE RATED R VERSION CUZ THEY CUT OUT TO MUCH GORE AND THE R VERSION COMPLETELY SUX."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wish Peter Jackson Would Return To This Genre","review":"This is one of the most violent,brutal,excruciating, and gory films I have ever beheld.And did I mention that it is funny, metaphorical, and downright insane. If you are a Peter Jackson connoisseur you can immediately detect his scope and DNA on this film.In my opinion, the reason why this movie works on myriad levels is because of it's innocence and it's atmosphere which is almost trance-like. This is truly one of a kind film made by the greatest director of our time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning - Blu-Ray version has terrible picture quality","review":"Yes, this is a great movie. It's full of gore and laughs, as others have noted.However, I have never seen such a flawed transfer. It looks like someone ran the film elements across a carpet which had not been vacuumed for ten years. It is the most speckly and dirty Blu-Ray I have in my entire collection (about 500). Every single frame has hundreds of specks, which are very annoying. If you have a small TV screen, you may not notice the specks. But if you watch your movies through a projector (like I do), then the specks will drive you mad. Lionsgate, how about a remastered version to match the fantastic picture quality on Heavenly Creatures?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good","review":"I had heard good things about this cult favorite and I wanted to see it because of its popularity. But, like any film (especially cult favorites), you are either going to love it or not. I happen to be one that does not love it.Yes, there is gore and lots of it. You would think all of the gore might make the film good since it may enhance the other aspects of the film. But the other aspects of the film were simply complete nonsense and chaos with nothing else. Humor was intended but lacking. It could have even been better if it was actually disturbing. Without a mere semblance of reality though, disturbing can not even be used to describe the film.I gave 2 stars as a rating because I do not think this film is the worst zombie flick ever, but I do think the potential it had was left uncovered."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst horror-comedies","review":"You could do a lot better than Dead Alive. I can't believe more people like this film than other good splatter zombie horror-comedies like Re-Animator and The Return of the Living Dead. Dead Alive has very little wit. It wasn't that funny, either. Especially the conclusion. I didn't have a problem with the gore. In fact, I sat through most of the film without a single problem but I couldn't stand the fact that this movie wasn't funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barely Breathing","review":"The title of this movie should be changed to Dead because there is nothing lively about it. Yes, the movie is without a doubt the goriest movie of all time, but the compliments for this film stop there. The acting was pitiful and the story lacked a real \\"bite\\". The mere attempt at humor in this film was incredibly cheesy. I mean c'mon, a priest doing karate or \\"divine intervention\\" was how it was put, zombie's organs coming to life and attacking people, zombies having sex and then giving birth in a matter of 5 minutes actual time, and not to mention, a baby zombie that at birth can walk around and giggle. I watched this film expecting a solid zombie flick but got stiffed. This movie is an embarrassment of a zombie film and furthermore an embarrassment to the horror genre. Gore alone could not save this movie.

However I would reccomend procuring a copy of the original NZ release entitled Braindead. The fact is I have both a VHS of Braindead and the so called uncut DVD Dead Alive. Yet the DVD is not only cut, but sceenes re-edited with terrible ill effect on the film.Braindead is the version you want, it helps make the film more coherent, as well as keep things more lively. Some of the jokes which seemed lacking were due to the sceen juxtaposition in the DVD and worse yet the R rated version.I got my copy of Braindead from Blacketst heart which has unfortunately gone under. The only way I know of to get this title is to order overseas from NZ or get the Japanese laserdisc.Warning - don't be fooled by the unrated terminology so blatantly stamped on the DVD - it is edited, and it irks me to no end!"},{"rating":"2","title":"b flick movie","review":"one of my favorite b flick movies ever. if you haven't seen this one, you need to. hilarious scenes. all I have to say is a priest doing about 20 high kicks in a row saying 'I kick a** for the lord' is enough for me to watch this over and over."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this movie, but...","review":"This DVD is the Edited version... cut from 97 to 85 minutes to get the R rating...

More a comedy than a horror, this film is easily one of the most enjoyable zombie films that I have ever seen.So if you find yourself up at some ungodly hour and you are rather bored, then pop this in and make sure you are secluded so as not to disturb any people that may be sleeping, with your hysterical laughter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best goready of all time","review":"If you love blood, guts and gore you will love this dark humored horror film.

The basic jist is poor Lionel has a domineering mother, who he genuinely loves. However, when his mother catches him going out with a lovely Latino girl, she is bitten by a monkey and massive amounts of mayhem ensues, including great scenes with a kung-fu priest, an embalming gone bad, and a lovely scene with a lawn-mower.

(Something I have done only 1 or 2 other times out of thousands of movies...) It is neither funny nor scary.

Yeah there's lots of fake looking blood and gore. Big f-ing deal. Noteworthy, only for being an early Peter Jackson movie. On the plus side, I kind of liked the cheesy stop motion action with the Rat Monkey and the end sequence with the giant Mom zombie.

That movie sucks and i'm polite! I like gore and horror movies but there is limits (and i never tought there was before i've seen that movie) This is just too much!! I think the goal for the creators of the film was to put more discusting things possible!! The first 30 minutes, it was funny but after an hour i was already bored! That film has nothing scary! This is just discusting! But...if you really want to see the movie...dont eat in the same time!!

If you get a thrill out of seeing body parts flying all over the place, with tons of reddish-pink paint, go for it.

A truly fun horror-flick... not SERIOUS horror, more splatstick.

This movie started out more like a love story than a horror flick, then it eventually got interesting, had some good spots and then it went over the top ridiculous. I love good shock value and gore as long as it is looks realistic, blood should not look like water with red dye shooting everywhere. It took away from the realism and feel of the film and basically made a joke out of it. If you like the concept of cartoon horror i.e. Evil Dead II you're in luck, this is a 5 star movie. If you prefer a good story, along with good acting, and realistic effects that make you feel part of the movie, this is not for you. Keep looking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extreme gore doesn't make a funny movie","review":"Dead Alive is nowhere near the ranks of being the funniest horror-comedy because it falls due to its own graphic and bloody violence. The only inventive scene in the movie was when the priest started fighting the zombies. Other horror-comedies such as Army of Darkness are good because of a lovable hero, a silly plot, and villains that are just as stupid as the hero. Watch Army of Darkness instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"GORE GALORE but.....STUPID!!!","review":"Everyone talks about the gore, blood and guts. SO WHAT!

Pick it up! I bought this unsure of what to expect as I knew this wasn't going to turn out looking like Transformers 3 or something. Its an old movie and kind of obscure so you can't expect the best transfer. With a side by side comparison of the DVD it DOES look better, just don't expect to be wowed.

My son loves watching big earth moving equipment and out of an entire 1-hour DVD there was maybe 15 minutes of good scenes. Part one was kind of bizarre. Most of the 1/2 hour was spent on Glacier National Park ,some obscure circus in Wisconsin and a toy train. And a large portion of scenes with machines were mostly old footage of antique tractors. I also did not like the video quality. Most of it consisted of 1 second clips strung together. Part 2 was better but still not what I was hoping for."},{"rating":"1","title":"If your child likes the \\"I Love Toy Train\\" videos....","review":"This may be the DVD for you. It was created and follows the same format as the popular I Love Toy Train series. However, I find the footage on these dvd's less stimulating than the train series. Most of it appears very old and certainly wasn't recorded or produced for the digital format. It also lacks any technical explanation of the vehicles. I would recommend the Real Wheels (There goes a Bulldozer, There goes a Monster Truck/Firetruck/Tank etc.) series. In addition, I Dig Dirt is also a good find (and much cheaper than this one)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tell Me Something Pretty","review":"I just began reading \\"Tell Me Something Pretty\\" but I doubt I'll be able to finish it.

I bought it both for the Sony brand name and the VCR+ feature. I wanted to use it mainly to play old tapes and time shift tv shows (and buzz through the ads), and maybe watch the occasional rented dvd. The vcr playback is crummy--through a glass darkly and fuzzily. The picture quality in the one dvd I played was okay but not wonderful. It's not even tall enough to use as a footstool.

It has since broken less than 8 months from the original purchase date and I barely used it.I would suggest that money spent elsewhere on practically any other manufacturer would be better spent.The sad part is I love Sony and have a television and digital camera which they manufacture and I love them!

The warranty is good for 90 days and after that I have to pay for both shipping the item and the return and labor, the warranty only covers the parts. My problem? the VHS works; the DVD sound comes and goes. The cost of what SONY wants me to do is almost what I paid for this piece of junk. After I said NO, they offered me a refurbished one for $35!. How many have they gotten back?!! No thank you. It is just sad to see how a good company is riding on its good name and no longer cares what product it offers its FAITHFULL customers.

Instead it gives a better idea of what an MVC architecture or a HTTP protocol or what the end user sees or about the Model part of MVC.Doesn't the author understand that when you are trying to learn struts, the reader probably (about 90% of the readers) has prior knowledge of all these things.

I heard a few good things about this book, so I bought it rather excitedly -- after all, it's the newest book, so it ought to be the most complete, right?I found this book *seriously* lacking. Its example applications are trivial and its explanation of anything Struts is almost completely superficial. As an example, the book claims to cover Struts 1.1 but didn't mention Map-backed ActionForms at all -- and hardly mentioned DynaForms, other than showing one simple example.In summary, the writing style is quite good, the introductory material fair, but the detailed coverage is abysmal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Many bugs, not helpful, book abandoned by authors","review":"This was the first book that I bought in order to learn Struts. I found that the text was generally unhelpful as it was written from the point of view of Struts 1.0x, whereas 1.1 invalidates much of what the authors talk about (you might as well rip out the chapter about validation and throw it away, because NOTHING in there is valid), assuming it wasn't bug-ridden anyway.The supporting website hasn't been updated since May, 2003, and the links to updated files are all dead (the chapter 3 hello program on the CD doesn't work, so you're SOL now).The ONLY saving grace is the CD.I suggest you look elsewhere for an introductory book; this book seems to be hacked out quickly to capitalize on the Struts phenomenon and just as quickly abandoned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disorganized junk","review":"Completely useless as a reference book.

There's a companion CDROM that has all the source on it, but it is also poorly documented. I can't figure it out.I went to the web site for the book and it's horribly out of date.

With limited time, I had to rely on the local book store. Not a good idea since this book was the only available book. I should have ordered online and waited.The lack of detail is truly amazing. Use this tool, but don't describe the steps needed to compile the java created by the tool. Use this tool to create the JSP, but what if you don't have that tool and are limited to the tools you can use?Since the tool generated code is required before compiling the included source code - that is a glaring omission. While the use of ant may be expected of many java programmers - setting up ant to complete the examples is not, especially given the complexity of the resulting xml file.Disappointed would be a polite way of describing my reaction"},{"rating":"1","title":"Guessing with struts","review":"I'm totally surprised at the good reviews this book has been given. I purchased it based on those reviews and now ... well. The book is wordy and lacks some basic get you started information you would expect from a book with a title containing the words \\"kick start.\\" The authors got it part right - it should read, \\"Start kicking.\\" The authors seem to be upholding a long-standing java tradition: make it complex and avoid fundamental procedural steps. For what its worth, when I'm learning something new - upfront - I need to take baby steps - confidence builds and learning is accelerated on and up. Chapter 3 dives directly into a \\"hello world\\" application without one single word in the entire book devoted to \\"Here is what you need to follow along boys and girls...\\" Not one line of \\"before we begin, do this and do that.\\" So if your looking for a good text on \\"guessing with struts\\" look no more.

I have read iher style here as being comparable to Henry James... no way. This novel is too short, too abrupt, and too lacking in the details needed to pull off decent character motivation, somethng I find vital to novels dealing with infidelity and love.The scenes read as disjuncted and they do not develop very well. If you want a short Cather novel that is better and want to avoid the commonplace Death Comes for the Archbishop, then try \\"My Mortal Enemy\\" This shows Cather off at the better end of her career."},{"rating":"2","title":"A breakthrough for a neglected child","review":"I could not be happier with this toy. My daughter is 2 and recently joined our family from an orphanage in Russia. The staff at her orphanage did the best they could with very little and the net result was neglect for my daughter until she came home to us. She did not play with toys at the beginning. She picked at the frayed carpet. It was incredibly sad to see a baby hope to amuse herself with frayed carpet because she had never had the benefit of a family's love and attention This 4 in 1 Ride On was the first real \`toy' that she became attached to. She loves the music from the steering wheel and she was able to master straddling the car and race it about the house. Now she zooms around and shrieks with delight as we chase her and applaud her efforts. You can't imagine our relief to see her breaking free from her early life of neglect. This toy is fun, accessible, stable, and tough. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not safe!","review":"My 11 month old son really liked to ride this car. But it's very unstable and tips easily to the side. He fell very hard to the side right in front of my eyes, it happened in a split second. He hit his head and face on the floor and got a big bump on his forehead and a bloody nose!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and a great learning to walk toy","review":"I agree with the other two people about the steering issues. There does need to be some way to lock the steering wheel when the car is being pushed from behind. I purchased this for my 10 month old grandson and he LOVES it. We push him in it all the time and it has never tipped over. I wouldn't go for long walks with it but we do laps around the pool, walk to the mailbox, and around the house. He loves the \\"electronics\\" that he can control himself. The whole neighborhood laughs when we walk to the mailbox and he's blowing his little horn! I think this is a great toy for what I have just described and I'm sure when he can walk and push it himself it will be even better. If you want something to push a child/baby in for long walks, then take your stroller or a wagon. I'm happy I bought it for him and would purchase it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"buy something else!","review":"This ride-on was a gift when my son was 12 months old. It is VERY unstable and not durable. The only feature my son was interested in was the removable dashboard which plays music and makes different sounds. If you're willing to spend extra money, I highly recommend the Radio Flyer sport coupe. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware of Tipping!!!","review":"This looks like a great push/ride toy, but it's so light and flimsy, it's more of a hazard. We bought this when my daughter was 9 months, thinking she'd grow into riding it, but it turns out, the best part of this toy is the controls that play songs and noises. First, the control \\"center\\" is not secure in the car - my daughter pulled it out and threw it across the room day one. Second, you can not push and guide the car, it's too light, and only steers from the front. Last - and most important - if your child is not stable DO NOT let them in the car alone ever - it will tip when they want to get out, causing them to get caught (it happened once, and she wasn't hurt thank god). Now that she is 16 months - she likes to push it around, and play the songs - but that's about it....I'd consider this an OK toy, but nothing great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleased, but not without faults","review":"Overall the toy is made very well. My 11 month old loves to ride on it. The rocker attachments aren't very useful; they don't rock enough for the baby to enjoy it. The child being able to turn the steering wheel isn't that big of a deal. The toy is capable of tipping, but she's only fallen out of it once. I think that would happen with any ride on toy though. It doesn't come with the seatbelts seen in some of the pictures. I almost didn't buy the toy because of all the negative reviews, but now I'm glad I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ride toy","review":"Overall this is a great toy. My 9 month old son loves sitting in it and playing with all the buttons. The rocker portion is ok, not the greatest rocking motion. We've had to tape the steering wheel portion down because he can easily remove it. Haven't had a chance to take him outside yet in it because the cold, but it appears to be fairly durable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous - this can and will tip over","review":"I bought this on a whim at a toy store without checking the reviews first - what a mistake! My little guy is nine months old and 21 lbs. and he was able to tip this over while he was riding in it. I was right by his side, but he tipped it away from me and was on the floor in the blink of an eye. It's also impossible for an adult to steer, as mentioned in the other reviews. I really liked the idea of it being 4-in-1 and having the bars on the side, but in my opinion it is not safe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsafe Product!!!","review":"This product is unstable and tips over quite easily. Our child leaned to one side while seated in it and the car completely tipped over smashing his head to the ground. Our child is within the age and weight range specified by the manufacturer.

The compositions are consistently outstanding and work as an overall piece. This is also the bands strongest lineup and as a result, was well up to the task of presenting this wonderful combination of instrumental jazz-rock with classically influenced music. The only low point is Van Leer's brief yodeling-like vocal. Fortunately, it is quite brief and does not spoil the piece. The live half of this two-for is almost as strong as the studio effort. The band plays brilliantly and with great energy and enthusiasm. Jan Akkerman was perhaps a bit rough but makes clear as to why he was held in such high regard. Terrific stuff, highly recommended....Simon"},{"rating":"2","title":"Focus CD's Re-Released","review":"\\"Hamburger Concerto\\" and \\"Focus 3\\" are two of my all-time favourite albums and I have had both of them on vinyl for many years.

Their ck7 is a better product for less money. I believe that it is a design problem. They may be too small for their own good. The should fit in the ear better based upon the angle that it is designed to fit into the ear. It seems that the neck out to be longer and come with a bigger sized ear gel or ear foam piece to ensure better sound isolation. When I tinker with them in the fitting, I can achieve a pretty good sound with better than adequate bass response that is pretty tight and precise, but it is so difficult to achieve the proper fit. I have noticed the same problem with the CK10.Because of these problems, I have not been willing to give their double or triple armiture earphones a try.

Delightfully written, spirited and worthwhile -- A must read if you're from Denver, Colorado."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timeless American Folk Hero for Children of All Ages","review":"Published as early as 1942, Paul Bunyan stories are just as much fun to read today as when our parents were children. Tall tales about a huge hero, with the good old American art of exageration that children find fascinating. Read aloud to young ones, let the olders read to themselves. A good book to get kids hooked on reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"some of the best songwriting in years","review":"The new CD by Chris Knight picturesque reminder of all that real country music is and was. Chris Knight's songs evoke images of americana others can't. From the wrong doing of \\"Framed\\" to the painfully good \\"William\\", the listener can hear Chris's smalltown rural up bringing in the words of every song. Some might consider Knight's songs to be a little dark, but some will see it as the cold hard truth. So I suggest you run out and get Chris Knight's self titled debut album right now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Real American Music...","review":"Buy this album and tell your friends. Powerful songwriting combined with a earthy country/rock beat. It's what Mellencamp never could be and what most of Nashville refuses to be. The comparisons to Earle, Springsteen, and the like are all good, but Knight stands apart. One can only hope that radio will pick up on this guy, and a label like Decca might get him there. This album is a gem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chris Knight brings country/rock music back to life!","review":"For those of you who appreciate good country/rock/blugrass music...Chris Knight will not disappoint you. His music is very refreshing in a time where good music artists are a \\"dime a dozen\\".Chris reminds me a lot of Steve Earle, in that, they both bring true-to-life lyrics and great guitar playing to the table. We will never have another George Jones or Willie Nelson or Johnny Cash, but the Chris Knight's and Steve Earle's of today are taking us back in the right direction musically. The only problem that I have with Chris Knight's new cd is that its very hard to find in the record stores up North.This cd is worth your money, so go out and buy it today!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Contemporary country at its best","review":"Chris Knight is one of the most underplayed artists in country today. His style, bringing to mind Steve Earle, is more deserving of airplay than much of what gets played. He ranks up there with underplayed guys like Chris LeDoux and Junior Brown. Good debut, Chris..look forward to the second album!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great tunes, so-so lyrics","review":"I really like this CD, especially after playing it a few times. His lyrics are simple and not very clever, but it doesn't hurt the appeal of his music. His lyrics are easy to identify with, however, and I feel like I'm getting to know Chris from this album - and I'm looking forward to learning more on his next."},{"rating":"2","title":"An album full of songs that will move you","review":"If you want an album full of songs that will move you this is the best $12 you'll spend all year. Chris' music is too country for rock and too rock for country - a cross between early Eagles, Springsteen, Earl, and all the best country rockers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Music's fine but the CD stinks","review":"I've enjoyed Chris Knight's music for some time, on radio and in other people's collection. But DON'T BUY THIS CD if you plan to use a computer to play it: it's an \\"enhanced\\" CD that will try to take over your machine by installing unwanted software and it disables some CD-ROM audio players from playing the songs at all. It was infuriating, and a real disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Undeniably one the best records that has ever come out of Music City. It's a cryin' shame that not many people took the time to slow down long enough to listen to this gifted singer/songwriter.

Entire chapters are, lets say more or less either copied from the help with no additional insight or otherwise lack additional value. The included tests are faulty. The coverage of test questions is only \\"garanteed\\" by the provided practice tests, NOT the book itself.I still think it is a good starting point to get an impression of what the actual test might require. OTOH just following the test related table of contents (70-536), reading the help and trying everything yourself + purchase of practice tests would most likely be better (something you'll have to do in any case since the book does have quite a few white holes AND you can't rely on the answers provided by the practice tests)."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like the way this book is organized","review":"ofcourse this book is not for newbie level it is for people whom they want to pass the exam, i read manybook before this book and cover in depth the .NET foundation but the topics are not organized in a way to be memorized for the exam, this book is simple to memorize the questions for the exam"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait for something better","review":"The book is too long, with irelevent information for the reader. The book covers all samples in both Visual Basic and C Sharp, making the volume twice the size (and probably price). However, the exam lets you pick one language. Why spend time covering the differences between VB and C#?The authors completely ignore C++. This is a valid language choice for exam 70-536. (Look at the microsoft website, under 70-536). So if you are a C++ developer, you need to reintepret the C# samples. However the authors have no problem giving every example in both VB and C# to make their book bigger.I gave this book two stars instead of one. This is only because of the 90 day 2005 Professional edition, and the Exam discount.The discount runs all the way to 2010.After reading their book I am considering writing my own. I can give examples in all three languages. That way I can charge one third more money!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is truly overly complicated","review":"I brought this book in order to learn how to program. I wanted to take the exam. I had to get a dictionary to make it trough the text. The author seemed to take a very complicated issue, and make it even more complicated by the use of the types of words like antithesis, and obfuscate. While I know what these words mean, it would have been a much easier read if he would have used plain english. I have a bachelors in CIS, and 2 masters degrees. An MBA, and a masters in project management, and I still had a hard time making it through this text. As the other reviews have suggested, I had to purchase 2 other texts to learn the language. I have since been designing web pages for a year, and I have never, ever, opened this book again. It was a waste of the $49 bucks I paid for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Microsoft .Net Framework 2.0 Foundation","review":"The book covers key areas effeciently, especially new technologies in 2.0.

I was waiting on Amit Kalani to come out with his highly anticipated book, but I'm starting to wonder if that will ever see the light of day.In any case, it seems that this book has had corrections made to it since the earlier reviews. I've noticed that more recent printings have a slightly darker cover and that the errata listed at Microsoft's website has been corrected in the book. I could find no mention of a 2nd printing on the inside cover or anything else to suggest a reprint. This doesn't make up for the missing content but does at least make me feel a little better in that I don't have to constantly reference the 33 printed pages of errata while reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Embarrassing","review":"It seems this book was written by a team of beginners and I'm not talking about the numerous typos, but something like \\"class\\" instead of \\"object\\", \\"include\\" instead of \\"using\\" (many, many times) etc. It deserved 2 stars only for the exam voucher and for being usable after a look at http://support.microsoft.com/kb/923018/en-us for a long list of errata."},{"rating":"1","title":"Out of date","review":"This product didn't meet my expectations, and I found it very difficult to follow.

Another thing is that this is the most error-prone book I've ever read. In a novel typos aren't critical, but in a study guide for an exam, they are indeed. So be alert and use the errata. I found out it was better to take the hours needed to correct the text, than spilling time wondering about the accuracy on stuff that looked weird to me. My advice: buy another book !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Acceptable Study Resource","review":"I read this book twice. And I used the MS Press Training Kit Exam Prep application. I studied all 304 questions. I passed the test. So the study guide works. And this was the hardest exam I've taken (I've taken six).I didn't rate it 5 stars, because many of the examples were obvious, and the book had a few errors and typos. A handful of the exam questions were wrong, or had duplicate answers both of which were correct (pick one of the duplicates; no it's the other duplicate with the same answer). But generally, it provided enough information to pass the test.This test is hard. Don't underestimate it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent resource","review":"The practice exams are a great help. I also like the fact that it includes a searchable pdf version of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Poor Editing","review":"This book seems to cover all the necessary topics for the 70-536 exam, but the errors/typos are totally unacceptable. This is probably the most poorly edited book I've ever read. Repeated paragraphs, copy-and-paste errors, code that doesn't compile....you lose confidence in the book and when something doesn't make sense, I find myself wondering if I don't understand the concept or if it's just another error.Again, if you can get past the errors, the book does cover all of the necessary topics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Passable at best","review":"This book is better than nothing but there is a lot of room for improvement regarding quality. It went a long way towards helping me pass the 70-536 exam. This book has an alarming number of typos in it, tends to gloss over some important items, and is missing some key exam items. I bought this because I didn't want to wait months and months for other resources to become available. If you can wait I suggest you do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book, 15% off voucher, and software inside","review":"In my humble opinion this is very good book. I didn't take the exam yet so I don't know if it works but after reading over the 50% of this book I can surely say that the way this book is written is the one of the best (for me of course :) ) there are some typos but I can surely recomend it to all who wants to learn new MS technology and of course who wats to take the 70-536 exam :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"70-536 Exam Prep","review":"Good book. Gives us a good overview of various topics covered in the exam. Has a few errors. But, we could figure it out. It comes with 300 exam practice questions, answers and links to MSDN.

It's a real shame that Decca folded. This album has a ton of great songs on it. I like the songs \\"Better Than It Used To Be\\", \\"Happy As We Wanna Be\\", and \\"She's Got Everything Money Can't Buy\\". The best songs on the album, however, are \\"More Than Everything\\", \\"What Livin's All About\\" (and yes, Lovin's what livin IS all about), and the killer finale, \\"The Rest Of Forever\\", a beautiful song about two broken hearts who have to learn how to trust in love again, which is never easy to do. With the exception of \\"I'll Be Right Here Lovin' You\\", which is extremely corny, this is a great album from start to finish. Get another record deal, Rhett.

Nope. Just one wet t-shirt contest that you can watch on any episode of Wild On.It tries so hard to be like Real World, but fails miserably, no interviews, bad editing, and the idiots who they picked to be on the movie are boring. On top of that, they seem to play for the camera, most of their dialogue is akward, as if they are only having a conversation for the sake of the movie.

Well, I was half right.The thing that I liked, and others may just laugh at, is that the film was edited like a scripted story. Given the drama usually seen on The Real World, it may have been, but I still liked the choices made.There are 16 who were given the trip to Cancun, but we seem to only follow a handful of them.

I am not the type of person who reviews movies here, but this was so bad I just had to let people know. I can almost guarantee that the people giving this 4 and 5 stars are really the director or from the studio. Only a very very STUPID person could enjoy this movie. It isn't even worth describing here. This movie is not what they says it is. This is so bad that they should not make a penny on this film....PLEASE don't buy this sh*t, it will only encourage them to do more awful work. If I could sue them to get my money back from the ticket I bought to see this, I would!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bleh.","review":"I haven't yet seen a MTV movie worth giving a good rating. And after seeing this I see their getting even more desperate. Give it up already.I lost many brain cells watching this crap for crap movie. Don't waste your time. If your into that sorta thing and you want to see naked people, cut out the middle man and just find some porn. It would be less embarassing to be seen getting that than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"SAD AND DEPRESSING BUT IT'S IN FOCUS","review":"Sixteen vapid, semi-attractive, alleged college students head to Cancun for Spring Break and act like idiots while the camera rolls. This soft porn exploitation is weirdly grim, pointless, contrived, shallow, embarrassing, and devoid of joy, wit or charm. The characters are cyphers without human interest. And the music is even worse. I gave it one star because this very sad and depressing film is in focus."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhat Dull...","review":"This film (if you can call it that) was passable, nothing brilliant though, and sometimes remarkably mundane. Nothing really happens here, and that's the problem, no conflict=no story.The characters, well none of them have much substance, no values at all really, as a study of human nature it's pretty depressing, though their are insights to be had. The characters are shallow and vapid for the most part, and unless you're like that yourself, it's hard to relate to any of these muscle guys or air head girls.In summary, as far as reality tv goes, it'll kill 90 minutes if the need be, though why kill what little time you have;)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, depressing, unwatchable!","review":"Okay, I'm a middle-aged old geezer who still enjoys \\"Real World\\" and \\"Road Rules\\" but this movie was filled with so many boring, empty airheads that it was more like a horror movie than a fun thing to watch.The worst part was the way the group of no-brainers kept picking on the poor guy who had never drunk anything alcoholic before. It was as if they were shocked to the core that he was still an alcohol virgin. And the way their eyes lit up when he finally gave in and became just another whooping, drinking, sex machine. Now, when I grew up in the 50s, there just wasn't any of these temptations around. In a way, I'm glad i lived in a Walt Disney town of 300 people and we sat around drinking milk and eating apple pie. But getting back to this slick, two hours of grinning neanderthals, I wish they all stayed in Cancun and away from the Real World."},{"rating":"1","title":"America is not ready for a reality movie","review":"Why watch a film about the most pathetic people ever to grace film? They have NOTHING to offer society. There are very few people in this that are worth the time. This 90 minutes of trash is a slice of America that really makes this country look bad. Normally I enjoy a good party, but with people who have personality. None of these people have even a hint at a personality. The only personality some of them have is getting drunk and showing off their naked body. These people are dumb. Now you see why it bombed at the box office!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not what most people are expecting...","review":"I'll be frank and say I'm not a big fan of those MTV reality TV shows. And I'll be honest the only reason I even went to this movie is because I was expecting to see very beautiful girls, and I'm a big dumb male in that way. But the movie turned out to be more than that, it was actually funny. Alan, one of the characters, reminded me of myself, and I could really relate to him. This movie isn't just for those reality TV fans, it's for a lot of people. I thought the people in the movie were a lot of fun and very colorful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth of money","review":"In 70$ you can get best in Home depot with the blade.

It works best when the cutter can be aligned perpendicular to the branch being snipped."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long reach bybpass pruner","review":"It works, as long as the branch you are cutting is about the size of your little finger (depending somewhat on the type of plant being cut). No problems and the pruner's holding the cut-off branch so you can drop it in your wheelbarrow, etc is very handy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reach with a tree trimmer","review":"This unit works well and is easy to handle.

I searched to see if I could get another from \\"Stanley\\". No luck. I found the \\"Corona\\" long reach pruner on Amazon and decided to give it a try. I received it in good shape and within the promised delivery time. It works very well for trimming hard to reach items and thorny plants such as roses. It holds the trimmed piece for retrieval and disposal. I am totally happy with this pruner and would recommend it to any gardener. The only reason I gave it four stars, and not five, is that it is a bit shorter than my old \\"Stanley\\" version."},{"rating":"1","title":"toy pruner","review":"If you are a serious gardener, this is NOT a tool for you! I read the reviews, and thought it sounded plausible. It is for snipping stems the size of clematis flowers.....not for pruning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fail","review":"I bought this item for my brothers birthday. After he opened it he tested it out on a branch that was about 1/4 inch in diameter. I heard a \\"snap\\" when he made his first cut. It wasn't the branch,but the steel inside that holds a cable that's attached to the cutter head. I took it apart,saw the steel that holds the cable. It was about 1/16 of an inch thick,inch and a half long and 3/16 wide it was a riveted piece,that could not be fixed. Pretty crappy itemI don't think consumers care about the crap we get from Taiwan or China. We just keep taking it in the a** and don't do a thing about it ! Look for something made in the US.no matter what you buy. Lets stop this madness!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Corona Clipper my busiest hand tool","review":"This is a super product, although I was disappointed on first use: the claim of 1/2-inch cutting is overstated if you are cutting woody branches.But then I discovered what it can do. Reaching way into a shrub or ground cover, this item cuts and grabs the work as nothing else would do. Great it you're dealing with rose bushes, raspberries, etc., which you won't have to handle by hand.The big surprise was its usefulness as a weeding tool. Rotating the handle 180 degrees, you can go right into the ground -- or you can grab the leafy parts. I'm 84, and simply can't manage a lot of bending over. With this baby I can work for hours pulling weeds.I even clear fairly large areas where I used to use a weedwacker (I love a hand tool that frees me from lugging around a gasoline engine!) Not having to reach in and pull out the cuts is terrific. The rhythmic swinging and dropping is probably beneficial exercise for the upper body muscles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for my needs","review":"This long reach pruner is a great help!Mostly eliminated the need for a ladder to prune my dwarf fruit trees.Even better for trimming the kiwi vines that put out loads of new chutes all summer long. I cut them off every week or two... and the hold feature of this pruner allows me to hold and place the cut chutes into piles. The long reach allows me to trim from one side while standing on the ground.I also use this to cut weeds on the ground with little bending on my part.Wish I bought this years ago !--end--"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ella Has GREAT Friends","review":"And she is pretty great herself- the greatest female vocalist ever ....at least, I think so. And this album will show you why - the songs are just perfect for a singer of Ella's range and caliber - when Ella sings, you know exactly what the lyricist had in mind. This is one terrific collection of Singers and Songs - a must have for any lover of the Great American Songbook."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time & money!","review":"Beautiful, isn't it?Don't be fooled, as I was. This item is as filmsy as a soda can. When you connect all three parts together the handle comes a loose from face plate. This a not a true drawer pull for customers to daily use. It is only worth displaying for show because it is thin, weak and cheap! I wih I could rate it a zero. Would not recommend...unless you want it just for display."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie for all ages","review":"Each movie has just a touch of \\"scary\\" (if you are young) but enough comic relief to give relief.

The picture was quite clear and beautiful. For the packaging, it's just one blu-ray disc on top of 2 DVDs. Yes, even in a DVD case, it's pretty much feels the same.

They look slightly dated as colouration and picture techniques have improved much in recent years but not necessarily content. All in all this is a treat and fun for both children and their parents. The Blu transfers are as good as one could expect. Very enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie, NOT Disney's best-ONLY FAIR package","review":"In the down years for Disney animation after Walt passed away.The first film is fine, nothing outstanding about it. Only notable for Bob Newhart voice talent.There are quite a few extras on the discs, nothing outstanding. No Making of for the first film but you would not need one really for this film since not the top of Disney films.And, I have always wondered WHY WAS THE SEQUEL MADE? Best part of that unnecessary sequel is having the late John Candy voice talent. It was unnecessary, the first film was not a major hit, so why this sequel?Now, Disney is now going cheap on blu ray packages. For the last few years they have been bending over backwards to promote blu rays, but here as they did with the Pocahontas package & Aristocats packages we get plain jane discs with no artwork on them.So, these are good Disney movies, certainly not the best. Only fair package as Disney goes cheap again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rescuers Rescue Us From Boredom!","review":"Normally, I don't approve of Disney's recent 2 Movie Collections since Disney is proving to be lazy, but this is an exception. I enjoy BOTH \\"Rescuers\\" movies, but of course in their own different ways. The original \\"Rescuers\\" is soft and heavy, but also an enjoyable mystery and rescue mission, very similar to my favorite Disney movie \\"The Great Mouse Detective.\\" I like \\"The Rescuers Down Under\\" for being a more modern action-packed wilderness adventure, having a similar heart to modern computer animated films. It is very rare to see an animated movie take place in the Outback of Australia, and I think this movie has detailed it very well. This sequel is actually way better than those lousy direct-to-video sequels. This 2 Movie Collection DVD is unregrettable!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rescuers","review":"Great movies, awesome color, and and a good plot where good versus evil is exposed and of course good wins.

I was extremely disappointed with the product itself. Much of his monologue is drowned out by laughter of the crowd, and what you can hear is extremely difficult to understand as his Scottish brogue is the strongest I've ever heard for Billy, and I've been a fan for over 15 years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Between the devil and the deep blue sea...","review":"No, that track isn't on this disc. But what I mean is - this is neither the best nor the worst Armstrong CD. He's playing,the band is not as bad as people sometimes make it out to be. But this shouldn't even be one of your first TEN Armstrong's! However, I have to say that any CD with Steven Lasker's name on it is worth buying. He is the finest remastering engineer of older Jazz on a major label - by far.Are there any real musical highpoints here? Can't think of any. Drummer Sid Catlett came into the band shortly thereafter, raising the level enormously. And I say this with no little pain, because the team on most of this CD - (drummer) Paul Barbarin and (bassist) Pops Foster were about the swingingest team of the late '20's. But not here; not in 1938."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cruel!","review":"I lost all respect for the protagonist Dianne Robbins after she failed to report a horrible case of animal cruelty (against Orion, the poor puppy who was repeatedly beaten by Buddy)!

She writes thestory with such even-handedness. Each character fully realized, including a cat and a dog.There are several love stories here.Man and Woman.Mother and child. Father and daughter.And friends of the heart.Her ever so gentle portrait of the love of a family for a severely disabled child is stunning. Reading aboutthe child's physical problems and the care she requires is not depressing. It is inspirational.Another child has problems other than medical. I loved her character.

However...This one was simply awful, I am sorry to say. It was SO overly sweet and sacharine, I found myself nauseated throughout most of the book. It was also unbelievably repetitive- I did not need to hear a million times over about Dianne's contempt for Tim, the circumstances of his abandoning her, or the deep connection between she and her daughter, Julia. I got it after the first few times! It was also really predictable, but not in a good way....and the scene with Amy and the dog in the river? Please, that was the last straw. It was beyond far fetched....it was just silly. I expect better from this author. Some of her previous novels have moved me to tears, but this one is a joke.

There were many good episodes but not up to the quality of the earlier seasons in my opinion. I'll continue to watch my current library until the price is reduced. In any case, at this price the entire series would have set me back $900.00!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Former Radio King branches out","review":"Brian Templeton is the former lead singer of the Boston based blues band, The Radio Kings. Fans of that band will be pleasantly surprised with this cd. Brian surrounds himself with talent, including Monster Mike Welch, and the results are superb. The album is a mix of blues, country twang and upbeat rock that blends well with the multi-talented voice of Templeton. Whether he is crooning on slow ballads like Home or Long Gone Lonesome Blues, or hitting you low with crunching blues like Four Crows (my favorite cut) or Trouble Man, Brian gives it his unique nasal inspired delivery. She's My Baby is even reminiscent of Stevie's The House is Rockin'. Overall, this is a great album and should open some eyes to this guy. One last thing, when this guy and his band come to town, drop what you are doing and go see them. One of the best live performers of the 90's will knock you out in this new century!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Signal cuts in and out","review":"Bought two of these HDMI cables along with a new Samsung TV and Blu-Ray player.

This study has very little in the way of actual content, instead focusing on asking sunday school style questions. The book never actually answers any of the questions or provides deeper insight, meaning that there is little to learn from this study except the thoughts that you and your study group are able to produce. For those hoping for an in-depth look at Romans that will guide you into deeper, more thorough understanding of scripture, look elsewhere. This book is a waste of your time, energy and money."},{"rating":"2","title":"No fluffy stuff","review":"John MacArthur is noted for his in-depth studies and exegesis. This excellent study on Romans comes complete with a NKJ version of the Book of Romans, with short marginal notes on what MacArthur considers commentary you should know about. There is a section included in each chapter called \\"Going Deeper\\" which is also a wonderful optional challenge for study. The questions are not easy but not overly difficult for anyone who is willing to work at it. Romans, the most doctrinal book of the Bible, is of inestimable value for any Christian to know and know well. MacArthur makes it easier, although not easy. I teach Bible studies and my mature women students are salivating to get to this, having been familiarized with MacArthur's other works. So if you really care about the Bible and about what Romans teaches you about living the Christian life, this isn't fluffy. It's serious business and highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"great study, but be ready to work hard","review":"This is a great study of the book of Romans. MacArthur goes into such detail with the words and tense that a person can gain so much understanding by the original language. Be ready to work hard and be in the book of Romans for a while.

(And I still couldn't introduce myself...)But the Pimsleur methodology can't be beat and is much better at building a language structure upon which you expand.

The lessons are structured in a step by step process that does not allow the user to interpolate onto their specific need. There are a total of 4 only 4 activations on different computers, which means over the life of the program that if you upgrade computers frequently, you will be paying for additional activations EVEN if you experience a computer crash.

No light disturbing your sleep). Now really, does it get much simpler than that? I own one, bought one for a friend, and put one in our holiday rental. No one has to call and ask \\"How do I set the alarm?\\" and my friend has thanked me numerous times for purchasing it for him. Because it is light weight and made of plastic, I really didn't think I would like it for very long. I was looking for something much more substantial. I am so glad I took a chance.

I played it for a friend as a prank it is so bad.Instead of buying this record, drag your knuckles against a brick wall until the bone is exposed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Universal Soldier2 doesn't cut it.","review":"This was supposed to be part 2 of the original Universal Soldier with Jean Claude returning as the hero. Note that there was already a low budget knock off of #2 and #3 previously released without Jean Claude. Unfortunately, this low-budget sequel had none of the ambiance or realism that the original movie contained. In fact, if not for the title, you would not have known that this was the second part. Nothing from this movie linked the first movie (except for an occasional flash back). The weapons and outfits were poor. The premise was weak and and the special effects were either poor (as in bullets bouncing off car windows) or non existent. The only thing that carried over from the last movie (and all his other movies) was Jean Claude getting beatup through-out the movie in spite of the fact that he was supposed to be a \\"Universal Soldier\\" hinself. We were are pretty dissappointed with this one. It was a comedic ripoff of a good film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made the Original one look entertaining!","review":"I have to admit. I just wanted to see Goldberg! After his brilliant (?) performance with Kevin Nash on the Love Boat, it seemed like it would be quite a stretch to see him perform as an out-of-control killing machine. This movie is just awful, Van-Damme is terrible - and the plot is ridiculous. The computer terminal takes over and materializes into a soldier? That sure makes sense. Watch Nitro instead - at least Goldberg wins there and that's more believable!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Short running time causes sequel to go down in ashes","review":"\\"Universal Soldier\\" was a half decent action film and one of Van Damme's first half decent pictures. This sequel was a good idea for Van Damme, as he is starting to head back into straight to video territory. The sequel is pretty much a rehash of the original, except it's not as interesting and it is too damn short, just as it starts to get going it ends. Luc Devearaux (Van Damme) use to be a UniSol (as they nickname them) and now he is forced to take on the new breed, who get out of control. There's Seth (Michael Jai White)and Romeo (Bill Goldberg) posing the biggest threat. some action scenes in this are quite good, especially the opening one where there is a cool speedboat chase. But I ask myself, why wouldn't original co-stars Dolph Lundgren, Ally Walker, Ed O'Ross or Jerry Orbach want to do the sequel? it must have been a dodgy script. Action fans may find something of interest here. may I say."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not A Great Film","review":"This movie is not just bad it's real bad. Van Damm is washed out and you see it here. With Goldberg as a co-star you know this will not be exactly the greatest action flick and it isn't. Michael Jai White was in Spawn and if you saw that film and have seen how bad that way then expect much of the same here. Nothing great in this film, just a bunch of b/s running for an hour and a half. If your so eager to see it then rent it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Plenty of Van Dammage in this above-average \\"B\\" movie","review":"This Van Damme movie has everything you'd want in a \\"B\\" action movie: a waterski chase, heroes thrown through walls of glass; unstoppable cyborg villians, and a strip club scene (just because). Not much gab, the action is fairly continuous. I would give it 5 stars, but \\"Body Shaping\\" hottie Kiana Tom is underutilized and disappears after the first few minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your precious lifetime on this","review":"One of the worst sci-fi movies ever. Pitiful scenario, a shoot'em with no joy stick!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why did they bother.....","review":"I am a Van Damme fan and still hold out for the day when he makes a return to the big screen. I bought this recently and now wish I hadn't. Unfortunatly with this entry it seems Van Damme has decided to self-destruct what remains of his career. I hope he made this during his drug addiction years, if not, then I think he has received one to many kicks to the head and should consult a doctor. Very predictable throughout which by no means is a bad thing if only the film was enjoyable and didn't treat its audience as if they were 10 year olds. Logic seems to have been thrown out the window along with the two page script. Rent this before parting with your hard earned cash if only to see the fight scene in the lapdancing club! Van Damme has shown some glimmer of hope with Desert Heat and Replicant but I think the good old days of Kickboxer, Timecop, Universal Soldier and Sudden Death are long over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Universial Soilder - The rerun","review":"This film is just bad. It feels cheap. It lacks impact and plot. The only character I liked was Romeo. Overall it just falls short of the mark in almost every catagory. Some of the fights are ok and that is the movies only redeeming quality. Give it a miss."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Action, Bad Plot","review":"I enjoyed the original Universal Soldier, but like most sequels, this one has much to be desired. I'm a big wrestling fan, so it was fun to watch Goldberg attempt to act out of the ring. He's about as talented actor as Van Damme himself (heh). The movie has a lot of action, so it gets some high points there, but the story line really isn't that good. It's an entertaining movie, but the original is far superior."},{"rating":"1","title":"Universal Soldier 2 was HORRIBLE!!!","review":"This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It was very dissapointing, for me being a big fan of Van Damm's and Goldberg's. Some great action, but unneeded nudity and thoughtless storylines make this a movie that does not need to be see. Get the first one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Action Movie!","review":"This was definitely a beyyer movie than the original Universal Soldier. Van Damme plays the role of the hero very effectively. Michael Jai White plays the role of Seth in a human body to the point of being scary. Bill Goldberg ia also a very effective villain in his role as Romeo. This small army of super soldiers are turned bad by Seth the super computer. The main killer soldier, played by Goldberg, wreaks havoc. Seth the super computer takes on a human body and openly begins a manhunt for Van Damme because he has the secret computer code that Seth has to have. After battles all over the landscape Van Damme finally prevails. This is a good action movie with entertaining actors.

Unfortunately Universal Soldier 2 falls short, lack luster performances, and too many obnoxious scenes that make this movie too ridiculous to watch!I hope you will find yourselves something far more entertaining, like cutting your toenails its better than this, believe me! So try some of Jean-Claudes earlier work like No retreat no surrender or Bloodsport certainly better and more interesting that what is on offer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid \\"sequel\\" fails for the most part...","review":"This film marked the end of Van Damme's theatrical release career and started him on the road to being forgotten, finding parts in only direct-to-video flicks. It's a shame, really. Van Damme was actually getting good, but this flick doesn't show it. Full of cliches and silly action, not helped by an appearence from wrestler Bill Goldberg, this film is too short to pick up any real momentum, and too stupid to give the viewers anything more than a childish plot. I give it a two simply because it was watchable. I'm being very nice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Van Damme rules again","review":"Universal Soldier: The Return is the ultimate pinacle of all action movies.

However, the movie will now join others in my DVD collection as one that I probably wont watch again EVER! This film just does not deliver, it has 'A-team' violence (loads of bullits flying and explosions but knowbody actualy getting hurt!) , stupid characters (most of them seem to have come from WWF or something) and I have to say Van Damme plays a block of wood, I also got the impression that I was watching Sunset beach or something with every simple aspect of the film being explained out for me, like the audience were retards. Its a 'watchable' film if you aint doing anything interesting but I wish I had not spent the money on buying it.

A rather hip and apparently super-agile and -fit 65-year-old woman gets herself into unlikely situations for even a youngster, let alone an elderly mystery-solver. Add to that the \\"evil\\" cult which has moved into a small fictitious Vermont town and the rather silly and far-fetched goings-on leading up to an anticlimactic jumble at the end, and you have a very light, almost comical read that may be suitable for an afternoon at the beach, and I will admit that it kept me at least mildly entertained.

What struck me right away was the statement \\"neither the parent or the nanny is the more valuable human being\\". I was a believer from then on. This is an excellent book. The contents reflect that the writer has a through understanding of the basic fundementals of the nanny career and how the Professional nanny should function. Although I understand that the author was an aquaintance of Dr. Ben Spock, Debbie Davis, Jay Belskay, Fran Herman as well as other early childhood education pioneers, the work in this text is original and you get the sense when reading it that there are no pretenses. The only problem I have with this book is that the workbooks that go along with it need to be purchased separately. I think it should be complete package."},{"rating":"2","title":"I want this album to be the soundtrack to my life","review":"I bought my first Parker and Lily cd after seeing them play at Brownies in the East Village. They were so dreamy and hypnotic that I actually left a rock club relaxed and happy. Here Comes Winter is sophisticated and luxurious. It serves as excellent background music but is also edgy and alluring and deserves to be listened to on big cushy headphones in the dark. All music supervisors for movies and television should listen to this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Candy-Coated Melancholy","review":"A soundscape built from vintage instrumentation with nods (e.g. minimal drum machine beats and a charmingly postmodern, self-mocking lyrical sense) to modernity. A popular combination these days, to be sure, but this is a stellar manifestation of the trend. The dusky, moody harmonies of Here Comes Winter call to mind a slow dance in taffetta in a humid high school gym circa 1956.

Instead of the well-crafted songs and stellar musicianship I have come to expect, all I hear is a bunch of industrial noise. I don't blame it on Chris DeGarmo's departure (\\"Hear In The Now Frontier\\" wasn't that great either), but on someone's misguided notions about \\"what the kids will listen to.\\" C'mon, you guys, you can do better than this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"At least its not Rap","review":"Please put out an A.P.B. for Chris DeGarmo. This band is the reason I began to play guitar in the early 80s and I want to know what happened. I got married like these guys but my guitar work and songwriting capability hasn't become muddy and undestinguishable. What happened to the solo work and the heart wrenching vocals of old? Queensryche has become just like the other horrible bands that have come out of Seattle. Maybe they need to get out of the rain. You can't believe how disappointed I was when this long awaited CD came to me in the mail. The only good comment I can make is at least it's not Rap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Queensryche - Q2k: What the...?","review":"Since the release of Empire (1990), Queensryche's ability to write great songs has somehow been lost. No surprise, really, considering their best songwriter, Chris DeGarmo, left the band before Q2k was written. Yes, Queensryche's last two albums with Chris weren't exactly great but at least they were decent. Chris's absence shows. Q2k is, in my opinion, an awful album. It is just awful songwriting."},{"rating":"1","title":"This CD did not meet my expectations!","review":"The common thread that runs through the reviews of this CD by people who were less than satisfied is that Chris leaving the band was a bad thing and that QR needs to return to the writing style that built their fan base in the first place.It must be harder to write good songs than I thought - the last 3 CDs have all been a disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whoa, what?","review":"Cool cover and theme to the albums, but it just isn't the quality of their last few efforts. First, \\"Breakdown\\" is ok, but hardly a good choice for the first single. Not that I know anything about single selection, but why not the powerful \\"Sacred Ground\\", my personal favorite on the album, or the wonderful \\"Liquid Sky\\" or \\"Burning Man\\"? Other than these few songs and \\"The Right Side of My Mind\\" the rest of the album seems to be very undistiguisable, no real standouts. Don't get me wrong, I still love this record, it's still 4 stars. Even with a lineup change Queensryche can still produce some good music, but I just don't think that it is quite up to par with their previous work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uhhh","review":"Man what happened?

I really didn't care for \\"Hear in the...\\", but this is a great effort. Some of the reviewers are slamming this because it isn't mindcrime, I've personally seen these guys in concert 6 times and this cd is as good as any before. This cd epitomizes what it takes to continue their heavy roots, but keep up with the times. Keep up the great work, and I'll keep buying!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Easily there best work since Empire","review":"An overall excellent CD that is able to blend the smooth vocals of Geoff Tate on such diverse songs as Falling Down and When the Rain Comes. It is easily there best effort since Empire, which coincidentally was there most successful album. As a Queensryche fan I can only hope that Q2K tastes some of the sweet success of Empire because this disk is easily worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to the great mind inspiring band of all time?","review":"I have been a ryche fan since I first saw them as an opening band. The music mad you feel something when you listened to it. The last two cd's just don't do it anymore. It's almost like they are trying to hard. Maybe it's the pressures from record contracts or they feel their popularity falling. They need to remember where they came from and who got them there. I usually buy there cd's without listening first. They are the only band I will ever do that for. There have been so many times when their music was the only thing that made sense, and kept me going. I'm dissapointed ,but I still think they are the best all time band ever. I like Rage For Order the best and hope they can get it together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Again...","review":"I'm listening to the CD right now as I'm typing, and its droning music and whining lyrics might as well be white noise. Another disappointing album. None of the songs are remarkable. I defy anyone to remember any of the choruses or hooks three hours later. Terrible. While bands like Savatage and Dream Theater seem to be getting better as they get older, Queensryche has fallen apart more and more since Mindcrime. Everyone, do yourself a favor and pick up \\"Dead Winter Dead\\" or \\"Wake of Magellan\\" from Savatage -- that's the kind of music Queensryche should be putting out these days, instead of this sleep-inducing stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Q2K is a right step toward the Y2K","review":"The passion and emotion is back on Q2K. This album really rocks in a good 90's way and still keeps that signature Queensryche sound/style.

This album lacks the great melodies set by guitarist DeGarmo that was seen in prior albums Operation Mindcrime and Empire. Furthermore, this new album is missing the climatic choruses that Queensryche used to excel at. It seems that this band is trying to keep up with contemporary artists instead of relying on what made them popular in the first place. An overall disapointment... especially after reading that this new album will do what Def Leppard's Euphoria had done... back to their roots. Not happening."},{"rating":"1","title":"unsure","review":"I have been a fan of QUEENSRYCHE since I heard them in 1983. I have enjoyed all their albums, especially their earlier ones. I think that each one of the band members has a special talent that adds to the magic of their music. This latest seems to miss one thing, Chris DeGarmo. I am sad that he is no longer with the band. I hope that Kelly Thompson can fill Chris' big shoes left behind.

The only saving grace now (besides a mediocre \\"Falling Down\\") that has come with multiple daily listening is the three song group of \\"Beside You\\", \\"Liquid Sky\\" and \\"Breakdown\\", and of those, \\"Beside You\\" is truly the only memorable one. After those three songs, I just hit rewind, and play those three songs over again. \\"When the Rain Comes\\" and \\"How Could I?\\", and the last three songs might as well not even be on the CD, because they're unremarkable and truly forgettable.Where's Chris DeGarmo's new band?

I bought the album without seeing or hearing any sales hype, so no \\"over the top\\" expectations were set. But after the first listen, it was VERY apparent that Chris DeGarmo had left the band. Not only did Chris give QR their definitive sound, but also helped push Geoff Tate into writing and producing some great lyrics. The music on this CD are below QR standard, relying heavily on long, stale grooves that seem to never start, stop or climax. No solos, no hard riffs that imprint memories ....nothing. By the third song you realize that Geoff may still have those golden pipes, but his lyrics really need substantial help. Not only can you predict his next line, but can forcast what the bridge will be for almost EVERY song on this album. Is this the end for one of my Favorite bands?

This is not their best album, but I didn't expect to be. After a few listens a true Queensryche fan will like this album.

Did they take some substance that made them start a slow, and I most say, painful process into becoming horrible song writers. It started with Promised Land, which had a few classics, then HTNF, which had maybe one song that I can actually remember the words to, and this effort. WOW is it bad. I heard it on the internet last night and said to myself; it has to sound better on CD. NOPE. It is pure garbage. I have front row tickets to their show in San Jose and am just praying that they stick to the classics and play very little off of this effort. My advice to Queensryche is find a cure for whatever happened to, what used to be the most thought evoking band ever; that now is turning out mindless drivel.

And this, if not compared to Mindcrime, is a damn good rock record. This may fall short of Empire and Promised Land, but w/ songs like \\"Right Side of My Mind\\", \\"Liquid Sky (personal fave)\\", \\"When The Rain Comes\\", and \\"Falling Down\\", it can't be all bad. While, there are some songs that are awkward and just strange, there are many other that are killer. Every tru QR fan should listen to Q2k, and leave all your inhibitions behind.

Queensryche is DONE!","review":"This is horrible. I was hoping they would have a return to form after the joke called HITNF, but I was wrong. What happened to good music? Did they forget how to write? These guys should hang it up, because they are well-done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two words Unbelievably Disappointing","review":"After the last flop Hear In The Now Frontier one would think that Queensryche would take a step back and re-evalute their musical direction, but no, even after losing DeGarmo they kept plugging along on the same boring path as the last CD. What happened to Queensryche's musical imagination?? It obviously exited stage left with DeGarmo. Every one of the songs on this recent attempt are forgettable, there's nothing there for you to sit back and say \\"wow good riff or how'd they get that sound\\" Without Degarmo's imaginative songwriting ( unfortunately not evident on the last CD either) Queensryche has just become a mediocre band from Seattle. If you're interested in REAL Queensryche songs purchase anything before Hear In The Now Frontier. What a shame........."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Last Studio Release I Ever Bought From The Band","review":"I seem to remember one or possibly two passable songs off of this release but this pile largely picks up where Here In The Lame Frontier leaves off. To add insult to injury, Geoff Tate hired some hack named Kelly Grey to enable him to achieve his fiercely determined, meteoric plunge into the depths of banality. S2K, Sucksryche for the Nu-Millenium"},{"rating":"1","title":"Chris De Garmo's songwriting is sorely missed here.","review":"The effort is somewhat lacking, to an extent, that it doesn't sound like The Ryche at all. If you want to hear classic QR, better get the older albums.I hate to say this, but we want Chris back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Q2Krappppp!","review":"This is all but a joke. Being a Queensryche fan from the first EP in 1982, this all but completes their career for me. The only salvagable song is the last one (The Right Side of My Mind), and they would do far better in all aspects if they produced more material along this line. Maybe the tour with Maiden and Halford will give them a shot in the arm. I will give them one more shot, and if they reguriTATE the same grungy garbage, they won't get another cent from me. There's plenty of other good stuff being released (Dokken, Maiden, Fates Warning, Motley Crue, Dio, etc.) so if they can't cut it anymore, they should hit the golf course, for good. I really hope they can come back with a worthy next release, more identifiable of their sound, which is the reason they are where they are. If not, they can always tour with the Scorpions, or maybe even the Backstreet Boys :)......"},{"rating":"1","title":"Below Average","review":"Another dissapointment here, when DeGarmo left so did the heart and soul of Queensryche. With the exception of 2 good songs the rest is very weak. I expected Wilton to shine now that it was his turn to step up, but it didn't happen. The guitars are very thin throughout, Kelly Gray does nothing here. His influence is questionable (remember Dokken's Shadowlife CD?) he produced it. Well, maybe some day DeGarmo will come back and save the mighty Ryche!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Please Stop!!!","review":"Throw in the towel!! God, this is awful!! Queensryche really should have stopped after \\"Operation Mindcrime\\" but this is just embarrasing. Sad, sad, sad!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"They keep getting worse","review":"I'm sorry to say it but this was once my favorite band and Operation Mindcrime is probably the best cd ever, but I am really disappointed in Q2K.I can't blame the departure of Chris Degarmo cause HITNF was below par too. I think they should have hunted for a guitarist instead of going straight to Kelly. Most bands go with the flow of what is popular with today's youth instead of continuing to play what got them to where they are. This is what their fans want from them. Small changes are good but trying to please people with commercial pop tunes (which I consider a huge change) is wrong. I borrowed this cd thank god cause I won't buy it. This is to the guys of Queensryche, If you want to get back to the minchrime/empire days when you could do no wrong, don't be the norm. Make another cd like those because it can be done by you, but you have to want to. Don't lose your loyal fans by making any more Q2K's, go back to your roots. PLEASE!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful. See Tribe","review":"What does Queensryche sound like with a new mediocre guitarist? I remember listening to this album repeatedly to see if I liked it, then listened again months later. I still can't stand it. The lyrics don't really strike any chords and the music is nothing _but_ chords. It's bargain bin fodder.All of their albums up until Empire were great. Empire had some good songs. I even like \\"Promised Land\\" and \\"Hear in the Now\\" after that. Q2K and Tribe test my patience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different sound, but still cool","review":"O.K, This is no Operation:Mindcrime or even Promised Land part II. This is totally different type of Queensryche. The 'Progressive' - label was thrown away with HITNF and this one is no exception. It's just a cool Hardrock -album with some killer songs and few 'fillers' also. To me, the highlights are: The Right Side Of My Mind, Sacred Ground, Falling Down, Breakdown and Liquid Sky. When The Rain Comes and One Life are also listenable songs. The production is superb, making your speakers blow and your foot to jam with the beat. Geoff doesn't have that voice he still had on Promised Land, but it still sounds better than 99% of the other bands out there. Even though I gave this album 4 starts, I kinda hope that Wilton will dig up his heavy-guitars again for the next album .....the next album .... sure they're gonna do another one?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Q2K try why you say!","review":"OH MY GOD WHAT IN THE H#LL WERE THEY SMOKING ?THIS ISNT EVEN FUNNY BECAUSE THESE GUYS HAVE TALENT I KNOW WE HAVNT HEARD.BUY THE WAY WHO EVER WROTE THIS IS THE BEST HAS NEVER BEEN \\" ON THE ROAD TO MADNES!\\"ORSEEN\\"SUITE SISTER MARY\\"I FEEL SORRY FOR YOU AND ALL THE GREAT MUSIC YOU MISSED.I WAS HOPING THIS WOULD BE ANOTHER MINDCRIME OR BETTER BOY I COULDNT HAVE BEEN MORE SHOCKED"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tate's voice is shot","review":"I think it is clear that all the screaming and Touring has caused permenant damage to Tates voice--that is the reason for the change in their music. It is really a shame and is not the bands fault the tunes just dont sound the same without his high energy vocals.I would bet anything that when we hear Chris' new band--the vocalist with have restored Tate-type voice.I will say that I saw QR last year live and even though they had to tip-toe around the high notes and screams of old--they can put on an awesume show"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the HARDEST album they have made to date!","review":"To all of you @#$!%&$!@%# out there writing bad reviews about this album thinking that this album sucks and it's their worst album of all time, let me give it to you straight. This album is their HARDEST, MOST ROCKING album they have made so far. However, their most HARDCORE album is Rage For Order......there is a distinct difference. This freakin' album (Q2K) makes me have my own little mosh pit in my room! But, it did take me a few listens to get the feel for the album, and that's what makes for an outstanding, superb album. So, for all you cynical listeners out there, give this album a chance; listen to it a few times before you make your final decision. For me, it took about 5 listens to get the entire feel for the album. It is yet another outstanding accomplishment by the greatest Hard Rock/Heavy Metal band of all time, at least to me anyway, QUEENSRYCHE!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Anybody listening?","review":"This is a very uninspiring album. Only a couple tunes are catchy, none are edgy. I wish they could sing a different type of background vocal, and I'm tired of the waahh-waahh guitar sound in the background, present both on this album and Hear in the Now Frontier. I used to LOVE these guys, and have been a fan since the EP and The Warning came out and I blasted them in my dorm room while studying. I think nearly all of us agree that Promised Land was the creative end of the band, they're just putting out stuff now for the sake of supporting them and their families. It's okay, we'll always have Mindcrime, which has enough genius in it than most band's entire discography."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poetry? Nope. Marvelous playing? Nope. Great vocals? Nope.","review":"Everything I loved from Queensryche...their playing, Tate's vocals, and amazing songwriting...HiTNF and this simply mock. None of those great highs and lows where Geoff Tate seems to duel w/ Ian Gillian, none of the gut-wrenching poetry I've come to love. Empire was worth the money just for \\"Empire\\" and \\"Anybody Listenning?\\", Rage for Order, however dated, still shows great poetry, and their other albums are in the middle somewhere, though all worth buying. However, they've now released two that are nothing but crap. No poetry being belted out by Tate's amazing throat, and none of that great songwriting...the whole album is predictable, and the only good track is \\"On the Right Side of My Mind\\". Hopefully, this poor album is simply related to the new label I see..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely NOT Q2K Compatible","review":"Once again, another great metal band falls victim to the grunge/alternative hole.

There's no \\"Extras\\" on this which is disappointing but it still rates 5 stars for it's rockin' good-time, bluesy, tex-mex ragged but right music. This is the stuff for parties and drinking.

Did he call himself civilized?Did Mr. Reich have to pay to get this smeared toilet paper published? Will never know as it's probably privileged information. Right, Mr. Accountant?While he ceaselessly tries to be just a little more like DeMille, Clancy, and even Wolfe (almost entire passages copied out of The Bonfire), he ain't it.

Only these days they have abandoned the ruble in favor of the dollar, exchanged funny looking uniforms for $5,000 suits and their MiGs for G5 business jets.The only criticism I have for this book is that everything gets wrapped up very neatly, and my experience with Russians is that nothing ever gets put back together exactly right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Couldn't get into this book, I found the characters morally weak and the pace of the book very slow.

It was different that I had expected, but I came away with a very favorable impression of the author. Reich presents a story with the financial underpinnings that I had expected. More than that, however, the story is one of greed, ruthlessness, limitless ego, and geopolitical intrigue. Reich was able to grab the reader's attention at the very beginning and keep it throughout. There is an abundance of suspense, plot twists and non-stop action. Character development is strong, with some very interesting emotional ties among the characters. I am definitely going back for more of Reich's works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Sequel to Op Flashpoint","review":"The game is basically Operation Flashpoint with better physics, graphics, AI, weapons, etc. The game is very demanding on one's hardware.

Still, even if your machine is a year old, and have to run the game on medium settings, the graphics are still pretty decent.It has been said before, but this game is more a combat simulator than it is a first person shooter.

If you're longing for this type of ethereal eighties releases buy this CD to complete your collection, if you're fond of bland This mortal coil post-It'll end in tears CDs this one's for you too."},{"rating":"2","title":"shake your neighbourhood","review":"Immediately preceding the ex-Fairport Convention founder member's next important stage (Hi-Fi supergroup) - this excellent album in 1978 came out on a cute Mushroom label, yielded one terrific movie theme (\\"Shake It\\") and generally went to prove Matthews' own distaste at being categorized. If not for the hate of folk (how come?), than for the sake of his character, Ian (nowadays spelled Iain) Matthews goes wonderfully electric, disarmingly tuneful and captivating rhythmic. Not to mention awesome baritone sax to attenuate Matthews' tenor. Arguably, all-time best tenor in world pop, Matthews softly pumps emotion into \\"Shake It\\" till it bursts into refrain. It's all yours now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stealin' Home is Gold","review":"Just love the variety of musical styles Ian uses on this album. I bought this album as a cutout years ago. Recently put it on cassette tape with selections from his Hit & Run album as well. Why this guy never got the recognition he deserves is beyond me. There's certainly enough enjoyable music here to make it worth the purchase. His voice is an absolute charm to listen to."},{"rating":"2","title":"A total and unexpected standout","review":"An avid Squeeze fan for 20+ years, I found the Difford/Tilbrook split a disappointment, albeit an understandable one. But I would have never guessed that Chris working *without* Glenn would result in such a monumentally fine, substantial and moving work. Personally, I dig the heavy use of piano and keyboards alongside the exceptional guitar work and airy acoustic mixdowns. More than that, the exacting vocal arrangements here actually outdo anything from the Squeeze playbook. But above all, Chris knows how to pen lyrics to music. A stirring surprise overall, and I hope to see more from Chris Difford."},{"rating":"2","title":"Difford squeezes out a fine solo debut","review":"I always enjoyed the few Squeeze songs that Chris Difford sang. Although they were few and far between, and I love Glenn Tilbrooks voice, the sound of Chris Difford's voice always had a strange and magical feel. When I first listned to this CD, I wasn't so sure about it. After repeated listenings, though, I found myself singing along with my favorite tunes, like I would on any classic Squeeze album. Highpoints (for me, anyway) include \\"Tightrope\\", \\"Trafalgar Square\\", and the haunting \\"Parents\\"...a beautiful ode to Chris's parents, complete with answering machine messages from the two of them. All in all, a fine first solo effort, and one well worth owning."},{"rating":"2","title":"First Rate","review":"This book is a treat. Fine writing in a novel that plays with reality as though it were a new toy. Mirolla's cast of characters are extremely well drawn with a bias toward the off-beat, quirky, in-and-out of the shadow type people you wouldn't normally invite for a sleep-over. All are part of the puzzle that Berlin offers in its story line. The novel was a two-reader for me as the first reading left me...well, puzzled. And like an itch you have to scratch... In short, this novel is great fun for the mind - I was hooked after the first sentence."},{"rating":"1","title":"3 to 4 pages to everything in trading, really everything","review":"There are 33 chapters in this 639 page book which practically put everything you can think of about trading or investment into it. Technical Analysis, Fundamental Analysis, Trading Psychology, Options, Commodities... simply everything. The problem is: dont know whether it's the intent of the author to give so general an idea of everything to its readers or he is too agressive to encompass so much in one single book. He just used a page or two to describe very complicated items like MACD, Stochastics, Gann Fan, Fibonnaci numbers, Bonds, Computer Trading, Crude Oil, Platinum, Gamma, Theta, Rho, Delta Neutral Trading........In case you just want to have a close to nothing idea of the highly complicated trading or investment market, it's for you.

These ideas are more dramatized than explained, which makes it a little hard to understand. Plus, he filters all these dramatized theories through his own complex theories about prose and fiction, which focus on rhetorical complexity in lieu of plot complexity and things of this nature.If you're absolutely blown away by the concept that people think, that people really, actually cogitate despite the fact that their consciousnesses are located in bodies, then you may just love this work. If not, that is, you believe in an eternal soul and/or otherwise think that the mind and body are not the same thing (or if you don't care one way or the other)you may want to take a pass because this work's philosophical underpinnings may not resonate much with you."},{"rating":"2","title":"old buddy is the best","review":"buddy red bow is just the native counter partof ol hank if you dont know who hank isnuff said"},{"rating":"1","title":"Item description is plain wrong.

Sadly, after wearing them for 10 minutes discovered my heel kept popping up. I wasn't sure it was from my toes sliding forward or the fit of the shoe.

Tried them on my granddaughter who has very long baby fine but thick hair, worse job on her.

I still enjoy Fountain's albums though and think he is one of the best. My favorite tracks are \\"High Society\\",which is a very old New Orleans song played back in the day of Morton and maybe even before. This song has the traditional setup that I'm talking about. Pete's solo is nothing short of terrific. Then there's \\" Bye Bye Bill Bailey\\" which also is played with the traditional backup.

I think it was first released in the mid 80's as an LP on Etiquette records.I can't comment on the sound/mastering quality of this particular release, but the song sequence looks excellent. They nailed most or all of the best cuts.On the other hand, everything they recorded in 1965 was great. You may want to get the complete catalog as available on Norton (2 separate CDs on mono) and/or Ace (Psycho-Sonic rerelease, some in good stereo, no Christmas cuts). The price on this \\"Full Force\\" item seems a bit inflated, perhaps because it is out of print.

I don't think this is the greatest book in America, nor is it even the greatest book the Hubert Selby Jr. would go on to write. That would be Requiem For A Dream. I'm saying that this novel was taboo, Transgressional fiction, brilliantly portraying the weirdness, the violence, the sickness that always plagued society. It's not exactly timeless, but it does have it's moments."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nasty","review":"I know this is considered a breakthrough literary classic of some kind, and I gave it my best shot. I stuck with it as long as I could, but no thank you. I was expecting a great story about Brooklyn .... don't laugh at me ! The book is dated, disturbing, sad and so awfully vicious. It's quite a sinkhole in fact.The gratuitous cruelty of the characters to each other was too much for me. I bailed out after the first long section. I didn't need my nose stuck in this mess. Somebody tell me there was one glimmer of human spirit in there, later, and I just didn't get to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Scatterbrain of a Novel yet an Interesting Read","review":"Hubert Selby's novel Last Exit To Brooklyn is a harrowing and a sprawling portrait of underachievers in Brooklyn. A lot of it has to do with homosexuality, drag queens, drugs, financial and relationship problems, and living in bad neighborhoods. It was hard to read, due to lack of punctuation, and Selby's scatterbrain style of writing (he himself said in an interview that he had some sort of mental problem, so I can see that), but overall it was a good book and if you're willing to take an adventure into the underworld of Brooklyn and disillusionment, read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"powerful (?)","review":"i picked up this book, it being hailed as an \\"underground classic\\" and me being a bleak literature enthusiast and all. i read it, and we have a steady narration interupted by quotation-less conversation. schizophrenic? no. rather, the book is like an urban William Burroughs. i guess my one major problem with the book is that very diolouge thing, it just annoys me. other then that it's unsettiling, powerful, and very enertaining. meh."},{"rating":"2","title":"this is just engaging prose!!!!!","review":"this book got me into a land i haven't been before. one of the darkest books i have ever read. recommended"},{"rating":"2","title":"Look!","review":"Read the 1- and 2-star reviews if you want to know why this book is so \\"awful,\\" in the true sense of that word.

Selby's tales will pierce your soul and make it bleed, that is the kind of power his language has. Selby literally creates this euphoria through his language that inserts the reader into the character's mind and soul. Hence, we pity the depraved, the drug addled, the whores who populate this work. Even Ken Starr would let these characters off the hook, that's how humane and brilliant Selby's depiction is of these otherwise unsympathetic characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Believe the Hype","review":"Do not read this book because you liked Requiem for a Dream the movie. It is totally dissimilar. For that matter, don't read this book if you like a novel to have a plot. Last Exit to Brooklyn is made up of several unrelated stories that constantly switch back and forth throughout the book. The result is that you find yourself no more involved on the last few pages than you were on the first few. The stories go nowhere and could just as easily been arranged in a different order. Specifically, the stories are comprised of transexual and homosexual activities, drug use, spousal abuse, and child abuse. None of the characters are likeable. If you're looking for something contemporary, try anything by Chuck Palahniuk instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreadable","review":"The story seems decent but I found this book to be absolutely unreadable.

Others were found to be the worst waste of tree bark that one could imagine. But in all the books I have read, never have I questioned ones reason for being. I am a firm believer of the need of books that awake ones mind to the less then perfect American picture of life. I had never read or heard of Mr. Selby before this book. His constant pounding on the Homosexual theme I found tiresome. I thought he had something in his story called, \\"Strike\\", but found it also dragged down into the mire of dogma.Even in the darkest of stories taken from life there is some hope. Selby writes one of the most brutal, hateful novels I have ever read. I may not agree with a homosexual lifestyle, but I have found them to be people who live, their lives in the dignity of their choice.If this book was meant to do anything but degrade them I guess I missed it."},{"rating":"1","title":"It helped me go to sleep....","review":"This is the only book of the last fifty or so I have read that I just wanted to give up on. It was a distorted didactical load of the usual religious dogma. Yes, after 3 chapters I climbed out of my stupor to realize that each chapter (7 in all, of course) was unrelated other than that each was a relation of a christian sin to a world we are more familiar with. After that, I was able to entertain myself by seeing how quickly I could guess which sin was next as I started each chapter. I know what this book is \\"supposed\\" to represent, however, it is not worth reading unless you enjoy repetition and weak imaginations. My apologies for all the bitterness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same Sh** Different Day","review":"Clearly this book was written to shock and disgust the reader. It largely succeeeds.The overriding weakness of the book is that all the characters basically act, sound and view life in the same way. After reading a couple dozen pages I noiticed that you could simply insert the name of one male charater into the place of another and not really notice any difference.All the men are ignorant, physically abusive and shiftless drunks (of somewhat varying degrees). (...)I wonder if this work would have been more interesting if Selby took one of the stories in LEB (...say...\\"Strike\\"...) and provided more depth about the character's history and motivations.This work suffesrs from the same fatal flaw as Richard Wright's \\"Native Son\\" (although a much different work): the main character(s) is (are) simply unlikeable and repellant; the reader has no reason to care what happens to them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enough already with the drag queens, Hubert!","review":"Having grown up on the very streets of Brooklyn (albeit a decade and a half later) where Mr. Selby's storys take place, I am puzzled as to why drag queens populate every chapter of this book. You would think from this book that every adult male in Brooklyn wants to sleep with drag queens. Mr Selby took me in with his believabilty in each chapter only to lose me with his harping on gay lust. As I said, I grew up on the streets of Brooklyn in the late 60's and early 70's and with the exception of characters like Georgette and Alberta and Goldie all of the characters are REAL to me. He ruined a perfectly good book with his sexual obesessions. I wish he had written more about a greater cross-section of characters. This could have been a GREAT book, and alas, is only mildly interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"brilliant from start to finish","review":"I know alot of fans stay loyal to the old soilwork style and i can understand why they would dislike this album. With this release, soilwork has incorporated melodic elements similar to natural born chaos and figure number five. If any of you In Flames fans enjoyed Reroute to Remain as much as their previous work, this is the same concept. Soilwork has become more popular( not sold out ) and much more accepting to the melotic death metal fans.

So pitiable to hear Bjorn awkwardly [attempt to] hit notes outside his vocal range. So ironic the album cover is proportional to the music in terms of boringness.Oh, but then there's \\"Blind Eye Halo,\\" the obligatory pseudo-thrash snoozer. The inclusion of this song means Soilwork are as great as ever, evidently. Too bad the drug industry could sell bits of this song to cure insomnia.Basically, this album is fail.

Soilwork has changed from melodic death metal to Nu-metal. Although I like this cd better than figure #5 which sucked beyond belief, this is a pretty good album if you are into nu-metal. Think simple riffs and classic hooks...that explains this album. If you want to listen to serious metal check out cipher system, bynight, mnenic, dark tranqulity and strid's side project with disarmonia mundi which kicks ass. I give this 2 stars because this is not Soilwork anymore...it is metal commercialized just like Killswitch and ill nino."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOO MUCH HYPE - NOT THEIR VERY BEST AT ALL","review":"Not as good as \\"NATURAL BORN CHAOS\\" and \\"FIGURE NUMBER FIVE\\". Absent are the more melodious guitar solos and ambient keyboard atmospheres. It seems that they are trying to please the mindless brutal pit moshers. \\"STABBING THE DRAMA\\" will not be very memorable at all - they do not demonstrate any evolution whatsoever.Overall, I am not that fond of this band - they are way inferior to fellow countrymen OPETH and DARK TRANQUILITY. Their style of METAL sounds like some contrived hybrid of FEAR FACTORY, CHAIMERA, MESHUGGA & INFLAMES - a bit too cyber/industrial sounding with nu-metal/metalcore attributes. According to my taste and standards, this is not true METAL at all. Just alot of noise and punch. Anyone who says that this is some of the best metal they have ever heard probably does not have very diversified taste in music and not much listening experience.Spend no more than $3.00 for this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well it's not a COMPLETE trainwreck...","review":"I think Soilwork reached their peak with Natural Born Chaos. Figure Number Five showed us Soilwork reaching for a commercial direction, and Stabbing the Drama is the final execution of that idea.I want so bad to like this album, but I could only recoil in horror as \\"Fate in Motion\\" played through and I came to the realization that it sounded like a Korn song. I don't even mean \\"one riff sounded Kornish\\" or \\"this chorus sounds Korn-like\\", but the SONG AS A WHOLE.There are moments of their past glory scattered about an album which is, as a whole, mostly commercial nu-metal pop trash. As an example, while I like chocolate, I don't especially like feces with chocolate chunks mixed in.A tolerable album, but mediocre and a slap in the face to their previous work. Melodic death metal fans should buy Dark Tranquillity - Character or Insomnium - Since The Day It All Came Down instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a winner","review":"I thought this album would have really stood out from the other soilwork albums, the vocals aren't strong enough, the heaviness in this album is a low down, pretty calm and mellow, (track 3) weapon of vanity probably a good track. 2 stars; one for the mixed around drum work, and another star for the bonus track."},{"rating":"1","title":"These guys are from gothemburg?","review":"Come on guys this albumn is not amazing or briliant. I mean aside from a few decent riffs, this hinges on nu-metal. I hate to say this about a band that Dark Tranquility actually praised but its true. The songs ,as stated in other reviews, are simple and extremely formulated. The are some catchy songs but hell nu-metal and metalcore have these. I read the albumn label and it said the Swedish Metal Masters are back, come on. They should be considered lucky to be in the same breath as the three kings (In Flames, Dark Tranquility, At the Gates) of Swedish Metal. If your into Mudvayne or Slipknot buy this. If you like hellashiously kick ass music buy early In Flames or DT."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the hell happened?","review":"What is this crap?

However, these 101 things you never knew were 101 things even my child knew. Aside from the \\"101 things\\" listed are already in many Disney books, the book is poorly written.

To a Disney fan, very disappointing. To a fourth grader, rather insightful."},{"rating":"1","title":"disneyland book","review":"I didnt think this book was worth the money.

Maybe it is simply the woman in me that enjoys reading of a great love tale, but this novel truly hit me. In the beginning Lloyd is a man that would not think twice about dating a Japanese woman simply because of her race. But as time goes on, and the storyline progresses, his perspective begins to shift. He sees Hana-ogi not as a JAPANESE woman, but as a warm-hearted, loving human being. And although both of their careers forbid their relationship, neither one of them is willing to give up the bond they share. Their friends Joe Kelly and Katsumi are only another example of how love conquers, or rather, should conquer, all. Sayonara is not just a sappy love story. It is a tale of struggle and the overcoming of obstacles merely to be with the one you were meant to be with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"This is a beautiful tale of love and war.

Although the ending was very sad, the message was a very important one. The book was intriguing from the first page. It was not dull or boring at any moment. Major Gruver was a very accomplished and intelligent man. In the book it was interesting to see the changes he underwent; at first, this man would not even acknowledge a Japanese woman in public but after he opened up and gave these women a second look, he not only talked to them, but he fell in love. More people need to make that change in life because so many times people get overlooked and pushed aside because they are of a different race. In this book it was not only individuals who did not agree with the entangling of people from two totally different cultures, but the United States Air Force as a group did not agree with it either; they did not understand the strength that love has on mankind. Sayonara is a truly amazing love story who's message and lessons should be known world-wide."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glory to God Alone: The Life of J.S.Bach","review":"The movie is ok, but low-key and not the highest quility.

I have an Audi A4, which got the highest crash test rating for side impact collisions, and was hit on the passenger side of the car by a lady who ran the red light. The car seat held up well...but the head supports on the side of the chair that are supposed to be a luxury of the chair actually injured my childs face. The support was crushed into her temple.

I gave it the 2 stars I did because my daughter is comfortable in it. However, when I pull the silver release down to get her out, it refuses to work. One side doesn't work at all and the other one on the other side (which of course is not the one by the door) works only after several tries. Lucky for me my daughter is patient. One time it took us 5 minutes to get her out. That is a long time for a 3 year old. It also sits very low and the cup holder is a joke since it clearly states not to use it with any hard cups, only styrofoam or paper. In the car we use sippie cups to help eliminate spills. I think a cup holder for a kid car seat should hold cups made for kids. I am returning it to the store and about to try the Eddie Bauer one. I hope I have better luck.

Boy, was I wrong. I love that it is latch compatible. But as many other parents have said, the straps cut across your child's thighs instead of resting on the hips where they belong. The buckle between the legs is placed impossibly close to the body even after adjustment, so that it crushes the child (especially not good for the little boys). My son immediately complained that the buckle hurt his crotch and that he didn't like it.If anyone has had luck with a good, LATCH compatible carseat, please let me know.

The sales rep at BBRUS actually recommended this seat, so we bought it and I HATE it...the buckle between her legs is way too short, so I pinch her almost every time I put her in the seat. THEN, the actualy silver buckles get stuck underneath the seat, and it takes me forever to find the buckle, loop them back up to where I can snap her in.

This film deserves a full restoration so that new generations can enjoy this well-told tale based on a Hans Christian Anderson story. Its sweetness, imagery and production design is second to none.

However, I thought this was a bootlegged copy because there are really weird grinding engine noises mixed in! I am very unhappy with this recording."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so Great Stink","review":"Although I admire Clare Clark's effort and the amount of time she must have researched before writing this novel, a story of murder in the sewers of London in the 1850's, wasn't enough to hold my interest. I think she has great writing ability. Her descriptions in the sewer are palpable but could not hold the paper thin plot together. Nice try but I pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unpleasant reading","review":"This book was very well written, but i gave it only 2 stars because reading page after page about the contents of the London sewers was extremely unpleasant to me. I had a general idea of what I was getting into when I started reading, but was still unprepared for what was to come. Stories don't have to be \\"pretty\\" for me to enjoy them, and I read a lot murder mysteries with no problem. I had to take a log shower after reading this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"not for me","review":"The book concerns a man who works in the actual sewers below the streets of London. I expected that from the description but what I didn't expect was the lengthy and vivid descriptions of floating feces, mold, and rats...including descriptions of characters actually falling into the above. It was so vivid I actually felt sick after the first few chapters and stopped reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"The cruel irony of a too revealing title.","review":"The descriptive passages are far more artful than the vast majority of common fiction on the market. But what fun are beautiful words about ugly subjects such as sewer stench, rotting corpses, dog fights, and the twisted dreams of the delirious? It is more gross than engrossing. And by the end of the book the only character I cared about was the dog. Clearly, the author has great talent, but this book wastes a lot of eloquent prose for want of a compelling plot and characters worth knowing."},{"rating":"1","title":"title says it all","review":"There must be 5,000 ways to describe the effluvia of London, and unfortunately for the reader, Clark attempts them all.She breaks up the crap with tepid, repetitive descriptions of self-mutilation and rollicking accounts of rat-fighting terriers.The only person in the book who might possibly, one day, crack a smile is the main character's wife, who is, of course, a cardboard-character imbecile.Yuck. Repulsive. And I deal with gore and feces everyday at work. I love the grim picture of the author on the book jacket. No doubt she's a barrel of laughs at a dinner party."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is a stinker, all right.","review":"I love to read, and I was drawn to this book because I thought it would be a fun read as well as educational. Unfortunately, I found the book to be depressing and ugly. The book was not so much educational as it was appalling and of little redeaming social value. My one-word review of this book is \\"Bleeck.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Great stink does NOT","review":"Very interesting setting and storyline. The writing is sophisticated and well done. I would recommend this book to others who are not just searching for a quick mindless read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting book of celebrity death","review":"I found myself hardly able to put this huge book down once I started it. I have to agree with some of the other reviewers, some of the facts of the book are wrong, but overall I found it to be an interesting read. If you are into the true crime genre and are interested in celebrities, then this is the book for you! It proves also that just because you are rich and famous that doesn't exclude you from having something tragic and unexpected happen to you.

My listening skills have improved dramatically, since the video is the main learning tool, which forces one to sharpen up and really listen to what's going on. The workbook that accompanies Destinos is really detailed, making it possible to learn a considerable amount of Spanish grammar on one's own. Overall, the best Spanish textbook I've used yet! ¡Adiós!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Destinos rules!","review":"okay, if you don't like Destinos, then you just aren't with the picture.

It was simple to put together and has nice adjustable foot supports in all 4 corners. If I needed another bed frame I would purchase another one of these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Wide?","review":"The frame of this bed seemed a few inches too wide for the box spring. I had to shift my full sized bed several times and center it close to the edge of either side to keep it from falling between the side slats of the frame. The middle slat is the reason the bed has not collapsed entirely to the floor. The shipping cost was, in my opinion, way too expensive. The frame does serve the purpose it was intended for, but you will save a lot of money by going out and buying one instead of having it shipped."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad,because after few days they said that the idem is undeliberable","review":"they never send me the idem,because they didn,t want to pay for delivery, so i still looking for the same idem"},{"rating":"1","title":"An adventure that you aren't sure how it will end...","review":"This book is based on a 1995 ferry accident that happened in Malaysia. By interjecting the main character, Emily, an American living in Malaysia on board, we get to see what it was like for the lucky ones- those who could swim. Emily, angry at her parents for bringing her around the world while they try to heal the sick children of third world countries, decides to go visit her uncle, who is visiting a nearby island. She never suspects the ferry ride won't make it to the other shore. The book will disgust you at times, thinking of all the time wasted to get to people like Elizabeth, or how people act in the face of living or dying. You can't be so sure with this one how the story will end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read!","review":"Emily lives in Sumatra with her do-gooder physician parents. She hates where she lives because she feels isolated and unwanted. After a tift with her parents she \\"runs away\\" to a nearby island to visit her uncle, but the boat she is on sinks.Emily is stuck in the warm water, fighting for her life. She comes across Ishman, a young Muslim boy who leaves his fate in the hands of Allah. Emily fights to save both of them, fighting against fatigue, exhaustion, dehydration, and starvation.This book is about hope and the fight to stay alive. It is a reminder why we should never give up...even when the cards are stacked against us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Illustrations are worth a thousand words....","review":"This is one of the most beautifully illustrated children's books I've ever seen and I've been a librarian for over 30 years. Few books bring tears to my eyes and this did. A treasure!"},{"rating":"2","title":"no title","review":"A terribly bittersweet, hauntingly powerful novel about Roy Calvert, first seen in \\"Time of Hope\\". A manic-depressive, I think. Perhaps it was not so recognized in the 30's and early 40's when this takes place. A very memorable and sensitive portrait of the love and friendship that can exist between two heterosexual men, as it delicately portrays the compassion and caring they come to share, Roy, and Lewis Eliot, the narrator. Melancholic and sad, yet a wonderful book. Just as striking as two others, \\"Time of Hope\\" and \\"The Conscience of the Rich\\", but even more poignant. The last line could not be more perfect. Snow is a master of the human psyche and condition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"There are a few great stories in here, but the rest are quite mediocre, and I was surprised to find this after all the rave reviews here! Only worth it to read one or two stories - the first one and the last one in particular - and then skip the rest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Bisexual Women's Erotica","review":"Bisexual women are a novelty lately. Case in point: Ally McBeal is bi-curious. I suppose thousands of men got off watching Ally tongue kiss her co-worker, Ling (soft g), and maybe a few thousand women wondered if they ought to try it, too. If this is where your interest in this book originates, I say your interest is healthy, but don't anticipate the authors within to expose their sex lives for curiosity alone. Bisexuality is not merely a fad to try on but a hot and satisfying endeavor that sticks. More importantly, the voices in this collection speak of bisexuality as normal; it's natural. A bisexual woman once asked me, \\"Where's my people?\\" and I told her, \\"They're in here.\\" Kudos..."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best erotica collection I've read","review":"My God, I couldn't believe how great the stories in this book were. They touched me deeply, and what's more, they were HOT! Finally, a collection of sexy stories that focuses on women just like me -- bisexual women. It's so affirming to read this great book. This is by far the best collection of erotica I've ever read, and I recommend it to everyone!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"HOT!","review":"This is the best book of bisexual erotica I've found yet! Creative stories that acually HAVE a storyline, great sex scenes (with a minuimum of anal sex, one of my main complaints about the Best Bisexual books) and a lot of fun!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very sexy...","review":"I purchased this book for my girlfriend for Christmas (we are a bisexual couple) and I was very excited since there is so little bisexual erotica or literature available. Well let's just say, we were quickly disappointed when we started reading it. We keep reading in the hope that one of the stories would be worth our while. I found most of them rather disturbing. There were several really just plain gross stories. I wouldn't even call many of them 'bisexual.' It was more like a collection of stories about gay people who either 'strayed' or cheated with someone of the opposite sex. There are several stories that mention rape, having sex in back rooms or porn theaters, or with hookers. If you want a gritty read, this could be the choice for you but if you're looking to read about steamy sex maybe you should look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what we were expecting","review":"My wife and I purchased this book and we weren't happy with it at all. I know that bisexual could mean guy-on-guy just as much as it could mean girl-on-girl, but we just weren't expecting it. Already, we found two stories in the book with this theme showing up and for people that have no interest in it at all, it really kills the story. Additionally, some stories are just plain boring. They work up to what could be an interesting climax, but then they just end. Some stories go into great depth setting the environment and mood, but cover the actual sexual acts in like two paragraphs. We were definitely not satisfied with the book and will have to be a lot more careful before spending money on other erotica books. I was very confused because so many people wrote positive reviews on this book. Oh well, to each their own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ho Hum","review":"Boring. Better bi-sexual erotica on the internet. Nothing for the bi-curious woman. It was an easy, fast read and if you like the short story format then this might appeal to you.

Perhaps it is my own taste. I think there are too many rave reviews about this book to warrant that it is THE VERY BEST. It is good but my socks weren't knocked off.

Morrison has failed to mention any form of Humanism in her dream symbols- I doubt if she has received any dreamwork or psychological training whatsoever. Take the example of a dream about gallows. As a dream healer, I would be interested in finding out the client's associations of gallows, and would link that more to do with cutting off or severing unwanted ties, or of having them cut off by someone else. It may have something to do with anger. I would not advise the client that they are \\"sick\\" and in \\"serious need of psychological help\\" [sic]. Every time I have a client or someone asking for advice on getting a good dream book, I always make a point of telling them not to get this one- it is the worst example of dream explanations I have ever had the displeasure of reading, and I am gald you are out of stock- TAKE IT OUT OF PRINT AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the witch?","review":"This was one of the most useless books I have ever read. It is full of very random dream items. However, it lists very few everyday images that appear in dreams. The author often uses the same item several times by listing it under different names. In addition, the author plugs her husband's amulets in several sections. Finally, for a \\"witch's\\" book, there were many references to Christianity and very few to the Wiccan faith. All in all, it read like a Christian thesaurus of religious conversion, not a dream interpretation aid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total mis-information; complete subject ignorance!","review":"After reading this book I was completely insulted and horrified that it could even make it to print! As a real-life witch, I am totally offended by the book's comments and feel that the author has absolutely NO real knowledge of Witches, Witchcraft or any Goddess religion.

It is well written and complex, in plot and detail. However, I have only read about half, so the following opinion may change. I have just this to say at the moment - WHAT IS THIS WOMAN'S PROBLEM WITH THE IRISH? If the subjects of this acrimony were African-American or Jewish the book would never have made it to print!

The premise of this book has promise- tracing an accordian's journeys through time and owners, giving the reader a sense of the many cultures within American life. But the bottom line was that the book was too wordy, too long, and not very compelling. I couldn't identify well with the characters even in the abstract. If you want to be exposed to a story with this same fascinating theme- only much cleaner- see \\"The Red Violin\\" in VHS or DVD. It, too, traces the path of a musical instrument (a violin)though many owners and countries. However, the pace is much swifter and the characters are more engaging."},{"rating":"1","title":"Laborious","review":"This book was so disjointed that I quit halfway through. The concept of the accordion through time was interesting, but I cared nothing about any of the characters except the original owner of the accordion. I had to make myself read the book, so I quit. The Shipping News was much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"So boring I forgot I was reading it","review":"First, let me say that I probably can't come up with 5 books in my life that I didn't finish once I started (I'm a finisher). This is one of them. Second, this is the first book I've ever forgotten that I was reading - seriously, something reminded me about this book and I thought to myself \\"did I ever finish that?\\" and I found the book and had gotten about halfway through (and I will say it was painful to get that far). The problem as noted by those that gave it a few stars was \\"who cares?\\" I didn't care for the accordians, people or anything else as everything was so forgettable - as I plodded along I'm asking myself \\"why am I wasting my time here?\\" and then eventually I must have picked up something else and truly did forget about it. I wanted to like this book, but never managed to care."},{"rating":"1","title":"I love Proulx's writing, BUT...","review":"...this novel was simply the most depressing thing I've ever read... and I've read VOLUMES of memoirs from Holocaust survivors.Don't get me wrong-- I am ALL FOR a \\"sad\\" story, or one that doesn't have a \\"happy ending,\\" but I DO expect a written work to actually take me somewhere-- I want to finish a book and feel that I've been taken on a journey, that I am better for having read it, no matter how \\"down\\" the conclusion may be.But this book doesn't live up to that one, VERY MODEST, criterion. I finished this book, and all I could think was \\"DAMN, I really wish I hadn't read that.\\"As much as I love Proulx, and as much as I hate censorship, I have to admit that when I moved, I threw this book in the trash rather than toss it in the box of books destined for the local library. I just couldn't wish it on anyone else..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievably Macabre","review":"When my book club picked this as a selection I was looking forward to reading another book by the author of \\"The Shipping News\\"(which I enjoyed). Unfortunately, this novel was so different in style that it was a complete disappointment.The story follows the history of an accordian as it changes ownership over the years. The concept is a tried and true one(as illustrated in \\"Hitty, Her First Hundred Years\\" by Fields), but this book does it no justice. Each of the owners meet their demise or a disaster in horrible ways. I, personally, was not ready for such violence and would not have finished this novel if it wasn't for the book group. If there was a rating of zero stars, this is one book that would warrant it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too sad - so bad!","review":"This is the only book that the 12 members of our book group have agreed upon - our books are for sale to anyone who will take them! We found the premise intriguing until we met the very unlikable characters and read their depressing stories. The only saving grace at this discussion was the entertainment provided by a member who played her accordion for us. None of us had any idea that her mother loved Lawrence Welk so much that she insisted that her two daughters learn to play in order to entertain family and friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book needs a soundtrack, and luckily you can get one","review":"Someone gave me \\"Accordion Crimes\\" for a gift because I play the accordion. After reading the nasty and brutal first chapter I put the book down, but the person who gave it to me asked me how I liked it, so I had to pick it up again. On second reading I reversed my judgement-- It's a wonderful book. The trick is that the people aren't the characters, the accordions are. The flawed and prejudiced human characters are merely vehicles for transmitting accordion music. The people never quite understand the nature of the treasure they are holding (like the thousand dollar bills hidden inside the little green buttonbox), because they let their own prejudices get tangled up in their music even though the music itself transcends human constructed boundaries. \\"Accordion Crimes\\" together with the recording \\"Planet Squeezebox\\" would make a nice set since it would give the reader a chance to actually hear the amazing music this book is about"},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh, how I wish I wrote this book!","review":"Take heart, undecided readers. There are paragraphs and scenarios in this book that you will go back to again and again because they are so marvelous, so rich. I literally laughed for 20 minutes at the fool who gave his wife a surprise party when she was pre-menstrual and looking like hell. Her subtle chiding of him and the fire brigade leaving in the middle of the night were some of the funniest truths to be written in a long time.The travails of the accordian's disparate owners were sad. And all the while, I thought of a most appropro notion: if only the instrument could talk!A wonderful read, one that makes me glad of my own life."},{"rating":"1","title":"nancy's review","review":"I have enjoyed a lot of Annie Proulx books, but this one is my least favorite. The people who own and love accordians all come across as losers. This made me depressed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreary and misanthropic","review":"I have to admit that after reading this book I asked myself what might have happened to E. Annie Proulx between the time she wrote the wonderful, life-affirming \\"Shipping News\\" and the relentlessly dark \\"Accordian Crimes.\\" Did some disaster befall her to change her view of the world and humanity?In \\"Shipping News\\" we met all kinds of people, both good and bad--some good but full of human foibles, some not so likable. They hurt each other; they make true human connections. Not so for most of the characters in \\"Accordian Crimes.\\"Though of course to some extent the American Dream is a myth, I believe the true story of American immigration is much more complex and varied than the ugly tale that Proulx tells in \\"Accordian Crimes.\\"I just read the positive review of Proulx's new book of short stories in The Washington Post. I think I'll wait and get the book out of the library rather than spend my money until I find out which Annie Proulx wrote this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"How Much Tragedy Can I Cram In","review":"Every kind of tragedy is crammed into this novel. Written for movie rights maybe? The concept of following an accordian could have been interesting. The one star I gave it was for the descriptions of accordians - a subject with which I was unfamiliar. If you want to know about accordians, go to an encyclopedia; don't bother with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing, pointless, no redeeming qualities","review":"With great expectations, our reading group, all fans of Annie Proulx, took up Accordion Crimes. Alas, we were unanimous in our profound disappointmen. Nowhere in the book did there appear a shred of hopefulness, a bit of redemption, any glimmer of relief from the relentless pessimism and heavyhanded grimness. The characters themselves were unlikable, for the most part, and the view of humanity in this book is worthy of the most confirmed misanthrope. None of us in the reading group could understand what the point of this whole exercise was. A waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"scary... not in the good way either","review":"Some gray, murky metaphors, adjectives, etc. happen in this book, but I found the WHOLE thing completely inaffective.Let's just say it's the only book in my entire life that I returned to the bookstore AFTER I had read it, just because I didn't want it the book as a physical object in my house."},{"rating":"1","title":"A monumental disappointment","review":"After The Shipping News, I couldn't wait to read Annie Proulx's latest. She had been able to grasp a unique Canadian culture of Newfoundland so well, I expected more of the same or better in Accordian Crimes. This is not a book, just a weak collection of depressing and unsatisfying short stories that do nothing to create empathy with the characters. Not a character here you would want to meet. The theme: the American dream unmasked is a good one. No plot, no unifying idea other than the little green accordian which moves along as each owner dies or loses it. I had to force myself to finish it. If this had been Annie Proulx's first book, no one would buy the next."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing, Contrived","review":"The reviews were so good that I couldn't wait to read this book...and my expectations were high after the wonderful \\"Shipping News\\". The idea behind \\"Accordian Crimes\\" was brilliant; the result, a momumental disappointment. Proulx presented flat undeveloped characters, a choppy story line, and an unbelievable denouement. I keep reading only in hope that I would find a point to the whole thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interminable","review":"I have been reading this book for months, am almost done with it, and I still don't know if I'll ever finish it, it is that uninteresting. This author writes marvelous prose and I loved \\"The Shipping News\\", however, I have been totally unable to develop an interest in the characters, the accordion, the crimes; the total absence of humanity in any of these characters is remarkable. Should one become slightly interested in the fate of one of these families, it is too late, as they will be devastated by a weird calamity and that will be the end of them. This book was eminently putdownable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"After reading all the raves about Shipping News (which I have not read), I found Accordian Crimes in the bargain bin of the local bookstore, so I thought I would give it a try. The book is readable, but it is essentially a collection of depressing (and troubling) short stories. I was expecting an actual NOVEL. The characters seem to be either horrendously unlucky or incredibly stupid. The plot would come to a conclusion just when I feel I am getting into the storyline. In short, I do not much care for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I dare you to finish this book","review":"This is the most bloody Annie Proulx novel yet, with very little redeeming social value. After the fourth \\"crime\\" which only took me through about one-third of the book, I just gave up, not being attracted by any continuity which were present in Annie Proulx's other novels, \\"Shipping News,\\" and \\"Postcards.\\" In the case of \\"Accordion Crimes\\" the attempt at continuity is provided by the accordion of the title, which witnesses the various crimes of murder, lynching, adultery, drug trafficing, etc. In \\"Postcards,\\" despite the gimmick of the hand printed or typewritten postcards which precede many chapters, it is the vitality of Loyal Blood, the main character, which compels us onward and maintains our interest. Similarly, Quoyle, in \\"Shipping News\\" compels us with his dogged and tender nature. The accordion of the present novel just does not have such a compelling personality. However, if you like a challenge, I dare you to finish this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crimes Against Fiction","review":"I have read everything that Annie Proulx has written. At her best, as in \\"The Shipping News\\" and \\"Close Range: Wyoming Stories,\\" Proulx is unlike any author I've encoutered; her characters and landscapes burn with rage, passion, hardship and survival. However, in \\"Accordion Crimes,\\" Proulx violates her readers' trust with implausible stories of gratuitous gore. The pretext for her lurid vignettes is a green accordion that passes to various immigrant families, whose members are dismembered in gruesome detail. While these stories may entertain a few execrable sociopaths, Proulx risks the alienation of her enthusiasts. One can only hope that this work is the aberrant creation of an otherwise unique and remarkable talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing, dreary read with very little payoff","review":"I am always skeptical when a writer creates characters of other ethnic groups than her own: sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. Annie Proulx clearly did her research on this one, but while the stories seem factually plausible, none of her cast of immigrant characters ever really rises above the level of stereotype. It is as though the writer understands the facts behind them, but not the feelings. The result is like a lite, sixth-grade-social-studies trip through the history of immigration in America, with the accordion (and the unrelenting bad luck that goes with it) as a flimsy plot device.I loved Proulx's first novel, The Shipping News. But I wish I hadn't bought this book or spent the time it took to read it. My advice: save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"An aggravating book","review":"The premise sounded really promising -- an accordian ends up in the hands of very different people in succession and bears witness to a part of each of their lives. But none of the characters were worth witnessing. Worse than that, however, was the annoying style in which the book was written. One paragraph might be made up of one unbelievably long run-on sentence, separated by lots of commas, while the next might be twenty short little sentences. It was too distracting -- particularly for a weak book that could not hold up under any distraction. Pass on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple, delicious recipes","review":"This book teaches cooks how to create delicious, seasonal foods out of simple ingredients. He also includes stories linked to the traditions of Tuscany. It is an unusual cookbook in that Pino Luongo doesn't include amounts of ingredients but that seems to aid in the educational process. It's okay to make food based on taste rather than exact amounts. I definitely recommend this cookbook."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought provoking","review":"This book is amazing.

The offerings here are the same tracks previously released on the U.S. \\"Bliss\\" maxi-single. There is a very moving version of my favorite song of hers to date, \\"hey Jupiter,\\" and a pleasing rendition of the Amos fan favorite \\"Upside Down\\" (one of Amos's favorite songs). Bottom line: buy the \\"Bliss\\" maxi single instead, it's less money, less of a hassle, and still just as pleasing."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love Tori!","review":"I absolutely love tori and am actively purchasing all of her singles, and this is a great one to own! Hey Jupiter live is exceptional, a combination of the lp version and the remix. Just fabulous. Upside Down is also great live, as any tori fan would agree.

You'll just become frustrated and even more wide awake. Get up at the same time but make going-to-bed time late enough so you'll be sure to be sleepy. If you still can't fall asleep go do something else until you are sleepy. The reason your cat doesn't suffer from sleeplessness is that she sleeps when she's sleepy and prowls when she's not. Insomnia is a byproduct of our civilization's insistence on schedules. You can't force yourself to sleep. Don't try. It is better to try to understand what your body wants to do and go along with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Practical and Simple","review":"A very good, practical book. Although at first blush, the advise almost seems overly simple, it works. I guess, like lots of good ideas and advise, sometimes simple is the best. I've suffered from insomnia on and off for about 25 years and I've tried most everything, including sleeping pills. I've been doing this program now for about 3 weeks and it has definitely improved my sleep. In those 3 weeks, I've had maybe 3 bad nights, and even those nights weren't as bad as what I used to consider bad. In addition to sleeping better, I have an extra hour or two at the end of the day because of how this program works. Over the years, I've read quite a bit about insomnia and sleep, like all of us insomniacs probably have, but I would say this book contains the most practical advise. While this program may not cure everyone's insomnia, at a minimum, it will certainly help everyone who has insomnia that is not related to some type of underlying physical condition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Required reading to understand today's world.","review":"Anyone who has heard the terms \\"Apocalypse\\", \\"Rapture\\" or \\"Antichrist\\" but doesn't really know what they mean should own this book.

To me that is the disrespect. The symbols are universal love, and wouldn't you agree that we could use as much love as we can get? Our planet is suffering because of the lack of love, the abundance of greed and hate. The mentality that this is mine, and I will not share it is destroying our planet. The symbols are meant for everyone, as we are all part of the universal love. I feel that Weave did the opposite here.

The system they give for studing on your own makes it so much easier to really get an idea of what the individual chapters are about and what the big picture for that particular book is.

The reason I gave this CD only four stars is because I'm really not crazy about some of its other songs, specifically \\"Happy Jack\\" and \\"Boris the Spider\\" (ESPECIALLY \\"Boris the Spider\\"). Nevertheless, if you own Tommy, Who's Next, or especially Quadrophenia (the story of a young mod who grows up crazy), you need to add this import to your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"An essential collection","review":"This perfectly covers the early who singles.

Any older than that, though, and it might be a bit 'below' them, agewise.Especially good for kids who like music and dancing, as my nieces do. It was also a hit because they're used to interacting with on-screen video games (Playstations and a Wii, for example), so the DVD interaction added interest that a regular board game would not.It's a game all can play together at the younger ages, however, and stay busy with it (at least 20 minutes by themselves, or until someone argues or gets hurt, or needs mommy, anyway ;->!)A perfectly harmless (meaning not obscene or rude or violent in any way--which is nearly extinct these days!), fun, somewhat educational (helps with coordination and gameplaying, among other things) experience for the youngsters."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the best works of all time!","review":"They have the blood of the pop formula, were more than just a band of 80 years, one chord and the voice and soon you know who are they, the Eurythmics for some ... and the blond beast, for others the great producer and singer extraordinary that this was the first single released the song 17 again gives a summary of the trajectory of the color band with a personal touch that connects them all to the listener. the power of the voice of Annie Lennox great touch of the production of Dave Stewart, is a perfect set of a strong and melodious song, excellent product - a collector's must-have!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Real Hero","review":"David Christian is \\"Real Hero\\".

If you have ever read any books by men who told the truth about the war, you will not be able to believe a word Mr. Christian has written. He comes across as being so conceited.

This book dishonors Vietnam veterans by painting an obviously false account of David Christian&#65533;s war experience.

Over a year the center collar was quite chewed up, if I had decided to keep this system I would have needed to replace the collar by next year.I've moved to an all metal baffle system (Stokes Select 38046) and while I have no doubt that the squirrels will figure a way around it, I won't have to worry about them getting around the system by destroying the product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rip-off","review":"This is not a true soundtrack album, but just some music taken directly from the movie put on CD.

The whole reason to play Rainbow Six games was for slow, tactical, and squad based game play. Lockdown has NONE of these features.No longer can you plan out your missions on a map. This lack of planning leaves you wandering around or traped in a linear map without options of attack. You only have one squad, instead of the usual 3. The sound was just... aweful; All of the weapons sounded like cap guns. If you want to be quiet and tactical, forget it... This game is made for running and gunning. I could go on and on about this crappy, crappy game, but I don't want to waste anymore time on it.The only reason I give a 2 overall is for the graphics. Those were nice, but good visuals don't make a good game.Skip this one, and hope that this company gets it right next time around.

If you liked Ghost, you'll like Lockdown. You make your commands on the fly. Graphics are great. But you have to have a pretty strong computer.

Your team is SO stupid you'll want to just keep sending them back to the start point to keep them alive and out of your way. The enemy AI also becomes boring in how they always do and say the same thing over and over. I turned the game difficulty all the way up, and it's still just a 'yawn festival'.

Your teamates blame you for shooting them while they get in front of you in the first place. Breach and clear? Call it Breach and stand there and throw and clear. Teamates open the door all the way (yes, they don't open it a bit and then use that small opening to throw a grenade!) and take about 3 seconds to throw a grenade, which usually ends up with a incapacitated teammate full of grenade sharpenel.2.

Fundamentally, her voice is among the most beautiful and resonant of any singer-songwriter working today, and it is her remarkable range that makes the unique and agile melodies of _Plumb_ possible. Yes, Jonatha's songwriting is equally stunning: her lyrics hold their own as poetry (moreso than later albums) and are buoyed by intricate musical arrangements created with her (now ex-)husband and producer Alain Mallet. Many of the songs evoke beautifully the longing and melancholy of failed relationships; others address such complicated subjects as divorce, war, rape, and the record industry.

The company knew that this phone had issues since the very beginning but they don't acknowledge and don't want to do anything about it. 30 to 40 minutes to get to speak with a representative. Stay away.I will NEVER purchase a vtech phone."},{"rating":"1","title":"worked well at first","review":"The phone worked well at first. I was very pleased and bought 2 more phones for family. But after about 1 year use it fell apart. The battery is useless and only lasts a year. After that you need to buy another battery which is very hard to find. I had to order it online. Recently the phone has been dropping calls and I must replace the phone. As for the other 2 phones I purchased I am waiting to see. They aren't a year old yet. Good phone for one year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not waste your money","review":"I purchased this phone a couple months ago and it is horrible. The battery doesn't last through a 30 minute phone call. It constantly dies and has to be replaced on the charging base. I ended up buying a regular phone that plugs into the wall because this one is basically junk. I'm going to do my research and purchase a cordless phone that works. I do not recommend this phone unless you can afford the purchase of new batteries every month.... as other reviews point out, it's pretty, but doesn't hold a charge."},{"rating":"1","title":"Battery is wonky","review":"This phone has a bug. Sometimes when you answer it the battery drops to zero and you can't talk to whoever has just called you! And you can't call them right back because you have to wait for the handset to charge again. Also, you can't take the phone off it's cradle for any amount of time, like if you're expecting a call, without the battery draining within about 5 or 10 minutes. Customer support is non-existent.Sound is just fine though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Cordless Phone I've Ever Owned","review":"The phone has an absolutely horrible battery.

If you let the answering machine pick it up, the loudest volume on it is incredible low. (very frustrating). Sometimes when people call, I can't hear them well.

I'm shopping for another one now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Phone","review":"This is a good phone but the speakerphone goes in and out.

I called the customer service line and they told me that there might be some sort of electrical device thats interfering with the phone.

Negative / dissapointing issues include the fact that there is no speakerphone in the base, only in the handset. When left on the base the handset overheats. The microphone quality is not what I was expecting, sometimes with the volume too low even though is in max.The handset has time and date, but the screen is an old liquid crystal one, so it's barely visible unless you actually press a button and a light turns on.And most dissapointing, you can't record while using the phone, like most wireless phones with answering machines, feature I used a lot when I needed to take notes and had no pens around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Battery does not hold charge.

I purchased this phone on July 30, 2007 and have been unhappy with it for the last four months.The phone has developed a habit of losing it's connection to the base. When the phone is picked up from it's cradle and I press the button to talk, there is no dial tone. The handset will read \\"searching for base\\" or \\"unable to connect.\\" I must unplug the phone then plug it back in to be able to dial a number or speak on the handset.At first this behavior was intermittent, maybe once a month. Now it happens every two days. This is unacceptable in any phone made in the twenty-first century.Today I am buying a new phone.

I would love to have the book contain more of Evans art but would not give up the text. Mary Lyons has conveyed the social difficulties of being African-American in the early twentieth century not by \\"preaching\\" but by letting the story speak for itself. The result is a book that is appealing both for its art and for its social conscience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book for beginners","review":"Yes, this book is an excellent basic book, for people who are just knitting their first knots, which in this book are clearly explained, drawings included. So beginners, this is an ideal book. The book also offers instructions for some projects (not instructions for all of them), which could be inspiring. However, I think these projects belong to traditional art (folk art, I mean); they are not fashionable.

Do yourself a favor go and listen to the first two soundtracks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip It","review":"I was very excited about this album coming out, but I am sadly disapointed. It has totally steered away from Austin's 60's image to make a weird mix of random stuff The Hard Knock life with Dr. Evil is pretty bad, definetly nothing compared to the Just the Two if Us in the previous movie. \\"Work it Out\\" with Beyonce has a good beat, but gets boring fast!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply fun, NOT","review":"Previous A.P. soundtracks had been a brillant mix of original music/songs, classic pop/rock, and remixes that were almost as fun as the movies themselves. In contrast, the Goldmember soundtrack won't get many people tapping their feet or smiling at the song choice or getting a kick out of the originally of the pseudo sixties song.

Another side note is the storage box this comes with, you must keep the connectors in their bags. If you don't, they will overflow into the other compartments if turned sideways. But like i said, i bought them for the termination ends only. I'm a happy customer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"The tool itself was rusted where each handle connects, it is hard to operate and does not close fully.

I picked this item because it was the cheapest one I could find that was compatible with cheap shipping. The wire stripping tool is so poorly made that there is a visible gap about 2-4mm between the where the two sides of the wire stripping area is supposed to meet; making it completely useless. The portion of the tool for wire cutting is meets poorly with the opposite edge as well, but is still usable. The crimping part of the tool seems adequate at first glance. I haven't tried it.

Darknesses continues the solid work begun in Legacies. The character of Alucius deepens his understanding of his Talent and capabilities. The reader gains more knowledge of Corus and the different powers within Corus.The interesting thing about Modesitt is that he always seems to like the ideas that he is working out more than he likes the reader. His books are not really that different from one another; they always seem like parts of the same larger project. When he gets it wrong (Spellsong cycle), then the novels become repetitive and tedious. When he gets it right, then there is a real reassuring quality that makes his work a pleasure to read.In the world of Modesitt, hard work and solid values are always rewarded. As a reader, it is often nice to have a little literary corner where this is true."},{"rating":"2","title":"a good second book in this trilogy","review":"Darkness is a good tribute to the world Modesitt has developed. A military tale, Modesitt delves into the everyday boredom and gut clenching combat of a company of mounted militia who are pawns in the game of nations.He also develops the powers Captain Alucius has and introduces the alien danger threatening the Corean world.Modesitt heroes are ordinary people with extraordinary powers achieving amazing tasks. Luck, tenacity and skill allows Alucius to not only preserve his life but the life of his men. But in combat, it is not enough and his men and friends die.This world is an interesting blend of mechanical technology with magical powers.

Back in the early '70s, I plucked this album out of the $1.99 cut-out bin. It was in regular rotation on my turntable during my first couple of years in college. These great songs flow as the ultimate Jerry Jeff \\"concept\\" album. Beautiful, introspective lyrics leavened with JJ's sardonic, world-weary sense of humor.

The music is tiresome and I would not recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"No way.","review":"To be fair, I was hoping for the \\"Formica Blues\\" Mono, but I gave it a chance anyway. If you're some sort of pretensious music snob with more desire to be \\"yourself\\" than taste in music, and you'd like to flame me for hoping that this was the \\"other\\" Mono, give it a rest. That is incredibly shallow. Plus, I'm sure that some people will be happy to know that this album would not interest them before wasting their money. The fact is...This is the most uneventful CD I have heard in a while. Way too repetitive (which is sometimes forgivable if it's not already boring like everything about this band except their excellent album art). If you're looking for the other Mono, pass this one up. A 10-year-old could make more interesting music on a shoddy keyboard.More than anything else, it sounds like a boring soundtrack to a boring movie.

It doesn't start to pick up until the last bit. Matt Damon's character is annoying as heck. You're forced to listen to his pointless thoughts which do nothing but bore you to tears.

I would never watch this movie again unless I was paid a nice amount of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can this be a Steven Soderbergh film?","review":"THE INFORMANT! has an exclamation point after the title for a good reason - it suggests that even the writers and actors as well as the usually superb Steven Soderbergh had a tough time figuring out how to make this story into an entertaining while quite implausible movie. Though based on a true story the movie is basically a running monologue by the hyperkinetic Matt Damon in a role that suits him not at all. At moments it seems like an outrageous comedy, then at others it appears as yet another appalling exposé of how big business and big politics intertwine to the detriment of our environment and moral deterioration. No one seems to know how to treat this piece, and maybe that is just as well. Keep the exclamation point after the title - that sort of tells it all. Side step this film if you are a fan of Soderbergh or Matt Damon. Grady Harp, February 10"},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time","review":"Normally, I love Matt Damon movies. He is a very talented actor and picks amazing movies to star in. But this movie was a complete waste of time. It's about a guy who thinks that he's being a hero and saving the world but he actually shoots himself in the foot by pissing off what few friends he has. Don't bother watching this movie. I can't believe he passed on playing Kirk in Star Trek for this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Matt Damon's worst!","review":"I had never seen a crappy Matt Damon movie until now. This is definitely his worst! I couldn't make it through the whole movie it was that bad. Can you say BORING?

How in the **** can that be? lol Better luck next time Matt!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Odd duck of a movie","review":"Based on a Wall Street Journal expose, this weird film never really explodes, but you do want to watch it because Matt Damon is great as an industrial geek who engineers a scheme to get control of his company by faking a price-fixing scandal and involving the FBI. The lies pile up, and we are never really too sure when reality sets in. It's odd material for a Hollywood movie because there's little action. It's mostly a character study of the lead man, whose quirks and foibles are emphasized by his frequent voice-overs, posed as his passing rapid non-sequitor thoughts. Interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Slow!","review":"This movie was terribly slow. There was an attempt at humor. An attempt, which seemed to work in the first 10 minutes, however, after 10 minutes of Damon saying quirky little things, one wants the plot to move along. I felt that this movie could have been good if they had tried to focus more on the twisted and warped mind of the lead character rather than trying to make Damon a comic. This movie fell very flat. By the end, I just wanted the movie to end and to have some resolution - it didn't matter what that was. I just wanted the movie to end! It was almost like they were trying to make a movie like Fargo, but didn't even come close. Do yourself a favor and save the two hours of your life that you can never get back!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Arguably The Most Boring Movie I've Ever Seen","review":"How anyone could give this utterly boring, convoluted movie more than 1 star is amazing to me. I fell asleep watching it on 4 different occasions; taking extra care on the last viewing not to start it too late, or drink too much before pressing play. The last time I tried watching it I made it to about the 60 minute mark, before collapsing. It is a shame because Matt Damon is a really great actor. His performance in the Talented Mr. Ripley was dazzling. I also loved his performance in \\"Team America\\" :-) Seriously though, this movie could have been so much better.

If I could've given it 0 stars I would've. First off, if you like corn and corn related products, then I say go right ahead and watch it if you can bear it. But, if you are not crazy about the yellow cobs and corn refineries then take my advice and look at something else. The previews looked funny but after watching less than half of this movie, I wanted to rip my hair out(that would have been more entertaining!) My family and I couldn't watch anymore of the movie so we put in 2012 instead.Overall, I give this two thumbs down. Very disappointing!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"watch the trailer - at least it's funny","review":"the trailer for The Informant! makes this movie look funny. it portrays the damon character (marc whiteacre) as a Maxwell Smart type character helping the feds bring down a corporation.that however is not what the movie is about.this actual movie centers around the damon character and his sanity.the laughs are few and far between and the movie just seems to plod along.it just wasn't very good and certailny not as advertised by the trailer (kinda like men who stare at goats -- damn funny trailer, weird, not so funny movie)."},{"rating":"1","title":"sorry there were no Amazon reviews yet when I pre-bought this","review":"This was one of the worse movies I have ever seen.

I held out hope for the Deleted Scenes on the Blu-Ray version that just came out today. Springfield residents, don't get suckered into buying this (like I did), because there are only a few deleted scenes, and they are pathetic at best; and NONE of them are any added footage shot in Springfield. I personally am through with Matt Damon films at this point."},{"rating":"1","title":"IT SURE ISN'T SCHIZOPOLIS","review":"Director Soderbergh's brilliant SchizopolisSchizopolis - Criterion Collectionhad my expectations raised too high for this, I thought, spiritless parody of American business. This sad, flat piece of fluff droned for its entire length, was overly convoluted, filled with irrelevant digressions and meaningless information. Hum-drummery at its most vapid worstHumor was dry drone, not droll, cynical and confusing. Confusing as to why SS didn't use anything but a drumming, metronome delivery, with everyone mumbling their way along in occasionally a quasi-documentary style. In other scenes, not much style at all. A grave disappointment. I guess OCEAN'S 11,12,13 just sucked the talent from Soderbergh. Hope he makes a come back, there was talent there, before."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really liked it...quirky","review":"This is a distinct movie and when I say distinct, I mean it won't appeal to most but it definitely appealed to me.

I love \\"Reel\\" and \\"Daughters of Erin\\" is beautiful also...a couple of the other vocal offerings are, in my opinion, fairly schmaltzy but wouldn't make me not enjoy the rest of this CD. The last cut on the CD, \\"Raise Your Voices\\" literally made me stop in my tracks when I had it playing for the first time and when it ended I backed it up and got out the insert to see what the lyrics were...it is truly beautiful and one I will play again and again. I ended up ordering the Norwegian version so I will be able to have the additional tracks that were cut from the US version. My advice would be to start with \\"White Stone\\" or \\"Dreamcatcher\\" both of which are really wonderful...but with the exception of a couple of the songs on this one I still think this is a pretty good CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"So it's not their best, so what?","review":"I hesitated to buy this CD because of the mixed reviews but I'm so glad I did because the compositions are all new and still well worth the money. The Irish lullaby Sleepsong is gently sung by Saoirse, a new voice, and Grace is a unique blend of trumpet and violin.The inspiring words to Raise Your Voices are especially relevant in these troubling times.Learn the words and sing along! Even the booklet is creatively done with interesting comments, pictures and all of Brendan Graham's lyrics. This is another Secret Garden to enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Peace of Mind Through Music","review":"Earthsongs is the perfect album to come home to after a long hard day of work.

One of the previous reviewers suggested trying to find the more complete Scandanavian version, but I ordered the double disc Korean version. It has 14 songs (includes Canzona & Silence Speaks, excludes Sarabande) and includes a bonus DVD that has 5 live songs and an interview. The DVD says it is region 0 and I had no problem playing it on laptop here in the USA.The live songs are:1. Nocturne2. Songs from a Secret Garden3. Adagio4. Poeme5. Passacaglia6.

Don't buy this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, But Not Their Best","review":"Personally, I wish Secret Garden would stick with pure instrumentals - it's what they do best.

As for the content, well, the text descriptions of some of the artists use interesting terms like \\"conceptual trigger,\\" but the photos of the art itself are small and dull on thin, uncoated paper. And as the descriptions of the artists read more like frommers than lonely planet (I.e. positive only), it's hard to value the text too much. Buy the \\"PS1 Greater New York 2005\\" instead.

Outstanding!","review":"I first heard of Buck Owens thru the Beatles' Act Naturally version back in 1965 or so. As time went on I began to appreciate Buck's remarkable band and talent. His records sounded so clean and featured twangy Fender guitars. His band leader, Don Rich was a model of restrained professionalism. Clean and accurate picking, not fast or flashy. Buck was an outstanding singer and his two part harmonies were his trademark. All these songs were No. 1s on the country charts and date from Act Naturally in 1963 to 1988's Streets of Bakersfield with Dwight Yoakum featuring Flaco Jiminez on accordian. WOW! What a great CD this is. There isn't a bad cut on it! If you only want one Buck Owens CD, this is the one!

And yes... I said 'album'. All great stuff; well, the attempt at a 60's pop-style tune (Who's Gonna Mow Your Grass) is, well... not so great, but the rest? Oh ya!And with that being said I'm not a huge country music fan. LOVE the old stuff, say maybe pre-1975 or so, but this collection - Love's Gonna Live Here, Tiger By The Tail, Your Tender Loving Care, etc. etc. I think you'll be glad you picked it up if you're here considering it.Final note: My opinion is that the Hee Haw thing - \\"I'm a pickin', and he's a grinnin'\\" - 'tainted' his talent/credibility a bit.

It too screws into the back plate but the threaded shank is longer, heavier and therefore stronger than the lightweight pot metal Delta used for their handle.

Well, eventually the new girl gets involved with a medical student and nature takes its course. This movie has value as a reflection of the times, but it is kind of a sad plot. Definitely not her usual happy go lucky dance films."},{"rating":"2","title":"Daring deads, Sinister schemes","review":"Where do they get the names for these albums?

Start to finish, this CD is hard to top. CD2 is also fantastic, a bit harder than 1, but nearly as good as disc 1. If you're a fan of AVB, you better have this CD set.

I listened too again a few days ago, and I no longer think it's the worst live cd, I have ever listened too, it's got a little better, or I gotten hard of hearing.

The album does include the two earlier Wetton band songs (\\"Starless\\" and \\"Book of Saturday\\") with their different arrangements.

When you listen to her back catalog now, the thing you most notice -- as many others have pointed out over the years -- is far too many covers, performed by a voice that is a beautiful instrument but with arrangements and a delivery that are blah in the extreme. At best, they leave you wondering why she and Asher bothered, if they weren't going to do something fresh with the songs; at worst, they leave you yearning for the originals.Her most realized albums from that period are those that introduced new material and/or reintroduced little-known gems -- \\"Hasten Down the Wind\\" and half of \\"Heart Like a Wheel.\\" \\"The Very Best of...\\" only highlights the fact that the very best of Linda Ronstadt is not nearly as good as it should have been."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing Too Many Hits","review":"There's no reason to omit the Top 10 hit \\"How Do I Make You?\\" from 1980.

The author begins by laying out the \\"geography of the soul\\" according to Ingmar Bergman, and then analyzes several of his films in light of this paradigm. I felt the author very correctly identified Bergman's central themes in his films and did an excellent job of explicating how these themes are manifested in his works. I had a college professor say to me once, \\"A medoicre book points out the obvious, a great book points out things that are not obvious;\\" this is definitely a great book.

It is the legend of the House of the Seven Gables that makes the novel interesting - the curse the House bears and those troubled characters living within neglected walls and shrouding darkness make for an intruiging read. I have to admit, though, that this book is a very heavy read for me. It seems unnecessarily poetic and lacking in action. At times my mind wanders from the words my eyes are habitually tracing across the pages, but there are other times when I am absolutely absorbed. But I'm only absorbed periodically for only about a third of the read, and overall it's just not working for me.

I could feel myself in that time and place. I did not find anything scary or romantic. Nathaniel Hawthorne said he considers this a great romance. I could find no romance so I think he was using a type of romance we in the 21st century do not understand. I was not able to connect to any of the people as real. The narrator did a wonderful job with giving each character their own voice as well Nathaniel Hawthorne his own point of view. If you can get into this story pleas write to me and let us see if I can understand why this is a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"better than the marble faun","review":"overall, the house is a great book, and the additional sources at the end of this critical edition provide excellent background information on what to look out for, according to various critics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost a total massacure of this classic gem...","review":"House of Seven Gables has been one of my favorite classics since the middle school days, decades ago. This review is of the CDs and the performance of the narrator himself, not about the novel. The reason I decided to buy it in the first place was becasue it was on sale for $15, and the fact that it's unabridged. Anthony Heald has terrible reading speed, he would pause at wrong places while not stopping at periods. Anyone that has read classic novels would know that most of them have long sentences with many semicolons, and conjunctions. He sounded like he's catching his breath quite often, and his pronounciation is kind of slurred as well. At least it didn't cost me that much. If you search for unabridged audio editions of this book, you'll find a few others by different companies, which all cost at least $30 or more. If you are poor then get this one, it's the cheapest. I'm certainly shopping for another set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great condition, too many shipping companies","review":"The book arrived in good condition, well-wrapped but I would hesitate to buy from here or anywhere again which uses DHL and then transfers the order to another company for delivery. The order was going from Texas to Calif, and could have reached here in just a few days if it had been just given to the USPS. Instead it traveled one and a half times around the country with DHL (according to the tracking record it went from Texas to Kentucky then finally to California, where it was given to USPS to deliver.) Yes, it arrived within the 19 days window, but that was a very silly route to take. At the same time another order of mine came from the east coast to here in only 3 days directly with the USPS. I've since heard from others that DHL is only convenient for global orders not domestic. Never again."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is Not for teenagers.","review":"This may be a good book for adults. I read it in 8th grade and could not stand it. It is very slow moving and descriptive. This is not what teenagers want."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Now, I know Nathaniel Hawthorne is a classic American writer, but this book was just terrible! I can see how this was considered a classic during his time, but now.... I have never heard of, seen, or read a book that was this descriptive. The author would just all of the sudden start describing something that had absolutely nothing to do with the plot. This description would go on for at least a page or two. There were maybe three major things that happened in this book. The rest was just in detail descriptions of people, places, and things. I do admit, he gives a good background on the story, but that is about all that's good about this book. I read this book only because I was required to, and I would have to say to anybody who was interested in this book for just pleasure, please, don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"At least I can say I read it","review":"I wish I could say I enjoyed it. The writing was excessively descriptive; the plot was plodding."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay....","review":"This is definitely not my favorite book. I just don't get it! I had to read it in school and was totally bored. The last two chapters were better, however. The whole Hepzibah and Judge Pyncheon thing are just so boring. Hawthorne goes off in HUGE explanations for EVERYTHING. There are much better works of literature in this world (a.k.a. Christy, Little Women, Stargirl)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Depressing, But a Classic","review":"This is a dark, but important work in American letters. The novel captures a key moment in America's development as a country in a way that feels timeless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hawthorne's Splendid Gothic Masterpiece","review":"Nathaniel Hawthorne's \\"The House of the Seven Gables\\", may not be as riveting as his \\"The Scarlet Letter\\", but still will be appreciated by those familiar with 19th Century psychological fiction as epitomized by, for example, Henry James, with more than a passing nod to Edgar Allen Poe. This is a complex tale spanning generations between the Pyncheons and the Maules; a blood feud which emanates from the infamous Salem witch trials. Hawthorne is a splendid writer of descriptive prose, and it is so descriptive, that I must confess I was confused occasionally as he goes back and forth between the late 17th Century Pyncheons and Maules and their mid 19 Century descendants. This novel isn't nearly as tragic as \\"The Scarlet Letter\\", ending on a somewhat hopeful, optimistic note."},{"rating":"2","title":"True depth of understanding required.","review":"If you want a fast paced action thriller, then rent a movie. This book has depth and meaning that only the \\"true\\" classics have. If you're into thinking for yourself and seeing a wonderful story unfold in your mind then this book is for you. And by the way, this can be understood by teenagers- I was 19 when I read it. I think the awful reviews are written by people with a lack of character, or perhaps maturity."},{"rating":"1","title":"The plot is way too slow!","review":"I know Nathaniel Hawthorne is one of the classic American authors but this book was not very good. For the most part, he took way too long explaining things in great detail that really had little to do with the main story. I don't recommend it, especially if you're planning to write a paper on it because it's too slow-moving to get you excited and thinking about the underlying meaning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big on Words.. Small on Plot","review":"If you're into action, suspense, comedy, humor, violence, excitement, or anything else normal people like, then DO NOT read this book. It has a very slow moving plot, that does not do anything for anyone. This book could have been condensed to 3 pages, instead of its novel size, because the plot has so few events. Perhaps it was a fine novel back when it was written, but it was a bit too \\"lugubrious\\" for me. The bottom line is this: if you are suffering from insomnia, I would recommend this book, because it will put you right to sleep. One more thing.. I gave it one star, but if I really had a choice it would receive zero stars.. and even zero would be more than generous."},{"rating":"1","title":"do not read this book","review":"this book is horrible, it is too long, confusing and just flat out \\"sux\\" i dont recomend this book to any one, and for those who like it, I cannot agree. this book is a wast of time, words, presious life and trees. do not support this books production!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Less than enchanting.","review":"I remember enjoying this old classic as a teenager.

A.E. van Vogt presents, carries and completes a beautiful presentation about a roaming scientific spaceship visiting worlds strewn acorss the glaxay. His vision of aliens don't have the normal Golden Age hokiness than many books at the time have. The Space Beagle meets four species which are so different from the normal \\"two-arm, two-leg, slimy\\" alien. These aliens can control wavelengths or exist as pure energy or can project hallucinations, etc. The way these aliens interact or deceive humans is an excellent read.The crew of the Space Beagle are always on the brink of destruction, if it wasn't for Grosvenor and his mysterious science of Nexialism. Whole none of the crew understand his science, they view him as eccentric and unreliable. It's Grosvenor's struggle to have the others see that his science can work wonders between the other scientists sciences."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic...","review":"You hear that a lot. This is a classic, that is a classic. But this IS a classic.The Voyage of the Space Beagle is one of those books that have inspirited many later authors and movies. A. E. Van Vogt is one of the Fathers of modern Sci-Fi. While the Black Destroyer may, or may not, have inspirited the makers of the movie Alien I do know that two of the aliens in the book also show up in Barlowe's Guide to Extraterrestrials along side such great aliens as the Puppeteers, The Thing, the Overlords, the Guild Steersmen and the Old Ones.The book is four short stories put together. Or a novel that has been cut up into four short stories for other collections. But in the end this is the story of a huge spaceship on a deep space mission to explore and understand. The science is kind of soft, more of a space opera but also reminds me a tad of Star Trek. But remember this was first printed decades before Star Trek."},{"rating":"1","title":"These stories are not a novel, not new and not his best","review":"If you've read Van Vogt's stories, you've read the best of these 5 stories before. They've taken some Beagle stories, added the worst of Van Vogt as padding, and republished it in a gorgeous package. But that doesn't change the fact that it's not a novel, not new and not nearly his best. Just know what you're getting before you buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deceptive Description","review":"I have no fault with the story \\"The Go-Getter.\\" However, I fault the publisher and Amazon for their misleading description of this particular edition. In addition to \\"The Go-Getter\\" it also includes a dense, unrelated scientific article about magnetism by a gentleman named Edward Leedskalnin. This other text occupies the first half of the book. This makes it useless for giving as a motivational gift.I would recommend looking for a copy of the original text elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really Not That Good","review":"After reading all of the positive reviews I downloaded this book onto my Kindle and read it.

I’ve been involved in challenges in my life that were far more serious than what this book describes, and I have to say all this book highlights is how to be a weasel to get what you want.

But before he's given the big promotion at his work, his bosses decide to test his mettle by giving him an impossible task. It's clear to me that this whole book is some melding of exaggeration and/or over-emphasis to make a point of how not to give up. At first I was put off by this, but soon realized that I was emotionally involved with the main character in the story. Since reading this book, I have found myself remembering the main characters example of what being a go getter is. No BS. It seems silly to even write it, but this book, even though probably not even a true story, makes me feel almost embarrassed about my procrastination issues. I'm almost hesitant to read read it again, until I've dealt with that. I recommend this book for any one's permanent library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great quick read with powerful message","review":"I read the Go Getter as my first e-book on Kindle.

It stopped and made me think about times when I may quit or back down too easily.I would recommend this book for anyone looking for quick kick in the butt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could be more motivating for a younger reader","review":"I'm 36 and bought this book as a Dave Ramsey recommendation.

It filters down from the top. An organization is what its commanding officer is--neither better nor worse.\\" Some things never change. I have seen this principle play out again and again in schools.I think a few more Go-Getters in the world will make it a better place to be.

Not Ha Jin, mainly because he just isn't that great, but also because he hasn't even nailed basic English language usage. On page 179 Ha misuses \\"bisexual\\" to mean \\"hermaphrodite\\"; on page 296 he forgets to translate the Chinese for \\"idiot\\" and leaves it in literal translation as \\"stupid egg\\". I don't really care about the exotic terrain: it isn't exotic enough to me (I'm from China and am quite familiar with life and culture under Chinese communism) to redeem the other, glaring flaws within this book.

It does provide an interesting insight on life in China in the latter part of the 20th century, but for me this book does not compare with a book such as Tsukiyama's \\"The Samurai's Garden\\". Different books for different folks..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Torn","review":"Story of a man torn between his arranged marriage wife who has been devoted to him and his lover who he is in love with. The book is pretty good and really puts you in the footsteps of this man torn and indecisive. I felt the environment of the story set in China added to the story greatly - making the situation more believeable than other settings."},{"rating":"1","title":"I like \\"Ocean of Words\\" but not \\"Waiting\\"","review":"How can anyone call this even interesting writing? Manna and Lin, the protagonists, are two petty-minded, weak people who, to put it bluntly, deserve all their sufferings. To the misled readers, life is much more interesting in China, in reality or in fiction. Even under the most severe circumstances in that totalitarian state, people have been more adventurous, more courageous and have had more fun than those two losers. Up to page 185, this is a depressing, dreadful, slow-death-evoking tale. But I shall read on just to prove myself wrong. I am not holding my breath.Suggested antidotal reading: Wang Shuo's \\"Playing for Thrills\\" or \\"Please Don't Call Me Human\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"bored. bored. bored.","review":"Although there is some stunning prose in the book that is simple and profound in its wisdom, the language doesn't make up for unlikeable characters, slow moving plot and odd dialogue. The book reads as if it was translated which is wasn't. I enjoyed the glimse into the Chinese culture, but it was really hard to care about Manna or Lin, the main characters. By the end I didn't care what happened to either one of them. I enjoy reading books that are slower in pace (I loved Plainsong) but no book can get away with a thin plot and characters that are hard to root for. Waiting decades to get married only to be disatisfied with the marriage and want to end it. That's life I guess, but hardly the payoff the reader expects. We've struggled through all their tedious trials and tribulations only to have Lin realize he might have been better off with his now ex-wife. Hard to like the guy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good read","review":"This book is unexpectedly simple and beautifully written. A must read for anyone who likes to read on human nature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me","review":"I tried but there was not enought plot for me. The author drew the characters very well. I also liked the atmosphere of the story but in the end I was bored."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so much...","review":"I purchased this book to read for a book club I have recently joined. In the beginning, I wondered about the characters, but soon grew bored of the relationships. The \\"waiting\\" that Lin experienced was cowardly and did not gather any sympathy from this reader. Manna's love and willingness to \\"wait\\" grew to be a pathetic desire for a union that was not based on real feelings. I thought the rape scene was extremely graphic and unnecessary use of language...to the point of almost not finishing the novel. I did finish it, against my better judgement, only to be continually disappointed. I am looking forward to hearing from the other members of the book club..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waiting","review":"This book would have been vastly improved by being written in Chinese and then translated by a competent translator. While Ha Jin usually writes in competent English, it is seldom lyrical and more often clunky. His command of idiom is weak and his dialog in particular is utterly unnatural. The story I felt was engaging enough, but really I was not all that impressed and I can't help but wonder whether the good press this book has received is not due to an anti-Communist perspective popular here in the States rather than the intrinsic merit of the book. However, I did think his portrayal of life in China and continued attitudes of Chinese toward family and marriage was accurate and perceptive."},{"rating":"1","title":"much ado about what!?","review":"After all the hype and hoopla surrounding this book -- I finally succumbed. I would have put it down immediately, if not for the the prize it had received. I kept hoping... well, entirely in vain, there was nothing there. It was a huge disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"trite and disappointing","review":"I am not sure why this is called a love story, since Lin, by his own admission, has never been in love. He finds the true details of love intrusive and is actually looking for maid and laundry service. The language of the book is extremely uneven. The narration is sometimes lovely, sometimes archaic (they copulated a long time.) while the conversation is full of jarring Americanish colloquialisms (Girl, you're crazy!) which do not fit the characters or events. The omnipresent voice couldn't be a more overused device. Lin's stilted conversations with 'the voice' was like being hit over the head with the obvious. Ultimately, this is a dreary book about a self-centered man who only wants what he doesn't have and the two women who, for reasons never understood, love him."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent book","review":"This book takes you into the culture of China under Chairman Mao in the 1960's and 70's. Ha Jin was born in China. He moved to USA to study. He had delays in bringing his wife here after he immigrated. He knows about waiting and the frustration of state regulations. His book takes you into the mind of a man, who has repressed his own instincts in favor of respectability. The hero is ineffectual but credible. The two women portrayed belong to the pre-revolutionary and post-revolutionary worlds. Again the emphasis on the way culture shaped the individual is clear. The writing feels natural, as if written by a native speaker. Really worth reading, especially for Westerners who now are now steeped in individualism and notions of self fulfillment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Waiting is Informative and Interesting","review":"I would like to thank the author for this lovely tidbit of insight into the cultural life in China (1960's-1980's). As an American who has not been to China, I found this book informative. I have a new appreciation for the Chinese culture that my immigrant neighbors would have experienced at the same time I was coming of age. I will read more of the books by Mr. Jin. For those of you reading these reviews, some of which state he gives too many details, I would like to say this is incorrect. If you are reading in a peaceful place without distraction, you will find all of the details recreate a realistic setting. You will immerse yourself in the sitatuations presented in the book and find you cannot put it down. I read this book in several hours within a week, despite other commitments. It was terrific and I will purchase it for my bookshelf in the hopes to share it with friends and to read again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ordinary","review":"I seem to be the only reader on earth at the moment who found this novel bland and bloodless. It does offer a rich look at China in a historical time and place, but so would a good history book. Jin's been compared to Henry James, which means that no one has read Henry James lately. Ordinary, dull sentences, wooden dialogue, and irritating characters. Certainly there were more compelling reads available to the National Book Award jury?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waiting","review":"Perhaps I missed something, but this was a truly boring book. I found myself waiting for something to happen which never did. Man marries. Man moves. Man finds new love. Man tries to get rid of Wife year after year after year after year only to succeed and then to find there is no place like home. Well written? Yes, but so what?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and stilted writing","review":"I don't understand why this book won any awards. I found the main character to be an irritatingly passive male about whom I cared little. The only reason I kept reading was to see if anything turned up that made it worthwhile. I would have to say, no. Furthermore, the writing seems stilted and elementary -- like a very poor translation."},{"rating":"1","title":"overrated","review":"What's unforgivable in Ha Jin's novel is not its historical inaccuracies obviously catered to the tastes and beliefs of a foreign audience. What's truly unfortunate is its depiction of Chinese people and society as being without some understandable passion or recognizable human emotion. Who are these aliens depicted in this novel? Real humans don't act like this. People in China during the cultural revolution certainly could not have acted like this. While reading this novel, all I could think about is how incredibly cold and uninteresting the characters are. Where is the pain and the suffering these characters supposedly endured during the cultural revolution? Yes they are Chinese, and yes they are therefore subdued, but that does not excuse the characters from their competely lack of inner struggle and psychological depth. Why should I care whether the divorce comes through or not? It's hard to give a damn when the characters don't seem to give a damn themselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"A mediocre book","review":"This book is a disgrace, I can't believe it won the National Book Award. As a Chinese who spent his childhood in China, this book to be nothing more than a romantic potboiler. There is one cliched situation happening after another, not to mention the random positionings of irrelevant details. This is nothing more than the work of a novice. But I can understand why an American would like this book, because of all the exotic details. If you really want to experience China, go on a vacation and you'll see enough to write your own book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring Boring Boring","review":"This is a terribly slow tale filled with dispassionate characters. Everything about the story and characters is bland. It is story of 18 years where nothing changes. If you are looking for a simple, yet elegant, story, pass Waiting by. It missed the mark. Go read Shipping News."},{"rating":"1","title":"Protest review","review":"This is a review of the price of the Kindle version of this book. It is unconscionable for publishers to set the price of the Kindle or electronic version of a book higher than the price of the printed version, in this case, the paperback version. Authors, don't stand for this kind of pricing. I will not read your work until your publishers lower the prices of the electronic versions below that of the printed versions. I would love to read this book, but not until the Kindle price comes down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deceptively well written","review":"This book is not written with the outlandish style and genius of many contemporary writers. It's extraordinarily simple, both in its prose and in the story it tells. But something about it drew me in and kept me reading - maybe it was the sense that I was observing something about Chinese society that I'd never seen before, maybe it was the story itself. But I couldn't help but keep reading and was glad I did. This story captures the complexity of human relationships with a sort of Zen simplicity that takes deceptive skill - skill that is all too easy to miss perhaps.This is a very well written book. A very well thought out examination of human emotions. I recommend it highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Trying to please everyone never works !","review":"Rarely will you find a novel like \\"Waiting\\". It is simple, yet has a powerful message in it that does not reveal itself until the very end. Lin Kong, the key character in it, endeavors to do everything to honor the Chinese political system of 1960-80's, his medical career and his first marriage. He also allows true love to wait ! \\"Wait\\" being the operative word. The result of such \\"waiting\\" is what the reader must read on for. It is not what we normally find it to be.It may make you ponder some of your own life decisions.I recommend this book for those with an interest in socio-political issues in an Asian culture."},{"rating":"2","title":"An \\"ever so slight\\" peek into the Chinese Culture","review":"I found this book so interesting, yet very subtle. The story line is slow moving and not to be hurried, just like the life of the main characters. I found this a delightful story that builds slowly, inch by inch, to a very thoughtful and surprising finish.BRAVO!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WANT TO KNOW ABOUT LIVING IN CHINA..TODAY?","review":"This is such a simple story that I don't know why it is so good. Possibly because the reader discovers the thinking and reality of the average citizen in China in a way that all can understand. You are always sympathetic with the two women in Dr. Lin's life and always want to know what is going to happen next. \\"Waiting\\" is an apt title..but to the new reader...what is the waiting for? The winning of the National Book Award is warranted here."},{"rating":"2","title":"The only thing worse than getting your heart 's desire","review":"Against the background of tradition and political control, Lin Kong's story quietly unfolds. He is a soft-spoken, agreeable soul - a doctor in the Chinese Army. His wife, the humble, loyal Shuyu, and his daughter Hua live in a rural village. Lin is allowed to visit them once a year. He believes he will be happy if he can secure a divorce and marry Manna, a nurse at his hospital. After waiting eighteen years, Lin gets his divorce, marries Manna and fathers twins. Despite his abundant good fortune, Lin again begins to wait.Ha Jin is a master at developing his characters and settings. \\"Waiting\\" gives the reader a peek into Chinese society. We experience the events of daily living: food, clothing, daily activities all told in wonderful detail."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the greatest prose writers alive....still............","review":"This guy is good. His words are stunning. Just opening the book and looking at them on the page...simply goregous. But I must agree with some others, the story drags, the plot is flat, and it is a galatical bore at certain points. But if you are looking to study the craft of modern literature in its finest form, read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"At first I didn't like the book..","review":"It sort of read like a romance novel.. but as I read further on, I began to feel the futility of the characters lives... how they seemed powerless to change things that were within their power. It was heartbreaking, and I think we have all been there!! A simple, yet powerful story, well worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"National Book Award???","review":"Perhaps the reason I didn't like this book is that I'm Chinese, or that I bought it after reading Golden's \\"Memoirs of a Geisha\\" which I thought was lyrical. The prose style here is wooden, as if the author were trying to sound \\"translated\\". The narrative style seemed to me bureaucratic; again, this may have been the writer's intention, but it seemed ultimately clumsy. The characters were almost caricatures; given other reviews, perhaps they were exotic, but they didn't engage me at all. Even the metaphorical political and environmental ambiance seemed mechanical. National Book and PEN award winner???"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the WAIT","review":"Although this took place in China, there was none of the flavor of the country. A very shallow, rather spineless man cannot obtain a divorce from his wife for many years. When he finally does, he lives the addage, \\"Be careful what you wish for\\". It was adult subject matter, but written on a 6th grade level. I was truly disappointed in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Constructed -- Don't Waste Your Time","review":"The prologue tells of a man, Lin, who has a loveless marriage to a woman Shuyu, whom he attempts to divorce several times, so he can marry Manna, a woman with whom he works. Without mutual consent, and barring extremely extenuating circumstances,during the time this story unfolds, a person must wait 18 years to be granted a divorce.After the prologue, the author fills you in on what he has already divulged. Why would he tell what is going to happen when you're going to read it anyway.Save yourself lots of time. Listen to the song \\"After, You Get What You Want, You Don't Want It\\", and you'll get the gist of this tedious book."},{"rating":"1","title":"No challenges here.","review":"I found this book highly disappointing, both as a result of its colorless prose and endless hammering of \\"truths\\" that, in a society obsessed with self-help, are already part of our collective consciousness. OF COURSE obstacles make romance more attractive. OF COURSE relationships begin reflexively. OF COURSE people are often unable to see themselves with enough clarity to undo self-damage. OF COURSE communism is a hypocritical construct.Waiting offers little enlightenment, no subtlety, and a complete absence of reward for the insightful reader. This text is as bland and pointless as its characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time on this","review":"I bought this book because of all the awards it received but never will I make the same mistake again! Not only is the story dull, boring, the characters silly, but even the writing style is poor.The only reason why I gave the book 2 stars is because it gave me some idea abt the Cultural Revolution in China and its impact on ppl's lives."},{"rating":"2","title":"A unique look at the virtue of patience.","review":"I was not impressed by the initial chapters of the book but, like its theme, my patience was rewarded in spades. Ha Jin's writing is simple and schoolboyish at times, not what I would expect from a prize-winning effort. However, it is quite apt for this tale of simple unambitious characters from the heartlands of China caught in the thick of the country's evolution into capitalism. It is to Ha Jin's credit that the waiting is as frustrating for the reader as it is for Manna. The beauty of the novel lies in the underlying themes of the rapid changes in China and how it eventually drives home to even a most loyal follower like Lin Kong. The final chapters where Lin Kong finally realises how he lost 17-years of his life trying to marry the woman he thought he loved and missed the growing years of his daughter, completely blind to the devotion of his duty-bound wife, is simply heartbreaking. This book is a little gem that's worth the wait."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent choice for a book club","review":"\\"Waiting\\" is a well crafted tale that will elicit thoughtful discusion in a book club. The characters may be hard to relate to given the setting and the culture but that is precisely what makes the book interesting.

If I didn't have to read it for my book club, I never would have finished. The writing, story and characters were BORING. I was not impressed with any of it.

I myself waited and waited to get caught up in the story - but only landed up waiting for it to be over!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waiting, Indeed!","review":"This book lives up to its title. I was waiting the entire time for something to happen! While the ending is interesting, the book drags unbelievably on its way there. The character of the wife is a particularly interesting one---whom we do not really get to know until the last tenth of the book! The National Book Award is a real puzzle.Try it at your own risk. For me, it wasn't worth the time put into it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tired of Waiting","review":"This was a very slow book for me. I wouldn't recommend it. The plot seemed to lack the complexity necessary to hold my interest. The plot seemed redundant covering the same ground each year as he went back to try to convince his wife to divorse him. The only reason I finished the book was because it annoys me to buy a book and not finish it. And The Ladies of the Club is the only one on my shelf not read."},{"rating":"1","title":"CC from NJ","review":"The book began well, but after awhile I became annoyed with the main characters. There is just so much \\"waiting\\" a reader can put up with before you decide to move on (which is what the characters should have done before the middle of the book)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprisingly awkward","review":"I bought this novel expecting and wanting to love it. Unfortunately, I was disappointed by both the style and substance. Although the prose sometimes achieved elegance, it was frequently clumsy and obvious, especially when the author attempted to flesh out the personality and thoughts of the characters. Perhaps this was because the author was attempting to show how simple and callow the characters were, but I don't think so. Also, I found myself bored with the shallow and obvious treatment of some of the major themes - city vs. country, modern vs. traditional, capitalist vs. communist. The structure is good, the author's heart is in the right place, but the execution is clumsy and disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"WAITING - Politics as Personal","review":"This novel provides an excellent fictional counterpoint to Nien Cheng's autobiographical Life and Death in Shanghai. Ha Jin's characters' internalization of political rhetoric and submission to the whims of the dictatorship under which they live becomes understandable when viewed in the glare of Mrs. Chen's ordeal. China was and continues to be a place that expects total fealty to the State and to its normative values, stripping the wayward as well as the loyal of their humanity. This novel illuminates the slow erosion of the human spirit that accompanied the characters' acceptance of their fate as opposed to the physical punishment meted out to Mrs. Chen and others who strove to maintain individuality under the weight of their society's crushing demand for conformity."},{"rating":"2","title":"worth the wait","review":"I can't quite give it five stars because the first two parts of this three part novel were a bit slow for my tastes. In fact, I almost stopped reading the book before I got to page 12, but the diaogue on that page hooked me for the rest of book. Ha Jin is a minimalist in the best sense of the word. He gives you just enough to keep you intrigued, but rarely knocks you over with powerful passages. As the story develops, it becomes increasingly more poetic, gripping and provocative. The last third of the book is truly remarkable, containing some of the best prose I have ever read. By the end, I was left pondering age-old questions about male-female relationships and family obligations with fresh new insights as developed by the main characters. My advice is to be patient with the book. There is a method to his slow development of characters and plot. It is worth the wait."},{"rating":"2","title":"reall good book","review":"This is one of those books that makes you think long afterward. About a Chinese doctor who just does not know how to be happy. Very expertly crafted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Welcome to China","review":"Ha Jin's novel, \\"Waiting\\", resembles a more contemporary version of Pearl Buck's \\"The Good Earth.\\" Like Wang Lung, Lin Kong never seems to be at peace. The love he wants is always beyond his grasp. Lin waits 18 years for his wife to consent to divorce before he can finally marry his love, Manna. But the ideal Lin has carried with him for 18 years is not what life presents. Often times I wanted to scream at Lin and Manna, but other times I could feel their frustration and wanted to reach out and comfort them.All in all, I enjoyed \\"Waiting.\\" It was a moving and sometimes comical tale full of recent Chinese history and great character development."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"This book is amazing!

But this one I did--partially, because of frustration at having bought it,partially because I couldn't believe there wasn't some gem hidden in it somewhere. It was true to it's title--I WAITED, all the way through, for it to become something I would value having read. It was essentially a passionless story about a very dull life, and though it was instructive about the difficult nature of existing in post-Cultural Revolution China, it lacked any real sense of the uniqueness of the land. It was a literary white-wash, which may be of scholarly significance, but it was of no interest as a satisfying read."},{"rating":"1","title":"pretty awful","review":"The only thing of value in this book is the background--China and the way things worked or didn't work in that country before and after Mao. But even that becomes tedious. The characters are about as interesting as stacked wood because wooden is what they are. You learn nothing about them from the way they act or speak. Everything is developed through questions they ask themselves and similar techniques that would earn a \\"C\\" in a college writing course.

What was I doing with all of these pillows; I was trying to create a way to sit without having pain and a way to sit properly. Then I discovered the Herman Miller Aeron chair; this is the most comfortable chair in the world as far as I am concerned. I felt like I was sitting on air, no pressure on my tailbone, proper lumbar support, and the ability to sit for hours without increasing my pain level.

First, the mesh blocks air circulation while pressing firmly against your skin causing excessive sweating and soreness, something a foam padded chair does not do. Second, the plastic seat surround that the mesh affixes to presses in against the thighs unless you're anorexic with bony legs, this causes extreme discomfort within 20 minutes. I would constanly have to readjust how I was sitting in the chair, switching from sitting primarily on one thigh then the next to keep the blood flowing in my legs.I'm lucky I didn't die of a blood clot due to having to use one of these chairs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh.....","review":"I'm forced to agree with disclaimer777 on this one.

I think the year 2000-killed Trent and well Industrial for for that matter. I have been impressed with NIN singles and they where normally of really high quality and was a good addition to the collection. This is just terrible and a waste well earned money, rather get a Big Mac at MacDonald's. The song sounds more like something a washed out rock band would do with no catchy song lines and terrible composition. It sounds good the first time but after the second listen it is worn out Change is good but turning from the music mastermind of the 90's to emo/indie rocker just do not seem like good change. Maybe Trent is getting old or he might just be releasing albums to make a buck? If your are looking for the next big thing in music, this is not it."},{"rating":"1","title":"a total disappointment","review":"wow. this is the first time ive ever been disapointed with nine inch nails. this is the weakest song ive ever heard. i love every other album and single before the hand that feeds and the new album with teeth. the single is a very boring lame song. its like that boring 80s wanna be new new wave music, just a little more extra keyboards. the disc itself is disappointing because it was supposed to come enhanced with the video for the song. the video for the song is the only interesting thing about the song. also the fact that the cd is only available as an import and the vinyls for the singles are also imports. there is also a collectors box to hold the vinyls that is only available in the uk and is limited to 2000 boxes individually numbered. hopefully the next album wich is supposed to come out much quicker than previous releases will be the nine inch nails album that we deserve."},{"rating":"1","title":"For diehards only.","review":"Let me start by putting out a couple of my biases before getting into this review-- first, I relaly don't care for remixes as a rule, unless they're dramatic and severely restructure a song, I generally find they add little.

The \\"Dub Mix\\" is an interesting instrumental interpretation but you probably won't give it too much playtime. Both mixes have significantly more of an electronic edge than the original.

I have since re-read it many times especially before an important race or when the reasons for training get blurry. For a runner it is a spiritual connection to the joy and mystery that running can be as well as historic proof of the origins of American running.

I don't really care about all the historical detail. Frankly, it got to be very boring. Boring to the point I couldn't finish it. As a lifelong runner I'm always on the search for great running books,this definitely is one to avoid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Skims the Surface","review":"Yes, Laxer is a socialist. But no, that's not a bad word where he's from. I have read articles by Laxer in the past, and disagree with his leftist take on most issues.But in this book, he is on the money. Canadians have a hard time defining their culture: \\"hockey\\" and \\"not Americans\\" don't quite do. But being Canadian helps to understand America, and point out the absurdities it stands for. Laxer's book serves to list those characteristics that Canadians know are distinctly American, such as its self-absorption, its in-your-face Christianity, its gun culture, and its do-as-I-say-not-as-I-do approach to foreign policy.Unfortunately (or maybe fortunately, given Laxer's political leanings) the book does not touch on solutions, but it does stimulate thought.

This chain is a very good value."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it","review":"This item has few redeeming features, and lots of problems. First, it is extremely cheaply constructed with very thin plastic. It probably would not survive a fall from a table onto a hard floor. Second, you can't really use it as a spare charger, since it does not come with its own cord. You have to use the one that came with your phone or fork out the extra bucks for a spare cord. Third, the battery is held in place by a flimsy spring mechanism. It's hard to get the battery seated properly, and if you bump the charger even slightly, it dislodges from the electrical contacts. Fourth, it was apparently only designed to charge standard-size batteries. It does not accomodate the auxilliary-size Motorola batteries. Fifth, the documentation is almost non-existent. For the cost, I expected something with better construction and design. Dont' buy this one; here are higher quality 3rd party chargers out there that are cheaper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth it...","review":"Not much to say here. My experience with the device shows it's tricky to use, easy to break, and does not do a great job of charging. Being able to charge two batteries at once -- a spare and the one on the phone -- nice. Maybe it would be more useful if it came with decent instructions."},{"rating":"1","title":"no docs, item delivered different than pictured","review":"The charger I got from Amazon.com came without a single word of documentation. The manual for my phone helps a little. The charger comes with snap-in templates to fit different phones (I guess), but not a word of explanation about which one to use, or what the others might be for. Maddening. I just played Garanimals(tm) until I had a good fit, but why was that up to me to figure out? At these prices, write some instructions!The item that I received is different from both the one in the manual and the one pictured on Amazon.com even as I write this review, so any docs about what the lights mean would be useless anyway.Kudos to the guy who figured out that there's a status light for data sync activity -- go to the head of the class! :-)Oh, the charger seems to work fine.

It's not too heavy and there are only a few pieces to put on it before it goes in the window.We have 2 cats and one of our cats loves the veranda and sits in there all the time: yelling at the birds, watching the dogs play in the backyard and relaxing. Our other cat, for some reason, doesn't ever go in there. Maybe she doesn't want to go through the flap, although, she uses the cat door. It's a bit of a mystery.I would recommend it to anyone who kept their cat indoors but wanted to give them some fresh air and place to call their own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cat Veranda","review":"We received the cat veranda several weeks ago. We installed it in one of our kitchen windows and there has been a lineup ever since to use it. While some of the cats have not been able to figure out the flap, some have had no problem. Sometimes we tie it up to the window handle for the slow learners and everybody gets a chance.My only complaint, I wish they made it to fit a bigger window. We only have four windows that are small enough to accomodate it and two of them are bathrooms. We have alot of cats, so even though we are a little restricted on the size, I just ordered another one and we are going to put it in the upstairs bathroom window.Anybody that comes to our house and see's the cats in the veranda love it. I am very happy with this product and would recommend it to anyone that loves their cats."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Product!!","review":"For the health and safety of our cat, we keep her indoors. The Cat Veranda is a nice way for her to get fresh air and enjoy the outdoors in a protected environment. And our cat, Tabasco, LOVES it. Initially it took a few hours for her to get used to going in and out of the swinging door, but after she acclimated, it is hard to get her to come out of it!! Friends and neighbors often comment upon seeing Tabasco enjoying the fresh air. We live in New England, and try to leave the Veranda in the window as long as possible, but unfortunately the frigid winters often mean that when the first snow flies, we take the cat veranda out until spring. As a long time pet owner, this is perhaps the most valuable pet product that I have ever purchased, our cat loves it, and it is really simple to install. It may be pricey, but it is sturdily built, we have had ours for a four years now, and will be well worth the money in the enjoyment it gives your cat."},{"rating":"2","title":"looks good, and maybe it's just my cat but...","review":"so i installed this unit, and it looks good and is stable (but probably gonna need to use more insulation).but my cat is a bit timid about using it. he's only 6 months. and maybe it's just him. too early to tell anything very meaningful after just 2 weeks"},{"rating":"1","title":"effing really","review":"the amount of time to receive the product was awesome. but received half the product, one of two disc set. no trace of our cd of set, to return the second cd and get refund, i spend more than orginally, that sucks, dissappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"I like it, sets my face and absorbs oil!

It did capture the feel of an 70's or early 80's movie quite nicely but nothing happens in the first hour except for one girl getting her brains blown out by some drifter looking loser guy. The main problem with this movie is that the main character is as fidgety as a field mouse through the whole movie so it's almost a relief when she shoots herself in the head at the end of the movie. I'm sorry if I spoiled it for anybody who hasn't seen it yet but this movie is not as great as a lot of these other reviewers say. Rent is if you still want to see it. Don't waste your money on it thought because like me I bet you won't want to see it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated it.","review":"I'm a big Horror nut. I've seen all sorts of horror movies from all decades. So it's really hard for me not to like a cheesy horror movie. This movie found a way. Granted I like how it tried to pay tribute to older horror moves, but holy hell it was so SLOW! Nothing really happened for 97 % of the movie. It just dragged on and on. I was waiting for something good to happen and it didnt. Finally the last 7 minutes you see what's going on, but by then I was gone...not caring what happens by then. It's not even a good build up. Its just this girl walking around the frigging house. It's like the director had a good idea that lasts only 6 minutes so he made a movie about nothing just to get to that one scene. I will never see this again and cant believe people like this. To each their own I guess."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ti West's 'House of the Devil' AKA How to market your movie","review":"I attended a midnight screening of Ti West's 'House of the Devil' in Boston last weekend. I had seen a lot of press about the film which led me to watch the trailer. Seeing the inclusion of genre vets Tom Noonan, and Mary Woronov assured me that this was a film that had it's roots firmly planted in the late '70's through to the mid '80's.The film is one that is not for those who are looking for a quick paced, gore filled scream fest. It is, however, for those who enjoy an atmospheric, character driven movie. The film does have well done effects, a very atmospheric score, and very solid cinematography.If Mr. West is involved with the marketing of this film then I say job well done. For a film that really does feel from that era the choice to simultaneously release it on VHS as well as DVD is a great one, and for people who collect VHS, like myself, should buy this one as it comes in an over sized clamshell case."},{"rating":"1","title":"A third act disaster...","review":"Once again a potentially great movie falls apart in the last half hour... The first hour was brilliant, but then the film degrades into one unrealistic thing after another.

And the ending didn't make sense at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip it","review":"Once again I was suckered into buying movie based on positive great reviews, and once again I have to ask why anyone would rate this film more then 2 stars ?

The director does it on purpose so you build a bond or start caring for the main character. The movie has alot to like, it is a throw back to the 70's and early 80's period. I has very much so a haunted house feel to the movie. I would say more about the movie but i really don't wanna give anything away so you can enjoy it to the fullest.

Though it is certainly gory! Don't say you weren't warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tension gives way to Tedium","review":"This movie starts off great. The first half hour is very entertaining. There is great attention to detail in making a 70's style camp movie. Greta Gerwig's character is utterly entertaining and tension builds nicely. Then somewhere around the 30-minute mark, everything falls apart. The tension is replaced by boring, ultra-long drawn out wanderings through the hallways and rooms of the house, Greta Gerwig disappears and nothing, I mean NOTHING happens!! If they edited out about 45 minutes of the middle of this film and cut right to the chase this would be an excellent 50-minute TV scare show episode. But as it stands, it is a tedious film that tries too hard to be artsy for its own good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two stars for the 80's vibe...","review":"House of the Devil started out great for me. I was totally digging the 80's throwback vibe that the film had. The opening credits were fun. It was decently acted and had some interesting moments, but overall, the ending and the \\"satanists worshipping in the basement\\" plot felt sooooooooooo Rosemary's Baby to me for some reason. It just didn't leave a good taste in my mouth.Also, I have to agree...Using Dee Wallace for about 30 seconds in a film is SUCH a waste! She is an incredible actress and a horror icon and her little cameo as \\"the land-lady\\" was far too thin for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!

It was poorly produced, and the acting was so horrible I thought it was a joke.trust me - do not waste your money on this movie, it was terrible!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I love you, Jocelin Donahue!","review":"While not as boring a \\"horror\\" movie as, say, \\"Let the Right One In,\\" be assured that \\"House of the Devil\\" will have you nodding off like a champ by, say, the 42-minute mark. Oh, and that thing about the movie being based on a true story is a complete joke.On top of that, by now everybody who does not have their head up their poop chute should know that satanic cults are nothing more than fat guys eating cheese curls in their basement, listening to Slayer and playing D&D; -- and maybe plotting new ways to blow up fish in the family aquarium when mommy's not in on the game.But, boy howdy! If I didn't adhere to a strict 1- or 5-star rating policy (because life is black and white, never gray), I would probably give this movie 2 stars just because of Jocelin Donahue, the hottest new actress to come along in years. Seriously, folks. I can't wait for her to act in a real film. If you're reading this, Jocelin, holler at me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"All atmosphere with no payoff","review":"This movie did an excellent job of building tension and creating an atmosphere of doom. Nothing much happens for the first hour and twenty minutes EXCEPT for the building of tension, so my opinion is based predomininantly on the last twenty minutes. Did the finale justify the wait? No - not in the least. The twist, or reveal, or what-ever you want to call it, might have been mind blowing 40 years ago, but anyone with a rudimentary knowledge of horror films could have predicted the ending just by looking at the DVD case and the film's title.I'll give the director credit for doing an excellent job of establishing mood and creating the look/feel of a '70s film, but a good horror movie also requires a plot that goes somewhere. I look forward to seeing what the director does next, but can't recommend this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow and ineffectual","review":"This might be one of the slowest moving movies I've ever seen. The plot really only takes place in about the last 30-45min. Then when it does, it doesn't go very far. I'm really surprised at the number of good reviews of it. I gave it 2 stars since there were a couple action shots that were decent and it did have a halfway decent ending. Although, that could have been my joy it was over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best \\"Devil\\" Movie Since The Exorcist","review":"Wow. This movie has gotten a bad rap, and for the wrong reasons. There have been a LOT of American horror movies dealing with the \\"devil\\" subgenre lately, and each one has been pretty terrible. This movie is a clear exception to that trend. Yes, it starts out slow, but the suspense is almost palpable. Don't listen to those comparing it to \\"Rosemary's Baby\\" or \\"The Exorcist,\\" both of which are in a completely different realm. The set design and, yes, even the music are very reminiscent of the 1980s. This isn't a masterpiece like \\"The Exorcist,\\" but it is very much worth watching. For fans of the classic, suspensful, and....wait for it..wait...ATMOSPHERIC... 1980s horror, this is a must-see!!!I know there are the usual people who would turn down a movie upon seeing the word \\"atmospheric\\" in a review. But, fortunately there are plenty of blood-soaked Wes Craven and John Carpenter films to satiate them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bought it for the vhs!","review":"I'm a sucker for horror on vhs, what can I say. I still buy and watch as much horror on vhs as I did when I was a kid growing up in the 80s. This movie is a great little throwback to those days.I am not going to say it's a perfect or great movie but I liked it enough when I saw it a film festival to buy it afterwards. And it's a nice way to kill some time on a late rainy night. I won't go into any details, but if you like horror movies from the 70s/80s/early 90s eras then you should at least appreciate House Of The Devil. Now if you like movies like SAW, Paranormal Activity and American remakes of Asian horror movies I don't think this it for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"I appreciate the Intent, but ...","review":"Rosemary's Baby meets the Sentinal and Burnt Offerings .... all movies I really liked. The slow burn works great in a good thriller, but in order for it to work, you need just a lil' bit more happening than happens here for a very long time. I loved the intent to make a throwback horror film, but I think this is just way too padded with ... nothing. No point at all in the opening where she finds a new apartment (but fun to see Dee Wallace(Stone))and lots of plodding scenes of sitting around. Always a hoot to see Woronov, though. This needed more of a kick-start to keep the tedium from setting in before the finale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazon Selling Promotional Copies???","review":"I really like this movie but both my VHS and DVD copies arrived with deep slash marks cut in to the barcode part of the packaging!After sending it back twice for replacement orders and receiving more copies with the slash marks CUT in to them, I figured all copies from Amazon must be like this and decided to keep it anyway.This means that I was basically PAYING FULL PRICE FOR PROMOTIONAL COPIES. In the past, the only time I've ever seen a slash through a barcode is when an item isn't supposed to be sold, but given away.The other issue is that the VHS copy is strictly a collector's item (to me, anyway) and it showed up from Amazon each time with the packaging already damaged. They ended up giving me $10 off my next order with them, but I don't see how this is even legal....Did anyone else order this from Amazon and receive the items slashed???"},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the most boring horror movies I have ever seen","review":"For me I found the movie didn't get decent until the last 20 minutes or so.

Then the last 20 minutes we finally get some action and even that is a let down."},{"rating":"1","title":"WOW!! BOTH BORING AND STUPID!!!","review":"Ok, I rented this this after reading the reviews about how good it was. That it was a great horror movie. I'm a big fan of a good scare and a good story, this had neither. Basically, you're watching a girl housesit for the 1st hour of the movie, then in the last 15 minutes or so, they try and pour on the \\"excitement\\" Besides one or two little jumps from loud noises when there was silence, there was nothing about this that made me like it. Nothing explained about the story, nothing mentioned about aftermath, nothing, nothing, nothing. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass on this stinker!","review":"GRRRR.If you are looking for the much needed reinvention of the horror movie genre -- this is not the movie you are hoping it to be. The beginning of this film is very stylized and makes one think they are about to witness some great movie making. NOt so. The first hour and a half is slow paced -- even for those like myself who long for movies to slow down and build suspense. This would be welcomed if all that slow build up was leading up to something truly terrifying. Unfortunately, The House of the Devil doesn't deliver. The last few minutes is like a different, very badly made home horror movie. Much of it so dark and murky that it's hard to tell what is going on. It feels like the director had no budget left, or even a finished script and everyone involved made up the end as they filmed just to finish. I found the ending too fast, sloppy, ridiculous and disappointing in every way possible. It feels like two different films that both fail as they don't tell a cohesive story."},{"rating":"1","title":"awful, awful awful","review":"This movie plodded on without any interest being developed until the last 30 minutes.

I am watching it right now, having rented it from IO for a whopping $6.45. Wooden acting, stiff dialogue, clear absences of a competent editor, and meaningless scenes create a boring movie. It seems that the creators of this movie fancy themselves as independent film types. Nothing could be further from the truth. I already mentioned that the script was stiffly written. \\"Ah, I see you've met. Excellent.\\" The lack of editing creates a slow pace that drags on and on. The star, who resembles Karen Allen, is lovely to watch but not exactly inspired, or a good actress.Do yourself a favor- wait for it on HBO, but don't pay to see this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wicked Suspense","review":"A good story line and plot for this movie, it is well thought out, although not original, still well put together for a low budget horror film. A college student needing cash take a creepy \\"baby sitting\\" job in tin-buck two and the suspense starts to build immediately. The movie takes it time to climax as it builds suspense and builds suspense and the ending is also somewhat predicatable, but the acting and directing are above average and they do pull off a good movie. The backdrop of the 1980's is clearly identified down to the music of the time and the portable cassette players. There are some moments which make you jump off your seat and the demon is wicked looking, however, it does show class, as it does not have the sterotypical sataic type orgy and nudity. There are some very violent scenes which are not appropriate for children. All in all a good low budget film with a little kick to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Teardrops - Lovestation","review":"UK Maxi Single Track Listing for -\\"TEARDROPS\\" - LOVESTATION1) Joey Negro Edit2) Jamie White Remix3) Eric Kupper Remix2000"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent read...Better than \\"the Last samurai\\" story","review":"This story is an excellent one with a great ending. The author in my view is very detailed in interpreting the facts and building a detailed story around those facts. The dialog he added made it much better than simply a historical account of the events. So in this book you get a great historical fiction text of a great true story with the fictional details built in around the actual facts that transpired in feudal Japan. The story itself is great about a group of Samurai who lose everything (their Lord Asano, their jobs, their lands) and seek vengeance against the man who cost them everything through that mans corruption. The 47 Ronin lived honorably, fought honorbaly, and in the end died honorably. Well done Mr. Allyn!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Some basic problems, likely due to the author...","review":"I think the story is absolutely top notch, especially because its true. But the book has this major problem, for me at least, in that it seems to teeter on the fence between a history book and a storytale. Factually, I'm, sure its mostly correct, but the problem here is that the author likely writes a lot of history books, because I felt more like I was reading about what happened instead of reading a tale. I'm not suggesting the author fabricate anything, I'm simply suggesting it could have been written much better if it just used the language a competent fiction writer is equipped with.If you just want the book for the story, then by all means, buy it, cause I believe it is the only decently translated one left in print today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good story, very poor edition","review":"The original 47 ronin story is very good and the book is in general quite loyal for original story (as much as one can decide which is the original story, there are naturally several versios, which differ in minor details).So, the story is good and the this edition is quite loyal for it. What is the problem? Well, in my humble opinion one should not ADD much into a story when creating an edition of old legend. John Allyn is clearly a product of western culture and this is unfortunately very clear from the way he tells the story.I recommend this only for those who wish to read a Japanese story with very western tone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loyalty dwarfs all other moral obligations","review":"This book is a credible modern version of the Japanese saga of the 47 ronin (ex-samurai), for whom honor and loyalty to their master were the prime sense of their life.When their master is slain because he fights against corruption (high taxes, briberies) and silly laws (the \`Life Preservation Laws' of the Shogun, making animals more privileged than human beings), their only life goal becomes revenge, \`bringing peace to their master's soul', because \`a samurai cannot live under the same sky as the slayer of his lord'. But at the end only 47 of his former soldiers remain loyal to their cause and will try to seek revenge for their master's execution.This book doesn't attain the high standards of well-known Japanese classics (e.g., The Tales of Genji) and flirts sometimes with melodrama. But it is a worth-while read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful true tale of honor in a time lost to us.","review":"The 47 Ronin Story by John Allyn is a wonderful book and is easy to read also. The paperback has a feel to it that makes it readable, yet when you've finished you feel full; content. The amazing (and true) story of these 47 Ronin really makes an impact on the reader and also challenges them, because it makes you ask the question, 'What is honorable?' Some of these samurai became drunks and whore-mongers simply to avenge the honor of their lord. Is that considered right? Does the end really justify the means? With such a revered history in Japan, the story is a must read for anyone who has a love for the Japanese or Samurai culture. The book has depth, it has feeling, and by the end you might feel tired from going on such a journey with those warriors. A wonderful book for a great story, I highly recommend it! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great choice","review":"I needed a medium length chain to use with several different silver pendants.

Also Winchester showed a humane side to him that Frank Burns could never or just wouldn't do. I love the Winchester/Klinger duo thing developing throughout the series and the fact that Klinger could also develop more as a character. Although I loved the early years of MASH and have series 1-5, I am looking forward to start collecting the rest of the series with the new gang!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Goodbye Ferret Face and Hello Major Winchester","review":"Hello to Charles Emerson Wichester III and goodbye to Frank Burns. Actually, this was refreshing as last season was spent with Frank Burns being rejected by his long time mistress Margarget \\"Hot Lips\\" Houlihan in favor of her new beau. This season the transition is complete. Winchester is a welcome addition to the staff as a surgeon of equal rank. The writing seems to take on a different edge here without the political humor that was so common with Frank Burns as bumbling surgeon and whining twerp. Winchester is more sophisticated and so is the humor -although not quite as wacky as before - the stories seem more clever and mature rather than relying almost entirely on insult comedy. The stories seemed focused more on each character's human side rather than just their dislike for each other. Definitely, a new era in MASH and well worth the money I paid."},{"rating":"2","title":"M*A*S*H will always be one of my favorite series.","review":"I still continue to enjoy the M*A*S*H series on DVD.

Some good humor, including sex and booze, plenty of drinking and driving, and Alan Alda was not yet quite so cheezy. Some interesting cameos, including a very young-looking James Cromwell. First episode of the season there is some talk about Frank Burns, but he never shows up at all. He was written entirely out of the series after the first episode, to be replaced by Charles Winchester III."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny show","review":"A great show for all ages.

The character of Winchester is a great addition, but Frank Burns will always be more popular with most fans. That's a fact. Yes, \\"real fans\\". Maybe, not a reviewer from REDFORD MI, but he's not the authority he thinks he is.M*A*S*H suffered greatly in later seasons when it became The Alan Alda Show and most episodes ran like a awards show clip with every cliche imagineable included. Just look at what is rerun the most. It's the first 6 or 7 seasons because they are the most entertaining overall.There were some great shows in the later years, but the seasons themselves were very spotty. It's a common problem for long lasting series. They run out of things for the characters to do and say that they haven't already done.If you have never see M*A*S*H, don't start here, go back to Season One with the original cast and start there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Season 6 is what everyone remembers","review":"Say what you want about season six, but the fact is your impressions of Colonel Potter, Hawkeye are created by the Season 6 episodes. This is the point in MASH where these two characters change profiles. Colonel Potter ages 10 years and Hawkeye is now the son of a lonely widower. If it wasn't for this and following seasons you would all be claiming that Hawkeye definitely had a mother and sister and the Potters had only been married 27 years. How much did the later seasons weigh in the minds of MASH affectionados? We remember these characters for what they were in the later seasons and call the earlier season references \\"bloopers\\".Most of my favorite episodes have been released now with the 6th season. But I will put any ninth or tenth season episode against any so-called comedy of today.

Whitney was hip to the importance of a jamming club remix long before girls with names like Mariah, Amber, Toni, Deborah, Celine, Taylor, Ultra and Kristine had record deals.That said, it is a shame to see that Hex Hector has run out of ideas. Whitney has rendered a powerful, dramatic vocal, but Hex has turned it into some tired circuit party crap. Jr. Vasquez hasn't done a decent remix in years.Whitney needs a pumping, original, festive club mix to complement this fantastic vocal, where are Masters At Work when you need them?"},{"rating":"1","title":"mix of colors","review":"I ordered 7 boxes to do kitchen floor.

Once the whole job was complete, I had 3 different people come in and look at the floor, and they could see a color difference in several rows . Some of the tiles are a whiter background then others. It might not sound so bad , but visually it is noticeable, Needless to say I am glad this is just a temporary project.The price I paid for these tiles were reasonable to me since I knew I would be pulling them up in about a year or less so it works from that prospect, I can only guess that the tiles were made on different lots or different dyes from the factory , whatever the case ,,they are a mix of colors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your $$, don't buy.","review":"I had high hopes for this CD, I was / am a S&C fan.

He's even got his token black guy and white woman to back him up in the radio studio.This book is just like Neal's show: it is entertainment - that is all. He machine guns anything in his path and pulls mundane shock-jock tactics in order to appeal to the vapid masses out there who are too desperate to have someone's approval that appears to be in a position of authority.Neal Boortz is a carny balker - he is the man behind the curtain.

If you like albums like Summerbreeze by Tiesto - buy Tiesto."},{"rating":"1","title":"Steady Decline","review":"Over the years DJ Irene has been known as one of the largest DJ's in the world. I guess with increasing popularity only comes the inevitable decline that is mainstream. With a title like \\"Rock Star\\" it's no wonder why Irene seems to have an ascent into the bad DJ hall of fame. I have seen Irene live several times and it shows in her performances as well. With each new release I see this once acclaimed producer falling into a deeper and deeper hole. You want good Irene CD's refer back to the Club series mixes and the Hard House Diva ones as well. Don't agree with me, spend two months in the scene and you will see why Irene is simply the record labels new project."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book was cool.","review":"I thought this book ruled because it was written by my faveauthor.

My only problem is that the cord is a little too long (8') for my setup but might be perfect for someone else.

My old surge protector only had 6 and I needed more plugs (Monitor, PC, Speakers, Modem, Router, Printer, wireless mouse). My question would be about the coaxial connectors on the surge protector. I read one review where someone suggested to use them for your TV, but I have cable internet as well and I was wondering if anybody else that has cable internet had their coax running through this surge protector before it goes to their modem, and if they experience any problems with their connectivity from doing so. I had to have Comcast run a dedicated line directly from my modem to the box outside to solve a connectivity issue, so I was wondering if using the coax connectors on this surge protector would inhibit my connection.other than that one question I love this surge protector, Belkin makes quality products. The angled power plug is nifty too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Belkin lives up to expectations","review":"I have never gotten a bad product from Belkin, this as all others I have bought works as expected, It is well thought out and engineered.

While little is known of this technique in some therapuetic circles, TFT or 'psycholocial acupuncture' is currently being used to successfully treat sufferers of PTSD in places like Rwanda.If readers of this book try this technique for themselves by closely following the simple steps as described in Chapter 23, it is likely they will find relief from stress and anxiety.I highly recommend this excellent book for the inclusion of this groundbreaking technique alone."},{"rating":"2","title":"WHOA","review":"Whoa is right, this is a great song, and all the DJs should have this vinyl. keep the club bouncin yall"},{"rating":"2","title":"A remarkable debut album","review":"The most consistent of their 4 studio albums from the 70s.

I am really glad that I finally have this. Yep, I NEED YOU exactly fit the image of their rock. Deep south blues flavored rock. DON'T ASK ME NO QUESTION is excellently made pop song and THE BALLAD OF CURTIS LOEW really touches me. THE NEEDLE AND THE SPOON is a light mannered anti-drug song.

The first season was great and set the ground work for a wonderful and entertaining show, but it was season 2 that had to come back from that success and prove that it wasn't a fluke.

It worked enough for the red sores to heal and scab up, which wasn't happening before because the flies were striking so frequently. But after a few days I noticed my dogs were licking it off each other. Hard to say what effect that had, or if maybe enough of it was still lingering. Doesn't have an unpleasant scent. I've been using it in conjunction with a spray repellent on the dogs, the patio, and their doghouses, as well as disposable attractant traps, so it's really impossible to say how this product would work solo.

It definitely contains some of Shepp's best playing, most notably the first five tracks featuring Bobby Hutcherson on vibes. The title track leads off the album in quite an eerie fashion courtesy of Christine Spencer's soprano vocals. The album's inconsistency comes from two places. First, there are three different drummers on the first five songs -- Rashied Ali plays on 1-3, J.C. Moses on 4, and Joe Chambers on 5. These drummers have very different approaches to experimental jazz, and it gives the session a haphazard rhythmic feel. The other problem with the CD is the trio session tacked on the end. While the music is very good, it really makes it feel like two wholly different albums. The trio recordings make up tracks 6-10 of the CD, but three of them are versions of \\"The Chased.\\" Overall though, this is some of the best avant-garde jazz of the 60s.

But despite all that, the book is a fun, fast-paced, enjoyable crime novel. Cole is an easy-to-like wisecracking hero with a heart of gold. Pike is the cold, matter of fact, partner that you can always rely on. In this novel, Cole and Pike are hired by an egotistical and pompous movie director to locate his ex-wife and son. Finding her isn't much trouble, but then Cole decides to help her and learns that she is in a terrible predicament. Cole and Pike eventually run into the NY mob, and from there the story blisters towards a satisfying (and very violent) conclusion.

Being his usual righteous self, Elvis could not sit back and see Karen's life destroyed by the mob. However, could he and Joe take on the mafia, save Karen from its clutches, and escape unscathed?Like all other Robert Crais' books, it had the compelling power which made it impossible for me to put the book down. I have always believed that for a book to be likeable, we must like the characters in the book and really feel for them. This is precisely the reason which I enjoy this book so much.

Both have True HD DTS and 1000 Corpses has a great special features menu to boot. Ive seen better quality on the picture side of things but it's actually better than I anticipated it would be. Don't get me wrong it definitely looks blu-ray, but it's not as sharp or defined as \\"The Dark Knight.\\" Audio presentation is excellent.

Thus what had seemed an advantage--the absence of replacement filers, e.g.--was undone when I operated this humidifier.With weekly cleaning--per instructions--mine died after less than 3 months. I have junked it.A great disappoointment. The previous Honeywell warm air humidifier was infinitely better designed and,with proper care, lasted two years.DO NOT BUY THIS ONE.

It quietly puts out a lot of moisture. Construction quality seemed flimsy, and sure enough, after less than three months the heating element burned out.

I'm still impressed with the twist in how Tristan finds Valadan. The city of magicians is still wondrous, despite the many others I've read about since I discovered the flavors of this one.This is a book which takes fairy tale and epic fantasy, and twines them into one. As such, there will be familiar archetypes, but also new twists. There are shades of The Last Unicorn in Valadan's tale, while still being unique and different. Allaire's plight reminds the reader of Sleeping Beauty, but it's not the same tale at all. And, of course, Tristan calls to mind every orphaned hero since Arthur."},{"rating":"2","title":"How to live and how to work simultaneously","review":"Noone says before die: Oh I should had been more in the office.

Max Roach really shines, taking the soundscape of the drum set to another level.Using this album to voice his social and political concerns, Roach chose top of the line musicians to convey his message, including the exhuberant and masterful Eric Dolphy on alto sax, bass clarinet, and flute.Influenced by, but not flat out Latin jazz, Roach stirs up a blend of sound that is completely original, bordering on the mystical.Dolphy indulges in one of his best recorded solos on the twisted 40s style bop number, \\"Mendacity.\\"Masterful."},{"rating":"2","title":"P.J.

It seems to be pulled in two different directions. On the one hand, you've got Lee Presson's great original songs like \\"Hat Back Boogie\\" and \\"That only Happens in the Movies,\\" which is reminiscent of Indigo Swing. But the original songs that Lee didn't write just don't seem to fit. Leslie Presley sounds beautiful as always, and she does her best with Larry Sweeny's \\"He's still a Mystery to Me\\" and \\"Shadowman\\" but they still sound like they were written for another band. Ironic, since the songs that WERE written for other bands, like Elvis Costello's \\"Wave a White Flag\\" and the Stones' \\"Jumping Jack Flash\\" (!!) are the high points here. I guess they were pressured to have more original songs but face it boys, it's better to have a good cover song than a bad original song. This CD has both.I think their latest CD, \\"El Bando En Fuego!\\" is their best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Swing","review":"I first heard LPN at a concert and they were GREAT.

I believe that towrads the end of his life he saw through the concept of time and this philosophy translated into his \\"spontaneous composition\\" aproach which is beautifuly clear in this recording.

So when her album appeared in a used bin, I bought it. I couldn't believe my ears--she had this incredible voice and great songs (there's not a bad tune on this album). Her stage show was incredible, too--about half the house at the show left after her performance because she went to jam with Tony Glover at a local bar.

Ok, sure -- she can't sing as beautifully as, say, Annie Lennox or Renee Fleming, but who would want her to? Her songs and lyrics are sometimes barren and desolate in their simplicity which reflects, in some ways, the people and situations she knew growing up in the southern US. And adding someone with a gorgeous, full, overly pretty voice to these songs would ruin the effect they have they have on us: the feeling that Lucinda might as well be the girl down the steet who got a guitar second-hand and writes songs so people know how she feels. There's something beautiful in that...almost genius, of a sort. I highly reccomend this album.And, by the way, didn't some pop group recently cover Sundays? I swear I heard it on the radio once..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best","review":"I bought this CD way back in the late 80's. Might have been when Mary Chapin Carpenter told David Letterman that when Lucinda was on he'd better be nice to her - or else! It's one of my top 5 albums of all time. I can't get enough of it. Hard to believe the disc still plays. I love every single one of these songs, and Lucinda's delivery is so passionate and real that I don't like the versions other singers have done of her songs.I love a lot of her other songs as well, but this one has a special place in my heart. I'm so glad to see her get some of the recognition she deserves for Car Wheels and others."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best album of the 80's, no less","review":"This disc is a terrific classic. Filled with hymns to the intoxicated run of loving and living, with tears on the road, and sometime a pause as pure as a dawn, the sigh of an opening rose (\\"Like A Rose\\"). The fact is Lucinda doesn't only write great songs: she incarnates, marries them so perfectly that you even cannot believe your ears: her voice with a violin is something so fine and graceful that it soars from the Earth to the outer space (\\"Side Of The Road\\").\\"I'm only thirsty for a liquor unkown on the Earth\\", wrote the French poet Charles Baudelaire. Too bad he couldn't listen to Lucinda Williams."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nobody covers Luci better than Luci!","review":"If you think Mary Chapin Carpenter(Passionate Kisses) and Tom Petty(Changed the Locks) were good, you should hear the originals. \\"Lucinda Williams\\" is the album that builds up to deliver the greats - \\"Car Wheels,\\" \\"Essence,\\" and \\"World Without Tears.\\" Any serious Lucinda Williams fan will own this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why on Earth is this out of print?","review":"Another call to re-issue this classic.

He wants to redeem, make right, to Himself all people. But He made it only one way--through Jesus Christ. He wants you to love Him, need Him, worship Him and praise Him. But you must come through His Son. Jesus said, \\"I am the WAY, the truth and the light, NO ONE comes to the Father (God) except through me.

And help the world reach new levels of insight.By all means, read this book!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"God is Love, not Fear","review":"If you read the negative reviews this book has received it has come from people that love God out of fear, which is not love at all. If you really want to have a spiritual experience, feel Atonement and REAL love read this book and especially read \\"Conversations with God\\" - all the volumes. They are wonderful. You will have a better understanding of yourself and God and no longer feel like a blind sheep of organized religion."},{"rating":"2","title":"What God Wants","review":"I found this book insightful as well as challenging. This book makes you stop and think and contemplate and realize how beliefs given to one when young should be questioned and looked into more deeply when reaching adulthood.What God Wants has given me a new perspective of our Creator. I am very grateful for this wonderful gift."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still Reading This Wonderful Book!","review":"I haven't yet finished reading this small, short, though GREAT book. So far, I am greatly surprised, and ENLIGHTENED. BUt, I won't actually KNOW until I've finished just how enlightened I become. The first 10 Chapters did not greatly interest me, and I am glad they were very short and to the point. It's what follows that is mind-prevoking. I would love to hear what anyone else who has read it thinks about it. Please respond."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"The odd thing is, every time I was in a bookstore and flipped open the book in the middle, it said good things...but when I actually bought the book and read the first, oh, 11-12 chapters, I was very disappointed. Skip those and it's a decent book.One of the most important things I've been learning with other books is the idea to focus on what you DO want, how you DO want to create and feel and live and enjoy. (\\"Ask and It Is Given,\\" by Esther and Jerry Hicks is a superb example of that.)So, cutting off other people's heads (or organizations) to make yourself bigger isn't my idea of greatness. And the first half of this book does exactly that. Why waste time on all that negativity? Just focus on the part where we can be happy."},{"rating":"2","title":"We all really need to read this book","review":"Neale Donald Walsch has opened the eyes of many skeptics (including myself) regarding who God is, and what He wants from humans. This book introduces itself as a \\"dangerous\\" book. This is true, only because it makes you think about the answers to life's most perplexing questions. It makes you wonder about a God, who is Everything and All, who is Love. It makes you wonder why people ever created fallacies about God, which make God out to be angry and jealous, petty and punishing. Neale Donald Walsch's writings and his conversations with God make you realize, inside your true heart of hearts, that God is really all about Love and Life, and that we are all connected to everything and everyone. This book was well written, held my interest completely, and I would recommend it highly to anyone who is searching for THE TRUTH."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book will help you remember who you are","review":"I think this is NDW's most important book. It can be hard to read. Some of the points are pretty raw. But, if you can internalize them, experience their truth, it is a beginning to your understanding, remembering, of who you are. Other pointers are Enlightenment for Beginners by Chuck Hillig and writings by Alan Watts. A comforting, thrilling and familiar scenario for the future was given by James Redfield, The Celestine Prophecy.I really appreciate how NDW follows the processes all the way through to satisfying and logical conclusions, providing a hopeful view of the future and your continued presence in this cosmos.ktx"},{"rating":"2","title":"bringing peace to the world","review":"\\"what does god want?\\" is such a basic question from early years -- coming up with GOD\\"S answer, rather than the words of parents, teachers, and church leaders, is the trick -- this book says it like it is, and encourages anyone to check with their own True Self (not the programming of self-serving organizations). True peace can only come with PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gotta Release This","review":"I'm really surprized this record hasn't showed up on CD yet. For those who were fans of Rick Nelson's country flavored music, Windfall was a must have. Not only for the title track, but also for the beautiful One Night Stand. My biggest problem is all the collections and the box set, is that this record is poorly represented. Track by track, this is a much better record than the Garden Party album.Hello MCA...let's have this one!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mr. Coltrane in a very mellow mood.","review":"First of all I admit I don't really care for the more innovative and experimental work that was really Mr. C's hallmark. It gets a little too loud and noisy for my aging ears. (Don't mean to offend anyone). So his take on some traditional material here I find much more enjoyable. Every number here is great,playing with Duke on IN A SENTIMENTAL MOOD, doing old time torchers like WHATS NEW, or new takes on Sinatra classics like NANCY and MY ONE AND ONLY LIVE. The lesser known tunes are just as good and just as gentle. This CD makes a perfect gift for the 40-plus person generally unfamiliar with jazz, but who has an open mind and appreciates beautifully done and simply beautiful songs!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the same as the LP","review":"This was one of my favorite John Coltrane records, as a double album released in 1974. I was pleased to see it here but disappointed to see a couple of numbers trimmed, I assume to fit on one CD. I could have done without \\"Wise One\\", but the version of \\"The Spiritual\\" that ended the original record is a real loss here. And if \\"Alabama\\" was cut down from the original 5:05 recording, as stated by one reviewer, that really is an awful thing to do to one of the better songs here.I may break down and buy a turntable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Trying to understand Jazz","review":"I am a rocker who generally finds Jazz difficult to listen to, yet I have heard so much about Coltrane I had to try it out. His playing has real soul, a lot like my favorite Blues players and is very relaxing. So much of Jazz is improv and he shows that side as well, and would recommend this to other reluctant Jazz newbies. It is very nice and not grating ( ala Kenny G, Miles Davis, etc.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"trane delivers","review":"In my opinion this CD contains some of the finest jazz ever recorded. This material also features Coltrane's finest band. The interplay between the musicians is phenomenal. They are so good they can drop the concept of a syncopated rhythm and still function as a tight and cohesive unit. Coltrane's playing has more feeling than any horn player I have ever heard. To me he is greatest of all sax players, including Dexter, Lester, Coleman et al. That's a big statement, but one listen through this CD will reveal it to be true."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great Collection","review":"If you are not a collector of John Coltrane's catalogue, this is a great introduction to his more acessible works. However, if you have alot of his albums already, this collection is probably uncessary for you. The songs dont really flow together like one of his regular albums. Nonetheless, it is a collection of Coltrane's finer works. You cant go wrong with that, even if it isnt necessarily the best examples of his mellow moods."},{"rating":"1","title":"Miserable piece of trash","review":"You can see why they have fancy colour earpieces for this thing - they have to find something to appeal to you about it.I turned it in every conceivable orientation and never found a good fit to my ear. (In case you ask, I would describe my ears as \\"average\\" or \\"normal\\"). A diagram on the packaging would have saved much frustration on that score.But NOTHING will compensate for the fact that the built-in microphone function is utterly useless. I thought maybe it was just me - but two friends also got suckered into buying one of these, and their cellphone calls went from reasonable to completely unintelligible.Do not, repeat NOT, buy this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"incorrect listing in amazon","review":"Amazon shows this as an accessory for the Nokia 918 model phone. This is incorrect since the phone does not have a 2.5 mm plug for the earjack. Obviously, if you have a different model phone, that may not be the case."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting technology, but not entirely practical","review":"I've been using the Jabra Universal EarSet for the last week with a Motorola Talkabout phone. The incoming call quality is very clear, but background noise will play a tremendous part in how well your voice is picked up. You'll sound very clear in a quiet environment-your home, office, suburbs, etc. With a television on, things can get muddled. Outdoors in a city during rush hour is terrible, requiring you to cup your ear to give your voice any kind of quality.Technology-wise, it's impressive how well the EarSet works, but for urbanites on the go, there are better products out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the rest","review":"Ive had this product for over a year with no problems. i tried the ones with the boom mikes which were more problems than any thing else and normaly i ended up hitting the mike with my hand.. also wearing sunglasses was discomforting as well.. With the jabra i noted no background noise while using the unit with the windows up and air on which is what you would want to do any way while carrying on a conversation in the car. as far as the body noise goes that problem can be solved easily however since the mike is part of the ear piece the person you are speaking to will hear all that you do this includes gritting teeth and chewing on m&m's while you talk over all though there is no better unit currently on the market that is as convenient.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Microphone ruins this product","review":"The earpiece may fit comfortably and even sound pretty good, however the microphone is not aceptable. I find that I have to speak way too loudly in order for the other person to hear what I am trying to say. Either I talk so loud that everyone around me hears my conversation or the person I'm calling can't hear me well enough. This is not an item I would recommend to anyone unless you really want to annoy anyone within 10 feet of you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mic NOT in the cord","review":"This was my very first earpiece purchase before bluetooth phones/earpieces were financially available to me. LOL I loved this earpiece and its price so much that I bought like 3 of them! I ended up selling one of them to a friend (but only because she begged me) and keeping the other two for myself. I managed to break one of them and was grateful that I had the extra one to fall back on immediately because it was no longer for sale here. Once BT earpieces were available to me with a external adapter, I graduated from this unit. I have nothing bad to say about this unit & probably still have it in a box somewhere. I bought it simply because the microphone wasn't annoyingly located in the cord and it fit securely and comfortably in your ear. I recommended it to others."},{"rating":"1","title":"ok in the big city","review":"This earset worked fine in areas of good reception. In areas of low reception, the microphone didn't work well. People couldnt hear me talk and I had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone. I live in a rural area and this made the earset useless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jabra earset good for most apps","review":"This is the best earset I have used. I have tried several boom types and other earbuds. This by far has the best sound quality and the most comfortable. The only negative is when in a windy environment the parties on the other end can not hear your conversation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad try","review":"If you are expecting anything close to the first album , forget it.

Since THPS4, we have enjoyed a steady decline in difficulty and overall quality. This new game is so easy, in one sitting you can beat the game and retrieve all the pieces for your homemade skatepark, the \\"Skate Ranch.\\" I have been a fanatic about these games since the beginning, and since we left the \\"pro skater\\" title, the games have become cheesy. The storyline is unbelievable (this game is starting to improve there, however), the character models are weird (all the pedestrians are about 3 feet taller than your character), and now, the game features one level only in story mode! I did enjoy playing through the game, though. Classic mode was fun, with harder goals than the story mode by far, and unlike story mode, you can completely customize your character. Personally, I think the previews made the game look much much cooler than it is. Another game like this and I'm finished with this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome! But They Lie","review":"This is a great game. But there are lots of lies in this game like no loading it loads more than any tony hawk game. But when you ride the bike it does lots of Stupid manuals."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's Awful!","review":"I have played the tony hawk underground games and they're great, but if you like those then you'll agree with me when I say this thing is a piece of garbage.

But this CD is high quality, high energy, big band sax. So have some Tequilla and a couple beers and put this CD on, and you will remember Gato Barbieri for the rest of your life. This is truly memorable CD, albeit at an outrageous price. You might try ripping the a record in decent condition, rather than forking out the $40 for the current price."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Miss My CD","review":"I broke this CD and can no longer find it anywhere. It was a good cd if you like old-school Micro which was acidic Breaks. In his hey-day Micro would uplift you while screwing your brain up for 74 minutes straight and this CD was Micro in his hey-day. I would recommend it to anyone who owns or has listened to his Tech-Mix Series or Coast-to-Coast"},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing some critical items","review":"This phone has some nice features but missing some important quality. Issue number one: in order to avoid static on the phone line the base unit must be plugged directly into wall socket (per their techies). If you are like me and work from home, hence the need for 2 phone lines then you probably have lots of electronics and not enough wall sockets. The phone really sounds like you are on a 1950's party line when plugged into a standard electrical strip. Issue number 2: you can't turn off or down the intercom ring! Crucial in order to call my husband in the other room. The ring is loud and very annoying. Why when they have all the other ring options this was left off? Issue number 3: the microphone is extremely weak, every person I talk with, EVERY one says can you speak up. No way to do business.So if you don't mind these issue go for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Phone!","review":"I have a small business and need two lines. This phone has excellent clarity and ease of use. I would highly recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor range","review":"Phone has excellent sound as long as you are in the same room as the base. Get over 25' away and it looses signal altogether. I am sending it back. My old 900mhz phone has about 5 times the range. Just not a 2 line phone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Range and Reception","review":"The handset developed static and went \\"out of range\\" from the base from one end of my house to the other ... my house is not that big. For this kind of money I expect clear reception. By contrast, the 5.8 GHz GE phone I just picked up for $29.99 has only very slight static and maintains reception all through my house.As others have said, there is very little choice in 2-line 5.8 GHz phones ... Panasonic, Motorola, this Uniden, and Radio Shack which looks like is it this Uniden rebranded. I have not tried the others, but other users' comments seem to echo the problems of this one. Rather than buy a multi-line expandable phone for over $200, I have decided to simply buy 3 separate inexpensive 5.8 GHz phones for about $100 total until someone perfects this technology and/or more competitors enter the field."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware----no chain dialing","review":"Overall this is good phone. However it does not support chain dialing. If you check the manual on Uniden's website it says that chain dialing is supported. However, after I bought the phone, charged the battery for 20 hours and tried the chain dialing process in the manual...it fails to work. The instructions tell you to press the \\"phonebook\\" key after speed dialing the first number. The problem is that the \\"phonebook\\" and \\"mute\\" are a shared key. Once you've connected via the first speed dial the \\"phonebook\\" key is disabled and goes into mute mode. I confirmed this with the Uniden helpline."},{"rating":"2","title":"2 line cordless phone","review":"So far so good. Only have had the phone system for just over a week now. Everything is working well, so far. It was very easy to set up the main unit as well as the remote units.I would recommend this to others to buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Junk!!!!!","review":"I bought this phone because we have an existing 2.4Ghz phone and it is subject to interference from our wireless network. This phone is a piece of junk. They tell you it has excellent range but that is just not true. It cuts out on us from just one room away from our base station and it is virtually impossible to use from upstairs. You would be better off to stick with your existing phone or buy a 2.4G phone because this one is completely useless. I ordered online and am out postage both directions and a 15% restocking fee, but this pohne is completely useless.I read the only review that was posted when I purchased, but don't believe it.

Mostly sounds like you're in a tunnel even when in the same room as the base. The range is also extremely poor. Bought an extention to add on and can't use it in the next room without constantly cutting out. All in all, this phone stinks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great phone.","review":"Have never owned a better phone. The gentleman that wrote the review with 1 star had a valid point though, you can't call back callers in the CID menu with an area code outside of yours (no option to put a \\"1\\" in front of the number). However his other point of not being able to turn off the answering machine is funny, because this model does NOT HAVE an answering machine! Wow. Its only an additional keypad folks, no answering machine. That would stand to reason why you can't turn off your \\"imaginary\\" answering machine. Also, I purchased three additional TCX905 handsets... also work great. All the features I need. Another small feature lacking, is being able to change the ringtone on the base. Overall though, you'll love it over ATT, GE, and Panasonic. I've had them all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"I was tired of buying expensive speaker desk phones that last about 18 months, so I decided to try this.

It works great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love at first sight","review":"I don't normally write reviews on products, but I am really impressed the the Uniden TRU8866 2-line cordless phone. Installation was a snap and the thing works wonderfully. I also bought 2 additional handsets and all I had to do to match them with the base unit was set them in the base for a few seconds. The battery life is great and so it the range.

Cool display, nice feel, useful features (e.g. Do not disturb, Room monitor, Direct link, 2-line support). However, the SOUND QUALITY (via handset) is VERY POOR, and RANGE is VERY LIMITED (voice begins to breakup long before \\"Out of range\\" occurs). These two shortcomings render the phone a useless piece of junk. Good thing is that I can return it to the store.It's amaizing how time goes by, but phone manufacturers keep churning out crappier and crappier phones. And they are not cheap either. Shame on them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Features, Disappointing Range and Sound Quality","review":"This phone did not work out as well as I had hoped and I ended up returning it. I really wanted a 2-line system and one that wounldn't interfere with my wireless network. The Uniden had lots of nice features, but I noticed the sound started to breakup when I walked upstairs, less than 20 feet from the base station. When I took it into my backyard (one of the reasons I went for 5.8GHz), the signal was even worse, even though I was less than 50 feet away. The sound quality didn't seem good either - even in my living room, next to the base station, it sounded tinny. I'm still looking for a 2-line phone. I'm considering the Panasonic, but notice that it's not too highly rated either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Handset dead","review":"The handset to the unit was DOA. Not a battery problem. Ordered an additional handset and that one would not take numbers in memory."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sort of works","review":"Got the refurbished product on time. I already had the same product I was using and part of it stopped working. Got this one but the main phone will not hold a charge. The base unit works great. Combined my now two units and everything works now. I probably should have just shelled out for newer technology."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice features but very bad voice feedback on Line 2","review":"Others reviewers have mentioned this as well. There is a lot of voice feedback of your own voice on Line 2, making it almost unusable. For a phone that costs this much, this problem is completely unacceptable. It is a phone problem, as even if I swith the lines around, the feedback stays on Line 2, instead of switching with the lines. Uniden customer service advised me to do a soft reset of the handset, but this did nothing. I exchanged the phone at the store, but the second one has the same problem. This is sad, because it is otherwise an excellent phone, and I hate to return it to the store.Wake up Uniden - fix this bug!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Do Not Disturb does allow business use","review":"I read most of the reviews for the Uniden Cordless, and only found one comment that concerned me: one reviewer stated it could not be used for business, cause there was no way to keep 2nd line from ringing while on business line. This was the problem I had with my last corded 2 line phone, but could not find cordless that specifically noted this capability so went ahead and ordered the Uniden. Imagine my joy and ecstacy when I received the Uniden and it has Do Not Disturb button that does in fact allow me to stop the ringing of one line while on the other. No issues with the phone. Works as advertised and have had it about one month."},{"rating":"2","title":"The other reviews are right - this phone is worth every penny","review":"The other reviews for this phone are dead-on. I use this phone in my home office for business and home use and it works flawlessly.

But this one's going back too...why pay more for what is basically the same performance?Again: DON'T BELIEVE THE ADVERTISING B.S. !!!!I'm giving this phone 1 star not for its actual performance, but for the absolutely shameless advertising HYPE around it.(This is kind of like a 3.0GHz PC compared to a 1.2GHz PC: with 90% of commonly used applications, their performance is virtually identical...only you'll pay a lot more for the bigger number GHz.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Uniden TRU8866","review":"This is a wonderful item.

That was, until I noticed that the phone is unable to detect that a line is in use from a non Uniden phone. My primary reason for having 2 lines is so my wife can be on a call in the other room (from a non Uniden phone) and I can see this on the base or handset and choose to use the 2nd line without picking up and disturbing her call. I thought that this was the most basic of 2-line features. I guess Uniden thinks otherwise.

So, I probably will return it since I am not convinced it is adequate for dairy. It took at least hour to chill the box down from a room temperature start.

I would be careful keeping something perishable in here. But for keeping soda cool on a trip(they include a car adapter), its probably fine, and takes up much less space than a packed ice chest.I had high hopes for it.

I needed it to keep breastmilk cold on a trip and it would have been PERFECT if it could have just gotten colder.

Set in a Norway that makes you want to grab the first flight out there, it's haunting story is of a cellist who lives life by her own rules from the age of 5. Not 'slow' like Babette's Feast, but with all the subtleties that we just don't get in most Hollywood movies. But not so intropective that you get lost on your own navel. Really a treat. The music, awesome, and the acting... well very good. To me, I put it up there with the likes of The English Patient, Frances, Indochine. You'll just have to get it and see for yourself. Honestly, it's one of those kind of movies ( I had the opportunity to see it in the theaters) that when it's done, you want more and you want to act on making your life more full.

While there is room for improvement, this is a solid effort that shows a great deal of promise, but also works great on its own. Simply put, if indie rock just doesn't quite rock hard enough for you, then give Snowden a listen because they certainly bring to the table some of that passion that I've been missing. Plus, with Spotify nowadays, you can hear it and know what you're getting into.

It is obvious why the Black Eyes track is the single most heard off the album; it sounds like they spent WAY more time honing their craft on that one track than the whole album.Moment of honesty - should have just bought the single and left the rest alone.

Upon hearing it, I wasn't sure what to think. It was unlike any other band I've heard; infectious basslines, energetic drumming, and endearing, though somewhat off-key vocals.Comparisons can be made with Interpol, but I find Snowden to be more upbeat and catchy. Whereas Interpol has more of a minimalist sound, Snowden simply has more sound, period.The album quickly grew on me to the point where the CD never left my player, and 6 months later I still listen to it regularly.

What if these same medieval simpletons were then to take this ship to the nearest colony world of this alien power, guided by a captive alien. Imagine the fun and utter destruction that would ensue.This is a light and fun novel that explores completely ludicrous what ifs but is enjoyable nonetheless.

A good quick read that should be read as the light fare that it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Your basic story of knights, aliens and spaceships.","review":"This was one of the best books I have read in a while.

This was when I discovered a music that was power and grace and best things of the imagination. For me, it was the music that took me past the music of Adolescence, the state which rock and roll seems to keep many adults forever stuck in a perpetual state of.But I digress... Like all the other reviewers, this is one of the best My Favorite Things. You also get to hear Roy Haynes, who really was special with Coltrane.For another great MFT, check out Live At Village Vangard Again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine, underrated effort....","review":"This is a very fine effort by our beloved Mr. Coltrane. It's really not mentioned with his other efforts, but I got it really cheap, so I figured why not? It starts out with a beautiful rendition of I Want to Talk About You. That track has a beautiful a capella solo by Coltrane which goes on for around 4 minutes or so. It's amazing how much emotion Coltrane could bring through his instrument by himself. The edition of My Favorite Things is my favorite rendition (so far). Impressions is fine, as is Chasin' Another Trane (even though I prefer the blistering Chasin' the Trane from the Village Vanguard Album, one of Coltrane's finest hours). There's a little of Ornette in Chasin' Another Trane, which isn't surprising, as Coltrane took some lessons from Coleman before venturing off into free jazz.If you're a Coltrane fan, grab a whole of this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"everything here is better somewhere else","review":"There is one reason I do not like this album: the drumming of Roy Haynes. I am no drumming expert, but I know what sounds good to me. Elvin Jones sounds good, but he was unavailable to Trane at the time, so Haynes replaced him. Now, Haynes is supposed to be a great drummer, but his style clashes with Coltrane. Have you ever felt your heart kind of blip, as if there was a funny beat or a skipped beat? That is Haynes on this album. His snare drum sounds awful, and it keeps coming in at what sounds like the wrong moment. He utterly ruins I Want to Talk About You, which otherwise is every bit as beautiful as the verison on Live at Birdland. In fact, buy Live at Birdland instead of this record."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOTHING MORE THAN PLEASANT","review":"I have a few tapes with Dorothy Kirsten singing two of her most famous operatic roles: 'Mimi' in \\"La Boheme\\" and the title role in \\"Madama Butterfly.\\" Both are beautifully performed. This crossover album is certainly not as pathetic as the travesties produced for the great Joan Sutherland (Noel Coward songs) or Jessye Norman (Michel Legrand songs). Actually Kirsten's voice is perfectly fine. In fact, in the CD's liner notes, we're told that she started her career as a pop singer on the radio and this makes perfect sense. She has the sweet sound and lack of interpretive skills of a big band singer. The legendary Gershwin and Kern songs are simply sung pleasantly. Nothing more! The so-called \\"tropical love songs\\" are just a bit embarrassing, but then I cannot think of anyone besides Xavier Cugat who should perform them."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL.

And to make matters worse, I have, in the middle of a conference call, placed the handset (with a self-declared, imminently-failing battery), on the charger in hopes that it would charge while the conference call was ongoing.It hung up.GRRRRRRR!

I can walk an easy hundred feet from the base set before static becomes audible. I converted to Vonage about a year ago and have this system is plugged into that, still flawless and without issue. The only issue is with the batteries, which is why I stopped at four stars. Throw away the batteries that come with the phone! You will see this common thread with other Panasonic phone owners. The Energizer ER-P511 battery will give you double if not triple the talk/standby time and last years instead of months."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hunk-O-Junk","review":"I agree with those who've said the battery life for these phones suck.

I also agree with the other reviewer who said the caller ID only works about half the time.

The listed features are great however the battery life is pathetic (on average less than 15 min. on a full charge). If you don't put the phone back on the charging base after each call you will be lucky to complete two calls before getting the low battery warning. In addition the displays intermittently go blank. I have four phone in my system and all four do the same thing. I have spoken to at least 8 other people with these phones and all have the same problem.

Still, this is the second phone I have gone through in less than a year. I have spent hours on the phone with Panasonic trying to fix the problem. Panasonic replaced the phone twice with refurbished models and still the battery life is horrible. We looked into having the settings wrong to just a bad battery. I am now trying the newer model with the NiMHd battery instead of the NiCd. Let's see how this works. I am very disappointed with the customer service offered by Panasonic.

The original one of two, cannot be heard except on speaker, which is the one I was trying to get fixed for so long.I'm surprised that the cost is still so high after so long, and the volume on the handsets is still not loud enough.

The solution is not arrived at via sleuthing but by a chain of events that would have occured had anyone been assigned to the case. The opening book is the most intriguing. Downhill from there. Real disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"For P.D. James fans only!","review":"I have read all of P.D. James' books and was somewhat disappointed. The characters are there and it keeps you reading, but the depth is missing."},{"rating":"2","title":"P.D.James best to date,Resented time away from this.","review":"Well developed characters. Few Red herrings, Paints excellent picture both of Scotland Yard's methods and English legal system. If film rights purchased Glenn Close would find dream role as Venetia."},{"rating":"1","title":"Social stereotypes behave predictably...","review":"There is little new or surprising in this latest effort from James. There is a certain whiff of snobbery and misogeny about this book. The main female characters (nearly all victims of one sort or another) are portrayed by dysfunction, insecurities and social class, with scant attention to any unique individuality. Few of the characters elicit interest or sympathy. Dalgleish, the most complex character here, is woefully absent for big chunks of this book. I'm not surprised this is getting better reviews in the US, distance from its setting (London, UK) probably enhances its plausability!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hardly a worthwhile purchase","review":"The plot is poor, the characterizations are simplistic, the solution is arrived at without any deduction, and the writing is stuffy and overblown. What's to like?I might have given it 2 stars if it were not for Ms James' extraordinarily irritating verbal tic -- \\"hardly\\". \\"I would hardly ask him that\\", etc. Hardly a common turn of phrase but it appears that Ms James can hardly write a paragraph of dialogue without it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just about anything P.D. James writes...I will read!","review":"I think she is a great writer of mystery. Adam Dalgliesh seems like a member of my family, I know him so well. I never can never out-guess Adam or P.D. James.Robbie"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sort of interesting, but ineffectively presented","review":"This is a very standard P.D. James mystery in terms of plot and characters. The story is somewhat interesting, but is not well told - the book is far lengthier than it should be given the plot.The characters, normally decent, are very two dimensional with stereotypical old english personalities. All of them are hyper-aware of the feelings of other and all seem to notice small details with clarity (and are only too happy to exposit for pages). Also, James continues to beat the gender-differences drum monotonously, which makes the text seem dated.Overall, I would not recommend going out of your way to read this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"P.D. James always satisfies","review":"As always, P.D.James and Adam Dalgliesh make for absorbing reading. I don't know how I missed this one, but I'm glad to catch up with it now."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit overdone","review":"I had high hopes for this book, and was certainly interested in the \\"large print\\" aspect, but was dismayed to find that the publisher chose to make the print SO large that only one letter would fit per page. While this did heighten suspense in that longer words required quite a bit of page-turning, I feel that Random House may have gone a bit overboard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very inefficient mystery","review":"This is the first PDJ I read, and it has all the makings of a cheap mystery. In the name of \\"character development\\", all the characters NOT CONNECTED to the plot are given a lot of bandwidth. Half-way through the 'mystery', I figured out who the 'culprit' was, because that character was not being given any importance.I dont understand the similarities drawn to Ms Chrisite. Her books have an aura of spookiness, which PDJ has not achieved in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"PD James at her best!","review":"What a rewarding experience! I didn't think James could better her earlier works but boy, was I wrong! A gripping story-line, an ingenious understanding of human psyche, a realistic appraisal of the criminal justice system - James' insights and prose are second to none. A must for any crime-detective novel buffs and highly recommended to all rookies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding British mystery.","review":"IMHO P. D. James is the best living Mystery writer and her Adam Dalgliesh is the most well developed character in the modern novel.

Lots of fascinating details about the English system of Law."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant plotting","review":"This is a mystery concerning love and hate and all the shades of emotion in between.

The wires get caught on the plastic parts, making it difficult to re-open after cutting through the egg. It also doesn't cut all the way through a jumbo egg, it leaves a bit on the bottom uncut, and you have to push it back up through the wires to finish the cut."},{"rating":"1","title":"cute but not very good","review":"It looks cute, but the cute-factor no longer soothes my irritation when this product turns what should be a simple matter of slicing an egg into an ordeal. The product is difficult to clean and the metal wires just don't have enough tension in them to be able to cut the egg properly - they get pushed out of the way and seem so flimsy that I am amazed they have not snapped yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ripped Off","review":"I have only used this once and the wires separated from the egg.

Since I was ordering other items I ordered it too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost a home run","review":"Wedgey certainly is cute. However, keep in mind to only use this on eggs or other very soft food items. It is a little hard to line the wires up appropriately. For the price, this is a good piece of equipment and a whimsical addition to any kitchen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute but poor performer.","review":"I've only owned this for a few months and one of the wire cutters is already broken. And because of the way it is designed (one continuous loop of wire), all of the other wires have lost tension. Now when I slice an egg, the wires don't always line up with their slots. This is compounded by the fact that there is a lot of play in the hinge.I used to think this was cute but now it's super annoying to use and I feel mocked by it's stupid little face.Sure I may have abused it by slicing mushrooms, but I expect an egg slicer to be able to handle that.Today I bought a Westmark egg slicer. It's cast aluminum body feels sturdier and it is definitely better designed (made in Germany). Each wire cutter is it's own individual wire that relies on a metal connection (not plastic) to stay tensioned and seated. Also there is very little slop in the hinge. It may have cost fives times more, but I think it will prove to be worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"broke after first use","review":"I gave this 2 stars because this egg slicer is really cute, that was the only good quality about this product. However, one of the wires broke after the FIRST use! I was slicing de-shelled, hard-boiled eggs (what this product is meant for) and I didn't even get to the 3rd egg and it was broken."},{"rating":"2","title":"So cute.","review":"Bought these for my daughters, each in their own apartment for the first time.

I really look forward to reading them each day.I was disappointed with this one. First of all, the first letter of the first word in each paragraph is missing, probably because this is a Kindle edition. It's still distracting though. I just didn't feel like I got much out of this daily meditation book. It's one of the last ones that I read each day because of that reason.The good point of this book is that it was free on kindle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Stuff","review":"Recorded on two seperate occasions in 1963 and 1965 with replacement drummer Roy Haynes, while Quartet regular Elvin Jones was in rehab, this is a fine addition for any Coltrane collector. Though Jones' trademark thunder is absent, Haynes adds a tight finesse to the typically wild Quartet sound. The material is strong throughout, especially \\"Dear Old Stockholm\\" and the serene \\"After the Rain\\". The frenetic \\"One Down,One Up\\" and \\"After the Crescent\\" (both recorded during the 1965 session) evoke the kindred mayhem of Coltrane's \\"Sun Ship\\" recordings made that year and suffer many of the same problems of his work of that period. Unquestionably, the high point here is the albums swan song \\"Dear Lord\\". Perhaps the saddest song Trane ever performed; understated and wonderfully blue, it reminds us that beyond his legacy as avant garde explorer he was first and foremost a master of melody and lyricism."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book for the Study of Indian Cinema","review":"This book offers an in depth study of Indian popular cinema, concentrating mainly on films made during the 1950's and 60's after India gained nationhood. The book provides insight into how Indian cinema dramatically influenced popular culture by reinforcing values or creating new ones, and highlighting/recreating Indian history through film. The book also sheds a great deal of light on the symbolisim that is a part of all Indian films. I would reccomend this book to anyone who has a love of Indian cinema or who may want to learn more about it. A good historical analysis with many good photos."},{"rating":"1","title":"Factually incorrect, knowledge of Hindi highly suspect!","review":"As a student of cinema and history, I am amazed at the attention this book on the popular Indian cinema has been able to garner. The book is full of such obvious howlers as for instance the translation of BR Chopra's \\"Naya Daur\\" as not the \\"New Epoch\\" but as the \\"New Race\\". It seems that the writer has been somewhat overwhelmed by the rural tonga race included in the film. I wonder if, with that kind of understanding of the broadly \\"Hindustani\\" language, it is really possible to write the kind of seminal film and cultural study that this book is being so unabashedly advertised as by the likes of Robert Stam and the OUPs of this planet. Having gone through the book I have been able to find at least 71 similar mistakes. Just because India is far off and Hindustani an unknown quantity, one doesn't have to jump to Ms Chakravarty's defence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ignore the Title","review":"This book does go over Hawaiian Folk tales but only in direct comparison to the Bible. This is more a comparative religion text than a book of tales and legends. No tale is told in its entirety without constant interjections pointing out how similar Hawaiian tales are to Biblical tales. All in all, a frustrating read for those who are not already familiar with Hawaiian legends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Indispensable","review":"Wegren's book is a comprehensive and detailed analysis of the post-Soviet agricultural reforms in Russia. He successfully argues that the Russian state is not \\"weak\\" compared to its Soviet counterpart, but that it is still stronger than other components of society, thus creating numerous barriers to the development of an expanding free market in the rural areas. His archival, fieldwork and anecdotal information make this a tremendous contribution to the social sciences."},{"rating":"1","title":"enough of the tired academic approach and prose","review":"Alas, this could have been a book filled with enlightening explorations of the endless catastrophe called Russian/Soviet agriculture. Instead, we get tired recitations of fact mixed with analytical reviews of theories that lead the reader away from exactly the places where most readers will probably want to go -- to the farms of the ex-USSR, where real people are struggling with a monumentally inefficient system that's all but collapsed under its own weight.

Crescent on disc 2 is a thing of beauty, the little coda at the end of the applause is quite startling.

I love literature in all its shapes and forms, the printed word is a beautiful thing. Having said that this book is not merely an affront to anyone remotely connected to any war or human induced suffering, but is an affront to language itself. Prager's self obssesed heroine and the author's inate ability to make mountains out of molehills and vice versa combine in a glorification of self indulgence and narcissism.

Worst customer service !","review":"I purchased this phone thru Amazon.com in May, 2005. Phone worked great for 2 to 3 months and now battery charged overnight, lasts only 15-20 minutes. Yesterday, I called Panasonic customer service and it was worst than the battery quality. This support person wasted 45 minutes of my time troubleshooting this problem. Oh Come on ! This overseas support is useless and I felt like I ran into a brickwall. He kept denying that battery should be under warranty for one year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Dissappointed!!","review":"For the price I paid for this unit (I think almost $130 without the answering system feature) this phone should last 5 years! I charged the phone for more than the reccomended 15 hrs prior to use, and to my surprise, the battery died within 10 minutes of use the next day. I have replaced the battery 3 times now with both Panasonic and non brand batteries, and nothing has worked. It will appear to have charged to the full 3 bars, yet when I lift it off the reciever, it will drop down to one bar in seconds! This is even after a full 24 hours of uninterrupted charging. My calls get cut off even when the display shows 3 full bars, and the phone will say that it is out of range of the base even when it is only 6 inches away!DO NOT BUY THESE PHONES!!! At least wait until it seems that Panasonic has fixed the problem!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Impressed","review":"In short, I like gadgets with features. I thought I would like this phone system. I bought into this phone and set them up around the home. The reviews below are accurate. The battery life is short (less than 1 hour talk time) and I have already had to replace the batteries and I have not yet had the phone 1 year.The 'flash' feature does not work. I have Verizon and it does not respond when the 'flash' feature is pressed. Verison says it is the phone not giving the right signal or it is too short of a signal.Otherwise, the clarity is fine. I just hate not being able to easily switch to a second caller. I'd stay away from the series (maybe this brand) when I spend money to update this system.Good Luck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is an aweful phone","review":"Bought this phone as a result of trying 2 different Panasonic 900 MHz phones (which were both poor quality). I thought I was just having a problem with the range and wanted to try the next up in MHz. BAD IDEA. Panasonic has come up with a seemingly ideal phone with some great looking features but they have no idea of how to build a phone that will work or customer service that will properly address the issue. They continue to sell this phone in spite of very poor craftsmanship.-Very bad battery life (sorry to say that it will NOT last more than 20 minutes)-Very bad sound quality-Very bad customer service-Very high priceMy parents have the same phone and have had the EXACT same problems as have I and 90% of the reviewers, keep reading if you do not believe me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor battery charger","review":"I purchased this phone for my home office. I have replaced the battery twice in 6 months and, according to the place of purchase, the battery should last 1-2 years. I have a much older Panasonic with speakerphone for my home and have never had to replace the battery. In this phone, it slowly provides less and less time between charges until you can only speak on the handheld for about 30 minutes before it dies completely. Panasonic has told me to send it in for a new one, which I plan to do. But, that is very inconvenient. The other features work fine when the battery is fresh, but the battery charger is a deal-breaker."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's worse than you can imagine...","review":"I'm not often compelled to write negative reviews of products, but I just couldn't help myself on this one. Based on my experience, and the experience of a good friend who also owns this system (we both own the base unit with one or more extensions... I have two extension units myself) I would have to say that Panasonic has made a very poor decision to let this one out of the RnD lab. I've had every problem you can imagine with these phones... the battery life sucks right out of the box... one unit went bad and stopped charging the battery... one unit has a bad display... they interfere with other electronic devices... these phones are a joke.

I think these phones should have better batteries than they do. Ni-Cad is very cheap with relatively low power density. Don't know how the recharge cycles compare to Ni-Mh or Li-Ion.If you buy this phone, just expect that once a year (perhaps more often) you'll need to replace the batteries which are expensive.Aside from the cost of the batteries the phone does what I would expect it to.

They said it was part of the warranty on this particular phone. So, I'm guessing this phone has had major problems and that's why they're running such a great deal on it.

Seems like there was plenty of warning.This is not the world's cheapest phone, so I was hoping for more. The battery it came with was almost worthless. I replaced it (the beginning of $$$) and saw better performance, but then the phone as a whole deteriorated so that now, about four months in, I can barely talk for 10 minutes before I get the dread \\"No Link to Base\\" message. It works fine as long as I'm willing to use it on speakerphone, but as a cordless handset it's 90% useless. Even more disappointing, the Panasonic headset I bought (more $$$) was also unusable with this phone ... I couldn't hear the other party at all.

My friends ask me if I am in propeller plane. The biggest disappointment is the battery. You won't believe this, but, this phone needs to be charged every 2 days.

The phone loses its charge almost every day where as I never had this problem with my earlier phones. On more research found that the battery used PP511 has a huge memory effect (which is pretty bad) and seems almost everyone has this problem. Just search the internet with the the battery model number.Bottom line it looks great for the price, but is very expensive for this low quality piece from Panasonic.Moreover I bought this phone with a $40 mail in rebate from Panasonic which I never received after 6 months."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Battery Life & Voice Quality","review":"The battery life is terrible. 3 months from the day I bought the phone, the battery would last only for a maximum of 30 minute phone call.

The only option they provided was to send the phone to their service center and then I would be stuck without a phone for 15 - 20 days ! Panasonic's service sucks.

However as time went on, battery life has deteriorated to a point that it is a joke. Sometimes we get just 20 minutes without speaker phone. I have both a speaker phone/base station and an extension set. The extension is worse, but the base station is only slightly better in terms of battery life. So if you see 4 or 5 stars in the rating by some ...reviewer for this phone, you know it is someone who just recently bought the phone; if you seee 1 star, it is someone like me, who has had this phone for a while, who Panasonic has nicely fleeced but has finally figured it out!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Feature packed, but...","review":"This phone offers great features and is easy to use, but the battery life is terrible.

I can nary get the phone to display more than one bar of battery life on the handheld screen.More importantly, the speakerphone capability on the handset ceased functioning 35 days after I purchased the unit. Beyond that, the phone looks cheap and feels flimsy, and I find the user interface on the handheld quite awkward.All in all, I recommend that you consider alternative products."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Battery, strange Caller ID","review":"After waiting for Panasonic to come up with it's own \\"non V-Tech\\" expandable phone system, I was excited when this model showed up on the shelves this Summer. I purchased it along with an extra headset. The sound quality was excellent, and the features were nice, but I returned it because the battery didn't hold a charge. After being on \\"standby\\" for 10 hours, both handsets went from 3 bars (fully charged) to one bar (needs recharging). My old analog 900mhz Panasonic stayed fully charged for four-to-five days. Sure, I could keep the handset in the charger at all times, but who does that?Also, the caller-ID was very slow to post the name/number on the display. After the 2nd ring, \\"incoming call\\" would still appear. Frustrating. Another annoying thing was the inabilty to auto-dial multiple numbers from the handset. This is needed if you have a pre-paid calling card. Because the maxium numbers you can auto-dial is 22, it is impossible to do this."},{"rating":"1","title":"LEMON product","review":"This is the most disappointing purchase I have ever made. I expected a lot for the money - at the very least, for the phone to work. I bought the 2nd handset for this, and both of them behave the same way. The charger does not work - after being on the cradle for 24 hrs, the phone indicates to put it back on the cradle - cannot talk. On a good day, I can talk on either handset for 10 minutes before it dies with little warning. While sitting right next to the base, the phone indicates to get closer to base. I live in a shoebox apartment, so there shouldn't be a case of being too far from the base. The caller ID doesn't work - we hardly EVER get an actual name or number - just \\"outside caller\\". Customer Service indicates 7 minutes to answer, but what the automated voice really means is \\"never\\" or in an hour. This phone could have a lot of potential (based on all of the other cool features) but the most important features are LEMONS.

There are reviews all over the Amazon site that give a true picture of what this phone is all about. It really is a great phone on paper and apparently cordless phone technology just cannot catch up with cell phones. They really have a LOT of bugs to get out of the systems.Do yourself a favor, get a cheap cordless phone/answering machine.

I do use the room monitor mode, and the intercom is wonderful provided you remember what number phone is in what room. My solution is I have the phones numbered according to what floor they are on in the house. The cordless range is good, I can take my phone to the neighbor's house and it works pretty good.

This is one of my favorite ska bands of all-time, and this CD definitely is at the top of my list. It had some really great rhythms in it, and the energy and force behind songs like Ohichyo, Minimum Wage, and Kanasimiyo always get me going. Some tunes have somewhat somber overtones, but it's all great.

I don't plan to make movies with it. I like being able to see the front and back of my house. However, the user manual is worthless. The biggest drawback is that the wireless cameras totally knock out my wireless home network. Laptops put next to the access point can't find a signal. It uses the same 2.4 GHz band as home routers. Swann said there is no solution, buy a wired system. Defeats the convenience feature, doesn't it? It could possibly interrupt your neighbor's as well.

For people who are avid \\"North Korea watchers\\" or researchers, it may very well be worth a look.

To do a slide show of pictures, you have to have all the pictures in the same folder. Besides, you can not have more than 500 pictures per folder, or the last ones will not be shown. So if you have lots pictures organized in folders (like most of us do), you have to copy them into a same folder, which is very troublesome; and most likely you will have to split them in different folders of 500 pictures each, and every once in a while select a different folder. I wish there was a firmware upgrade so the product could randomly display pictures in any folder in a memory device. ...Oops, almost forgot, even though you have different options for memory devices, they cannot be more than 1GB in size or they wont work, another annoyance since nowdays is difficult to find devices of less than 2GB."},{"rating":"1","title":"Es una porquería","review":"La imagen de este frame es pésima, se ven pixeladas las fotos, adicionalmente en 4:3 se ve la imagen muy pequeña y en 16:9 se deforma la imagen pues se ve alargada.Realmente me siento estafado...!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Biggest peice of junk ever","review":"I got this because it has all these good reviews just to find out that it is junk. the picture quality is not excellent like everyone says. matter of fact the picture quality is very poor and the whites are washy and the blacks too. it puts lines through the pictures occasionally and lastly..it slowly moves my photos to the side. after it runs for about 2 days i have to turn it off to \\"reset\\". every picture moves to the left just a tiny little bit and after the pics scroll through eventually you notice them shifting off the screen.

If you load a picture before adjusting it (you wouldn't know you needed to adjust it unless you load it first), it won't save in the new format and you can't change the brightness/tone or whatever.

Not what I paid here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor customer service","review":"I've had several digital frames in the past. This product is grossly inferior to the others I've purchased. The slide show would freeze after only a few photos. I tried two different types and brands of memory cards (CF and SD) with different photo files on each, with the same freezing problem occurring each time. I tried twice to call customer service (good luck finding the number on the company's web site) and each time I was placed on hold for 10 minutes or more, waiting patiently while I was told what person in line I was. Both times, when I was 3rd or 4th in line, the system hung up and told me to call back later! I sent two emails with no response. I returned the frame and bought a brand I had purchased before. Stay away!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy Manufacture service","review":"The limited manual does NOT cover how to delete a picture.

We got very frustrated and decided it's not worth it to keep it longer. We really want to have digital frame and still looking for the good one, but we may have to wait until Costco can come up with something cheaper and easier to use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fatal flaw","review":"The Coby DP888 has, for me, a fatal flaw that I feel should have been disclosed in the advertising. It can only recognize and show 2000 pictures from an SD card (and I would guess any other memory card type), even if the card contains many more pictures. Of course, over the course of a lifetime, many of us take far more than 2000 pictures. My 2GB SD card is only 1/3 full with 3300 pictures on it, so I expected the DP888 to be able to show a huge number of photos, but sadly, it can't. I wonder if Coby's more recent products continue to have this limitation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware!","review":"Just to let everyone know, this frame DOES NOT accept SD HC (High Capacity) cards. For those of us with high-megapixel cameras that are going to that type of card, this particular frame is one you want to steer clear of.As an update...since this review has been \\"blasted\\" for being off-base, let me just say that is very difficult to navigate the specifications for these frames. There is a lot of info to sort through, and since almost any current SD card that isn't of the lowest memory is automatically a \\"HC\\" card, it is more to make sure the consumer looks at their SD card before purchasing. SDHC is not just an alternate version of SD, as I assumed. I'm not the smartest person I know, but I'm sure at least a few others new to this game have made the same mistake.My frustration is that any current mass-marketed frame SHOULD be made to include SDHC."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"Ordered 3 of these on 12/15 and only now, 3 days before Christmas, did I receive an email stating they are out of stock.

Thankfully the product interface is simple and if you try, and try and try again with file sizes, you do get to a reasonable end result, but if you try to call their technical support line, you will be very disappointed. They don't know their own product well enough to give clear guidelines on file sizes and resolution specs. Their only response is \\"It's not a digital TV, so don't expect much\\". Don't waste your time with a phone call to them, do your research on the web, even the info in this forum is more complete than at the COBY help line. I did buy and give 3 of these for Xmas, but I would never buy again from COBY and would tell others to avoid them too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy for someone who lacks tech savvy","review":"The instructions are unclear and the user interface very clunky.

It might be OK if you set it up for the person and give it to him or her. I am not familiar with digital photo frames in general, but the screen does seem awfully dark.

I would have given it 4 or 5 stars. But, after 2 weeks the remote died. I called technical support and after going through some debugging they agreed the remote was defective so they gave me a procedure to submit a claim for a new remote under the warranty. That was a month ago. I am still waiting for a new remote and when I called this week they stated it could take another month. In the meantime the unit is useless, unless of course all I want to do is a static display of 1 photo. The remote is required to access most of the menu items.The remote dying after a week I could chalk up to me being unlucky but the poor service after the fact is inexcusable. 1 star.

We do use the remote control which is nice.She has not tried any of the other features so I can't comment on them.

All of the photos I put on it are super contrasty - to the point that I can't use black & white images at all and detail is lost in almost all of the pictures - faces are terribly washed out. Reds are really red and colors in general are just very wonky. Is this just because it's a digital frame and they're all like this or is it just this one? I get the horizontal lines through pictures from time to time that others have mentioned and I agree that it does not make sense that the music and pictures don't work together.Also, I wish Amazon would change the photo of the product because it is misleading.

Coby tech support says they have only four models that actually can do that. If you want something that plays mp3 files OR displays photos, this is the one for you.Hard to Use: The remote control has very tiny buttons that only seem to work about half the time. Even using the buttons on the back of the unit does not guarantee that a command will go through on the first button push. Also, there are buttons that are only located on the remote, so DO NOT lose your remote.

The Philips has a nicer design and feel.The resolution on this frame is 800x480. I put in a memory card from my Nikon D40x (10.2 MP) and displayed the slideshow. I was suprised at the quality.

But, the fact that the pictures do not fit your screen well irritated me initially until I found out a solution. You need a software to convert your 4:3 pictures to 16:9. The software I used is \\"JS PhotoPrep\\". You can convert all your pics at once. Once you download and install, check mark both \\"Perform Crop\\" and \\"Perform Resize\\". Select Crop ratio as 4X6 and \\"Desk-view\\" in Perform Resize with a High quality (for enlarging). Now use these pics on your Coby Photo frame.

Also, the programming is so congested and slow that it wont let you skip through photos at will, you have to wait, which sometimes takes 30 seconds to a minute even with 5 sec slides. the buttons are plastic and flimsy. The button to make selections is the same to turn it off so it often ends up shutting off when you get frustrates because it doesn't make the selection you want.I only give it two stars because the picture quality is nice for the pictures that do work.

Not worth it, I would pay more for a better quality frame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dead after one hour","review":"Worked great for the first hour then went completely dead. A nice product but overall people are having too many failures."},{"rating":"1","title":"No internal memory, you must provide your own","review":"Buyers should be aware that this frame has no internal memory and can't be hooked directly to your PC. You'll need external memory (SD card, USB Flash Drive, etc) to view any photos.Of course, if you spend $10 and get a 1 gig USB flash, then spend some time formatting your photos to meet the frame's tiny 320 x 240 display resolution, then you can run a slideshow of hundreds, if not thousands of photos. But unlike most other frames on the market, this frame doesn't come with any way to remember your photos ... you'll need to provide your own memory."},{"rating":"1","title":"Product short-commings not reflected in price","review":"Not stated anywhere in the manual - if you are using a USB flash card that has more than 2004 pictures, - some pictures will never be displayed. The frame will display only the first 2004 pictures.ALSO the random shuffle mode is not really random at all, the same pictures will be cycled over and over like 1st, 5th, 8th, etc, but other pictures will never get displayed.Customer technical support is rude (they do not even pretend to be polite and hang up on you if you ask questions tey do not know the answers to) and they are not knowledgable. I am an experienced computer engineer and my opinion is that this piece of electronics is not a quality product, however the price is quite high and does not reflect the short-commings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Digital Photo","review":"I was disappointed to learn that this frame does not come with memory! I should have read more clearily. We wound up purchasing a small jump drive so I could load pictures from my computer from a variety of years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good digital photo frame","review":"This review is for the DP-887. 8\\" non-widescreen frame.First this is one of the non-widescreen photo viewers, which means it actually will not crop any of your normal sized photos which is probably most of what you have. Also this is an 800x600 display which means that for the size of the screen the resolution is absolutely awesome and pictures look great. Also it is fairly bright and has pretty good color rendition.The styling is okay, a little cheap looking, but not more cheap than your average photo-frame and if you really don't like it you can probably find a different frame.The transitions bothered a me a little at first, but you can fiddle with the settings.In short this is probably one of the best digital photoframes currently available (Jan 08) and one of the cheaper ones at this time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Mac users","review":"Even though this product advertises that it will work on Mac computers, it won't.

After getting it for a gift for my mom, loading an SD card with images, and then struggling through the non-intuitive UI on the frame, I finally got it to display a slideshow of the photos... and what I saw was an inferior quality! The photos are pixelated, and the resolution of the screen looks like a dot-matrix print-out.I should return the product, but it's for a Christmas gift, and it's too late. My advice: skip this one -- the field is too crowded to accept the inferiority of this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"A few probs","review":"This product has served the purpose my wife wanted it to. One thing I wish I knew before I bought this item is it will not play mp3s and show pics at the same time. It does have one glitch that is not a serious problem. When the unit gets warm from use, it will put lines through a picture every now and then. The only other thing I would make sure of is that you have some sort of extra external memory card. This unit does not have internal memory of any sort. Jump drives are cheap and easy to use though!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Grainy picture quality","review":"Diappointing picture quality. The online product overview states 'crisp picture', but I found it very grainy or pixelated (& I used high res digital photos from a new camera). It also had trouble reading 2 different SD cards, but I got it to work with the 3rd one. Manual is vague. Please note there are buttons on the top of frame to deal with the onscreen menu, although it looks like it should be touch screen. The frame is nice looking & has a nice finish. It doesn't look like wood, but it has a nice molded shape. Also has a small power brick. I'm returning the two I bought for gifts (drat)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor picture quality, even worse customer service!!","review":"I purchased 3 of these frames for Christmas gifts based on the affordable price. The idea was to pre-load the frames with photos to give to our family, since we won't be together for the holidays. When I received the frames, I was really disappointed in the picture quality, but was going to keep them until I had trouble with the interface and horribly vague manual. I am a pretty tech savvy person, and all I wanted to accomplish was have our photos start up when you plug in the thing. Everytime you turn the frame on, you have to select about 5 prompts to get the slideshow started. I called Coby to see if there were other settings, and they emailed me instructions on reinstalling a MP3 player....nothing about the frame. I returned all three and purchased the $99 Westinghouse frame instead, which works like a dream, and has lots of settings to customize viewing the images..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for the price but the item is misleading...","review":"This little digital picture frame does it all, playing back photos, music and video (AVI only coded in Xvid). Good bargin considering other frames cost an arm and leg more; well maybe not a leg but certainly the arm. However be forewarned that this device DOES NOT, I REPEAT DOES NOT play photos and music at the same time and can only do this with video, but that is being redundant since movies are picture and sound anyway. The ad nor the box said this and in fact made it appear to be able to achieve this feat, which it cannot. That is why this product lost a star. That and the picture sometimes shows up fuzzy but that is only after like 20 minutes or so at a time."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT PICTURE SHOW","review":"I bought this picture frame for my Mom for Mother's Day.

It can only read up to 2 GB memory card. It accesses the memory card very slowly and there are a few software flaws. One of them is that when you rotate a photo, you will not be able to save it. Furthermore, it does not support Mac OS X (I called the tech support to verify). I believe they still need to further improve this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sooo not user friendly","review":"I was so excited thinking I had gotten a real score with the low price on this frame. I should have remembered you get what you pay for. This product isn't user friendly at all. I hate returning stuff so I tried to call Coby's customer service twice.

A few weeks later, I added more pix, stuck the drive into the frame. Nothing! It will not recognize the drive anymore. And I checked the drive on my laptop - it is fine.

All the advertised features are present.My one complaint (and disappointment) is that even though the screen size can handle pictures in 4.3 and 16.9 sizes, if a photo is not taken in the 16.9 format it will not be displayed as such. The picture will look distorted.Other Digital Frames in this price range have a feature that lets the picture fill the frame without distortion. I would recommend a prospective buyer look for a Digital Frame with this feature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Initially happy, now dissapointed - broken in 18 months","review":"Initially this was a great deal.. Worked well, it was a gift for my mother.After 18 months of use, she gave it back to me. The screen had 4 dead pixels and flickered constantly like a badly tuned TV channel. The unit was buzzing and I noticed that near the on/off switch, the white plastic had a yellow/brown areas that apparently got hot enough to discolor and slightly melt.Unfortunately, its past it's warranty. Additionally, I'm very concerned that it began to melt near the on/off switch. Perhaps it was best that it failed before it caught on fire and burnt down my mother's house.Stay clear of this frame.

The thing that bothered me the most however was the inability to easily transfer images on my computer to the frame. It's designed to take images off one of the memory cards you find on cameras but there was no way to move older images from the computer directly to the frame without extra hardware. I returned the unit and purchased a larger unit with the ability to transfer images directly from the computer for about the same price at a local H.H. Greg.

Pretty affordable since it's a coby, will playback video (with great frame rate), built in speaker, lots of memory card options, even a usb jump drive. With that being said, probably the one thing that annoys me is that it doesn't remember any of your slideshow settings, so if you turn it off, and you told it to repeat folder, you have to go back and change it again.

The second time they told me that all of my pictures were too big, although all my pictures were way under the 6 MB limit stated in the manual.

There is a thumbnail view showing 4 on each row. In order to get to the photo #500 from, you have to push next button 499 times if you just turned it on. It doesn't save where you left off. There is no page up and down to speed up the browsing. So, if you loaded the frame to its max capacity and have SD card, be prepare to push next button many many times.Another problem I had that the buttons were not very responsive. It may have been a malfunction on the device I received.

Sadly, it was not to be.The fact is, the screen is not that great. It's resolution makes any photo on it pixelated, and in slideshow mode you can barely tell what the pictures are you're looking at. The fact that it's \\"widescreen\\" makes it impossible to display any of your pictures properly on it; they must have had surplus DVD player screens sitting around or something.The fact is you can find nicer screens for just a bit more, so keep looking. I would NOT buy one of these again, fortunately I gave it away as a gift so I don't have to suffer with the thing any more.Recommended Alternatives:Pandigital 8.0-Inch LCD Digital Photo Frame with PanTouchPandigital 11-Inch LCD Digital Picture Frame"},{"rating":"1","title":"Glitchy, buggy, undependable performance on two units","review":"First one arrived but did not display photos properly.

When I went to sync photos onto it with my Mac Powerbook G4, however, over half of the photos inexplicably failed to copy. I spent over two hours trying different solutions: renaming files, switching to tiffs, compressing photos to various sizes, I even tried a different SD card--no effect. Finally, I found that copying each file individually, and trying over and over even when it failed, would eventually work. But considering it took three or four attempts PER FILE, this was profoundly tedious--and even though the pix worked, on the Coby display itself, half of the images were marked as INVALID. I don't know if this is a problem with all digital photo frames but I tried this on two Cobys (I bought one for each set of grandparents) and I had the exact same problem.

Upon first hearing \\"Looking For A Friend\\" I knew I was hearing what was to become one of my favorite songs of all time. This CD is primarily acoustic and the guitar sound is phenomenal, with Ry Cooder as a guest player. Much has been made of David Blue's connection with Bob Dylan, but I have to say that although he died an unknown talent in Dylan's shadow, he possessed a great talent for articulating simple truths, which is the mark of every great songwriter. This CD is extremely moving, and has prompted me to get the remaining 6 discs in David Blue's catalog. The vision I have of him dying alone in Central Park is chilling and casts a pall over this already melancholy music, but like many of my favorite songwriters he didn't kid around while he was here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent phone, bad caller_id","review":"I just returned this phone after owning it for two weeks.

When I saw the verbose feature list on this phone plus the 2.4Ghz range, I jumped.I liked the cell phone like approach to storing numbers, though the interface is quite clunky. Sometimes it's hard to figure out your way back to the main menu.Anyway, the main beef I have with this phone is battery life and construction quality. I've had the phone for less than a year and the battery has reached the point where it starts beeping after having one conversation on the phone. This is unacceptable. For some reason, the LCD panel has gotten so faded that I can barely read it without extreme darkness. I tried to adjust the contrast but nothing happened.Luckily I bought this phone with a 2yr replacement warranty at Best Buy and I'm returning it and its accessory phone to get a better system.I was very happy with the features but the promise was greater than the execution."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wasted money on this","review":"Phone looks cool.

It's poor when 2 people are on different extensions. Also, when on speakerphone, voicemail systems seem unable to hear the touchtones at times, so one needs to switch to using the handset directly.We're still using these phones, but obtained a new set from Uniden (with which I've had much greater success) in case these give us further trouble. Would recommend avoiding this series of Panasonic phones."},{"rating":"1","title":"handset dies","review":"I have had two of these where the handset has just died in a matter of weeks. I just read the other comments with the battery life issue but dont know if that is what caused the failures.

The only way to fix this is to shut everything down, turn the ups off, unplug the ups for a minute, plug it back in and boot everything up again. This will give you a few more days.

My book looks like someone took the original, and photocopied it in black and white, and then bound it with a glossy cover. Based on the tables in the chapters and break out text boxes, there used to be light coloring or shading. This is not the case in the text book I bought, which has grainy/fuzzy tables that are in shades of black or white, or grey. Overall, I'm not super impressed with the publishing quality based on the price I paid for the book, since it was new.I've never have issues with Amazon before, but I'm disappointed with what I got this time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment - Students Beware","review":"Ordered this book from Amazon as new - and did not receive the software.

I bought this book because of Stephen King's recommendation on the front cover and I am very glad that I did.

I am looking forward to his next book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just didn't have what it takes","review":"It took me a while to get into this book, maybe 80 pages or so. The story picked up and held my attention and then bam!....it switches off to something or someone else before I even knew what hit me. There really are some excellent sections of this book but they just didn't last long enough, bringing great disappointment. This book won't get recommended to my large group of reading friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lee Childs and Steven King create a psychological thriller","review":"I really liked the idea of this book, and it is much better written than the average, so much that I think it leans more toward Stephen King than Lee Childs. However, like a Jack Reacher novel from Lee Childs, it's a mild mystery with a lot of action and exploration of interesting circumstances. The plot itself becomes apparent after the first third of the book, at which point it detours from X-Files/Stephen King supernatural scariness into the more literal fiction of Lee Childs, where a social phenomena is made into a tangible, shadowy, micro-conspiracy that then needs destruction by brave heroes. Like many books, the last third is where the author loses his nerve and gets too linear in his writing and also too vague, as he tries to massage together loose ends. I really enjoyed the first half of this book, but found the conspiracy of an overdone archetype, and finished reading without any real sense of mystery."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Most Unusual Tale","review":"This is a good debut novel by the writer and will satisfy the reader if one is willing to overlook certain issues that were noticed by this reader. The character development leaves much to be deired as the featured members in this novel seem to lack depth. The story is a good one with the writer crafting three stories that seem to be divergent into one as this story develops. Unfortunately, the stories do not converge into a solid story until one has completed nearly one fourth of this book and makes for a somewhat confusing and tedious read. The story finally does take off into a good read for the second and third quarter of the work. When the writer brings everything together in the last fourth of the work, the reader is left with a story that is so unrealistic that it detracts from the earlier writing that has been done. The book is fair and this writer shows some positive flashes, yet nothing really special."},{"rating":"2","title":"good mystery","review":"Wow, this is a pretty weird book. Nothing too sick, but just enough character development to keep you interested. I liked how it tried to bring a real world sense to it and never really goes too far.The book doesn't live up to being really scary but that doesn't mean it isn't good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"I picked up this book as an advance copy at the store I work at, and I could not put it down. I felt that the story was very well thought out, though it couldve used more description, it was a well written book. It is slightly reminiscent of early Dean Koontz works. Based on that, I have personally sold about 25 copies of this book in the 2 months it has been out, and have not had a complaint yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"straw men","review":"Great book and I got it on time. I have now read two of the series and waiting for the 3rd installment. I like this author alot."},{"rating":"1","title":"STRUGGLED TO EVEN FINISH","review":"This book flips between two different storylines which appear to be completely unrelated. These dragged out way too long. Eventually they intertwine but I felt the connection to be too contrived and implausible. Just never connected to the story and honestly glad when it ended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gratuitous","review":"I'm a lover of good writing and good thrillers in particular. This book is well written, however I found it sickening in its relish for brutal, evil violence, particularly to young children. Especially if you are a parent I strongly consider giving this book a miss. I bought it on the basis of exceptional reviews. I was not, however, prepared to read its content and have since removed it from my library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thinks it's more clever than it really is","review":"I read this book because Stephen King called it a \\"masterpiece\\". I soon came to realize that Mr. King probably read something else, or his brief review was taken way out of context. The author has tremendous potential as a writer, and he uses language in interesting ways, but he's no storyteller. This book is three times longer than it should be because long passages of useless gibberish fill the page rather than advancing the story. And the finale is disappointing. Moreover, I'm not sure he knows anything about cops, or CIA, or lawyers.This book could have been a raucous good read, but it wants a good editing, first. Mr. Marshall is about two books and a good editor away from becoming a an excellent writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice cover; slow-moving, overly detailed story","review":"Like a few other people here, I bought this book for its cover -- not very smart, but I was curious. (Stephen King's blurb on the cover didn't make any impression on me -- I mean, come on, hasn't he blurbed even John Saul?) The book started out intriguingly but lost its way quickly amidst too much descriptive prose, making it a chore to finish reading it. While there were flashes of humor I liked, they just weren't enough to save the story. Not a keeper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tom Cruise will play the lead....","review":"I think this book was written in a weekend. I'm serious, it's that bad.It starts off just fine, with several seemingly disconnected and shocking events that you assume will be tied together later on. And they are, but when you finish the book, you'll still be scratching your head. The ending just doesn't make sense, neither do any of the character's motivations.The characters are hard enough to keep track of, because besides being stiff and pale representations of real people, they keep being referred to differently by the author. First he's talking in third person, then he's back to first person. It's disconcerting, hard to read, and I can't believe that this book was published without being hacked into a million pieces by an editor. Or perhaps it was.Like another reviewer here, I finished the book, but wish I hadn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"A huge waste of time!!!","review":"I never thought I could express myself this way about a book (after all someone set days and night to write something to succeed) but this book is simply...

I couldn't stay with it, couldn't get into it, didn't care about the characters, the story, or anything.

This was the absolute worst book that I have ever read! I will go on to say that this book got on my nerves. I got to page 221 and deceided that I would not take anymore of this and I just gave up! Please Mr Marshall \\"DON'T WRITE ANYMORE BOOKS LIKE THIS\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"A Chilling Debut","review":"Marshall hits the ground running in one of the best mystery/thriller debuts this year. I picked up this book due to Stephen King's review that it was scary as hell. King was right. Marshall sure knows how to build the suspense as he plots seemingly random events and connects the dots well into the book. It looks to be the first book in a projected series and I can't wait for the continuation!For those of you who hate shifting viewpoints, you may be disaappointed, but Marshall does pull it off well without distracting from the story.If you're in the mood for something scary, something mysterious, by a new writer...this is a darn good bet!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite Good","review":"This is a thriller that will repay handsomely if read. The basis for the story has enough truth to it to merit a suspension of disbelief. There are an ample supply of red herrings to distract the reader, each of which is plausible. The pacing is a little choppy and the dual points of view (first person and third person omniscient) do not blend as well as they ought.On the other hand, the bad guys are very, very bad and the good guys are believable, and largely sympathetic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oliver's Wars","review":"I think Oliver's Wars is a pretty good book. The message I got that it is hard to get used to a new place but eventuly you'll get used to the place another message I learned don't keep back your fellings because people won't get to know you. Oliver's Wars is about a boy named Oliver. Him his twin brother move to Halifax to live with his grandparents because his father had to go to the Persian Gulf to be a nurse in the Gulf War. Oliver doesn't start on the right foot and got off to a bad start how will Oliver survive?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Oliver's Wars","review":"Oliver's Wars is an excelle book. It take place during the Galf War. Oliver has his own war inside. All his famely thinks that nothing bother him because he naver makes a fuss. His twin brother, Jerry, is very different. He is outgoing, loud, a good athelete, very popular. Oliver is clumsy, the new kids make fun of him, especially Gus, the class bully. Gus's father is also away at the Gulf War like, Oliver's. Oliver finds out that Gus is really not as mean as he seems. He is only tring to cover his real feeling about his father being away and hurt. As soon as Oliver realized that, they become good friends and Oliver start to feels alot better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great instrumental recording","review":"John Michael Talbot's instrumental recordings are unique- I don't know of any other instrumental artists to compare his style with. I am a pastor, and I often have this CD playing quietly in the background as I prepare sermons. These are instrumental versions of songs which John Michael Talbot has song on previous recordings. I have greatly enjoyed this recording, as well as his other instrumental recordings in the \\"Pathways\\" series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing! Tour de force! What a kaleidoscope of emotions","review":"Just finished this book. Wow! I need to take a breath. As cliche as it all sounds, a tour de force truly. A keen breath-taking observation of human frailty and strength, of the human condition in all. Screaming with emotion, these characters come ALIVE. Alistair, Rosalind, and Luke... Stevenson captures it beautifully--the beautiful and scary isolation of being a human being in this world, and those ties that bind these solitary entities to the family, that thing that is both their downfall and their salvation. Inherently an optimistic book, the plot centers around the emotional lives of these characters in a way that makes you feel as if you're watching a densely plotted movie even though all that's going on is a severe and gut wrenching process of human awakening. That rare gem of a book... Read it now! Your life will be the better for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"CIA post 9/11","review":"This DVD really gives very little information about the general workings of the CIA; instead it tells of the CIA involvement in Afghanistan in the hunt for Osama Bin Laden after 9/11 and in Pakistan searching for those involved in the 9/11 hijackings.There are basically two shows; \`Hunt for Bin Laden' and \`Pakistan Undercover\`. The first deals with the CIA insertion into Afghanistan soon after 9/11 supporting units like the Delta Force element described in the book \`The Horse Soldiers'. Emphasis is put on the CIA's use of Predator drone aircraft. Some of the actual agents describe what it was like to be on both missions.It is ironic that even though this DVD is dated 2009 and 8 years have passed since 9/11, statements are made that give the impression Bin Laden will be captured before long.The presentation seems to be fair in that it also gives coverage to the CIA's controversial interrogation techniques. Basically a fair presentation of this specific mission of the CIA."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"We enjoyed this very much! It was detailed and interesting .

The review gave it 4.5 stars. The other album review I read at the same time was Innervisions. Innervisions is a good album, but not quite as great as FFF in my opinion. Living For The City may be an epic, but I think You Haven't Done Nothin' is much more heartfelt.The most beautiful song on FFF is probably To Shy To Say (he knows how so many of us feel) and that beats any of the ballads from Innervisions. Don't get me wrong, I gave Innervisions 5 stars in my review. I just think this is better. I will add though that it is not as perfect as Talking Book and as epic as Songs In The Key Of Life, but it is truly a gem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stevie Wonder is a genius","review":"This album is very goopd to have in cd rotation for any occasion you will not be able to stop listineing to the wonderful sounds of Stevie Wonder."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stevie Wonder CD's/ Fullfillness Finale","review":"I really like most all of the music on this CD.

Not to be named as a preverbial \\"Innervisions part 2\\" but an album that stands on it's own. The songwriting is at its peak and the focus and clairity are beyond comparison. He starts it off with \\"Smile Please\\" which makes a marvelous chorus out of the words \\"Bum di di bum bum\\", his most spiritual song that is a direct reflection on his then-recent accident \\"Heaven is 10 Zillion Light Years Away\\" which is so unbelieveable it's hard to put into words. Other tracks include the wonderfully progressive \\"Bird Of Beauty\\", the painful longing of \\"They won't go when I Go\\", the wonderful funky \\"You Haven't Done Nothing\\", the slow production classic \\"Creepin\\" and \\"Boogie on reggae woman\\". I just wish he released the rest of this album because it was supposed to be a double. \\"FFF part 2\\" has a terrific song on it called \\"The Future\\"..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not his best, but good nonetheless","review":"I love to listen to this CD while I do my homework. It is so relaxing and soothing. It's a shame other teenagers don't know how great Stevie Wonder is!"},{"rating":"2","title":"JUST ANOTHER MASTERPIECE","review":"Let me try to be objective here;this was STEVIE's third masterpiece in a row;a great collection of soul,funk and ballads concocted by a master chef.Just remember,1974 was the year disco music really became popular,and this guy was reinventing the dictionnary of soul music.If an artist has deserved every GRAMMY award he ever earned,it is STEVIE WONDER.Few artists have dominated a decade like he did in the seventies;his influence is still being felt today.Everything in that album is of interest,from the funk groove of BOOGIE ON REGGAE WOMAN and the political YOU HAVEN'T DONE NOTHING aimed at NIXON's administration,to wonderful ballads like HEAVEN IS 10 ZILLION LIGHT YEARS AWAY and THEY WON'T GO WHEN I GO.Bying only a greatest hits package is an outrage to this artist.Buy TALKING BOOK,INNERVISIONS,SONGS IN THE KEY OF LIFE and HOTTER THAN JULY and you'll find out why STEVIE matters.AMAZON is waiting to send them to you.What are you waiting for?"},{"rating":"2","title":"NOT FULL DISCLOSURE ON ALL INGREDIENTS","review":"no where in the description is there FULL DISCLOSURE of all ingredients! simply saying that the fruit is number one does nothing.

I was anticipating some insight into the war but was instead given endless descriptions of faces and places that told me nothing of the war.

Back Bay combines a modern day thriller with historical fiction in truly remarkable fashion. The characters, the story line -- everything is top of the line. You could picture the Boston area (and I live in the heartland) so perfectly. Just an outstanding book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing story, weak ending and sloppy plot","review":"Other reviewers have mentioned the weak ending - and I agree. Before the ending, there is also very sloppy plotting - two 'bad-guys' who have been killed at an apartment in Cambridge turn up a few chapters later digging a hole in a basement! While the weaving of the plot through Boston's history is clever, and is the best part of the story, the motivations of the main characters in the present day are not clear, and there are jumps in the story that don't make sense. It is OK as a Beach Read, so long as you can suspend disbelief and ignore the errors and inconsistencies in the story structure.The same writer's 'Harvard Yard' is a much better book, but also has a weak and disappointing ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid playing, strong song-craft. Holds up amaizngly well.","review":"These songs were all recorded between late '68 and May '70. I would call it country-rock. The recordings are clean, and not over-produced; you can really hear the quality of the playing on all the tracks. If you have eclectic tastes (and if you are looking here because you are a fan of Albert Lee, you likely do), you will probably enjoy this. I just listened to it again after re-discovering it while straightening out my CD collection, and have ripped it to my drive at work so I will be listening more often.The songs are definitely \\"listenable\\" (some would call it pop) without being overly-commercial. There are tasteful solos tucked into well written songs - real songs, with verses, refrains, bridges, modulations and memorable melodies. The vocals are more than adequate, though not stellar.As I am writing this, I'm listening, tapping my toe, and just generally grooving to it. Good stuff. Good tunes expertly executed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Black Claw & Country Fever-Albert Lee","review":"I have always admired Albert Lee's playing, so I decided to try this collection of early recordings. Not quite what I expected. The playing is there, but the songs leave me wanting something else.

Maybe I just need to give it more time but SINNER grabbed me almost from the second I heard it. To be honest this seems somehow sterile. It's like hearing Johnny Van Zant singing songs Ronnie Van Zant's was suppose to sing. It just makes me miss Dave more. Maybe they should have found a singer that had his or her own style and the ghost effect wouldn't be there (but it is). Regardless, this is a good CD by one of the better new bands I wish the new DP lineup the best of luck. Rock on boys!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than i thought it would be","review":"when i first saw this album in the shops i was unsure wether to get it because i thought that with the change of singers that their style of music and the sound of it would have changed pretty drasticly. when i got home and put it on i loved it. every time i listned to each song again i like it even more. the stle has changed slightly but i wouldn't say it was better or worse its just as good. i loved the album sinner and i have to say i like this one even more. each song has a catchy tune and great lyrics and i find you can relate to each song in different ways. i particually like the song 'this life' it has a slow and melodic tune that then turns into a more heavy chorus with great rhythm and has a short guitar solo to add to it.if you like drowning pool you must get this album to taste their slightly new style and im sure you will all like it.now go buy this album and spin the disc. go dont read this go and buy it now!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pantera rip off ?","review":"Nu-metal that wants to rip-off pantera ?

Killin' me, forget, and think just rocks hard. Jason has a very powerful voice like Dave and it suits hard core nu metal rock. I know Jason Jones is no Dave Williams but he still rocks. Just ignore other people's pathetic BS: \\"Oh this album is truely suck-o-matic\\" or \\"Jason has ruined every thing good about Drowning Pool\\" and run out and buy this album now!FORGET! FORGET!

This is a giant slide downward for the band..."},{"rating":"1","title":"I miss dave","review":"I miss the Dave. He had such a great voice and this sounds like your average nu-metal crud. his voice set them apart. Maybe what i liked was the emotion that was in his voice. you really could feel it. He could go from a growl to a whisper in the same song. All this guy does is yell, which is what people do when they can't sing.

R.I.P Dave. you are missed"},{"rating":"1","title":"R.I.P Drowning Pool","review":"This band is now dead in terms of their music.

Drowning Pool has lost their heavy touch and has achieved a redneck sound"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dave died, and so did Drowning Pool","review":"Dave Williams was to Drowning Pool what Kurt Cobain was to Nirvana. That being said, how could anyone compare this work to Drowning Pool's earlier work? The new lead singer is brash and forcefull, bringing no such melody to his voice that Dave did (for a metal singer, he had a good voice) and the guitarist's style is completely different, although maybe talented. This is metal trash, and a disapointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a comedy album","review":"Ok, the video for Step Up is a joke right? Please tell me that it is because I am really embarrased for them. How they get to be on Headbanger's Ball is beyond me. This is not metal and never will be (and neither was Sinner). I hated Dave's DP and now I really despise whoever the new guy is. Oh, and I read one reviewer say that you should buy the Sinner CD because it went platinum. Guess what kid, Justin Timberlake and Beyonce are also platinum, and just because they are, doesn't make them good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who is this joker!","review":"This new singer is an absolute tool!

Dave Williams can never be replaced. He was and is still the man who Drowning Pool was all about. He was a kind man and way better singer than the new one.

No sappy, drawn out, formula endings. Just pure humanity. Mr. Greenberg writes what he feels. Sometimes funny, sometimes insightful. Always earnest.

Clay's voice and the music are very good, with his Oklahoma roots showing through. Clay puts forth a great rendition of Robert Earl Keen's \\"Dreadful Selfish Crime\\", and \\"The House Song\\" with Guy Clark is priceless. This CD is a great start and one which folks who appreciate efforts like Robert Earl, Reckless Kelly, and others, should own. I saw him in Oklahoma City solo and he was very, very good. He played some material from an upcoming CD, one that I will be purchasing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good and easy","review":"Clay's music has spirit and a reality about it.

My favorite was the large model with large tires. This one's leaver cord broke the 5th time I used it. I would like to order another large one but I think the company should give me some kind of credit. I'm sure every product has a lemon or two.s"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Spreader!","review":"This spreader is far superior to anything else on the market at any price point. The oversize tires really help going over rough terrain and the spread rate adjustment is straight forward. Because the tires grip so well you can get a longer throw during broadcast as the spreader sling plate spins much faster than those on cheap poly wheeled spreaders. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Does the job... not many do any jobs...","review":"Glides over the lawn without ripping it up (would be pointless for a spreader to destroy the lawn, but the plastic wheel ones have both on Scotts and no-name brand ones).Most spreaders choke on big bags of powder lime. This one was even and fast. I have not found anything within 100 dollars of this product that could compete with it. I put forth 1/20th the energy moving around the spreader. The pneumatic rubber wheels are the key along with a simple and sturdy design. The adjustment opens and closes with precision, it is made well.The picture makes it look cheesier than it is. It has a strong build to it and the handle can be loosened to fit in a tight shed. I was impressed by it in general :) The only possible issue is the cotters pin/wire that is in the bucket to mix the powder. I do not know how much of a load it can take. However, all spreaders have one as far as I have seen. Maybe on 400 dollar ones they use other things?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Scott's","review":"Bought this from Amazon after reading the generally positive reviews. I had borrowed a Scott's to use before getting this one and it was definitely harder to push and didn't broadcast as wide a swath. The Earthway works well spreading milorganite. Only thing to watch is that you have to shut the lever off if you stop for any reason--or the fertilizer will keep pouring through the holes onto the ground below! Other than that it is easy to use on rough ground (the big wheels make a difference, as stated by others) and it carries a full hopper of 35 lbs easily."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Happy","review":"4/6/2012 I received the spreader with the control handle knob poking out of the box and missing a part. I called up Earthway and they no questions asked are sending me a whole new control knob. I have to replace it but their cust. service person was very nice. When assembled i felt that it was cheaply made esp. for the $100 that was spent on it. The handle is way too short and makes maneuvering and using the spreader much more difficult. Lastly. don't use any type of powdery type product such as Lime because the agitator is much too small to feed the broadcaster. Pelleted lime and grass was good but again that handle needs to be longer, anyone over 5'7\\" is going to find this spreader cumbersome to use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Earthway Spreader 2050P","review":"Ive used this once heres my take:It comes very well packaged and delivery was quick. It required little to no assembly. The big tires are very helpful when spreading on tall grass. My main complaint is that the title is misleading. It reads 80 lb spreader. I put a 40 LB bag of fertilizer in the bucket and it completely filled so I dont know how they would expect you to fit 80lbs? Other then the capacity glitch it was a good purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Earth way broadcast spreader","review":"I will preface my review by stating that I am new to gardening and this was my first broadcast spreader purchase.Pros: the all terrain tires makes this easy to roll about.Cons: I agree with a previous review that stated that the directions on how much product to use are very vague and I spent a lot of time doing all these calculations to figure out at what setting to put it on.You can't put more than 20 pounds of product in a time or else it won't spread. You have to turn the open and shut valve a couple of times and shake the whole thing and hope that it begins to spread. A once it spreads it works fine, but it seems to get jammed pretty often. I am very disappointed, especially given its price tag. I would not recommend this purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Satisfied customer","review":"This is a top performing spreader.We are involved in a fairly large commercial gardening and lawnmowing operation and this machine suits our needs very well.Very prompt delivery in a fully assembled state.5 star +"},{"rating":"2","title":"Earthway Spreader","review":"I had a Scott's broadcast spreader that wouldn't do the job.

Once in a while there is a short column that made me wonder why did they include this in the book; it was if the publisher just \\"through\\" it in there just because; this is the reason for the 4 stars.

Sorry Hank, couldn't resist.

Anyway, as a heartfelt sign of the times or nostalgia for people who saw/ know them, maybe this album is great, but for a lot of us who did indeed never hear of them (no surprise there) their music doesn't really stand up to the test of time. Dated? You bet! Musicianship? Basic at best. Coming from someone who likes listening to anyone who puts it on the line- no matter how wavering, I gotta say, if this is their best example, these guys were amateur warblers who came to NYC to just hang out and take in the sites and music scenes."},{"rating":"2","title":"FIVE FOR MINGUS","review":"The only criticism that I see on this fine collection, is that Mingus had previously recorded the majority of these tunes. Some say that the original versions of these songs included on various Columbia and Atlantic recordings are superior. If that's the case, then these versions come in second in a photo finish (Mingus re-recorded some of these because he was unhappy with previous edits). The ensembles that Mingus leads here play fast and loose on the uptempo and show great sensitivity on the ballads. Anyone interested in checking out the great Charles Mingus would be well advised to start here. Those already familiar with his work, also will not be disappointed, even if they already own other versions of these songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mingus to the Fifth Power","review":"This is the place to learn all you need to know, if all you need to know is whether or not to become a Mingus fan. This is the album that hooked me, and I still consider it his best. The compisitions are old, but these revamped versions are definatley the ones to own. With renewed vitality, Mingus turns his standards into a new revelation!Once you're hooked you'll find a wealth of great albums waiting for you, but this is the place to start, it almost seems made to order for an introduction to his genius.And for anyone interested \\"2BS\\", a reworked version of \\"Hatian Fight Song\\" IS the version heard on those commercials and Oliver Stone's film \\"U-turn\\".This is NOT easy listening music, if you're a fan of Kenny G you will probably hate this album, and I'm sure Charles Mingus wouldn't have it any other way.I couldn't hold this album in higher esteem, get it, treasure it, make it a sandwitch before it whips you with a car antenna!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Always changing!!!","review":"I bought this CD a couple of months ago, and I've listened to it dozens of times since!!! And never get tired of it. Mingus music, and this album specially, has the quality of grow and grow after repeated listenings. The music is always changing, offering diferent aspects, different moods, and even after exhaustive listening one founds himself discovering new things.It is very difficult to say which is the \\"best\\" album of Charles Mingus, since all his discography is extraordinarily consistent, but this one ranks among the best, for sure!.If you are a newcomer to the Mingus' Universe, this album is a good starting point, because is a work of great quality, but maybe more acccesible than other records of his extense discography. It also offers a good and complete overview of the complex landscape of Mingus as a bandleader, a bass player, and a composer.And if you are not a newcomer, buy this album NOW!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What jazz is","review":"I love this music! This CD has everything---mood, attitude, fire, swing. This is one of Mingus' few large works, and what a gas it is! The way the soloists are completely integrated with the ensemble is pure genius. Elevator music this is not. Mingus demanded artistry from his collaberators and so this music is demanding of the listener, as it should be. Like his other great album \\"Black Saint and the Sinner Lady\\" I never get tired of hearing this one. I always hear something new each playing. Emotional, engaging, soulful. I love this music!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Great Great Great Great","review":"It's true that this album has got new versions of older tunes, but these new versions are even better than the originals, mainly because the larger ensemble makes the music much more intense. These versions of 'Better Get Hit In Yo' Soul', 'Haitian Fight Song'(IIBS) and 'Goodbye Pork Pie Hat' ('Theme for Lester Young') are the definitive versions. The bass solo on 'Mood Indigo' is beautiful too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mingus at his best","review":"While most of these tunes appear on other Mingus albums, this disc has the best versions; they really move, and the whole band sounds energized. I would recommend this disc to anyone interested in Mingus or looking for an introduction to his work."},{"rating":"1","title":"I cannot rate this CD because there are clips.","review":"I want to listen to the music before I buy it. You guys don't have any audio clips."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't Put it Down!","review":"This was my first read in the Capitol Crimes Series, and it won't be my last. While being an easy read, it wasn't too easy that I became bored and lost interest. The main character was someone I could relate to, and have sympathy for .

THIS IS A GREAT CD AND A GREAT SOOTHING CD ESPECIALLY DURING THESE TIMES.... THANK YOU DIANA AND PLEASE COME OUT WITH MORE"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Wonderful Christmas Gift For the Lover of Jazz!","review":"Any album by Ms. Krall is eagerly anticipated. \\"The Look of Love\\" is no exception. The bossa nova flavor harkens back to the 1950s and 1960s bringing to mind those wonderful guitar albums by the late Charlie Byrd. As usual, Diana blends her keyboard artistry with a sultry voice reminencent of 'torch singers' from the past. While a good album, I would have found it more appealing if it had featured more of her keyboard styling. No matter... it is a worthwhile addition to any collection. Cuts that were particulary appealing included the Adair & Dennis tune \\"A Night We Called it a Day\\" and Hoagy's \\"I Get Along without you Very Well\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Diappointing","review":"This review comes from a big DK fan from Canada who loves her style and piano. This is easily her worst CD; no edge to her voice, which is muted for some reason, piano almost nonexistent, strings take long monotonous solos, questionable song selections for a a jazz singer. Even Cry Me A River doesn't make it whereas live in concert she does a a bang up job. Buy \\"All For You\\" or \\" When I Look in Your Eyes\\" to hear the real Diana. I hope that she doesn't make this kind of mistake again"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn","review":"Diana Krall has almost no feeling on this CD. I like her piano playing, possibly she should do more of that. It seems almost like she is being put together by the record company, much like a pop artist. She might be better off fighting for some artistic integrity in the long run."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did nothing for me","review":"I bought this CD based on an article by Stephen Holden in the 12/6/01 New York Times. The article was about the current state of cabaret singing. Holden said the album was \\"perhaps the most satisfying collection of orchestrated popular standards to be released since the heyday of Frank Sinatra and Ella Fitzgerald.\\" I hope not, given how bad the album is. Before buying this album, buy some of the Sinatra albums with Riddle from the early 1950s and some of Fitzgerald's Songbook albums, if you haven't already.This is my first album by Krall. Her style/approach, at least on this album, did nothing for me. It was interesting to see that quite a few of the online reviewers hated this album, but liked her earlier albums. Yet, I found one online reviewer that thought this album was her best and that her other albums were bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"For anyone else, a triumph, but not quite Krall's best.","review":"The Look of Love differs from Krall's prior recording in that every song is backed by large string arrangements. Like many of the other reviewers, I miss the more intimate and concentrated impact of her trio. Still, she has one of the finest voices today, and her phrasing only gets better. I would probably buy a CD of her singing the phone book. However, she is an excellent jazz pianist as well as a singer, and the latter is lost in the string arrangements. Of course, many jazz musicians have recorded with strings, including Charlier Parker. My hope is that this is only a temporary diversion.As for the merits of the album, the string arrangements are quite well done and the songs well selected. Particular highlights are the title track, and Cry Me A River. I would certainly recommend purchase of this CD; if you want a jazzier recording, you should get her tribute album to Nat King Cole."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's So Dull","review":"The blame for this poor cd must rest with Tommy Lipuma and Klaus Ogermann. They ovewhelm Ms Krall completly with syrupy one paced arrangements of beautiful songs, on her previous album at least there were sparky trio and quartet tunes to stop it being too sweet. Get a new producer and go back to the small group format, it's what you do best."},{"rating":"2","title":"What can I say!","review":"I purchased this CD for my pleasure and am absolutely blown away. I love the artist jazzy voice. This CD is worth buying for all you jazz lovers!"},{"rating":"2","title":"love her ballads","review":"i love it when Diana sings ballads - love songs. she sings it just right. puts me in a relaxed mood."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love Scenes - I miss you...","review":"Because I loved previous releases of DK, I pre-ordered two of these CD to use one as a gift for somebody very special to me. However, this disk is a sad disappointment. Shortly speaking, it is over-produced, arrangements are annoying, sound quality is poor. 'Besame Mucho' is a disaster...She sings slow ballads, which I like best in her interpretation, but the feeling of intimacy is missing. After two years of silence this CD sounds like a joke from such a talented artist.It is no use to make further critical comments concerning this record - read others from those who describe themselves as her big fans and yet give it one or two stars only. Unfortunately, they are perfectly right.Sorry K., I didn't know..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Saccharin singing with no depth","review":"As an owner of a few Diana Krall's CD, I have to say this CD is truly a waste of her talent. In this, she made it too obvious that she fell into the trap of commercialism and easy money. Where is jazz, passion, emotion, and depth??? No life in this album. This is one of those tacky labels with a famous name attached. Good for a cocktail/lounge music, at most."},{"rating":"1","title":"Her piano must be broken","review":"I really, really wanted to love this album, because Diana Krall is just so talented. But alas, I must agree with the folks who feel that she has abandoned her strengths. I agree very much with the fella below who discusses the \\"George-Bensonization\\" of Diana Krall. Diana Krall is a \\"musicians musician\\", or at least she was...but not on this album. If you loved her other albums because of their intimate vocals and fabulous piano playing, you will be disappointed with this effort. You should probably still buy it, but don't expect her old magic. This is an album of sophisticated background music, albeit excellent background music. I have all her CDs and this is her poorest effort. If you like jazz at all, buy any of her other recordings first. On the other hand, if you LOVE Celine Dion or Streisand, buy this one first and work your way backwards. By the way if you like Diana Krall, check out Julie London, you'll like her too."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't buy this one! Buy all her others!!","review":"I really love her other CD's, but was very, very disappointed when I first listened to this one.It reminds me of Mantovani in the sixties and seventies.You might use it as elevator-music though,"},{"rating":"1","title":"Keep the booklet and throw the CD","review":"Yep, the booklet is sooooo sexxxxxxxy.Well, so ? Musically, one of the worst jazz(y) CD of the year. Apart Lisa EKDAHL, hard to find a less swinging singer (?).Hard to decide who is the worst : Mrs KRALL or the sound engineer ? Take \\"The Look Of Love\\" track. Can anyone tell me if Mrs KRALL is playing acoustic or electric piano or ... accordion ? Can anyone explain me why this instrument crosses my room from the left to the right speaker ? Can anyone explain me how not to be distubered by the edit and drop out ?A pity Amazon don't allow people to rate a CD 0 star.Better keep away from this total failure."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a let down!","review":"Diana Krall is a multi-talented performer. Wheather it's her beautifully seductive voice or her lively, syncopated play on the piano, this woman has it all. This latest disk unfortunately, does not. Diana has shifted her priorities over the years from emphasising her piano to developing her vocals. This may be great for those listeners atrracted primarily to her singing. If you're like myself however, and was hoping to hear her \\"WOW\\" you on the piano, you are going to be sorely dissapointed. Diana Krall the piano player failed to show up for these recordings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Moving away from her roots-this CD is a HUGE disappointment!","review":"I'm sure I am in the minority in my opinions of this CD, but-this new album represents a giant step for Ms. Krall away from her jazz roots and, sadly, toward \\"popular\\" even \\"elevator\\" music. Even though Dianna has had great commercial success with her newer CDs, I still feel Dianna's best recorded work was done on her CD \\"All for You\\" a tribute to the Nat King Cole Trio recorded a few years ago. I own all her CDs and have seen her perform live thus I do have some perspective on her body of work. This new album is far too bland, quiet and boring. As some other reviewers have noted-after a while, probably due to the slow tempo and heavy orchestration, the songs start sounding the alike! (...)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Smooth & easy listening","review":"I really enjoy this CD it contains several of my favorite classic songs. It's just smooth and easy, I listen to it while I'm getting ready for work it eases me into my day. It's good stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"From a Grammy Winner to This?","review":"I am a fan of Diana Krall and have several of her CD's. and I too am disappointed in this album. I must have counted a 100 disappointed reviews in here-- really depressing. Then I discovered Dena DeRose! If you haven't listened to Dena, you will be in for great listening Jazz experiencence. Dena really is a unique talent with a clear, exciting voice, an accomplished jazzz pianist, she arranges, and composes for her albums, accompanies herself and her solos are of a jazz intellect that are melodic and exciting and smooth.I listen to her albums constantly, and never tire of them, because with each listening, I feel something new. Although Dena is relatively unknown as DK, I think she will be a contender of Diana's. I certainly was not disappointed with Dena DeRose. Win me back Diana, with your next album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but not her best","review":"I have two of her other albums and have to admit this is the lesser of the three. Having said that, I've listened to the CD 8 times in a row today and I'm not even close to getting tired of it. I do wish there were a couple of up tempo, fun songs on it but it is still a very good CD. If you like mellow, clean music you won't be disappointed by this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"We've all waited a long time - and for what ?Music quality is not good - orchestra with vocal is very difficult to have them both on the same cd track.Maybe next time Diana....."},{"rating":"2","title":"S'Wonderful - S'Marvelous","review":"From the opening strains of the LA session orchestra, this album is S'Wonderful. Diana continues to improve with each and every recording; and, with her music already 5-star, that is quite unbelievable. The recording itself is very crisp and clear (listen for the triangle on \\"I Remember You\\"). The addition of orchestral accompaniment only adds to her sultry, smoooooth voice and piano playing. She has added Latin flavor with \\"Besame Mucho\\" and I can't imagine who could say 'no' to such a simply elegant song. The album closes with \\"Maybe You'll Be There\\" and my answer is there is no 'maybe' about it. Yes, yes, yes. This album is not only S'Wonderful, S'Marvelous!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not herself on this one","review":"This is not the Diana Krall I know and love. The orchestra on every track is simply not her style and the singing is very uninspired. One or two phrasings in \\"Cry Me a River\\" caught my attention; otherwise, there is nothing of the playfulness, moodiness or sultry singing she exhibits on virtually every other track she's ever cut. And then, of course, there's no piano to even compare with her other CD's. I was so disappointed I tried to give this CD to a friend but he gave it back to me after listening to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What are they thinking?","review":"I am a big fan of Diana Krall but found this album to be a big disappointment. The arrangements are very plain and the whole album lacks energy. If you want to hear how a ballad can be delivered with intensity and direction, try Kurt Elling's latest - \\"Flirting With Twilight\\" I'm looking forward to Diana's next effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vintage Krall...To Die For","review":"Grab your significant other, make a fire in the fireplace, pour the wine, and relax. Diana Krall has hit another home run in the name of romance. Sultry, diverse, and just plain sexy, this album will warm you up on the coldest winter night. Krall performs \\"The Look of Love\\" as masterfully as I have ever heard it. \\"S'Wonderful\\" is an absolute homage to Gershwin, and \\"Dancing In The Dark\\" is so good, it could even resurrect Astaire for one more spin around the floor. This album is terrific."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Don't Understand Her Career, Although She Has Good Taste.","review":"I don't get Diana Krall. Yes, her taste in music is excellent, and the accompaniments to her singing are usually good (as they are on this album). But she is such a lousy singer, with a voice that is almost always flat and stilted. She always sounds like she just rolled out of bed at 7:00 in the morning and dragged herself in front of a small jazz group or a big orchestra. All of these songs have been done a million times by real singers, so what's the point of listening to her?"},{"rating":"2","title":"An improvement over her last album","review":"While I do prefer her \\"Love Scenes\\" album over this one, I have to say that it is an improvement on her last album, \\"When I look in your eyes\\". This one, even though there is an orchestra, it tends to compliment rather than take away from the songs. Plus the added bonus of having the great Christian McBride on bass, and Russell Malone on guitar. Her voice sounds a lot better than on her last cd too, richer and with more emotion. I thought her previous album was kinda flat and dull, and I almost didn't buy this album because of that. But after hearing \\"S'Wonderful\\" and the title song on the radio, I thought I'd give it a chance, and I'm glad I did. Diana is becoming a really good torch singer, and ballads are definately what she seems to do best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Krall=Medicore","review":"Her voice defines medicore. SUltriness to cover the fact that the voice is weak. Her grammy was a laugh, but then again most of them are."},{"rating":"2","title":"What beauty!","review":"The images of Diana Krall on this CD jacket far surpass any before. They are evocative. The music (mostly standards) is good, but chosen to appeal to the masses. Her earlier works (and I own them all) revealed more of her amazing vocal talent. Nonetheless, I like this CD and am encouraged to keep buying Diana Krall."},{"rating":"1","title":"HOLD THE SYRUP","review":"What a disappointment. If this is the direction Diana wants to take her career, fine, but I suspect it's the record producers who are to blame for this CD. Before I buy her next CD I'll check to see if there is an orchestra involved. If there is, I'll pass. And the art designer has a foot fetish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounds forced.","review":"Went for the commercial appeal and overreached -- waaaay too sugary. Where's the snap of the 'Errand Girl for Rhythm'gone? Skip this CD, skip 'Love Scenes' CD, and go back to 'When I Look in Your Eyes' for some good stuff. The lady's got a fabulous voice but please let's not drown her in orchestration! And this CD seems mighty skimpy on Ms K's fine piano. Sigh. I had hoped for something to stretch her talents, but this CD didn't do it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pompous","review":"The magic from the previous records are gone... replaced by a big set of strings. Diana Krall still has a great a voice, but she sounds like one of many pretty-but-boring singers, drowned in a boring, predictable sound. There's not much trace of jazz here, which was made her previous records good - it's just a predictable, slightly pompous record. Go buy \\"Love Scenes\\" or \\"Stepping Out\\" instead - they're brilliant, and showcase what Diana Krall is good for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I think this CD is just OK. Adding string orchestra made her voice more distance. Intimacy is the key of her other album. It's totally lost here. Her singing is bland. Gone are the 'conviction' and playfulness. Her selection of songs are weak. There is no new ground broken here. I won't recommend this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't judge a book (or a CD) by its cover","review":"I purchase quite a number of CDs thru ... based on the recommendation feature. It's probably my favorite ... feature, and it has introduced me to a broad assortment of great music.I've been familiar with Diana's name -- not her music -- so I took a chance when this CD kept popping up on my recommendation list. I'm honest enough to admit that I was somewhat captivated by the cover photo.Unfortunately, the cover photo is about as good as this CD gets. I really didn't grasp from the other reviews that Diana Krull is a female Frank Sinatra. Yes, she's apparently a musician as well, but that really didn't come thru to me based on this effort. As I listen to this I just keep thinking, \\"lounge singer, lounge singer, lounge singer.\\"I'll keep this CD in my car for a week or so and see if it grows on me, but I don't see a lot of promise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Elevator Music","review":"It was nice when the handlers allowed Diana Krall to be a jazz musician. Her piano playing was excellent, her vocal timbre and timing were divine. This CD is great if you like elevator music. The strings wash over and bleach out the music. For good jazz from Krall go back to her earliest efforts."},{"rating":"1","title":"okay, but not great","review":"I am a big Krall fan, but this album lacked that special touch she has had on past albums. A little bit to much orchestra, and not enough piano. An okay album, but not great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Silky and Smooth!","review":"The Look of Love is one romantic journey! I loved her smooth jazzy sounds on all of the tracks. I really have to differ with the reviewer who said that her rendition of the Spanish song, Besame Mucho was not up to par. I completely disagree as I found that song incredibly sensuous. All ten tracks were so silky and smoooooth!! Krall has the ability to transform any song to a lavish delight. I not only found Besame Mucho one of my favorite tracks, but also her rendition of the Bachrach song, The Look of Love.Put this CD on for a night of romance with your significant other and get lost in each other!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed Love","review":"The first two albums by Diana Krall were off the charts. However, her latest album is a great disappointment. The arrangements are all strings, and little of Diana's wonderful piano skills. Also, she apparently has determined that 'talking or whispering the lyrics' is better than singing them. Not only does she not only not use her vocal skills, she has apparently decided not to play the piano as well. Someone should also tell Mr. DiPuma, her manager, who apparently selects her songs, to dump the strings, go back to the wonderful jazz sounds of her trio, and let her use the voice that made her an icon. I hope Ms. Krall doesn't follow the footsteps of Nat King Cole (her idol) who gave way to the money tree and abandoned his jazz roots to became a 'TV singer' . Finally, Diana's voice is sexy enough, she doesn't need to overdue it as she does in this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major disappointment from Krall","review":"I bought this CD sight unseen (or unheard) because I loved her previous two disks (would have given them 5 stars). What a disappointment! I could probably live with the cloying strings in the background if Krall's performance was up to her previous ones, but she seems completely detached from the songs she's singing. There's no emotional connection, no snap, it's like she's sleepwalking though the performance. These are songs that tell a story, but Krall is singing words like they have no meaning. Let's face it, Krall doesn't have a great voice, she depends on her wit, and phrasing to connect with the song. They're absent here, and what's left isn't enough to justify buying this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"awful!what awaste of talent.","review":"I have been a fan for some years but I had to find someone to give this wretched CD to{who wouldt be offended{.The production swamps the players in a sea of sugar.It could be Mantavoni for slow learners.I will still go to see her live...as long as she leaves the string section at home."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decepcionante.","review":"Este disco está muy por debajo de los anteriores. Aunque estéticamente se acerca a \\"When I look in yor eyes\\", los arreglos orquestales de Claus Ogerman son muy inferiores a los que Johny Mandel hizo para el disco anterior, y además apagan el maravilloso piano de la Krall. La versión de \\"Bésame mucho\\" en espanol es un desastre... El acento inglés y la falta de entonación lo hacen muy inferior, por ejemplo, al que no hace mucho realizó Diane Reeves. Sugerencia para el próximo trabajo: olvidar los arreglos de cuerda, y volver al trío o el cuarteto."},{"rating":"1","title":"She has great legs....","review":"OK, I admit it. I bought the album for its cover. For insomniacs this is great therapy. Diana almost seems bored on these tracks, and the highlights come from the accompanying orchestration. Because of other reviews, I am going to buy some of her earlier works & give it a listen. If she was not a looker, would you buy this cd?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Queen of the Blahs","review":"Surely there must be others who feel, as I do, that Krall is an over-hyped, mediocre vocalist lacking in passion and depth, with an almost complete inability to communicate the emotional essence of a lyric. So who's buying all these CDs? Probably people who also think Norah Jones and Peter Cincotti are just swell and wouldn't know a real singer if one bit them on their posteriors, I suppose. Hey Krall fans, ever hear of Lee Wiley? Peggy Lee? Oh, I forgot, they're not only not young and blonde anymore, they're DEAD, so they're not \\"relevant\\" to your late-twenty-something musical \\"tastes.\\" Krall is for people who voted for Bush because \\"he seemed sincere\\" and go to see the latest \\"blockbuster\\" CGI-laden movie because the Fox TV critic called it \\"a white-knuckle thrill ride.\\" The triumph of media hype over taste and discrimination is now complete."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'mTrying Not To Sound Mean","review":"But its a bit difficult. I don't want to offend anyone so here I go. This CD is probably one of the worst out of my collection. It was a quite dissapointment after hearing the \\"Diana Krall Craze\\" with everyone raving about her gorgeous voice and wonderful CD. I'm not saying that she doesn't have talent, she might have but she obviously doesn't show it in her CD. I'm sorry if you think so but this is MY review not yours. So as I continue. I like mellow music but not of this kind. The songs are a bit too boring to my taste, I've heard great things about Norah Jones so that will probably be the next CD I purchase.Overall: Buy at your own risk."},{"rating":"1","title":"pluck the strings ,trash the photos","review":"The latest offering from a very telented singer/pianist.voice very good but this production has two major problems(1)a very slow dreary orchestra which makes musak sound positively swinging(2)tacky,revolting sexist accompanying photos.Don't buy it.Instead get her earlier work,or anything by Stacey Kent or Carmen McRae."},{"rating":"2","title":"I truly enjoy this one","review":"All the negative comments on here are bit much. They come off sounding like self-involved pretentious jazz snobs. I enjoyed all the songs and arrangements and vocals! I recommend it to anyone. I can sit back and really enjoy this CD many times over.And apparently so can about half a million other listeners as well, since this CD has already gone gold in less then 3 months.These other negative reviewers probably loved Miles Davis' post 1972 work!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Look Of Love","review":"I absolutely love the songs on this cd.I think Diane Krall has the sexiest voiceI've ever heard. I also think the music isa perfect match for the voice. She is my veryfavorite female vocalist."},{"rating":"1","title":"skeptical cynic Jazz lover","review":"So far Krall seems, at best, an imitation of Jazz vocalists from the 1960's. This album is average if you are new to the genre, but as a somewhat experienced listener or as a novice who desires a little history and authenticity, you might want to look up artists from 1920 and on. Krall has a somewhat unique style; however, I thought this album was too plain, too passionless, and too \\"anglo-saxon\\". For all who read this criticism, you should listen to Astrud Gilberto (and even Fiona Apple) before considering Diana Krall."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding for the newly discovered \\"grown up\\"","review":"As a guy who is just entering the adult phase of his life, (for those of you who don't know it's when you drink coffee regular instead of a \\"coffee beverage\\"), this CD was absoultely great. I can't get enough of this sound. I'm no jazz purist, but I know what sounds good to me and describes a moment. This CD does just that. I can't tell you all the titles of the song because all of them just blend to me. It's great for a soft lit occasion, or when the Houston traffic gets too unruly. Not to mention that Ms. Krall certainly has \\"The look\\". This is the first CD I've bought of hers and immediately went out afterwards and bought her others. It's that good to me. Don't let all the \\"elitist\\" music experts that have panned this CD get at you. It's the same crowd who got peeved when \\"their\\" band when too mainstream for them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Y'all have it all wrong...","review":"This work definitely rates 5 and one half stars!\\"You won't regret it, come an' get it...\\"Sincerely, Lioness."},{"rating":"1","title":"pass on this CD","review":"Diana Krall has incredible talent - too bad she didn't bring it to this project. Pass on this CD, and buy one of her past efforts. Hopefully she will fire the bozos who produced this stinker, and get back to what she does well."},{"rating":"2","title":"smooth as silk","review":"The more I listen to this CD the better I like it. When I need some soothing, easy listening music I reach for this CD. If you are not aquainted with Diana Krall this is a great CD to get introduced. Order this CD now, you'll be very glad you did!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost Julie London","review":"Diana Krall has a lovely voice and nice songs, but not up to her usual standards. It reminds me of Julie London, but with less force and energy. The album is too weak in interpretation and misses musical guts."},{"rating":"1","title":"IT ISN'T HER BEST.","review":"I think in this album Diana tried to win you over with the pictures rather then the music. I felt her songs lacked emotion.She had more pictures then songs. It is no doubt that Diana is a pretty woman but that isn't why I listen to her music. I love Jazz but this album was in a low bedroom whisper (as I have heard another reviewer say)and wasn't what I think she is capable of.Sex is what sells in pop but not in jazz, we want substance and emotion.I was disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too slow for Bossa Nova","review":"These days when Bossa Nova is making quite a comeback, I don't really mind if old artists want to join in and fine tune their creative musings to the sound of sexy cool music.Unfortunately for Diana Krall, this does not look like one of her strengths. The orchestra dramatizes every song with sweeping intros and what-not whereas the heart of Bossa Nova is a Bongo and accompanied with classical guitar strings and the tempo is supposedly medium-slow as opposed to her downright slow and boring.In my old favourites like 'Besame Mucho' she sung like she did not take Spanish in one of her foreign language classes whereas in 'The Look of Love' like she has just lost love instead of found it.The thing here is slow, sweeping orchestration and a husky voice does not always equate sexy. I know she has talent but Diana needs to let it all come out and not 'try' that much."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am disappointed","review":"Unfortunately, Ms. Krall's follow-up album to the phenomenal \\"When I Look In Your Eyes\\" is as disappointment. The song selection is unstimulating at best, boring and pathetic at worst. Even her voice seems out of sync, and her normally stunning intonations are all wrong. The title cut which is a great song, seems dull and unimaginative.It seems that her fame and noteriety has caught up with her artistic capabilities and dulled her creative possibilities. Why did Tommy LiPuma let this be released? An utterly boring and disappointing album from an artist on the verge of stardum. Again, the album cover focuses too much on her looks. Diana should be ashamed. This time her music does not equal her looks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the jazz?","review":"Ms. Krall's latest album consists of stylish renditions of standard tunes, consisting of \\"mood music\\" appropriate for rainy days and background music. Unfortunately, for those who remember her earlier albums or may have heard her perform, there is very little if any of her substantial jazz piano playing ability on display. Given the abundance of elevator music and/or \\"smooth jazz\\" offerings, it is regrettable that Ms. Krall does not have the courage, conviction, or perhaps opportunity to simply record a straight ahead, hard bop trio album (or a quartet with someone of note -- Joe Lovano?). Most likely, given the success of her last two albums, she has the means to choose her own artistic projects. Her tasty, well-constructed improvisations were such a welcome addition to the new jazz talent that made its brief debut in the early and mid 90s. Now they have taken an excellent piano player who is easy on the eyes and made her a fixture of yuppie love affairs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Diana is Oveworked","review":"I am an avid Diana Krall fan. I have all of her discs (imports included) and have seen her in concert three times. As much as I think she's the greatest thing to happen to jazz vocals since Peggy Lee, I've got to let her know that this latest path in the road she's taken is not the one to stay on. She sounds tired and uninspired - which I'm sure she is knowing the demanding schedule she keeps. It's overproduced and each song is sung in the same key. I enjoy her singing on the holiday Target commercials more than this disc. Go back to your roots Diana, and don't let the demand for your fabulous music lower your standards to get it out there by any means necessary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sleepy","review":"Ms Krall has discovered the cure to insomnia. What happened to the Diana Krall of \\"All for You\\"?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A step down for a talented artist","review":"Great songs, beautifully lush arrangements, subtle rhythms...unfortunately, the singer seems to have phoned in her performance. Her delivery is, for the most part, flat and lifeless, without any of the spark she showed on previous albums. Maybe she's tired from touring too much, but there's no reason to try to sell a bad performance.If Ms. Krall has any respect for her fans, she'd have a cup of coffee and rerecord her vocal part for this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Syrupy","review":"I am a big fan of Diana Krall from her very first releases but I find the Look of Love release to be too syrupy. She is moving further away from her jazz roots. I would like to see her re-emerge with the traditional trio or quartet setting which allows her jazz style to shine. Back to basics would be my advice."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get her, either","review":"I gotta agree with the reviewer who said he/she doesn't \\"get\\" Diana Krall. I don't either. I've heard a couple of cuts on the jazz station and read enough good reviews to figure she was worth checking out. Maybe I got the wrong Diana Krall CD, because this one did nothing much for me. It's a nice collection of songs, I just wish someone else was singing them."},{"rating":"2","title":"S'Wonderful, S'Marvelous, S'Luscious","review":"So smooth, so mellow, these incredibly romantic songs will warm your heart, put you in a sentimental mood, and make you think of the one you love...Diana Krall's smoky voice and terrific interpretations, her jazz piano, and the incredible musicians that back her are all superb. There are also beautiful, lush strings arranged and conducted by Claus Ogerman and played either by the London Symphony Orchesta or a L.A. session orchestra (a.k.a. the best musicians in town).The songs ! What a great and incredibly tasteful collection of classics...a delight to hear the Julie London hit \\"Cry Me a River\\" again...always adored \\"Love Letters\\"...my favorite Burt Bacharach song, \\"The Look of Love\\"...the delectable \\"Besame Mucho\\", and on and on...every track a pleasure to hear.Each song is taken at a slightly slower tempo than is perhaps usually heard...the better to dream by ! This is truly the most relaxing CD I've ever heard.Total playing time is 50:36."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Look of Love","review":"I owned this CD for a few years then I losted. When I purchased it from Amazon it was in excellent condition.

We are indeed fortunate that she has chosen the jazz/vocal genre to perform her magic.And, magic is the watchword of \\"The Look of Love\\" album, her newest. She is an artist who caresses her work both on the keyboard and with her sultry, overly-mature voice. It's easy for this jazz mistress and her extraordinary colleagues on these cuts. Or, it certainly seems so.If you miss this album, you will miss something very special."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Journey Into Mediocrity","review":"OK, I took the plunge, bought into the hype, believed what I'd read and ordered this CD from Amazon. Hey, it doesn't hurt that she looks great on the cover either! Talk about the old addage \\"Don't judge a book by it's cover\\", don't judge this record by it's cover, or the reviews or the previous Grammy nominations. This is such middle of the road, unimaginative, watered down pap I can hardly believe it. Mediocrity really has risen to the top, a la Britney, J-Lo, etc. A pretty face and a pretty weak musical effort. If this type of music REALLY interests you I suggest looking elsewhere for your aural pleasure - Enya, Eva Cassidy, Marilyn Scott, Patricia Barber are all better places to spend your hard earned music dollar."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tha Look of Love","review":"The Look of Love is one of Diana's best. I have pondered why I am so attracted to Diana's performances, and I have realized that she presents musical content more than she presents herself, a rarity among performers. It is a selfless gift. I wondered why her first CD was rated so highly since I think it not one of her best efforts, but, then it was her first and had no comparison. Her style has refined itself so much with each CD. I'm also impressed with the photographs on each CD, so elegantly is she attired and photographed. Can the shoes on The Look of Love be Prada? I confess that I have a major crush on this woman!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Stretch","review":"I began collecting Diana Krall a few years ago because she was a shining example of a newfound jazz recording artist, blessed with a great voice and outstanding piano skills. And we'd get these showcased talents before a small trio or quartet of jazz musicians. But lately her artistry is buried playing love songs with an orchestra. If anyone is looking for watered down easy-listening stuff, go for it. But this is NOT jazz. I guess I'll have to catch her on the way down."},{"rating":"2","title":"You, your lover and Diana","review":"This is the kind of music that is perfect to listen when you are having a glass of a good wine and thinking of someone you love. The sound is very good and the musical arrangement is superb.Her voice, as usual, is angelical."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Look of Love, the sound of zzzzzzzzz...","review":"Awful CD. Ms. Krall's CD maybe the hottest selling jazz CD in the nation at the moment, but this listener found her to be downright boring. She may as well have been singing the same song over and over as they all sound alike -- very monotone. I don't mean to sound critical as I can't sing at all, but I wish more of the reviews had been so honest before I spent the money on this CD that I will never listen to. Count mine as another that will go as a used one for sale. If you are looking for a female jazz singer try Jane Monheit, much more pleasing to listen to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Asleep","review":"Will the real Diana Krall PLEASE WAKE UP. I have every CD that she has released and seen her live several times. She and her quartet have a hot tight sound. After waiting so long for a new release, this was indeed a disappointment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"An Okay Album.....","review":"Alright, I wouldn't say that this album is bad because there is still nice tracks like \\"S' Wonderful\\", \\"Cry Me A River\\" and \\"The Look of Love\\"... Ms Krall sounded nice in these tracks as she manages to bring out the right feeling....Other than that, I think this album is a disappointment... The rest of the tracks sounded quite boring. Ms Krall sounded tired and I couldn't really catch the melody....Buy this album is you are really crazy over Diana Krall...If you're not and wants to listen to this album anyway... Just borrow this disc from a friend if he/she has it...."},{"rating":"1","title":"I sure hope this isn't a trend.","review":"Being a fan, I found myself horribly disappointed at this near \\"elevator music\\". For me, Diana Krall is a great pianist who can sing; not a great singer who can play piano. Why these sappy arrangements? Does popularity mean selling out to the mainstream? Please get back to where you belong!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks great, sounds dreadful","review":"Diana Krall's best looking cover art to date wraps an excruciatingly dull CD. A huge disappointment after the brilliant performance delivered on \\"When I Look In Your Eyes\\".Maybe she needs to re-record all the songs here, with a jazz producer, not some reject who thinks the sound of Mantovani and Barry Manilow from their declining \\"Las Vegas\\" years is the 'future' of music.Diana needs to keep the great cover art... a little skin always sells, and Diana Krall sure has great looking skin. So the photographer can stay. But if the product is jazz, not pinups, then a big change in direction is needed, and the producer needs to be fired."},{"rating":"1","title":"too orchestra heavy","review":"I've been a Diana Krall fan since Only trust your heart. I think this album is allright, but is very far from where Diana really shines: when she is playing and singing upbeat jazz with a small (drumless) trio. The addition of the orchestra somehow muddys things up. Bring back the days of Love Scenes!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I've changed my mind","review":"This is an amendment to my earlier review which I wrote after an inital listen last fall. My first impression was that this was a nice departure for her, but since then I've probably listened to this CD at most four times. I think it boils down to one thing. BORING! I still and always listen to all her previous CDs, but this one has become lost in the pile, it's pure and utter muzak. A better title would be \\"The Monotone of Love\\". I know this isn't a very useful review for people interested in purchasing this disc, but I just had to post a new review to reflect my awakening. Boy, do I feel better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"oh dear","review":"Simply put this is a big no no for me - I just couldn't listen to it for more than 5 minutes before pressing eject on my cd player. Thank god for Carmen Lundy's new album 'This is Carmen Lundy' as it's a great antidote to LOL."},{"rating":"2","title":"great singer, not!","review":"Don't get me wrong. I really do like Diana Krall. I have most of her CD's. To say, however, that she is a great singer is really stretching it. The arrangements in this CD are some of the best she has done and they cover up some of her shortcomings (like the annoying habit she has of slurring up to nearly every note she sings). On the other hand, her piano playing is great. It would please me if she played more and sang less. I like especially what she chooses not to play as much as what she does. Her choices are intelligent and well thought out without trying to overwhelm you with her virtuousity."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is all the fuss about this 'talent'? NO star rating","review":"If Diana Krall wasn't a tall, semi-attractive blonde, I doubt there would be any interest in her. She is like many contemporary 'jazz' performers whose voices and instruments are emotionless and flat. Please do us a favor and stop brutalizing the old standards and trying to moderize them - they are perfect they way they are. No one can match the REAL jazz performers like Ella, Louis Armstrong and Sarah Vaughn. Stop wasting your money on the likes of Diana Krall, and while I'm at it - Kenny G.Ick. There's no accounting for taste..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Krall in a crawl.................this ain't jazz?!","review":"For all of you (myself included) who really enjoyed Diana Krall's recordings to date, this is a major disappointment. After the marvelous \\"When I Look In Your Eyes,\\" I looked forward to this release with great anticipation. However, the terrific ensemble band has been replaced by an orchestra. The playful and improvising singer that Krall was has become a mellow Astrud Gilberto clone. The music accompaniment sounds alike with every song in the CD, with its swelling strings, metronome-like percussions and right on the beat guitar chords. Even Krall's piano riffs sound polite and tame, as if they are afraid to disturb the steady click-clack rhythm of the drums. The whole CD sounds like Krall was lulled to a nap by the sleepwalking orchestration. This is Krall becoming mainstream, except it is plain boring elevator music. Diana, haven't you learned from John Denver?!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Look of Love - The Sound of Depression","review":"After seeing Diana Krall on a tv show and marvelling at her pianistic and improvisational abilities, I ordered this Album. Boy, what a mistake! Her undoubted talents are hardly evident in this collection of \\"love\\" songs which are almost all given wrist-slitting arrangements. If you enjoy ending up twice as depressed at the end of an album as you were beforehand, then this is for you. Otherwise, find something happier to listen to, like a funeral march."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kralling Under My Skin","review":"This album has a mood throughout that is effuses sensuality. It combines torch songs in both South of the Border Latin and North American ballads. It is well designed and musical. Diana Krall fans might want more piano but this showcases her outstanding vocal abilities, her crooning in that low register that brings emotive resonance in style. It sets a mood from the 40-50s of lush arrangements with later latin sensibilities. She also incorporates the wonderful interludes between tunes very reminisicent of Gordon Jenkins work for Frank Sinatra in September of My Years or with Nilsson's Touch of Smilsson in the Night. While it sidesteps her swing piano tributes to Nat King Cole and others, it is truly a session full of provocative themes, keeping a groove consistently mellow and meloncholly.... like a warm summer breeze."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Takes A Lot to Please Some People","review":"Diana Krall had the good artistic sense to hire Claus Ogerman to arrange the songs on this \\"album\\" (what a beautifully antiquated term). These songs capitalize on the sultry side of her singing. She makes Jane Monheit sound like a girlscout (which she probably is). These songs carry you away into another realm, an aural landscape to enter and stroll around in. Totally fetching, completely irresistible. The purists who quibble with this or that minor (to my mind) detail are probably the same ones who never \\"got\\" Antonio Carlos Jobim. They are lost souls. Leave them to their Purgatory. Leave me to my Paradise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Relax...","review":"I went to the record store to buy new electronic music, and happened to listen to this CD at one of the listening booths. I was captivated by Diana's voice and forgot about whatever CD I planned to buy.Favorite: 'Besame Mucho'.This is the perfect CD to listen to while cooking dinner, or when sitting by the window watching the rain fall."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great album","review":"This album is great, but it's not as fascinated as her previousalbum. It's kind of latin now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like an old friend...","review":"This was my first listen of a Diana Krall album and I was not disappointed. It reminded me of the music my parents would play on a rainy Sunday when I was much younger. Perfect for listening to in front of the fireplace with someone special."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the look","review":"Great music from a sultry performer.My first time listening to this artist. I was not disappointed with this selection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Diana Krall and Antonio Carlos Jobim","review":"This album is lovely, and I play it at least 2 or 3 times a week, and have bought the DVD of her live concert in Paris, which includes many of these songs. With the orchestrations of Claus Ogerman and with her piano playing in the Brazilian jazz style, Diana has GOT to make her next album the music of Antonio Carlos Jobim. Her voice would be perfect to bring his lost classics back to his fans. Meanwhile THE LOOK OF LOVE remains one of the loveliest romantic CDs ever. Yeah, I mean it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ummmm.......","review":"Yes, I can't help wondering about Diana Krall's success. To me this sounds too much like the Jazz equivalent of Celine Dion. Soulless and superficial. Then again, all music types seem to be heading towards a similar level of mediocrity aren't they? I don't think she's a very good singer; to me, she sounds like a poseur - like many others I suppose. I won't repeat what's already been said many times except that these songs have been done better by many others. Seek them out unless you're only interested in the cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"not so good","review":"Her vocal phrasing is really uninspired on these clasically-arranged songs. She uses the same husky breathy singing on ALL of the tracks and it all sounds too much like the same song over and over again. Its a shame really, because these are great songs.Really, her vocal phrasing could only interesting if you haven't heard these songs ever before in your life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, but this album is a stinker...","review":"I, like everyone else impatiently awaited the arrival of this new cd. What a letdown. I agree with other reviews that the conviction is not there, the vocals are bland, more pathetic if you ask me and all around it sounds like nothing more than a droll mess of elevator music. Take away her name and vocals and no one within a million miles would touch this sappy mess. For Pete's sake get rid of that orchestra! Yikes! It simply does not work this time, plain and simple. Even the record store where I go people were asking the manager to turn that thing off! How sad. I own all of her other cd's and this is by far her worst. Dress her up as a sex kitten and forget about what got her here. Now she's famous, so the powers that be are running the show, no matter what she says. This cd blows, I'm sorry I bought it, but for those of you who think Diana is god and can do no wrong, then this sap is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lush Songs","review":"Diana Krall is one of the best jazz singers around today. She has the tremendous ability to slip inside a song and wear it like a glove. Her smoky voice can alternate between force and subtlety as in the beautiful \\"Dancing In The Dark\\". She has excellent arrangements and they add a lush sheen to standards like \\"Love Letters\\", the title track and \\"Besame Mucho\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"The look of Love","review":"I love Diana Krall, but this CD is just not that fun to listen to. It sounds like she is on cold medicine and makes me feel the same way. It is waaaaay too slow. Waaaay too little instrumental usage. But...I still love Diana and her singing, but please give us a bit more entertainment in a CD. The only time I listen to this one is if I need to go to sleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't like it","review":"I love Diana Krall but have to say this was a let down. I'm sure the other reviewer have already given their comments so I'll spare you. For those new to Krall or deciding on which album to get, I recommend some of her earlier works. My personal favs are the All for You: A Dedication to the Nat King Cole Trio and Love Scenes albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"Diana Moves Farther Yet from Her Strengths","review":"'Steppin Out' is by far my favorite Diana Krall album -- the vocals are not quite as polished as in later releases, but the piano work is superb and the song selections are mostly up-tempo. With each successive release she seems to be moving further from the strengths that make 'Steppin Out' such a success.On 'The Look of Love' Diana's vocals are out front -- not a bad thing, of course, but the piano work takes a backseat and appears mostly as single-note-at-a-time filigree. The orchestral arrangements are evocative of bad pop music from the 1960s and 70s. All of the songs would sound better in classic jazz trio format -- with a more prominent piano part, of course.In all, I found this work to be a big disappointment.I am going to one of Diana's concerts in December and hope to hear more of the early stuff. I'll take a 'Frim Fram Sauce' over any of her more recent recordings...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better listen to the blender","review":"This is a purely awful offering from an allegedly talented artist. If you listen to the first track, you've heard them all. It's much the same as listening to your blender hum through 10 drinks alternating only from speed 4 to 5. C'mon, Diana, what were you thinking. This is a tepid offering that is best ignored."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Journey Into Mediocrity","review":"OK, I took the plunge, bought into the hype, believed what I'd read and ordered this CD from Amazon.

The critically acclaimed previous albums of Diana's had made me wondering if it is my uneducated ears that's not finding her music as comparable (if any) to the likes of modern greats. For example, Shirley Horn. Well, so I bought all of them so I can get educated. However, after buying this one, I am now realizing that I (we) have been taken for a ride, and having more distrust of the reviews from these Jazz \\"experts\\" from reputable magazines and newspapers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Diana Krall: Top Jazz Legion","review":"The album \\"The Look of Love\\" is the pinnicle of Jazz achievement. If you love Jazz, you can't go wrong by purchasing this Jazz CD album. Diana combines her warm charm with her talent to make this great masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another fantastic display of her talents","review":"An excellent performance as a follow-up to When I Look In Your Eyes. I can't say I'm as impressed with it as I was with the last release, but she's still amazing. Her renditions of The Night We Called It A Day and Cry Me a River are the perfect expressions of bittersweetness. Her versatile voice really comes through. I'm not too happy with the fact that she's showing a lot more skin on her albums (CD insert has her displaying serious cleavage). I think she's a classy woman who's fallen prey to some marketing vices. Sure, she's an attractive woman, but I think her talents are enough to carry her far. Okay, I admit that if she looked like Sandra Bernhard, that might change things toward the downside for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"This was my second Diana Krall disk. I received the first one as a gift and I loved it. As soon as \\"The Look of Love\\" came out I purchased it. I like her voice and singing but I was dissapointed in this disk. There are too many very slow numbers on it. There needs to be more of a mix. As much as I like her singing, I found this boring. I'd have a hard time recommending it based on that."},{"rating":"1","title":"PLUCK THE STRINGS","review":"This is the latest offering from a very tellented singer/pianist.The voice is very good, but the orchestra is an unnecessary addition.the orchestra plays everything very slowly, they perform appaulingly. If they played like this at a classical concert,it would cause a mass walk out.The accompanying marketing photographs are tacky,sexist and unnecessary.Don't buy it, instead buy her LOVE SCENES or anything by Carmen McRae."},{"rating":"1","title":"Diana Krall The Look of love","review":"This type of record has been done so much better by many others.You can hardly hear her voice over the overproduced orchestra. Diana doesnt have a strong enough voice to pull this off. It is a shame that such mediocrity gets hyped up so much these days."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!","review":"Diana Krall is one of the few great jazz pianists and vocalists to come along in many years. I have all her albums, and I am a huge fan. This album is, I hope, the last in a downward spiral of marketing agents run amok. Someone decided to take a great jazz musician and transform her into a \\"Sex Kitten Accompanied By Strings.\\" The modeling photos and the(muzac-like)symphony orchestras are an insult to a musician who is at the top of her form in her earlier albums with just her trio or quartet. Please, please Diana, lose the phony image stuff, and get back to the very solid, hard-swinging jazz albums that place you in the ranks of the jazz greats."},{"rating":"1","title":"This CD is BROKEN!","review":"I hate to give this CD such a low rating because I like the music (not her best but I would have rated it 4 stars). Unfortunately, this CD appears to be \\"protected\\" by one of those new copy protection schemes that adds noise to the CD.On my 3 cd players I could hear a clicking sound every 10-15 seconds. It's barely audible, but now that I've heard it I always hear it. More frustrating, however, 3 of 5 computer CDROM drives I tried won't even read the disc.I hope that Universal stops this insane practice. It completely destroys my enjoyment of the music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Embarrassed","review":"This is an over-produced disaster.

I listen to this CD when I am on planes and trying to relax and tune out the world...very very nice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Her worst CD","review":"I don't know what Diana Krall was thinking when she made this CD. Maybe she thought shifting away from jazz would increase her popularity. Well, I don't think so... not if this is the result. Its a very boring, uninspiring CD with unremarkable songs. Thankfully, she has started to move back toward jazz with her CD \\"The Girl In The Other Room.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to her usual standard.","review":"This is the first CD by Miss Krall that disappoints me. Her voice is, as always, marvelous but the screeching violins make me sick. As for the cover art, who cares? I buy CDs for the music not the pictures. She could have a plain white wrapper and if I thought the music was good I'd buy it....... O.K., she's gorgeous but that doesn't make up for the bad orchestra."},{"rating":"1","title":"Come back Diana!","review":"I was hugely disappointed with this CD. She keeps moving farther and farther away from her jazz roots. I would have never believed that she would start doing Burt Bachrach tunes with schlocky orchestras arrangements. If you had only heard this CD and none of her earlier releases, you would never guess that Miss Krall is an excellent piano player. In fact, you can barely hear any piano at all. I saw her in concert weeks before the release of this CD and she only played one tune from it. I can see why now.The only positive thing I can say about \\"The Look of Love\\" is that she looks smoking hot in the artwork."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why?","review":"Diana has some strengths as a fine pianist and a decent singer with loads of originality. Unfortunately, this album does not display any of them. This dumbed-down muzak must have been the idea of a record label and not of the artist. If you listen back to Krall's original stuff, it bears no resemblance. Come on Diana, go back to making real jazz."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hopelessly Over-produced","review":"This album defines the word \\"clueless\\" but it isn't Diana Krall's problem, unless she's also producing without influence from those powers-that-be who want to see her reach a broader audience. True Krall fans want her to return to her roots: intimate, bass led, just you and that voice and that piano. Carmen McRae didn't shine in this milieu, and she knew it. This is not a Streisand or even Ann Hampton Callaway. Krall's voice isn't that good -- it's her style, her interpretation, that makes the connection with listeners. Strings break that connection. Love Scenes was the best of the best. More of the same, please."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreary and boring...","review":"Diana Krall's \\"When I Look in Your Eyes\\" was a great album which should have won the Grammy for Best Album of the Year. But Santana got the sentimental vote that year. (I digressed.) This album is boring and dull...put me right into a stupor. Every cut sounds the same....sloooowwwwwwwww and lifeless. She sounds like she was on downers when she made the recording. With the exception of the first song 'SWONDERFUL and the title song, everything else is forgettable mush."},{"rating":"1","title":"Desperately Flat","review":"This recording is desperately flat. You can't hear any difference in between the different titles.Great for a hotel lobby were you don't notice the music!Listen to Stacey Kent's versions and you think of suing Diana for running great songs.I must say the cover looks great in my case logic these legs deserve *****."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Gem!","review":"Relaxing, romantic, magical ... I think people of all ages can enjoy this cd. It's definitely soft jazz and has a lightness about it, nothing heavy musically . This is why most jazz purists will be disappointed. But I like the fact that Diana Krall is non-pretentious and is willing to give people what they want. It's also makes the perfect gift.I hope she makes more cd like this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Such a beautiful voice","review":"Although I had been a fan of Diana Krall, I had never owned a cd of hers until now. I am not what you can a big jazz fan either. This is a great relaxing cd. I highly recommend it to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Diana Krall","review":"What more can be said after you say excellent. This is with out a doubt the best of Diana's CD's to date.

Para darle las cinco estrellas hubiera tenido que estremecerme algo más su versión de Bésame Mucho, pero es que para un oido latino que ha escuchado tantas y tantas buenas versiones de ese conocido tema, en mi humilde opinión no queda \\"redondo\\"..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good bad day music","review":"If you haven't heard Diana Krall, you're missingout. She is a true jazz talent. I recommend The Look of Love highly."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Look of Love\\" great rendition but album is over produced.","review":"I really adore Diana Krall but this long awaited new album is unfortunately a huge disapointment.For a start the sound is very mushy and the whole album is just over arranged and produced. I really can't classify this as Jazz, just pretty background music.Diana is at her best with her trio and not backed by large orchestras as here she just sounds lost among all the too-lush sounds.Where are the fantastic piano solos from \\"All for you\\" gone.I hope the next album will be a dedicated 'Christmas' album and the producer leaves Diana alone to do what she does best; play and sing."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Look of Love","review":"I was very pleased to see that Diana was releasing a new CD so I pre-ordered (very convenient). While I know that this was another step forward in her musical career, I was disappointed with the syrupy arrangements and heavy strings. She is an incredibly accomplished musician and songstress and I was looking forward to another well-crafted, intimate jazz album, with tight arrangements, showcasing her voice as well as her excellent piano skills and that of the other fine jazz musicians in her group. I would not have purchased this if I had heard the musical clips on Amazon"},{"rating":"1","title":"Zzzzzzzzzzzzzz","review":"If you're awake, it will put you to sleep. If you're sleeping, it could kill you. There should be warning labels about using this CD in your car stereo. If you're a Diana Krall fan, you should probably pass on this one. I thought it was a bad choice of songs. S'boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"BIG DIANA FAN! HUGE DISAPPOINTENT!","review":"Sure, the album photography is great, her voice is great, as is her piano skills, but like another reviewer so poignantly noted, this is not jazz...it's Lawrence Welk's greatest hits. Seriously, (and I hate saying this), but if you want to be bored to death, or at least put to sleep, listen to the orchestral arrangements and the soft violins and let this sleeper of an album take you away. I really hate saying this, becuase I have every other one of her albums, and besides a few tracks from her last album, I love just about every song she's recorded. I've seen her live twice and in televised performances...and let's just say I was expecting some more jazz-oriented tunes with great piano riffs and her super-sultry voice, and what I got was a bunch of sappy violins."},{"rating":"1","title":"From Jazz pianist to elevator muzak DIVA","review":"I admire Diana as a(n)(ex) Jazz pianist/singer, who was discovered by Ray Brown who wrote the liner note on her excellent debut album \\"Stepping Out\\" with accomplists John Clayton and Jeff Hamilton. It was an excellent Jazz album with great piano playing and tasteful singing from Diana Krall.Material in The Look of Love is not bad music, but is not what she is capable of. I am not sure what people who liked her original style think, to me this is muzak, passable but so is Kenny G.Besides,after hearing Dusty Springfield's haunting \\"The Look of Love\\", Diana just does not do it for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Look of Love","review":"Disappointing and dull-sameness best describe this album. Her voice is nice, but nothing changes in her delivery or musical arrangements. The artistic merit is extremely low."},{"rating":"1","title":"A recording bordering on elevator music.","review":"I agree with the first reviewer. She has become more and more commercial and artisitically empty and uncreative. In answer to the question posed as to does her beauty make her less talented? No, her lack of talent makes her less talented."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Look of Love, Diana Krall","review":"The producers of this album should be ashamed. They have taken a great vocalist and great jazz pianist and buried both under the London Symphony or worse. Suitable for the elevator but not for a jazz/pop collection. What a waste!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great product from Amazon","review":"Amazon has done it again by being there with their great selection of products they sell.

One of the best books I have read all year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lauren is an angel with a voice to match...","review":"I first met Lauren over a year ago when I saw her perform at a local venue. Not only is her music magickal, but I can personally say that she is as beautiful personally as her music is. She is a genuinely nice person and knowing that makes her music even more special to me. When I hear her voice, I always feel better, no matter how rough my day has been. Lauren's voice is just downright transcedental, easily taking you away from this mundane reality. Listening to her is like listening to faeries singing. I can't wait until her next CD comes out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good sander, Bosch not much help on dust adapter","review":"Love the sander. Very controllable, works fast, not too noisy.For the life of me, I cannot figure why you bother with a dust port and no way to hook it to a vacuum or dust collection system. I did find a solution that works for me. Now, the dust collection is Festool-like. The Fein 921072K13 Step Adaptor here at Amazon is about 6 bucks. It is soft rubber. If you cut off the top two steps, the 1250DEVS dust port will fit inside the Fiein adapter (nice and tight). The large end of the Fein adapter fits very tightly inside the end of my Mr Nozzle hose (requires a little effort, but a tight fit is worth it.) Mr Nozzle is a great hose.The sander would be 5-star except for the required work-around. Bosch should just include an adapter to 1-1/4 or 1-1/2 in the package."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best sander FOR PROS","review":"If you USE your tools you will love it.

I am not sure where $250+ prices comes from ?.Check the Ridgid from Home Depot, as it feels solid and does job way better and costs only $170. ( Made in Germany ).I am returning this one for sure.I loved bosch tools in the past but lately I am returning more Bosch tools and going for Ridgid/Makita/Dewalt brands as I use my tools over 14-20 hours a week and I am feeling that Bosch Tools are over priced and low quality and won't last over 1 year.Disappointed with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad service","review":"If the item says \\"In Stock\\" you order it overnight shipping because you need it and expect it next day.

We use these in production, probably on the average of 15 to 20 hours per week, so we need a durable machine to handle the work load. This is it. The unit is a little heavy so you don't need to apply pressure when operating it. Great for large flat surfaces"},{"rating":"2","title":"absolutely amazing","review":"Ellroy is becoming more and more well known since the adaptation of LA confidential as a film, and the success of his most recent novels, but if you want brutal, honest truth about the man, this harrowing, gut wrenching truth to tell story of how he got the way he is, and how he lived enough for three men by the time he was thirty, this is worth reading. It is blatantly Freudian, explicitly forward, and never, ever compromises. If you would like to see just how interconnected the entire world of Ellroy's fiction is tied up with his real life, pick this up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harrowing, compelling, disgusting, and more","review":"Readers now know why James Ellroy's novels are filled with so much evil and sordidness. As \\"My Dark Places\\" reveals, his novels are filled with mirror shards of his own life. The book is not for everyone (reading these online reviews shows that clearly). It is compelling to those who are drawn to his novels by the sharp dialogue, the seamy characters, and the sense that real life is exactly like his stories. I can't say I \\"enjoyed\\" the book just like I can't say I enjoyed driving past the scene of a car crash. But reading this book gave me the same feeling I get when I drive by the scene of a car crash. I had to look."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disturing, disgusting and unnecessary","review":"I was a huge fan of James Ellroy until I read 'My Dark Places,' now you couldn't give me one of his books to read. It appears that this book comes from a very sick, twisted mind, of someone who truly had no respect for his mother. The book is very distrubing, somewhat boring and very disgusting, I would not recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perverse, grotesque, obsessive!","review":"James Ellroy steals the spotlight of a horrendous crime. This \\"best true crime book of the year\\" turned out to be a tell all of his perverted world of drugs and sex. The moment I thought I would be able to learn more or anything at all about the actual murder, Ellroy included his personal memoirs to twisted sexual fantasies. When anything pertaining to the actual homocide was mentioned it was as though the police logbook was restated. I was extremely disappointed as well as turned off by Ellroy's explicit descriptions of immoral acts unrelated to the actual murder. This book does not do Jean Ellroy or her murder justice!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Distasteful and wholly uninspiring","review":"Somebody bring me some water. I have just finished My Dark Places and need to gargle. Ellroy could not have portrayed himself any more convincingly as the author I would LEAST like to meet. From his choice of words and awkwardly- placed profanities, to his tacky pride and conceited name change, he doesn't seem to have evolved much in character since as a 10-year old he lapped up his father's propaganda about his mother. Poor dear Geneva - your son has disgraced you in the interests of his own 'success'. Poor Aunt Leoda - little Leroy never learned respect. In future books, I hope Leroy, I mean James, strives for better content, nobler content, white orchids. Let all the redheads rest in peace."},{"rating":"1","title":"I agree with Pedantic's review.","review":"A sick, self-indulgent, waste of ink by a very sick puppy.The deeper you get into this book, the more you realize that it is going nowhere and very slowly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time & Money","review":"I know how a bad review can hurt the author and I don't take that lightly. I just don't want someone else to buy this novel without knowing what they're getting. I found the book boring and repetative. I kept reading it anyway because I kept hoping it would get better. It never did. I then kept reading hoping for a good ending. I got no satisfaction with that either. It leaves you hanging. I really enjoy true crime stories but this one makes me not ever want to read one again. Sad but true!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgusting, foul and obscene","review":"The most depressing,horrible book I have ever read. I would not have continued it after the first 50 pages if it had not been the selection for the local book club. If you ever have the chance DON'T READ IT! It is a true crime/detective story about the murder of his mother and contains many disgusting, foul and obscene parts. It is truly amazing that with the many evil, black (not just dark) thoughts James Ellroy has/had about his mother and other murdered women in the L.A. area that he did not turn into a serial murderer himself. The only enlightening thing about the book is the question of how many other boys reading \\"true crime\\" books will accept his dark thoughts and evil suggestions as normal and be pushed into a private life as perverted as the one James Ellroy describes as his own. I do NOT recommend this book to anyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Portrait of an Artist Becoming a Man","review":"James Ellroy's intense memoir explores the development of his imagination and psyche in relation to the most intense experience of his childhood: learning, at 10 years old, that his mother has been murdered. With searing honesty, Ellroy portrays his obsessions, the breakdown of his mental health, and his life as a petty criminal. Simultaneously, he probes the history of Los Angeles (city and county) and the fight against crime there. I found the Ellroy's layers of exploration fascinating. The book's turning point comes when, in 1994, Ellroy hires a detective to join him in reopening the unsolved case of his mother's murder. At this juncture, as he explores the history of detective Stoner, as he explores L. A. more deeply, and as he continues to come to terms with his own life, all of the many dimensions of this memoir begin to cohere and an extraordinary portrait of an artist, James Ellroy, and his milieu, Los Angeles, results."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insight... and then some!","review":"I just finished reading this book in about two days. I, unlikely as it seems, didn't come to Ellroy because of the film version of L.A. Confidential, I started reading him because an awful lot of writers in the genre admire and recommend his work. I would recommend to any one thinking of getting this book to read as much of the \\"LA Quartet\\" (Black Dahlia, The Big Nowhere, L.A. Confidential, and White Jazz) before tackling it. I think it makes more sense and is especially rewarding when you see the direct correlations between what happened in his real life and what he wrote about. The police routine in the second half is a bit pedantic, but I generally skimmed through a lot of it (as I suspect most people would do). When I finished it, I immediately pulled out Black Dahlia and began re-reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling. Total page turner.","review":"When I met \\"Lee\\" Ellroy in junior high school in 1959, we knew his mother had died, but we did not know how. I lost track of Lee after we graduated, and was reintroduced to him when he became James. \\"My Dark Places\\" is shocking in it's truth, and for me a trip down memory lane, because I knew the boy who lived through this horrible experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Practical","review":"I am not sure what to do with the safety tool, maybe give it to a fireman or EMT that could use it. I was pleasantly surprised with the sheath. There are an amazing number of carry options and I love the built in sharpener idea. That being said, I removed the scabbard from the webbing and attached only that to my pack straps. I was pleased to have that option as well. I bought another one for my nephew to take hunting as I was so impressed with the quality for the price. I also liked the shorter blade length."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buzz Buzz CD","review":"Lots of fun, upbeat songs throughout CD.

We listen in the car frequently, and prefer it to the more recent \\"Rocketship Run\\" songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great BUZZ!","review":"This is (and I'm speaking honestly here) one of the very few singalong CDs for your kids that won't make you want to tear your hair out when you're listening to it for the 100th time on the way to the grocery store with the kids. The songs are short and catchy, but they don't grate on your in the same way that others do, probably because Laurie doesn't sing with a voice that caters strictly to 2 year old sensibilities. Yet, the songs have that blissfully calming effect on the kids too. I'm not quite sure how she does it.Buzz Buzz is my son's favorite. I would highly, highly recommend it to any parent looking for a good set of songs for the car."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another fun one from Laurie","review":"We first found Laurie on Jacks Big Music Show and now we have all of the Laurie Berkner music to date.

I have other \\"mommy\\" CD's in the car but I always turn on Laurie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"So Far The Best CD I Have Found","review":"I purchased this CD and Whaddya Think Of That after my 1 year old son fell in love with her videos on Noggin. We listen to her all the time in the car because it keeps him quiet and content. I've purchased many CD's before and none have been as easy to listen to, both for my son and myself. Most CD's are either boring lyrically or musically - this is neither!

My daughter loves to watch Noggin. She cannot wait until Laurie's next song. I ordered the \\"Buzz Buzz cd and it was a disappointment. The cd is very unrefined - quite possibly one of her first cd's. In fact my daughter gets upset when we play it. It is so different my daughter doesn't even recognie it.

I would DEFINATELY buy all of her cd's if this were true."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I bought this CD based on the reviews for my 2 yr. old.Some songs are okay but the lyrics on some of the others do not make much sense. My daughter was scared by the way a few songs turn from a soft tone to a loud shout by the end of the song. (\\"There's a Little Wheel A-Turnin In My Heart\\" and \\"Pig on Her Head\\"). I really didn't like \\"I'm a Mess\\" which sounds like a heavy-rock/rap and also scared my daughter. I would recommend instead Karyn Henley's CDs which I found to be the best out there for the toddler age group (3-5 yrs). She tells stories between some of the songs which really engages my daughter. The songs are wholesome and innocent."},{"rating":"1","title":"IF YOU LIKE HER ON NOGGIN - DON'T BUY THIS!!!","review":"This is NOTHING like you hear on Noggin!!

We love it! The songs are not the same as on Noggin, but they are just as fun. Most of the songs my 4 year old can remember and we sing them around the house. The clean up song is a staple at cleanup time. The old favorites and the new songs are up beat enough that the entire family can enjoy this CD in the car. A CD for children that does not make me sick at my stomach if we listen to it one more time."},{"rating":"2","title":"luuuuuuv it!","review":"We just bought this cd on the recommendation of my sister. I have a 1 year old and a 4 year old and our family absolutely loves this collection of songs. They are so fun and upbeat...great for dancing around the living room or distracting a cranky toddler in the car. The melodies are whimsical with a folky edge. Laurie Berkner's voice is fresh, delightful, and (thankfully) not annoying. The cd has a number of traditional favorites as well as new tunes that are sure to please. Beware...these are very catchy songs that WILL get stuck in your head but the funny thing is that you won't mind a bit. You will be happily buzzing through the grocery store or wherever singing these silly tunes with a smile on your face. This cd is pure sunshine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laurie Berkner","review":"I as well as my 4 year old daughter really enjoyed the CD, and DVD.

Stay away from this album!","review":"This is the kind of recording that gives \\"children's music\\" a bad name. The insipid and annoyng songs coupled with Ms. Berkner's flat, nasal vowels seem designed to irritate the listener. Her supporting cast is simply beyond belief--did she go out looking for tone-deaf people to sing with her on this album?...she certainly found them. It also seems that she recruited her brass players from the local junior high school. The trumpet and trombone players play out-of-tune with extremely unprofessional sounds.To bring children up on bad music is to do them an injustice. There are some GOOD albums out there for children. Please don't buy this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"save your money","review":"My 2 year old son loves to dance and listen to music. However, he is not that interested in this CD.

My son, who just turned 4, knows all the goofy & funny lyrics by heart and never gets tired of it! On occassion, after dropping off kids here and there, I've found myself singing along to this CD, alone in my car, which cracks me up when I realize what I'm doing! It's not possibly to be in a bad mood with Laurie's music on. Buy this CD and you'll surely be back for more - I'd try one with \\"We are the Dinosaurs\\" on it next. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Laurie Keeps Victoria Dancing","review":"The first time I heard Laurie's music is when I was watching Noggin with my two year old daughter Victoria.

My little kids absolutely love it, ages 4 and 20 months, as does my very picky and too cool almost 13 year old daughter (who now knows the words to the original songs better than I do). It has a lot of original music about things kids like (monsters, ice cream, cookies...), plus some old folky favorites. Laurie is very creative and a nice change from Barney and Friends music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD for kids and adults, too!","review":"I bought this CD because my son really enjoys Laurie Berkner when she is on the Noggin channel. I popped it into the CD player in the car yesterday and he immediately started bouncing back and forth in his carseat and singing. The best thing about this CD is that kids love it, and it is actually good music, so I didn't mind listening to it as well. It is a great to listen to something for him that is not the same nursery songs, over and over."},{"rating":"1","title":"beginner software","review":"This was confusing for an 8 yr old who wants to learn to play.

Easy-to-read, it is written for the layman, not the academic.I learned things I'd never heard of before, such as the fact that the United States once had troops occupying part of Russia! During the intervention of 1918, Europeans and America went in to support the White Russians and help quell the chaos during the early Russian Revolution.Also that in early American history our relationship with Canada was anything but friendly. There were shooting incidents between Americans and Canadians partly over border disputes and partly over Canadian fears of American invasion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the wait","review":"I've been looking for this album since 2002.

It reads like it was written for the head chemist at Budweiser or a graduate school chemistry course. If you didn't major in chemistry or have been out of school a few years, it reads like a textbook. There is some interesting information in the book but you have to dig it out. Unless you really want to get very technical about the chemical changes during the brewing process, this book has little use for the average brewer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the homebrewer","review":"While jam-packed with technical brewing-related information on the molecular level, the book is virtually useless to the amateur brewer seeking to improve his or her beer. I did not expect instant enlightenment, but I did hope to glean some knowledge of water chemistry, hop utilization, etc. Unfortunately, I am brewing beer, not conducting experiments in a well-equipped laboratory. The prose is somewhat dry and reads like a post-graduate-level lecture. Definitely a chemistry text, and not a brewing text."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreadable.","review":"Gore Vidal phoning it in.

It is a paperback, but very thick and heavy, and does not allow easy reading except on a table; almost impossible to read in bed.Second, subject matter. These are the ravings of a totally unbalanced mind. Yes it is arcane and interesting to see how someone (admittedly brilliant) thought so long ago. And he had an opinion about everything! Everything, I say! Talk about motormouth. He goes on and on long after anyone could possibly find him interesting. Oh, how this man needed an editor.Third, he is viciously anti-Catholic. Yes, I know it was (is?)the fashion in England for the best people to be anti-Catholic, but this guy can't be beat for vitriolic, venomous, bigotry. If you like that sort of thing, or some peekings into a pretty nasty anti-feminist, anti-modernity, deluded melancholy mind, be my guest.My advice: save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"good book","review":"although i have yet to finish this treat, i have enjoyed reading it so far. i'm not an english major so it is a little more engaging than what i'm normally used to. but i can feel my brain growing as i steadily crawl through the pages.

Only buy this paperback version:The Anatomy of Melancholy (New York Review Books Classics); it's by far the best available and of durable construction (for a gigantic paperback, anyways). It also has two introductions, wonderful in their own right, especially Gass's. It also contains the translations for the Latin phrases which so often appear.

His \\"macho\\" voice sounds so deferent and can reach a very high notes with good vibration on few songs like \\"you raise me up\\",\\" my confession\\",\\"All'imprevviso amore\\"What I like the most is \\"Caruso\\", I've been listening for so many version of Caruso and never thought that he can sing in a deferent way with his classical twist!!I can say this album is the best album of the year,Great job Josh, you did it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a terrific performer!","review":"I had heard a review of Josh Groban's music on the radio and that he had a concert in Portland, Maine. On impulse, I bought his CD. I have played it over and over again. Josh Groban has an incredible voice. I am usually into rock and roll. When I listened to this CD I thought it was the most romantic music I have ever heard. Josh Groban has an irresitible sound to him. I would recommend this CD to anyone who appreciates a beautiful voice, unbelievable lyrics, and overall talent in the production. This a great CD, no matter what type of music you usually like.

I wonder if it's because of the overproduction of the songs, but I've listened to the CD many, many times, and his voice just doesn't sound as powerful and deep as it was in his previous works (honestly, I think his voice is going the route of Charlotte Church in \\"The Prayer\\", which would be an awful shame). I don't know if it's the problem of the producer or if Josh has just tired his voice too much, but that voice, though still vastly superior to most, just doesn't have the same \\"punch\\" as it did. I truly hope Josh will find his voice back on his next album."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of Josh","review":"Another terrific CD by Josh Groban. What a talent.

Execellent relaxing Music!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"no room to be CLOSER to perfection","review":"This is the very eagerly anticipated sophmore effort from Mr. Josh Groban (not including the live CD from the much celebrated PBS special). With over 5 million units sold worldwide, there's no sophmore jinx lurking here. Josh delivers the goods we've come to expect; Power ballads that hit the heart & soul with such force that Amazon should've listed CLOSER with a \\"better together\\" offer that included a box of tissues. Josh has added to and enhanced the formula by co-writing 3 tunes. Yes his musical team has the best talent money can buy but the power & emotion of this young man's voice demands it. Groanites & newbie fans alike will be delighted in CLOSER. Buy the limited edition w/ the DVD now. You get some extra tunes on the CD & face it, if not now, you'll end up ordering it later anyway.

This syrupy Italo-pop is truly insufferable. I suppose it's great for people who want to seem classy and cultured without having any idea what they're talking about. People who think Andrew Lloyd Webber composes operas. Sarah Brightman fans. Celine Dion fans. Andrea Bocelli fans. Ignorance really must be bliss.

Seriously, the fella would kill on Broadway in a couple more years. That said, this album is gawd-awful. Overwrought production, cringe-inducing faux-emotional balladry, and pretentious foreign language tracks make this a nearly unlistenable piece of tripe, and positions Groban as the male Celine Dion. My opinion of Groban as an artist (not a singer, an artist) was not improved when I happened to see a 5-minute infomercial for \\"Closer\\" on TV one night; morbid curiousity dictated that I watch, and I'm worse off for it. Just like the CD, it was an agglomeration of phoney sentiment, a lot of soft-lensed, wistful stares into the camera or just off stage-right, and in the spot's most comical moment, a clip in which Groban has grown a \\"beard\\" that makes him look like Wolverine's testosterone-challenged younger brother. You wanna hear Josh Groban? Wait until he plays the Phantom, or Valjean. Don't buy \\"Closer.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Your Money's Worth","review":"In reading the (few) negative reviews, it struck me that when a talented artist becomes immensely popular, the standard bar is raised proportionately. So really, the fact they are worth being held up to close criticism is actually a compliment in reverse!

Without a doubt, it is one of the finest vocal recordings of our time. Masterpiece is too small a word for such beautiful music. Every song is meaninful, masterful, mindful and magical. Listen to vocal, lyrical and orchestral mastery. No matter where I listen, in the car, working, at home, relaxing, I am continually in awe with the eloquence of the music and Josh Groban's God-given voice. He is a young master and his inspiring music is filled with so much intelligence, passion and love. I both weep and jump for joy and thrill with the majesty and greatness of it all. I promise you, there is no way to hide from this music, it will reach into your heart and soul and move you to your depths, as it has touched me to my inner core. Flawlessly beautiful."},{"rating":"2","title":"If crying isn't manly, then just call me Shirley.","review":"Josh Groban produces, arguably, the purest vocals since those late 80s Folgers commercials. The first time I heard \\"You Raise Me Up\\", I had to pull off the freeway! I was bawling uncontrollably! Embarrassingly, there was a lot of traffic on the 405 at the time, and drivers kept staring.The other songs, especially the ones in Latin or Korean or whatever that is, are beautiful. After Track 13, I waited for a bonus track. No such luck. It wasn't advertised, but you never know.If this doesn't convince you to buy Closer, I don't know what will!"},{"rating":"2","title":"setting the mood","review":"I enjoy Josh Groban's music and think he is talented beyond his youthful age.

This cd is just incredible and definitely better that the first one. Even though most of the songs are in foreign languages you get to love them simply because is Josh who is singing them. He has an extraordinary voice that can turn any song into a magnificent experience. I love \\"Oceano\\", \\"When you say you love me\\" and \\"Hymne a l'Amour\\". However, the best song is \\"Remember when it rained\\", first because you get to listen to him playing the piano and because he wrote it, and second because you get to hear his voice at his maximum. You won't regret it. I can guarantee you that all the songs will put a smile on your face.

Though filled with songs that are in Italian, French, and some other languages I can't reasonably understand the lyrics in given my history with language classes, I love the cd.Any fan of Groban's will love this CD, and songs like \\"Remember when it Rained\\" will draw in a new round of fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"If a heart could sing this is what it would sound like","review":"Very few \\"new\\" talents, and none this young, have a voice that can reach the places in your soul only known to yourself.

DISAPPOINTMENT IN YEARS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I loved Josh's first cd. I have eagerly awaited his second one for 2 years. But this new offering is so bad I am shocked!!!!!! It is monotonic, all the songs sound the same. The whole thing is bombastically overproduced!!! Sounds like he is singing to a Yanni concert. The arrangements are way tooooooo loud and the percussion is outrageously intrusive, making him virtually SCREAM every song. And what is with all these foreign language songs? They are neither interesting nor worth hearing twice. Josh has such a beautiful voice, but whoever produced this mess has done him a MAJOR disservice. If you loved the first cd, I cannot state strongly enough, DO NOT BUY THIS CD!!!!! I hope he changes arrangers, producers, and conductors and lets someone else help him pick the songs for the next cd. I can't give up hope that this beautiful voice will be used for a better effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pleasant Voice - Terrible Material","review":"These types of recordings seem to be aimed at an audience I cannot relate to.Mr. Grobin has a pleasant enough voice - think an Anglo version of Andrea Bocelli - but I cannot get past the music itself.Frequently - and incorrectly - he's called an opera singer, but I think it fairly obvious, unless he's hiding something, this is not a voice made for opera. A certain type of musical theatre, or perhaps ballads of another era - or from an era yet to be, would be more suitable for this singer. As it is the material is overproduced, souped up to levels of near maudlin intimacy - but lacking anything \\"genuine\\" or real.Amazingly, people are flocking to this stuff and praising it to the heights ... I don't get it. And don't want to. It smells a little bit like Charlotte Church to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Closer","review":"I've been a Josh Groban fan from the moment I saw him on Ally McBeal a few years ago.

But what I found was an entire CD that I can listen to over and over without skipping any of the songs.Josh Groban has a unique voice - I would say it's 50% opera, 25% pop, 25% broadway/jazz. And his music is unusually varied- I love the Spanish, French, and Italian pieces on this CD. With such a versatile voice, it's hard to believe that he's really only just getting started! I'm looking forward to a lot more music from Josh Groban in the coming few decades."},{"rating":"2","title":"Josh Groban has what it takes","review":"Josh Groban has incredible talent and a mature understanding of musical selections. His first album may be my favorite album ever from any artist, so it would be difficult to improve upon this on his second try.

This album is still a wonderful effort, but it falls short of accomplishing the success of Josh's first album. Of course, I could be a little biased ... Gira con me and Alejate will always be my favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"So young, but so much passion!","review":"Josh's latest album, Closer, is an incredible follow-up album to his first. I truly tear up when I hear Mi Mancherai from \\"Il Postino\\". At such a young age, it is amazing that I actually feel he has felt the pain and joy of love when he sings. His talent is truly showcased on this album as a singer, writer, and musician. Every song on this album is beautifully orchestrated and it will be interesting to watch Josh's career blossom even more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love","review":"One of my favorite Josh Groban cd's of all time - was really bummed to lose my cd - but now I have it digitally (hopefully don't lose my computer AND my ipod all at once)"},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW","review":"This is Josh Groban's best CD. I purchased these for a group of elderly woman who had never heard of him. They all just thought this was great."},{"rating":"2","title":"By far my favorite Josh Groban album","review":"I love every song on this album. I wish he would return to music like this. I used to be a huge fan, but his last two albums have been a big disappointment to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"4.75","review":"Another excellent effort from Josh Groban...cant say enough about this artist...I am not one to listen to this type of music for the most part, but when you put this CD in or the earlier CD, you are taken to a place that gives you great peace of mind and comfort...these songs are just beautiful...musically and lyrically. Only draw back is that it seems every other song is in Italian...therefore, it can be hard for the average listener to understand...even then..the songs are beautiful...great job!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow....","review":"Josh is soo inspiring, Closer is just amazing its to good for words. If he was a girl he would sound like a chick i've heard of before, her name is Genie and she sounds very similar to josh. check her out on amazon, just search for genie. The album that corispondes to this one would be wildflowers.I HEART JOSH!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!!","review":"Emotional, musical, talented .....truly a step 'closer' to where Josh has said he is headed. A wonderful compilation of songs. Josh has outdone himself...I only hope that he that he keeps making music more into 'his' direction. There is an obvious difference with the tracks he was more closely involved in...very enjoyable. The only negative I feel - and I felt it on the first CD is that some tracks are overproduced..way too heavy on backings and orchestrations,,,,I would prefer that Josh would not have to compete with all the extras....Let his voice shine!"},{"rating":"2","title":"SPECTACULAR","review":"I first heard Josh on the radio in Oct 2002 (not sure why it took so long) and couldn't believe the voice I was hearing on a top 40 station...exquisite, soothing, beautiful, etc, etc, etc. Loved the first CD and Closer is just as good if not better!! Josh has enormous musical talent that continues to improve. Hi song co-writing ability is captured in Remember When It Rained (great piano playing also), Per Te and Never Let Go. Mi Mancheral, When You Say You Love Me, My Confession, Oceano, You Raise Me Up, Hymne A L'Amour, etc...all of the songs on the CD capture JG's talent and are a joy to listen to. Singer, song writer, piano player...can't wait to see what the future will bring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple, powerful, amazing","review":"With great anticipation of this album ever since his debut, there was a big risk of disappointment...I never thought that he could build on perfection, but Josh Groban did the impossible. His new album is more mature, giving what Grobanites have come to expect and yet adds a bit more variety and stretches his vocal range...his strongest songs in my opinion are \\"My Confession\\", \\"Per Te\\" and \\"When You Say You Love Me\\", but there is no denying the power of inspiration in his leadoff single \\"You Raise Me Up\\" (which it most certainly did!). All of his songs highlight this man's immense talent. Thank you Josh, for sharing your amazing ability to inspire and to comfort...you truly are amazing!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bravo Mr. Groban...You Have My Standing Ovation","review":"Josh's sophomore release, \\"Closer,\\" far surpasses his debut album as it examplifies vocal mastery and artist maturity. The highlights of the CD includes: \\"My Confession,\\" \\"Oceano,\\" \\"You Raise Me Up,\\" \\"Broken Vow,\\" and lastly a duet with Joshua Bell, \\"Mi Mancherai\\" from \\"Il Postino.\\"I can't tell you how much listening pleasure I receive from listning to \\"My Confession.\\" You'll have to explore that pleasure on your own. Basically, if you enjoy music from artists like Mario Frangoulis or Sarah Brightman or simply enjoys relaxing soft music, give \\"Closer\\" a try. If you don't like it, you can always sell it back on Amazon.Com Market Place.If you like to know more information about Josh Groban, please visit his offical web site: http://www.joshgroban.com/.

Hearing Groban's sonic stench makes every single hair that I have stand on end. Moreover, his insufferable slop has made me painfully aware of hair in places which I never thought possible! To make matters worse, David Foster, the production genius who ruined the band Chicago, produced this travesty.Naturally, women love Josh Groban. He has no doubt dethroned Michael Bolton as the world's leading chick-schlock vocalist.Josh Groban is an active participant in the Great Conspiracy Against Men. Come on, Josh!

But who cares, he has curly hair and can cleanly hold a note for a measure or two."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who needs opera?","review":"I was disgusted when I listened to this cd.

His music is beautiful and his voice is beautiful - like silk. I highly recommend this CD to anyone who wants to listen to a CD and get chills because I have listened to it over and over yet I still get chills when I listen to it. It is amazing. And once you listen to this you can understand why he has fans all over the world nicknamed - GROBANITES!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I looked forward to Josh Groban's second album as I absolutelyloved his first. His voice was so powerful, emotional and personal. What I especially enjoyed was the way the music did not overwhelm or substitute for the vocals.This album evocked this comment: \\"My God, he's been Celine Dioned\\"! My partner, a musician, simply said: \\"Sounds like songson a hollywood sound track.\\" There are dozens of albums like this and they all sound the same.I have a deeper appreciation of how a producer can make or breakyou. I am a huge fan of Eva Cassidy, who, in part, never becamefamous in her lifetime because producers didn't know what to dowith her wide ranging talent: jazz, folk, torch, ballad, etc. This album indicates a lack of appreciation for the voice bycommercializing the \\"product\\" to the point of blandness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bogus \\"Enhanced CD\\"","review":"I specifically bought this CD for the song \\"Raise Me Up\\" and the promised additional exclusive video footage. As a result, I was not disappointed when all the other songs on the CD sucked.I was, however, let down when I found that the so-called \\"Enhanced CD\\" features were a scam. The only thing you get is a pop-up screen that only allows you to enter your e-mail address to sign up for their mailing list and has two links to the artist's and record label's website. There was no exclusive video footage at all.The record label, Reprise / Wea, claims, after you've already bought the CD, that, \\"Oh, by the way, the so-called enhanced features do not work on all computers.\\" Well, the truth is that they do not work on older computers and they also do not work on the newer computers that have drives that can read and write both DVD and CD on one sole drive.This CD sucks.

It sounded lovely and I wanted to get that lovely love song. I could not find the exact album on your Amazon site, so I chose something that might be near. Well, I am very sorry to say that this CD is highly depressing to me; not uplifting at all; so in fact a total waste of money.Also, what was confusing, it said that this CD was coming from the U.S.A. It had a price in dollars, 16 something. I do not know what I have been charged and the ultra confusing link the the U.S. was very strange to me, but I went along with it. If we get a huge bill my husband won't be happy! Please, Amazon, make your site easier.

I first saw him on the Winter Olympics when he sang with Charlotte Church. I'll eventually have to get his first CD, but this one is doing just GREAT!!!I would encourage others to open their minds and take a listen to an incredibly gifted young singer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning Follow Up.","review":"Josh Groban's Closer is a wonderful follow up to his debut. Josh stays with the same formula which made his first so successful. Soaring ballads performed in English, Italian, and other languages. His voice has gotten much stronger, and richer which makes some of the songs all the more powerful. His voice does lack some personality, especially when he starts off a ballad, but it always builds into a climatic chorus with a full on orchestra or gospel choir. Highlights for me include the first single You Raise Me Up. The haunting ballad Broken Vow. The beautifully sung Remember When it Rained. This is Josh's best vocal performance on the disc. Josh has only gotten stronger, and I can't wait to hear what he's going to sound like in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"brilliant","review":"Josh Groban's \\"Closer\\" cd is brilliant, I recommend it to everyone who enjoy real music, a real vocalist and great performist. He should get more praise for his work. Instead kids who bop around wearing practically a band - aid get more play. Josh's voice is like velvet. I know I will always enjoy his music, \\"she's out of my life\\" is wonderful! and so are the rest of the tracks on this album. you will never be disappointed with Josh."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING","review":"I LOVE JOSH GROBAN!

Again, this is not a CD with only 1 or 2 good songs - there are several songs in this album that rate as beautiful/great -- melody, lyrics, and voice. You will not be disappointed with Closer. It is a great follow-up to his debut album."},{"rating":"2","title":"does the soul of music","review":"of music can any better than this? nopehe could lose the intro mandolins or whatever instrument which often proceeds his genius in his own unique genre on this cd.

Thanks Josh"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"With every new song Josh sings, he proves his phenomenal talent! Each song is full of emotion and you can hear the care Josh takes in singing each one. It was also a treat to hear Josh play the piano on \\"Remember When It Rained.\\" Great CD and a perfect follow up to the first album."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"King of Highbrow Pop\\" - Most Definitely!!!","review":"Other than Barbra Streisand, Josh has the best recording and singing voice in the industry. I don't have his first CD, but this is an impressive effort. For those who want to sleep through Josh's refreshing vocals, go right ahead. We won't wake you up.Josh is on course to legendary status. His voice is just that good. A lot of people think he's an opera singer, but this is a Pop CD. Josh has a classically trained voice so it's not traditional Pop. But Just because some of the songs are in a foreign language, that doesn't make it a classical or opera CD.Billboard referred to him as the \\"King of Highbrow Pop.\\" So accurate. I love the entire CD. Josh, keep up the work!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A perfect follow-up","review":"I became an instant fan of Josh Groban with his debut on my favorite TV show, Ally McBeal. With the release of his self-titled first CD, I was ecstatic and blown away. Now with Closer, his follow-up, Josh Groban has basically become a household name, and he deserves it all.Closer is Groban's second CD and slowly moves his towards the pop arena. His first CD was a mix of pop and opera with a mix of English, Italian, and Spanish. This CD is mostly sung in English and still showcaes Groban's beautifully gorgeous tenor voice. As with his first CD, all the songs on Closer is worth listening to over and over. There is not one to be missed.If you haven't heard of Josh Groban, I suggest you pick up this CD and give him a try. You won't be disappoitned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding voice","review":"Although I'm not a fan of this type of music normally (I'm only 30 and more into 'young peoples' music), this guy has an amazing voice and you'd be a fool not to agree. His vocals are that of an Andrea Bocelli and he's amazing. The music is beautiful and calming and puting his voice to the music makes this cd something almost anyone can appreciate."},{"rating":"2","title":"breathtaking","review":"This CD is absolutely breathtaking! Every song on here is worth mention but I don't think there is enough room here to describe each song so I'll just cover my absolute favorites. 'YOu Raise ME Up\\" is of course a good one. It has beautiful accompaniment and just a song to mellow out to. My absolute, absolute favorite was Remember When it Rained. This song honestly brought goosebumps to my skin. Josh Groban plays the piano in this one and it's just beautiful not to mention the lyrics are great. The first song is also pretty neat (OCeana). I love the beat to it. Well, these are just a few of the great things about this album. YOu definilty have to buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Holy crow, can this kid sing!","review":"Josh continues to astonish me. His voice is powerful and gorgeous, his diction (in any language) impeccable. I haven't been able to stop humming You Raise Me Up since I first heard it. And I loved his original compositions, particularly Remember When It Rained. On the radio station I listen to, the DJ remarked the other day that she doesn't doubt for a minute that he'll win an Oscar someday. Hopefully it'll be soon -- and maybe with a Tony, too!I'm only knocking a point off because I'd like to see him stretch stylistically a little more. I suspect he's capable of a much wider range than we've seen so far. Josh, keep up the great work, and I'm already salivating for your third CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I JUST WANT GOOD MUSIC!!!","review":"I just want good music and \\"Closer\\" certainly qualifies. In fact, it passes with flying colors.I respect the fact that Josh is doing the kind of music that he likes, and that people are responding to it. He's not your typical Pop artist, but why should he be??? He didn't conform to the norm. Thank God. I'd rather listen to music that genuinely reflects who the artist is, than something that represents a manufactured identity.I truly appreciate artists like: Josh Groban, Norah Jones, Alicia Keys, Clay Aiken, Eminem, Outkast, and Kanye West. Why? Because they're succeeding based upon their own individuality and merits. They're not trying to be anybody else but themselves. I'm tired of clones and carbon copies. That's why I'm supporting Josh because he's an original."},{"rating":"1","title":"Been There, Done That","review":"If you have the first Groban CD, don't bother getting this one. They are indistinguishable. The man has a beautiful voice, now all he needs is someone who can choose his music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Many Foreign Language Songs!","review":"This guy has a great voice, but the problem is he hasn't got any songs to sing. His first album had just a few English songs and the trend continues on this cd as well. I find myself skipping all of the foreign language songs and only listening ot the English ones. No offence, but I don't like to listen to words I can't translate! There are only 5 English songs on the album! Why can't he sing an entire album in English and then release the French version separately? I'm taking the English songs from the debut album and adding the English songs from this album to make one album that I don't have to skip through! My finger is tired!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do we really need this?","review":"The preference for singers is very subjective. But I would like to point out that we have a great pool of talents in our time and please don't miss them. If you like the baritone voice, please try any cds by Dimtri Hvorostovsky. He simply does not make bad cds. Other great voices you should at least try to listen to for once: Thomas Hampson, Nathan Gunn, Thomas Allen, Thomas Quassthoff, Bo Skovhus, Gino Quilico, Peter Mattei. By the way, most of these gentlemen are very easy on the eyes. I may as well throw in three tenors as bonus: Ramon Vargas, Juan Diego Florez and Michael Schade. If you have heard all of these singers and still think Groban's cd is the \\"best thing\\", then I am really speechless. Please don't call me a \\"snob\\" just because I would like to share with you some of the best voices in the world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nervewracking!","review":"Someone played me this cd in their car. For openers, I was not enthralled with the voice quality. Secondly, the very syrupy, sicky-sweet style throughout the cd is constant and can truly get on one's nerves after a few minutes. Yes, some of the tracks are written in foreign tongues. However, the music is always annoying, regardless of whether it is in English, French, Italian, Malaysian, or Swahili. I dislike Josh Groban's music. Perhaps that means I'm not a sensitive person. Oh, well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Musical Blasphemer? INDEED!...","review":"Mr. Groban is an egregious musical FAILURE. As a longtime listener and sincere fan of all things musical, I can say that this warbling isn't musical. His voice is weak and lacking on so many levels it is rediculous. To the reviewer that had the audacity to compare Mr. Groban to Luciano Pavarotti: SHAME!To those thinking of buying this album: investigate other classic baritones and tenors, and for that matter-CLASSICAL MUSIC!! Do not limit yourself to this garbage, but rather stray from the darkness and into the light that is anything BUT Josh Groban. I suggest you read MaestroMike's review for a scholarly look into the proverbial cow dung with which Josh Groban has stained the musical market."},{"rating":"1","title":"Superior Against An American Idol World, But Is That Much?","review":"Sure, he's miles ahead of the devoid Clay Aiken [who or what isn't?], but I still prefer \`You Raise Me Up' when it was recorded as \`Wind Beneath My Wings' and I didn't like it much then either. Bland quasi-classical in the same vein as Charlotte Church, his pro-nun-ci-a-tion more suited for the Broadway stage, stabs \`Hymne a l'Amour' to stupefaction, misguidedly co-writes a few himself, and gets lost when he decides to get ambient. Groban seems intense in his beliefs, and credit him for not pandering, but, while he seems to love the sound of his own voice, the delivery remains soporific. My grade: C+"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very irritating music","review":"There are two bedrooms in my dorm, and in the bedroom next to mine, one of the two guys that lives there plays this CD constantly. I can't STAND it.I am not familiar with this style of music, (pop/opera/crying?) but I don't know why it exists. The most annoying song on this album is, without a doubt, \\"When You Say You Love Me\\". My dormmate sings along with this one, and I would literally go insane if I wasn't able to put on some headphones and drown out Mr. Groban with some quality music. Groban's crooning is simply a conveyance of overindulgence and false emotion.For truly emotional vocals (along with superb instrumentals), listen to Mick Jagger and Keith Richards on The Rolling Stones' 1972 masterpiece Exile On Main Street. If you demand the \\"opera\\" style of singing, I would suggest the earlier music of the band Queen. They were never as good as The Rolling Stones used to be, but Freddie Mercury's vocals are infinitely stronger than those of Josh Groban."},{"rating":"1","title":"I liked it better when...","review":"1.) I liked Josh Groban better when...It was done by Loreena McKennitt or Enya.2.) I liked \\"You Raise Me Up\\" better when...It was done by Selah. (It's too soon after Selah made it a hit for a remake to come out. Josh's version is exactly the same except with the third verse cut out.)The only song I can actually recommend is \\"Remember When It Rained.\\" He has a good voice but the songs are boring and done before. In a few years, he'll be the Michael Bolton or Kenny G of this decade."},{"rating":"1","title":"Josh Groban","review":"When Groban first appeared he was new and exciting.

He is one of the world's best singer and one of the most talented musician around. He just keeps getting better and better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ladies & Gentlemen, THE NEW MICHAEL BOLTON!","review":"I love all kinds of music (SEE MY OTHER REVIEWS for proof) This just has been released to annoy. And as another artist for Adult Contemporary radio stations to play to death.He may not sound like Bolton (no need to clear THIS throat) but he sings the same, sappy garbage. The previous reviewer who compares \\"You Raise Me Up\\" to Wind Beneath My Wings is dead on. I didnt realise it until i listened to it again.You Raise Me Up is one of those <sarcasm> sad tearjerker songs. Kind of like I'm Already There by Lonestar. Makes you want to weep in the cornflakes.Unless you are a panty throwing woman (or gay) you would be best to steer away from tripe like this. If you do like it, I recommend titles by Wilson Phillips, Air Supply, Kenny G and Yanni"},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE!!!!","review":"This Cd is just anoter typical piece of Josh Groban's garbage. There isn't any good unique or different about him unless you consider singing lame sappy songs in dead languages a good thing. There is nothing positive that is distinguishing about him. If you want good music you should listen to Measure of a Man by Clay Aiken, or even better his single Solitaire. In Solitaire, Clay sings with more power and color than Josh Groban has, and looking at his \\"progress\\" so far, ever will.

I know poor singing when I hear it. I have this CD, along with all his others and I am telling you to save your money and scrape your hands along a chalk board. It gives the same effect. You want a good vocal artist? try Barbara Streisand or Rod Stewart or even Cyndi Lauper. Now there is a voice! I have listened to Josh's new CD Closer about 25 or 26 times and I can't stand it. Oh sure I know all the songs by heart now, but oh what I wouldn't give to have my mind back."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Closer","review":"Out of 13 tracks there is only one song on the cd I recognized, you raise me up.

He looks like he belongs in a Gap commercial.There is some psychology happening here. Since Mr. Groban has a certain look, people will say that he has an excellent voice and that his singing is heartfelt.

Wise up, huh?"},{"rating":"1","title":"not good","review":"A voice with very little substance. I agree with all the others who question why is he so popular. Obviously by all the comments, there is a huge audience for this kind of stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"A beautiful voice wasted on this album","review":"A big disappointment!. This album is mostly Italian love songs (I guess that's what they are)and don't mean anything to this listener. He has a beautiful voice but it's wasted on this album. There are dozens of beautiful songs that would be even more beautiful if he preformed them instead of these rather abscure tunes. I'm talking about songs that were on his first album like \\"Vincent\\", \\"Jesu, joy of mans desiring\\", \\"The Prayer\\". I wasted my money on this album!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Closer /Josh Groban","review":"I loved Joshes first album, David Foster did him good.But this album I give 1 star. Because the music just dont clickfor Josh, his voice will be hard to place in the classical sideand the pop side of music. Josh should get Elton John's song writer to write some music for him. Broken Vow was the best on this recording. Leave Caruso up to Russell Watson."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sucks!!!","review":"The man has a good voice but the recording is awful! It sounds like he is lost somewhere in the orchrestra. Having listened to many recordings of well known artists I feel that whoever was in charge of this recording should go back to kindergarten and start all over. Anybody want to hear how it should be done I suggest that they buy a Russel Watson album. Now there are real fine recordings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Son of a... *mumble mumble*","review":"So I'm not the sort of person qualified to review this pile of... anyways, I'm getting off track. I only listened to five minutes of this and shut it off in pure embarrasment. I hope no one heard me listening to it, or I'd have to let them beat me with a rake. As for the CD. It's a pure exercise in sucking out any true emotion out of music, smearing it with cheez, then overprocessing it's corpse until it's just a metallically rendered monument to exactly WHY the music industry will eat itself.There was a reason this music became out of style in the first place. This isn't music. I don't know what this is. If you make crap smell like roses, it's still crap. Do yourself a favor, pick up music with some soul in it. You'll thank yourself later.

If you don't want to experience world class frustration you best buy and test this album at your local store."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!!!","review":"If you thought his first cd was great, you'll be blown away by this one. I love it when you can listen to an artist's different works and hear them mature and, as unbelievable as it sounds, Josh has. My favorite songs would have to be Oceano, My Confession, and Remember When It Rained. Josh has made his songs much more deep and I absolutely love it!

WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR GO BUY THIS CD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Crooner's voice voice is no comparison to Clay Aiken","review":"Josh Groban has been ofter compared to Clay Aiken. But the only similarity between the two singers is the fact that both sing ballads. Josh Groban's voice is rich in barritone. On the CD Closer Groban sings in Italian, Spanish, French, and English. He does an excelent job in singing in four diffrent languages. His voice is very strong and moving. The songs are very smooth and relazing. He is most definetly not an opera singer. Groban made and okay transition to pop."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much more than You Raise Me Up, His killer single. 4 stars.","review":"I don't think there are many more relaxing, and soothing CDs, that truly inspire and uplift the soul. He's not bad looking, but His voice is where it's at. It's never flat, it's always uplifting, and somewhat melancholy. Somewhat powerful. Not as powerful as Clay Aiken's, but He's much easier on the eyes than Clay.And let's be honest, has Clay put out a listen-able CD, EVER???! I rest my freakin' case. This CD is so good, that I even enjoyed the Spanish songs for the most part. And I'm not a fan of music that I don't understand much...!Hymne A L'Amour is very a very sexy track. LOL Can't believe I just said that. =PAnyway, it's rather enjoyable throughout.

This bag of musical gems includes all of TD's classic albums on the Dakar label between 1968 and 1975. I've kept this set in heavy rotation on my disc player.For those listeners that know of Tyrone's one-of-a kind singing voice only through the two big pop crossover hits- \\"Can I Change My Mind\\" & \\"Turn Back The Hands Of Time\\", there is in this 63 song set, much more of the great Chicago Soul sound & the underrated musicians from the Windy City that provided such a funky & mellow cushion for TD's vocal wizardry. Otis was called \\"Mr. Pitful\\", but we always called Tyrone Davis-the \\"Beggin' Man\\" because of his pleading style , which could never be called pitful(Exhibit A: \\"I Had It All The Time\\"-such 'masculine beggin' on this prime cut!). I missed seeing TD in concert by a week, since he'd taken ill the week before the show. R.I.P. Mr. Davis- You've left us a wealth of wonderful music to cherish."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Acid Jazz\\" as in ACID (LSD-25)","review":"Well, first of all, let's understand that Trane was tripping regularly in '65 and '66, reading The Tibetan Book of The Dead, reading Hindu and Zen Buddhist books and also reading Indian mystics...I forget the names off hand.So, he and his band went to Seattle and recorded this at the Penthouse and then the next day they went up to Lynnwood, WA and recorded \\"OM\\".It's really hard to call this \\"Jazz\\". It's just free/energy music with little structure, and most listeners will have absolutely no clue how to hear this.I give it 4 stars for the intensity and the energy but docked 1 star for the indulgence. The 60's \\"New Thing\\" was pretty crazy sometimes and people started tuning out Jazz because they simply couldn't \\"grok\\" this stuff. So, now, we have Jazz comprising less than 1% of all music recorded. I love Trane and Ornette and Cecil, but, truthfully, they helped put Jazz into the museum, if you know what I mean..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sonic Textures","review":"THis album is a prime example of free jazz. More textural than Coltrane's \\"Ascension\\" with the many bellowing horns. The presence of more of a soundscape, and layering is involved that creates spontaneous visual imagery.If you dig \\"Ascension,\\" \\"Kulu Se Mama,\\" or \\"Om\\" and the like, this is a treat.Not for the weak at heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coltrane Quartet great in spite of Sanders","review":"I bought the original 2LP set when it came out in 1971 or 1972 and was waiting to get the CD. It was great hearing Body and Soul and Afro Blue on this CD set. Coltrane is incredible. No matter what he is playing, it always works. I wish that I could say the same for Pharoah Sanders. He's not my taste at this stage in his career. I liked him later on his solo albums, but with Coltrane he's not at the same level musically as the rest of the quartet, in my opinion. Often, Coltrane creates a mood in his solo, only to have Sanders completely destroy it in his solo, in my opinion. I didn't think that Sanders was listening to what the rest of the quartet was playing. In spite of Sanders, the CD is still a must have as long as the Classic Coltrane Quartet is playing."},{"rating":"2","title":"good quality, rich matte gold color","review":"No complaints about the quality.

What interested me the most about this video was the combination of original film with elderly veterans giving a first person account of what they experienced at Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941. There is a third aspect to this DVD having to do with a modern underwater search for a sunken Japanese mini-sub. There were times that this story was somewhat interesting but mostly it interfered with the rest of the program. As I understand it, this search was the reason that the National Geographic took on this project. If so, I guess this documentary had to give that search SOME coverage. However, I would have preferred more of the interviews and the the original film of the attack and its' aftermath. History is presented well in \\"Pearl Harbor; Legacy of Attack\\" and it is aided by the excellent narration of Tom Brokaw. Overall I give this DVD a \\"4.5\\" but it could have been a \\"5\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pioneer Historian","review":"As a young college student, Francis Parkman, the later noted historian of the early West, goes to the land of the Lakotas and experiences their life.

About less than half of the tracks herehave some real spirit and fire but the rest fall flat and rely too heavily on the stereotypical airy, flowy, spiritually slow,mournful celtic airs. There's certainly a time and a place for that... just not on an album called FIRE in the Kitchen showinga spirited kitchen party on the cover. The decent tracks on here are from Leahy, La Bottine Souriant, Ashley MacIsaac (thoughnot as \\"firey\\" as he usually is) Great Big Sea (before they went mainstream pop) and Natalie MacMaster.

I washed it exactly as directed on the tag."},{"rating":"1","title":"AN OK READ AT BEST","review":"This was definetly not one of lisa kleypas' best books. Maybe it was that the lead characters were so boring and one-dimensional. We know that Julia Wentworth is a great actress but the book just dosen't tell you alot about her outside of her career. There also really never seemed to be any real feelings between the main characters. They seemed to be sexually attracted to each other at most. Damon Savage was also unreasonable and obsessive. I think it says alot about the story that the secondary character of logan scott(who came off as cold and a jerk)was the one you really wanted julia to end up with. The author should know that you're never supposed to make the secondary male character outshine the hero."},{"rating":"2","title":"Somewhere I'll Find You is a 'rare find'!","review":"Totally engrossing. A 'one sititng' read. Normally, I'm a historical romance reader, however, this one by Lisa Kleypas had me captivated. Though totally not original, the writer keeps the readers engrossed with the pain, anguish and resentment the characters feel for their situation. However, both are strong willed, independent, and determined to battle to the end to have their way, in other words, a typical romance novel written well enough to be 'oh so entertaining'. If you're a thespian, you'll love 'Somewhere I'll find you', if you're a hopeless romantic, you'll love 'Somewhere I'll Find You', and if you're a historical buff like myself, read and enjoy it for the change and variety!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely not her best","review":"This is not one of M. Kleypas' best. Trite plotlines, simplistic writing and shallow characters come across as a first-time author. I had a lot of issues with this story. To name a few. She explains why the characters feel a certain way instead of conveying the emotions through the story. The female lead is ridiculous. The idea that British society at that time would blithely accept a \\"Duchess\\" - of the highest peerage! - entertaining the lower classes on the stage is too far-fetched. (The cultural responsibilities of a Duchess went far beyond simply being concerned over snide comments about her possible affairs.) The whole idea of them rebelling so strongly against an arranged marriage - no matter their ages - is a bit off mark as well. Arranged marriages were still the norm in the upper aristocracy. there are so many irritants in this book. I was dissapointed. Save your money and go for a different Kleypas - or get Stephanie Laurens' Devil's Bride."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good","review":"I didn't care for this book at all... the writing was poor, the characters were not well developed at all. It was SO predictable, you can see the scene coming a mile away. Again, the character development was very poor. Also, the writing was too modern for the time period...if you removed the references to oil lamps and horses and carriages, this could have been a contemporary romance. Just finished reading the Outlander Series, and this doesn't even come within the same League."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Read","review":"I enjoyed this book. The heroine was strong and knew her mind. The hero was strong but not afraid to show his soft side. It was nice to see the main characters fall in love slowly and take their time in developing a stronger relationship."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent book","review":"This is my first book for Lisa Kleypas and I loved it, even though I liked it much more when I read it a second time.

I am an actress, so I was very much looking forward to reading this one. But I just didn't find the chemistry between Julia and Damon all that exciting. And about halfway through, the book started to become entirely too long. Or was this because I was reading it in an airport? Who knows?I've read the sequel, BECAUSE YOU'RE MINE, which I thought was much better. I found Logan to be a much more interesting hero."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lisa Kleypas is a National Treasure","review":"Lisa Kleypas writes a mighty fine romance novel. We readers owe her for our many hours of pure reading bliss.Again, Ms. Kleypas has penned a perfect romance novel: \\"Somewhere I'll Find You\\" is flawless.I loved the story of the theatre and I was excited to find out about Julia's life and where she came from. Ms. Kleypas creates characters who seem real, yet who are also fascinating. That's a difficult task for a romance writer, but Ms. Kleypas has no problem giving us characters that come alive on the page, yet who also seem like people who could have actually existed.The book is also very sensual, yet tasteful ... you'll enjoy it.Don't cheat yourself! Buy this book and you'll read it all in one night!"},{"rating":"2","title":"First romance book","review":"I really enjoyed this book!

But this story fell short for me. Considering once they discovered they liked each other and had passion, why did she keep denying it? Kind of found her constant denial irritating. Considering she was a blue-blooded female, I can't image her preferring the life in the theater to a handsome rich husband and children. Story seemed to drag on and on about people, places and things that were of no interest to the story. Skip it."},{"rating":"2","title":"WONDERFUL!!!","review":"Wow, I LOVE this book!!! The first book I read by Lisa Kleypas was \\"Stranger in My Arms\\" and I didn't like it at all. However, this book was definitely AMAZING! I didn't know that Kleypas could write like this.

The story dragged on and on...and the characters were not at all likeable...it got to the point where I didnt even care what happened to them..I just wanted it to end..I adore Ms. Kleypas, but \\"Somewhere I'll Find You\\" is definitely NOT a story that I would recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"A definite turkey","review":"I usually love Kleypas, but this novel was a big disappointment (the sequel, Because You're Mine, is not much better).

Damon \\"Savage\\"(is that really his last name*rolling eyes*) was your typical, over possesive alpha male with no depth that I'm honestly getting tired of reading about over and over again.

The protagonist Father Jean Latour must combat his desire for companionship and esteem as he establishes a diocese in the midst of a barren and desolate landscape.

Seemingly they pay no emotional attention to others beyond themselves. What efforts/miracles/gifts they encounter they simply assume this is to be expected. I found it replusive to read about these Characters. On a mission for God, but so much missing the point of morality and respect for one another. I felt like it was a lesson for us all to try and be more respectful of not only others but what they have to say and believe in. The novel is not gripping like a Clancy, but it does have an elusive thought process and meaning underneath the surface."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"Willa Cather sacreligiously portrays the father as some sort of hero because he is baptising and converting all the mexicans. Personally, i think this is disrespectful of all people's beliefs besides Christians. The descriptions are so boring and meandering, it is difficult to follow the paths of the characters. This book would have been better had it been reduced to about 30 pages, and written without these descriptions. I will never read this kind of drivel again."},{"rating":"1","title":"The book was long boring, and without a solid plot","review":"I was forced to read this book for summer reading.

Instead, I merely advise to anyone who plans on purchasing this book to purchase a different copy. This particular edition is poor in two ways.1. The only information the book offers other than the text itself is the publisher and date (Cassia Press, 2009) and that it was printed on 23 December 2009 in Lexington, KY. It fails even to give the year it was originally printed.2. More significantly, almost every single sentence in this edition has a typo where a space is omitted. The first two sentences of the prologue, for example, read: \\"One summer evening in the year 1848, three Cardinals and amissionary Bishop from America were dining together in the gardensof a villa in the Sabine hills, overlooking Rome.

The landscape itself has the richest characterization. She has crafted her prose in such a way as to give the land its own vitality and presence. If you like landscape art; if you stop at Scenic Overlooks on the highway; if you ever like to walk in the woods, the hills--just because--read this novel.Archbishop Latour, a Frenchman, has taken on the missionary work of creating a diocese in New Mexico Territory in the 1850's. Throughout his life's ministry, he encounters rogues, blackguards, ragmuffins, scalliwags, and ruthless soldiers, and then some simple saints, some lasting friends, and finally, death. When death finally does come, it brings his own peace, the restitution of justice.Cather writes lugubriously, moving from one anecdotal story to the next. But it is all against the backdrop of the land; when she is finished, the tapestry of the whole appears.Nice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Death Comes For the Archbishop: unreadable","review":"Although it was published in February 2010 (Cassia Press), it was unreadable as every tenth (or so) word was run together with the next.

My Antonia is one of my all time favorites and O Pioneers right up there. This was a major disppointment. The characters (2) were not developed nearly as well as the characters in Cather's other books. The characters make the Ms Cather's other works. The Archbishop particularly is never filled out. I found him very unsympathic. I enjoyed his Vicar and wished there was more of him. In fact at one point I thought it would be a much better book had he been the primary charcacter.As I neared the end of the book I came to this site to see if there was any historical basis to the book. At first I was pleased to learn that it is based upon the lives of these two characters. Then I became disappointed again. As a history or biography it is truly lacking.I find it hard to classify this as a \\"classic\\".

Others are \\"No Other Life\\" by the same author, \\"The Power and the Glory\\" bu Graham Greene; even \\"Monsignor Quixote\\" by Graham Greene exhibits more emotion than this flat tale.Perhaps, if you're not Catholic, want an overly scrubbed version of life on the frontier, and don't care about passion in the books you read; this'll do the trick.Willa Cather is a superios sytlist, however.

Peggy Ddana is a product of the Pittsburgh slums, with all the problems of survival endured in that environment.

Her hosts, Martin and Doris Ellen, are black. Peggy is a tall, blond, white young girl. The year is 1971. Desegregation is a work in progress. The subtleties of bias that speak to all of us are beatutifully woven through the story with a light hand and a strong message. The author has done herself proud. The maturing of Peggy and her introduction to relationships takes her thru the gamut of emotions and we watch her develop, with the help of the wise and understanding Ellens. This book has many layers of complex issues that surprise and elate. This is a must read for all ages.

Each song may consist of anywhere between four and eight riffs that contain various drum rythms over them. While most of the riffs are fairly basic in composition, the speed at which they are played is nothing but satisfying. Many of the riffs will start with a \\"basic blast-beat,\\" then to a \\"fast blast-beat\\" then to a final round of pummeling double bass. Each guitar riff is very clear and distinguishable, making it a fun album to play your guitar to. Many of the songs have those \\"minor- third\\" riffs,(5th to 8th fret type stuff/cannibal corpse sound) with the guitars tuned to D. The clear production adds to the easy \\"comprehension\\" of what this band is playing.

I've always been faciniated by stories that involve the idea of reincarnation and past lives. Especially the idea that we have one soul mate that will be with us in other lives, through out all time. This is only the second book I've read that involves this idea. I think it is the most romantic concept ever concieved, and Lisa Kleypas does a wonderful job of turning this concept into an engrosing book.

He is a super bad boy. All of the bad stuff he did I was okay with, until he cheated and that was a turn off. That, in my opinion, crosses the line and true trust can never be again.I read Because You're Mine (I have read this book twice and I very rarely ever read a book twice.) and I fell in love with Lisa's writing.

An avid Kleypas fan, I was eagerly anticipating this novel, but found it hard to wade through, follow, and got completely confused during the flashback section.

I have to agree with some of the previous comments about both characters. There was nothing likeable about either one. He was too everything to show any sort of vulnerability. She was too prissy to root for. I read about halfway through this book and decided to reread \\"Someone To Watch Over Me.\\" I have read all of Kleypas' work and I feel she is hit and miss with many of her books. I usually really love the book or hate it with a passion. Unfortunately this falls into the latter category. I recommend \\"Dreaming of You,\\" \\"Someone To Watch Over Me, and \\"Somewhere I Will Find You.\\" Her first two - \\"Where Passion Leads\\" and \\"Forever My Love\\" are also quite good. Her other books fall into the so so or blah category."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I own all of Lisa Kleypas books and this one was the last one I purchased. I was actually looking forward to reading this. However,was extremely disappointed. I have to agree with some of the reviews that the dream and sudden turn-around in Nikki's behaviour were strange. Does he ever really love Emma or is it Emalia? His behaviour towards Emma and his son prior to the dream was disturbing to say the least. I had great expectations when I started reading the book but had great difficulty finishing it. These two books with the Russian characters were without a doubt my least favorite ones of all her books.That said I think Lisa Kleypas is a very talented writer and I truly enjoy her work.

It was a great price but the shipping and handling was expense to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Non exchange of defective product","review":"I received the product [ OWL LITE ]and found the light that makes the magnifier an \\"OWL LIGHT\\" was inoperative. I sent an email to retailer. Their comment was to ask if twisting the card helped [ they were very familiar with the product ] and of course it did not work and why should you twist a credit card light when it was made to use with one hand ?????I sent the product back and it was refused by the retailer.I am now familiar with this particular product and after trying several at a nearby retailer, found they ALL did not light.POOR PRODUCT. POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality Don't waste the money.","review":"This is a product to pass up. The light activation button is difficult to use. It slides out of position where it won't activate the light. When you do get it aligned it doesn't illuminate consistently. It flickers on and off making it annoying to use. It is compact but the annoyances are not worth the money. Spend you money on something more reliable like a keychain LED light."},{"rating":"1","title":"None of 4 units worked","review":"A product that does not work.I ordered two of these. Neither worked when they arrived.The company sent me two more as replacements. Neither of these worked either.You're supposed to press the button to make the light come on. None of the 4 did. They were all from China. Must not have any quality assurance program."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this item!","review":"I bought three of these for friends and NONE work. The light worked for about 10 seconds on one. Then when we pressed the light button again (gently I might add), it made a clicking noise and the light no longer worked. The other two were duds right out of the package. Excess packaging too! (If the website would let me give this item NO STARS, I would have chosen that option)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Junky :8^(","review":"Too tacky--not worth it. The led is too small to truely illuminate and it is not focused on the area being illuminated. I, too, thought I was going to recieve a pair of them but did not. The magnifier works fine, but you can get a thinner card to do that for less cost. I also bought the \\"Fulcrum LED 2-Pack Card Magnifiers\\" which is a little over 1/4 inch thick but works, is lightweight, and contained 2 of them, as advertised."},{"rating":"1","title":"Owl lite","review":"I purchased the owl lite from ads I saw on TV. It is advertised as credit card sized, but that is misleading. It is in fact the shape of a creidt card, but it has the thickness of three credit cards stacked. That is too large for my wallet. It works as advertised so I may throw one in my gym or computer bag, but i can't put it in my wallet which is what I wanted."},{"rating":"2","title":"<3","review":"I must say that I have not laughed so much for a long time!

Her voice, the music, the production values, and everthing else about this recording are terrible, except of course the songs themselves. Tom Waits is one of the all time best songwriters in the entire history of music and Holly Cole should be ashamed of herself for mutilating so many of his classics. I can't believe so many people on this site have praised this album - they must have never heard any of the originals. Do yourself a favor and buy absolutely any Tom Waits album you can find instead of this."},{"rating":"2","title":"EAR CANDY!!!!","review":"Holly Cole has some outstanding reviews in the audio press and listening to this CD one understands why. This is one superb recording. If your audio system is High End this performer is palpably real, right in front of you. The acoustic Bass will test the low end of any system. The harmonica riffs by Howard Levy will send chills up your spine. Ms. Cole's cover of Tom Waits material is a compliment to this fantastic songwriter. If you are lucky enough to own \\"Tube\\" audio equipment, buy this CD. If you are a sound fanatic, get the import. Reference sound!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Recorded Darkness","review":"This CD is so well recorded that I had to buy an entire new stereo just to hear the hidden details. Multi-layered pure jazz ballads cleaned up or expressed in a different light than Tom Watt's originals, this is a great CD. Holy Cole sings more smokey than ever, acting out rather than plain singing the songs. The main highlight is the bass player, who taps & spins his bass almost like a drum. Added playing adds extra findings. This is Holy Cole's pinnacle of jazz after this CD she \\"Pop\\"s down to mere rock star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tom Waits Must Shudder","review":"I have been a huge fan of Tom Waits (and jazz) for over 30 years and after hearing \\"Little Boy Blue\\" on the radio I thought this might be worth a listen. It is definately not! I gave it 1 star because I don't think they count 0 stars. We're in negative star territory here. If this isn't the most insipid, uninspired and worthless interpretaion of a great artist's work I sure don't want to hear what is. Putting this soft and syrupy spin on Wait's gritty, earthy, seamy side of life work is like (for once decent words fail me)."},{"rating":"1","title":"A poor Tom Waits","review":"This album is 100% Tom Waits songs; however, you would never know it since you'd need an excellent pair of glasses to have known. Tom sings the songs so much better. Some might call Cole's rendition Jazz. How poor, and how boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"I have owned Don't Smoke in Bed for 12 years. When I wore the cassette out I replaced it with a cd. I really love the simplicity and earthiness of Holly Cole's voice. Because I liked EVERY song on the other album, I bought this without first listening to it; as a result, I was sadly dissapointed. I would have rated it lower, but there are a couple good songs on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality voice","review":"Next to Cassandra Wilson and Patricia Barber, Holly Cole is one of these singers that have changed the outlook of jazz. Like Cassandra Wilson she started with traditional jazz, which nowadays is still performed by singers like Diana Krall or Jane Monheit (listen to her CD Never Neverland). As Patricia Barber mixes oriental influences with her music, Holly Cole adapts countrymusic (The Heart Of Saturday Night) and traditional ballads (The Briar And the Rose) to make them sound as if she had just invented the genre. Of course this is not the case; the trick she plays is to slow down the rhythm of the original, stretching it almost to bring it to a standstill, thus allowing her voice to attract the center of attention. Sometimes this procedure results in singing as children do, sweet and innocent, a bit predictable and often just slightly off key.But all this is nitpicking; her performance is one of pure quality and if you have decent Hi-fi-equipment you will thoroughly enjoy this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"I have owned this CD for several years. I sat down last night and listened to it again - I am still amazed. This is a great album. Dim the lights, play it on a GOOD system and then sit back and enjoy. You will be amazed at the layers of sound and the soundstage. You can feel the presence of the musicians and the sound is almost 3D. Holly's voice just draws you in. One of my very favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Cute","review":"I bought this poster and a few others for my sister in law 40th 80's bday bash.The poster is super cute, now my niece has it hanging in her room. The reason I gave it a 4 and not a 5 is because I wish I would have read what size this poster is. It was very small like 1 foot by 2 feet and for the cost it was pretty expensive. For a larger poster I would have been more okay with spending more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good quality.","review":"I was very disappointed in the quality of this chain...basically it doesn't look at all like real gold, it looks totally fake! I returned it since I expected something better, only to then find out that the gift certificate I used on the order was not valid any more and could not be used for another purchase. And had to pay for the shipping back too! So definitely won't be buying jewelry again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disagree","review":"All you have to do is check the gram weight to see that this will not be a heavy chain. For the money it is a good buy and is a good chain to hang pendants on if the 18\\" is too short. If you want big and bold then this isn't it-but if you want a chain to change off lengths on different pendants you own this is the one for you.

Unfortunately, this novel went overboard with the darkness. It included suicide, Alheimer's, alcoholism, and dark medical secrets of the past.That said, the parts set in the past were compelling. The author made wonderful use of flashbacks. If the present-day segments had been as good, and if the hero and heroine had been more likeable, I would have liked this book a lot more.

I used it for awhile before uninstalling it and using the free PSE I got with my camera (after that got an upgrade for it as well).I think quite honestly that you'd be better off investing in a REAL editing program, you'd be much more pleased with it once you learned to use it properly.While using this program, its easy to use, I give it that much. But colors don't come out accurately which makes the prints look bad. The light and contrast is hard to get just right as well since its preset options. I remember it being a few things I liked on it but not enough to keep it as an addition, moving files between photo explosion and PSE makes it a lesser file which usually means lesser quality product in the end.So if you're a beginner and need something to just play with, this probably will work for you.

Just listen to Seraphic Light or Stellar Regions! John Coltrane's playing is sweet, not angry. And Alice provides the perfect, colorful backdrop for him. Rashied Ali too plays with remarkable restraint as well.There are a few moments (Tranesonic) where your eardrums will explode, but on a whole, Stellar Regions is quite calm and meditative. Don't be fooled by the closed minded fools who wrote in with 1 or 2 stars just because the album sounds different. Sure, you won't be snapping your fingers or tapping your feet... in fact, you'll have trouble sometimes identifying any sort of traditional rhythms. But music doesn't always have to adhere to the traditional, white, european rules to be good. Be adventurous. Get the album."},{"rating":"2","title":"The last thing he recorded before he died....","review":"A must for anyone who is a Coltrane believer. This is the last set he recorded shortly before he died. He took the master tapes home after the session and they have been hidden ever since. His wife, Alice, allowed them to be issued. He was metamorhisizng into a new consciousness and this sound is unlike anything he had recorded before. I bought it two weeks ago, listened to it and haven't been able to listen to it again yet. It's too powerful. Even this long after his death, he is still the heavyweight champion."},{"rating":"2","title":"STELLAR REGIONS: worthwhile","review":"Stellar Regions is a very cool collection of studio outtakes from the later years of Coltrane's life. the playing is great and it's wonderful to hear his exploration of so many new ideas. it's a marvel to think of how further developed these songs might have become if Coltrane had lived longer. i'm glad that this was released to the public because it stands as a fascinating audio document to one of the greatest musical minds the world has ever known. i'd recommend this to experienced fans of John Coltrane, not to those who are just beginning their search through his vast back catalogue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not For Everyone","review":"I recently borrowed this CD from my local library. Whereas, Mr. Coltrane is a very talented saxaphone player, the songs(and I use that term extremely loosely here) are not very memorable to say the least. I can not understand for the life of me how one of the editorial comments can say that this work is focused. So many of tracks just fly off on wild instrumental breaks that you really wonder the mental state of Mr. Coltrane at the time. Iris and Stellar Regions are probably the most memorable tracks on this release. The keyboard work on these particular tracks nicely compliments some of Coltrane's saxaphone soloing. However, there are times when the sounds from Mr. Coltrane are so disonant that it sounds like he is murdering the instrument. This is mostly for completists and die hard fans of this man."},{"rating":"2","title":"An intriguing very-late Trane performance","review":"As you may have guessed from the other reviews, no, Coltranes late work is not very accesible. If you liked \\"Giant steps\\" and \\"A love supreme\\", and are expecting more of the same, forget it. This bears more resemblence to Ornette Colemans work.The music is quite dissonant, with Coltrane bending notes out of tune and shrieking for expressive purposes. However, there is not as much shear \\"loudness\\" as there is on recordings such as \\"meditations\\" (where Sanders loudly honks through the album).Jazz newbies are well advised to start from the early recordings and work their way up to this. On the other hand, Coltrane fans who've heard the late classic quartet material in the Impulse! box set (such as \\"First Meditations\\") and would like to explore more of Tranes experiments in free jazz will find this interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Late Coltrane of a poor standard","review":"I found this CD to be one of the least impressive ever by the great tenor John Coltrane. This reissue finds him in the studio not long prior to his death. The songs are of a solid standard, however Coltrane's screaming and screeching at the higher pitches is disruptive and quite simply non-musical. Alice Coltrane on piano however is breath of fresh air, backing the sax work quite brilliantly. The drumming and bass work is also quite advanced. Prehaps I have been a little hard on Coltrane's performance here judging upon other reviews. However the two stars remain and I issue a sincere warning to the casual jazz listener."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Don't Think So","review":"I would not recomend this album unless you are a completist.

How open, interesting, generous, complicated, funny, sweet, tender and amusing their relationship really was. It is a great read and if you are lucky to read the letters of Virginia Woolf (another great book, the letters of VW between 1925-1930), you get the whole view of what was going on between them.

Her new one, What I Deserve, is just incredible, but this album seems to me to be a bit more fun. Some really great real country (none of that top 40 country that most of us are so familiar with). One of her finest works, \\"Whatever Way the Wind Blows,\\" is on this album, and that song alone is worth the price of admission. The album is out of print, so buy it! You will not find it in stores anywhere. Trust me, it's great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Alt Country Music","review":"This is country music that is full of life, modern, and as far away from Nashville commercialism as you can get. Kelly Willis' voice is both alluring and twangy at the same time, her remake of \\"Heaven Is Just A Sin Away\\"-is as good as the original. However, the rest of the songs on this album are equally great. The melodies range from ballads to honky tonks that will have you going past the speed limit if you listen while driving. Overall, most highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Product is beautiful","review":"This product was shipped to me after it had been open and possibly used.

The album version gives way to the excesses of the day with bleating, screaming and overblowing segments that serve only to break the infectious groove of the song. The second track is basically filler."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long song worth the over half an hour","review":"I agree with almost everything said in the other 5 star reviews, so I will not repeat it.

With every listen it gets better. Not for the faint-hearted, or those who like more 'conventional' jazz."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant book:","review":"If ever there were the opportunity to grasp the scope, meaning and lessons of history, The Chronicle affords the conscientious reader that opportunity. Despite divisive passions and ideologies, humankind's search for their own identity and concept of justice finds expression and definition here. In Dr. King's vivid and incisive description of our resourcefulness, creativity and developing humanity, we awaken to a transhistorical sense of universal human destiny. The Chronicle not only provides acute analyses of humankind's collective conscience, it shows humanity's capacity for intelligent survival across the millennia. To read The Chronicle is to assimilate the significance of history through the matured insights of a true historian."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst tasting DGL there is","review":"I have used DGL throughout the years with great success. DGL is a wonderful remedy for acid problems with the stomach. I purchased this brand of DGL thinking all DGL products are the same. So I did not read the ingredients. But Planetary Herbals puts orange flavoring into their formula of DGL. Which makes the taste absolutely horrible. I chewed one tablet and just about lost my cookies.

My Vicks Humidifier is a must but the water causes the filer to build up with what is probably a colorful mixture of minerals. So far this is my analysis. It does seem to slow down the filter calcification that I used to scrape almost weekly. But that unnecessary pink dye makes this product to where you must handle it as if it were bleach. It stains everything including the machine its used in. I accidentally knocked the bottle over resulting in a hard time cleaning a difficult stain on my carpet and not much had spilled. Ill use this up but most likely will never buy it again because of the dye. Instead I'll search for another product with the same active ingredients but clear in color. The spill was my fault 100% but I can't imagine what's in there that made the color settle so quickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"CLR is 10 times more effective","review":"This has not stopped lime build up at all in my humidifier.

I usually use a plastic bag left over from grocery shopping, but sometimes those leak and the trash doesn't stay secured in the bag. Anyway, this is nice because it's weighted (it comes with a weighted bean bag you zip into the bottom), and there's velcro on the bottom of the bag for those of you who have carpeted mats in your car. The bag is lined with a waterproof/plastic liner so you don't have to worry about nasty old stuff dripping into your car. The cover for the bag is held shut with velcro, and it's pretty sturdy. I would suggest putting a little liner in the bag so you don't have to worry about sanitizing or cleaning the bag, depending on what type of waste you're putting in there.I would definitely recommend this product to others, I'm a clean person and I like my car to stay clean too. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for what it is.","review":"For the price, you can't go wrong. However, the \\"XL\\" designation gives the impression that this is larger than it is. Its is not very big, but can hold maybe a six pack of empty cans, a fast food back, and a few napkins. It serves its purpose well, as long as you don't mind emptying it out once a week.I'm glad they included the weight, as it would otherwise have a tendency to topple over. While that's happened once or twice for me now over the course of a few months, I had it loaded up with top-heavy materials. Wouldn't have minded just a little more weight, though.For reference, this fits perfectly in a 2012 GMC Sierra between the console and the middle of the bench seat.In short, I would purchase this item again without any hesitation---and be happy about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very sturdy...","review":"I got this for the back seat of our truck for the kids to use.

Other than that, really nice product for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's 6.5 x 10 x 9 inches","review":"Given the \\"XL\\" in the title and the product photo, you may think that this bag is a lot bigger than it is, which a lot of other reviews have mentioned. It is just about exactly as big as the product information section indicates: 6.5 x 10 x 9 inches. If your expectations are in line with those dimensions, I think you'll be pleased.I have one of these in our Honda CR-V, and I think it's great. It gives us a central location to dump everything instead of leaving trash everywhere. It also will contain a fair amount of liquid, if for instance, a top for a soda cup pops off while in the bag. It does exactly what it needs to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good","review":"I've tried a few different trash bins for my new car. This one is pretty good.Pros:- sand bag that can go in the bottom to anchor it down- pocket in the front- fairly spacious- the right size for grocery bags as linersCons- sides don't stand up as well as it says- lid/cover is heavy and can cause the sides to sag inward even more- sandbag is oddly shaped and when it's inside the bottom of the bin it causes the base to be uneven"},{"rating":"1","title":"I wasted my money","review":"The bos does not stay standing up (as many reviews reported it).

I bought it for two daughters as well as myself, and they were underwhelmed. It is good if you tend to toss wet trash in a waste recepticle and don't want leakage, but beyond that it is not worth the price.

When the DJ did not announce the singer's name after the song was over, I called the station and found out that it was Johnny Hartman singing ,\\"Joey, Joey, Joey\\" from Frank Loesser's \\"Most Happy Fella\\". I immediately went out and bought the album and it has remained one of my favorites to this day. His baritone is so smooth and the arrangements are wonderful. I started to write Mr. Hartman a fan letter, but I learned that sadly, he had died rather young of lung cancer. Singers like Billy Eckstine got a lot more fanfare at one time( I am a fan of his, too), but Hartman's voice just stays with you. I really felt vindicated in my admiration when I read in Ella Fitzgerald's obituary that he had been her favorite singer! Can't get much more of a recommmendation than that, and you can't go wrong with any of his albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"*THE* most sensual recording EVER - his very best!","review":"Johnny Hartman was finally made famous by Clint Eastwood (thank you!).

Absolutely!!!\\"A Slow Hot Wind\\" is more than enough reason by itself to purchase this recording and rave about it to every human being you meet for the next 50 years.This alblum is full of delightful, loving ballads that are guaranteed to melt your socks! In addition to \\"A Slow Hot Wind\\", my favorite cuts are \\"My Ship\\" and \\"Waltz for Debbie\\". Starting with Hank Jones, the studio band has some of the best New York cats available in 1965.

This edition needs serious attention!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the most poignant of ancient histories","review":"Certainly much of the histories from Josephus have been criticized as self-serving. Some of that slant may be based in a misunderstanding of the times where acknowledgement of personal accomplishments was not viewed with the same distrust it is in our time. So whether the telling seems self-serving or not, the pathos and detail that Josephus brings to this telling brings the tale to life and puts us in the midst of the deprivation of ancient insurgency war. Love or hate Josephus, we are forced to acknowledge his gift for communicating the realities of politics and war around the ancient Mediterranean.A point must be made as well to commend Charlton Griffin's wonderful performance in the audio version of this book. It will be one worth listening to again and again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rambles","review":"Let me preface by saying I'm new to Buddhism. I found this book often hard to follow. The author seems to go on tangents and often does not expound on her thinking. She will start with one analogy and jump to another and then end with talking about something different. This is probably because these were talks given by the author. Talks sometimes don't transcribe well to written words, which is the case here. Take, for example the passage \\"True Suffering and False Suffering.\\" The authors starts by telling a story about her friend, then she moves on to a friend giving her an article about suffering, then on to Shakespeare, then to a Sufi story, all in just a few pages. This may work well as a talk, but in a book this is just painful to follow ramblings.There does seem to be interesting philosophical points that the author makes, but it's beneath a sea of (sorry to say) garbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Response to steve_kap8","review":"In a nutshell, Zen is meaningless without meditation.

It's author has fundamental misunderstandings regarding mind/body/spirit, and yet approaches the subject as though she has the truth in hand. The approach feels oddly like an elementary school teacher leading her students to the blessed truth. I don't know; it's just...too dogmatic, and from time to time there are concepts presented which will make you (as an intelligent reader) WINCE! I mean, actually WINCE! It's soooo poor, that I THREW it away rather than leave it for another reader to stumble upon at my local coffeehouse. Save your money.

Undecipherble koans and austere living habits. This is a book that explains the essence of zen and how it is applicable to everyday life. It's really nothing more than \\"mindfulness\\" and the conscientious performance of the most trivial of daily acts. Charlotte Beck was instrumental in bringing zen out of it's foreign and exotic context and explaining it's true meaning to the american novice. These are informal talks given during the sesshins (meditation weekends) she conducted in various retreats throughout the world. They touch upon all aspects of life and are illuminating at times."},{"rating":"2","title":"very nice","review":"I've read a bunch of books on Zen and on other lineages, and looked through a bunch more, and this is really the one that has spoken to me the most, by far. It's specific, wise, relevant, and somehow just generally brings things home in a way that others don't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple, direct, unadorned truth","review":"Joko Beck's thesis is a simple one: That life, just as it is at any moment, is all that it can be and therefore is perfect. Pointing again and again to the troubles we cause ourselves by living life not in the moment, but out of a confused fog of fantasies and \\"what ifs,\\" Beck challenges us to divest ourselves of our mental defense mechanisms and dare to be OK with life as it is. Yet she is a compassionate teacher, intimately familiar with human weaknesses and struggles, and she extends one hand of comfort even as the other hand pulls the rug out from under our feet. Perhaps the only shortcoming of this book is that it is much more clear about the \\"deconstructive\\" aspect of Zen practice than about exploring the ultimate manifestations and benefits of enlightenment. Knowing her aversion to \\"holding out cookies,\\" however, this absence is understandable."},{"rating":"2","title":"On a withered tree, a flower blooms","review":"Good book by a real practitioner. It lightly touches every significant aspect of life. Very easy read. It also explains what Zen practice is and what isn't. There are too many books on as quazi-buddhism, unnecessarily complicating Zen with self-invented garbage. Zen is simply about being.It is written in simple language and may be read by anyone. Everyone is a beginner in Zen, anyway.Most importantly, the author does not present her writings as the absolute truth. Zen is about questioning, and Beck repeats it over and over again.If anything, the book requires an open mind. As it is said, \\"On a withered tree, a flower blooms\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Readable and Practical","review":"I bought this book for discussion with our group at the local Zen center in Delaware.

Unfortunately, I found that the tone of the talks lacked compassion and understanding for the complexity of the world. Thicht Nacht Han tells us not to create us/them dualities, but this book is replete with them. Further, the book overwhelmingly emphasizes the importance of sitting, but *ignores* the importance of everyday ethical practice in providing the groundwork for a joyful life of awareness. I find that it did not provide much help for ordinary people trying to deepen the practice of their everyday lives. Perhaps this is a problem with Zen Buddhism in general. A much better book is Sharon Salzberg's \\"Lovingkindness\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good in Small Bites","review":"A friend who is very involved in Zen suggested this would be a good introductory book for me (along with Joko Beck's Nothing Special). I found myself having to read this in small bites and then taking the time to reflect in order to get a meaningful read. The format is a lecture by Joko Beck followed by a Q/A with students - this was very helpful. Ideas and cocepts were discussed with an underlying assumption that the reader had some baseline knowledge of Zen. I didn't, but still felt I got a lot out of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written and simplistic","review":"I was looking forward to reading this book but after the first 60 pages my patience wore thin and I had to put it down.

If you want to use non pod coffee in your senseo this is the easiest way to do it.The key to using this product is to compress the grounds as much as possible in the coffee holder. You need to compress them in the same way you would in an expresso machine. If you do not compress them you will get watery coffee, you would have the same experience with some expresso machines.What would make this 5 stars would be if the manufacturer provided a better tool to compress the grounds, I use the bottom of a Tylenol bottom which fits perfectly into the coffee holder. Highly recommended!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute junk","review":"I really wanted to like this. I followed all instructions and comments posted, but all this did was make brown water. Plus, it doesn't necessarily stop the Senseo at 8 oz. I switched to the EcoPad which makes real coffee."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Idea, Just Not Very Functional","review":"I bought a Senseo to enjoy a good bold cup of coffee. The unfortunate side effect is that one has to buy 18 pods a week at $5 a pop. So I thought I would try the Presto MyPod to help save a few dollars, and be able to use the machine that I liked. The concept is a great idea. Presto just didn't get it right. I'm not sure what the answer is, but the bottom line is that this product produces weak coffee with a lot more hassle than the Senseo should have. The instructions are full of disclaimers about the type of coffee, how you have to stand by the machine to make sure it doesn't overflow, etc. It's like Presto knew this wasn't going to be a great product, but put it on the shelves anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work","review":"I bought think, thinking I can use my own coffee, and the attachment does not fit in the Senseo.

So no one really needs a \\"podmaker\\" of any kind.However, if you INSIST upon making your own pods, there's a MACHINE on the market for $70 that works amazingly well. I'm not sure I'd spend $70 bucks on an \\"accessory\\" for a $60 product. But I have seen one, and it's very well-designed. Amazon doesn't sell it. It's called \\"The Gourmet Pod Maker.\\" Google it..."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great concept, but not a great product","review":"We purchased this item and thought it would be a wonderful idea. Unfortunately it did not work very well. It did not provide a 'foamy' cup of coffee like the pods did, thus the coffee lacks a quality that the foaming offers. Also the item lodged in the Senseo Machine and the machine had to be opened with a screwdriver and pliers. Fortunately it did not ruin the Senseo machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!","review":"The Senseo did not even seem to recognize the MyPod in the holder. When I brewed the coffee, the unit did not shut off and what was supposed to be a great morning wakeup, turned into a huge mess of boiling hot water and coffee grounds.Thinking I did something wrong, I cleaned up and tried again (when my blood pressure dropped!) and had just about the same result.I'm just glad I only bought this on clearance at WMart, and didnt pay full price for it.

Very disappointing. We've tried it with three different types of coffee and none of us like it. Too difficult to get a full strength cup of coffee. Not enough resistance for the water.

Buying a Perfect Pod and hoping it's better. Expensive experiment so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product, IF you don't mind the clean-up mess","review":"I stumbled upon this at Wal-Mart. It works great in my Black & Decker coffee maker. I have found pre-made pods way too weak even if doubled and they're costly, esp if you double them! I was so pleased to be able to brew a cuppa strong French roast BUT - BUT - BUT it's a huge PITA cleaning out the pod maker. I have yet to be able to do it without having to sweep coffee grounds off the floor. I dunno. Maybe I'm just a klutz with it.Six of one, half-dozen of the other. I put up with the messy clean-up to have a fresh, strong cuppa joe - for now anyway. :-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Uses too much coffee for a single cup","review":"The directions for its use are unclear since it doesnt state whether you use the single cup button on the Senseo or the double cup button. You have to figure it out by trial and error. Although it works fine, the aparatus uses way too much coffee grounds to get a medium bodied single cup of coffee."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waster your money on this poorly conceived product","review":"I purchased this as a backkup for the no pod occasions, but it is totally worthless! The reason we all have pod coffee makers is because they are quicky, easy and make a great cup of joe without the hassle. So why in the world would we want to use this device!! It makes weak flavorless coffee, requires clean up, and doesn't shut off automatically like the pods. Also, there is no crema. I returned mine! Amazon sells pods by Gala that are really good, great price, and now there is no reason to run out of pods! Skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Awful","review":"It's easier to make drip coffee in a cheap machine for better flavor than using this as even an emergency replacement. It was worse than awful I'd rather drink gas station coffee for a better flavor than what this can do.Please don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"This thing does not work at all!!!!!!!!!","review":"I bought this gadget on amazon a week ago to try it with my Senseo coffee machine. I was very seduced by the idea of using my favorite coffee with my favorite coffee machine. But with Mypod from Presto, I only get very weak cups of coffee with a lot of water in them. As if it wasn't enough, there is no foam on the coffee I get, which is very frustrating for me. I will never recommend this product to anybody. Save your money for real pods from Senseo or Kona."},{"rating":"2","title":"I use this every day","review":"I use the Mypod everyday. This thing makes great tasting coffee and I can change the strength by varying the amount of coffee in the pod. Always use the single cup button since the mypod allows more water to go through. Reviews that say the machine does not shut off are wrong. It is a little messy to empty the grounds. I have found that if I place the mypod in the sink to drain a while, it is less messy to empty. There is no foam, however the great tasting coffee makes up for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Senseo Supreme","review":"This pod does not fit the Senseo Supreme.It leaks the water out.The top does not close tight with pod in.I find the Eco pads work well in the Senseo Supreme."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Idea!","review":"Bad execution. I picked one of these up at a local store and had returned it by the end of the day. What junk. No grounds on the rim, I tried drip and espresso grinds of varying sizes and still it leaked and gave me nothing but brown water."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"I saw this product while walking through WalMart and thought it was a great idea. I felt the packaging implied it would produce a \\"Senseo Pod\\"-quality brew from my own coffee. Well, what I got was yucky coffee and a big mess! As other reviewers mention- the coffee is brewed very weak, you have to watch the water level to prevent an overflow mess and there is no froth. There are lots of inexpensive 1-cup cofee makers that would be way better, and this does not get you the \\"Senseo\\" coffee experience. Save your money and don't buy this product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Coffee and Bad Design","review":"I got one of these thankful to be lowering my per-cup cost on my machine. I didn't even use it once. First, MESSY MESSY MESSY. I end up with grounds all over the place trying to get this right. Incidently, that's one reason I got a Senseo. Second, it made the weakest coffee without the great foam. I say weak, I mean watery. I was even using an expresso blend. Third, the clean up stinks. Overall, hit Target when pods are on sale. I buy them buy the case! Love my Senseo!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as the ECOPODS","review":"I have had the blue ecopods for well over a year now. Ilove the taste of the coffee and it does give a fair amount of foam but hard to clean.I saw the Presto MyPod and leaped to try it. The coffee overfills the cup making it too weak and no room for creamer. There is absolutely no foam. I got hooked on the Senseo Foam. We will use it in a pinch but only on the 1 cup setting with 1 1/2 scoops."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea, bad implementation.","review":"It seemed like a good idea.When using the Presto MyPod, my Senseo can't tell when the cup is full. This is probably because the configuration of the MyPod doesn't allow the Senseo to reach full pressure. If you don't stand by the machine to shut it off when it's done, you'll wind up with a counter full of water.The MyPod makes watery coffee with no foam. I am definitely disappointed in this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works exactly as advertised!","review":"I don't have a clue why anyone is having a problem with this product. I bought one of these a month or two back to use after I used up all the pods I'd bought on clearance at Kroger's. Today I thought just for grins I'd try the unit for another quick cup of coffee instead of wasting a pod. This unit works perfectly. I cleaned it first, took the advice of another reviewer and wet the filter when I put it in so that it stayed exactly in place. Dumped in one measure of drip coffee I had on hand and put it in the machine. Bing Bang Boom! I had a cup of coffee minus the foam. Took the coffee holder out of the machine and tapped the grounds into the wastebasket, then rinsed it off. Done, no problems with too little of this. . . . to much of that. . . . just a good cup of coffee in literally less then two minutes on my first try. Mindlessly easy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not ready for prime time","review":"The product description doesn't provide full disclosure. This product is not a substitute for coffee pods. It does not make the characteristic crema of standard pods and it won't regulate the amount of water that goes through the coffee maker because of pressure variations. As a result, cups overflow and brewing is difficult to regulate. It will save you money over pods, but the coffee is not as satisfactory. Final judgement: waste of money and not useful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Make your own pod.","review":"This product does allow you to use regular coffee if you are out of pods; however, it is messy to cleanup.

A cheap alternative to overpriced pods and all that jazz.Then I had to clean it. And decided my time was, in fact, worth the cost of pre-packaged pods. The reviewer who mentioned that this item eliminates the fast convenience of a pod coffeemaker hit it on the nose. Prep is inconvenient, clean-up is awful (my senseo is in a room without a sink) and it was just a nastier mess than I wanted to face on a regular basis. I kept the kit for absolute coffee emergencies, but make an effort to ensure I don't run out of pods rather than use it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No Thanks","review":"I had the same experience about the coffee maker not stopping the water flow. I had quite a mess. Even ignoring the water flow issue though, because I could at least shut it off manually since I'd only use this occasionally...The real problem is the lid that covers the coffee grinds: It's a design flaw in that there's room for the lid to float once water is let into it. Once it floats the water flushes the grinds out from under the lid and up into the coffee maker itself (where coffee would never go normally). No grinds made it into my coffee cup but I had to clean the counter and spent the next half-hour flushing and re-flushing grinds out of the upper mechanism.No Thanks"},{"rating":"1","title":"Back to the drawing board...","review":"I have tried different grinds of coffee, different coffees, different amounts of loading, and still just get colored water.

The first song, the title track, is 20 minutes of loud bursts of sax and trumpet and extended Elvin Jones (previously John Coltrane's drummer) solos. Just when you think it's over, the song comes back, with more drums, more sax, more squeaks, and more dissonance. It sounds like a cross between free jazz and progressive rock--Rollins meets King Crimson. Tracks 2 and 3 are more straight-forward, with nice melodies. This album certainly is not for all tastes, even for those who like jazz. But, how can you go wrong with Rollins and Elvin Jones on the same album?

Elvis Cole is hired to find this sacred Japanese book that has been stolen from a business man who had it on loan from a group of respected Japanese. His job becomes more than just a hunt for a book.This is the type of book you could read in one sitting. I like Elvis much better in this book than the first one. He isn't as sleezy.

That Elvis! Does he get great clients, or what? Protecting himself from the businessman's sexual predator wife and trying to protect their vulnerable, at times almost catatonic, teenaged daughter, while trying to hunt down the elusive Japanese manuscript, keeps Elvis on his toes and readers on the edge of their seats. Joe Pike, his silent (but deadly) partner, brings all the big guns into this explosive---and surprising!---finale. Excellent!

The plot was just SO unbelievable!!! He goes out on a limb (not unusual for Elvis) but for such a teeny, tiny reason, then, there's a ton of violence and posturing (OK, so that's not unusual for him, either). It was the assumptions he made and the unwelcome \\"Knight in Shining Armor\\" schtick that really got to me. Maybe I've just read one too many of his, or something.Also, I must say, that I rely heavily on Publisher's Weekly Reviews to help me determine which books to read (so many books, so little time...), and I feel the review for this book was way off base.And, honestly, how does Elvis pay his mortgage and power bills? I've yet to see him take money for a case, isn't he supposed to be a 'professional' private eye??

After so-o-o-o much work and sacificie to win the position and with no markable skills it is not likely this would occur. Most likely she would declare the daughter a lier, kick her out of the home, defend the husband and father. IS SHE REALLY GOING TO DESTROY HER ONLY MEANS OF LIVELY HOOD??

The plot was painfully predictable, the characters laughably cliched and the dialog stupid, forced and irritating. Toward the end of the book, after heroes Elvis and Pike, easily blow away a half dozen oriental villans, they proceed to voluntarily and inexplicably put down their weaponry in order to engage in hand to hand combat with one final bad guy...just like on tv.

The HIC looked the same as its predecessor, but has been a bitter disappointment. There is no lock to hold the drum in place and it requires maximum strength on the handle to hold press down on the cheese to grate it effectively. (I use it only to grate parmesan.) The cutting edge is not very sharp. Most disturbingly, every time I use this grater, a faint bluish powder appears on the cheese. At first I thought the cheese was moldy, but on closer inspection, it appears that the metal-on-metal pressure is producing a small layer of metal filings. Ick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks nice, works terribly","review":"We purchased these cheese graters to replace another similar set that we had that broke over time. This product looks exactly the same as our old ones, but performs completely differently. First, the arm that pushes cheese towards the grating wheel seems to be soldered on at an incorrect angle, serving to only cut the cheese in the hopper rather than push it down. Secondly, the grating wheel is not held into place by anything other than pressure, and frequently falls out (sometimes, very embarrassingly onto customer's laps). I hope to find adequate replacements for our old graters, because these are just not doing the trick."},{"rating":"1","title":"can't wait to replace it","review":"We have had this cheese grater for years.

Aside from Living For The City, Higher Ground, and Jesus Children Of America there isn't anything I like on this album.There is just something about Stevie's languid, rather sappy, elevator-music ballads that I can't stand, and this cd has a bunch of them.Having said that, I absolutely love the great stuff on this cd, with Jesus Children Of America being the highlight for me. That alone makes it a disc worth owning, to me. Overall though, I think I am going to look into getting that multi-disc Stevie box-set that came out a few years ago or whenever it was.

It's hard to believe that this masterpiece was produced by a 23 year old, who wrote and arranged all nine tracks, and played almost every instrument on the album. It's easy to focus on the strength of Stevie Wonder's voice, from the effortless soul of \\"Don't you worry 'bout a thing\\" to the raw emotion and power of \\"All in love is fair\\", but the fact is that there are no weaknesses on this album - from the lyrics to the production, it feels like perfection from start to finish.

(When Paul Simon won the 1976 Grammy, he famously thanked Wonder for not having released an album that year; Wonder went on to win again the following year with \\"Songs in the Key of Life\\".) Lots of touchstone moments on this album. It kicks off with \\"Too High\\", a funky evocation of how it feels to be too high. \\"Living for the City\\", a huge hit which hit No. 8 on the U.S. Billboard chart, is a consciousness-raising expose of hard times in the city, with a memorable spoken word minidrama of a black naif arriving and promptly getting set up and busted for drugs. (\\"New York! Just like I pictured it! Skyscrapers and everything!\\") \\"Golden Lady\\" is a luscious slow-dance tune.

From the anti- drug anthem \\"too high\\" to the bitter yet realistic take on poverty stricken victims of urban america on \\"LIVING FOR THE CITY\\", Wonder's pen would never again carry such bite and seriousness as it does on innervisions. You almost feel sorry for President Nixon the way Wonder attacks him on the amzing finale \\"He's Misstra Know It All\\". \\"Higher Ground\\", and\\"Don't you worry 'bout a thing\\" are two of Wonder's best compositions which I'm sure you all have come to know and love. \\"Songs in the key of life\\" may be Wonder's must adventerous album but \\"Innervisions\\" is no doubt his most consistent best."},{"rating":"2","title":"In Peak Form","review":"This record was made at Stevie Wonder's peak.

There are ballads here but Stevie has the soul to sing them well. Have you heard the cover versions of \\"All In Love is Fair?\\" Nothing compares to this, the original a) because he wrote it b) because he felt it.I really don't like everything Stevie did after this. I like his \\"Little\\" Stevie Wonder stuff and his mid 70's stuff like this the best, and this one is my favorite.

The whodunit detective story that is the background of this work is only OK, but Lethem's writing and his protagonist Lionel Essrog leave a major impression. Touching without being sentimental, this is the story of a physically flawed yet three-dimensional human being, and I only wish that the author would write a sequel so I could be assured that Lionel gets the happy ending he deserves.

I had heard such great things, and it had gotten such great reviews, but in the end it really disappointed. The main character has Tourette's as we are CONSTANTLY reminded. It seems that the author was using the Tourettes as a crutch in developing the story or even to pad the book with endless lines of drivel. Didn't add a heck of a lot to the story. Actually, nothing added a heck of a lot to the story. The story wanders, rather aimlessly, through three or four days of misadventure for some small time thugs. There were glimmers of an interesting love story, but it is abandoned. Too much, really, is wrapped up too quickly and unimpressively at the end.

All in all, this book resembles more a work of detective fiction than it does a great literary work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Expected","review":"Great concept but a bit too gritty/gangsta for me. I felt the interruption of the sentences with his tics and syndrome blurts were a bit much. Sorry to all the Lethem fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like walking through knee high MUD","review":"This book was very hard for me to keep in my hands and I only finished it because it was recomended by a friend. It may be the fact that I am not from NY and don't understand the neighborhood references or just I am too compasionate for the main character. I thought this was a really a bad book. I would not reccomend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated and poorly written","review":"If you liked the boring mystery novel that was the Da Vinci Code and if you thought writing a novel from the perspective of an autistic child was clever, then this is the book for you.On the first page Mr. Lethem compares subvocalizing to tickling reality like piano keys (whatever that means), an army, and replacing divots. His similes are too diverse to create any sort of impression on the reader.Read Lolita instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"It tugged my boat","review":"A friend gave me this book when I moved to Brooklyn (the area of Bklyn where the book takes place) and as he handed it over said \\"It's not very good, but you will appreciate it.\\"Later that week, I mentioned that I had gotten Motherless Brooklyn to another friend (both of which have great literary taste in my opinion) and she said essentially the same thing. Now that I have read it I can safely say that the plot was weak and the end was even worse. I decided to give him another chance with \\"Fortress of Solitude\\" and som far so good... but this one is a stinker."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Mystery","review":"It's just a really great read. It was very interesting to go through a mystery through the eyes of someone suffering from tourette's. Although, upon finishing the book, I really don't know if Lionel actually \\"suffered\\", it kinda helped him along. Anyway, get it. Read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why Not?","review":"Why can't more authors write like Lethem? He's that rare combination of storyteller and prose turner that keeps us coming back for more. We laugh and cry. This is one of my desert island books, along with Klim's Jesus Lives in Trenton and Palahniuk's Fight Club. Take them if you will."},{"rating":"2","title":"Authentically bizarre","review":"Pleased to see Lethem's novel won the critic's circle award. Lethem's masterstroke is his narrator; Essrog is utterly believable. Often I wished hard he would just shut up and get on with solving the case, but there was no way I was going to stop reading. A very human reaction to a fictional character. Once you accept the Tourette's as part of the rhythm of the book it becomes a fascinating element of the character. As a former Brooklynite, I found Lethem's depiction of that area dead-on accurate (down to Rusty Staub and \\"half a fag\\") and beautifully realized without going over the top. Wonderful choice of words without overdoing it. Brooklyn becomes a main character with as valuable and intimate role in the story as any of the people. By the end I had a hard time believing Lethem was not a Brooklyn raised orphan with Tourette's. An entertaining, compelling and intelligent work. The defintion of excellent fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best audiobook ever!","review":"First off, I've read the novel as well, and it's easily Lethem's best. I worked for five years for a guy with Tourette's, and Lethem did is homework. The thing you don't get on the printed page is the abruptness, the change of tempo, that a verbal tick, especially an unsuccesful suppression of one, can come out with such lightning speed in the midst of an otherwise normal conversation.Which is where Frank Muller comes in. I listen to audiobooks at work, usually 40 or 50 hours a week. I rarely revisit one, but in the case of Motherless Brooklyn, I can't stop going back to the library and getting it for another listen.There are some other good audiobooks out there, to be sure, and some other gifted narrators, but this combination of book and narrator is the ultimate."},{"rating":"2","title":"A \\"Can't put down\\" read!","review":"Jonathan Lethem has cratfed a book that transcends the crime fiction genre! He has created a colorful cast of characters that hold your interest from page one to the last word. Lionel Essrog, the Turetic lead character, is at times master sleuth and at other times, bumbling detective! Grab an egg cream, sit out on the stoop and enjoy this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"lethem's incredible","review":"The writing is excellent and original, but the story and plot isn't all that inspired. Sweet main character with few chances in life who makes good. It's hard not to like Lionel Essrog, but Lethem didn't go deep enough. We're teased. I was a little disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another book from a very versatile writer","review":"A very nice book that requires some patience at points, but is definitely worth the read. For hard boiled detective fans it has all the elements with a very unique main character."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I'm surprised to see that this book has generally gotten such positive reviews. I was excited to read it after hearing the author discuss his new book on the radio, but I found it to be ... not very good at all. The writing is fine, and the Tourettes thing is kind of well done, but the plot is absolutely terrible - a sophomoric pastiche of hard-boiled detective stories. I read the whole thing only because it was a quick read and I hate to put down a book, but I really didn't care what happened in the end, and then the ending turned out to be the worst part of the book. Not sure why this author is getting such hype. Perhaps his new book is better."},{"rating":"2","title":"READ ME, BAILEY!!!!","review":"This book screams READ ME! Why? Because Lethem is a god! Really! Seriously! No kidding! He creates a world that is dark and moody like a good crime noir. Then he tosses in Lionel, a man prone to ripping apart words, meshing them together, and creating a whole new language. Then he populates it with distinctive characters like Mina and Kimmery. Toss in a little Zen, White Castle hamburgers, and Maine and you have the makings of a fantastic novel. What I loved the most (other than Lionel's narrative) was that it was a detective novel elevated to a contemperary fiction level. When handled deftly by such an artist, it can be magnificant.NOW DO WHAT IT SAYS AND READ IT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"Total gibberish, literally and figureativly. How can this book be rated so highly by so many people. the author is so involved in what he thinks is his own genius that half the time I don't understand what the hell he is talking about. The only thing that makes sense is Tourettes Syndrome"},{"rating":"2","title":"Five star story ... until I hit page 263","review":"Lethem did an excellent job with defining his characters and justifies the reason why the main character, Lionel Essrog, would risk his neck to find out who killed his friend, Frank Minna. Motherless Brooklyn was humorous and I found myself charmed by Essrog! The book was rich with information without weighing me down with too many unnecessary details (I've read stories that took an entire page to describe a run down building). The story read smoothly even when the narrator starts one of his \\"tics\\", I couldn't bring myself to skip any pages. The only faults with this book is that it starts off with a bang...continues giving off heat...and then lets me down with a wimper of an ending. From page 263, I grew bored with the so called climax as it lingered for quite a few pages and I wished that the situation didn't resolve in such a dull way. Nevertheless, 85% of the book was just too much fun to allow the last 48 pages to spoil it. I simply loved it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"It's a Tourette's thing--you wouldn't understand.\\"","review":"Yet, Jonathan Lethem makes us understand. This is a brilliant work, filled with completely fleshed out characters, a crazy, creative plot, and a murder mystery wrapped in a sense of the absurd. Lionel Essrog is the central character with Tourette's syndrome, and I cannot say enough superlatives about his characterization and dialogue. I found myself thinking about Lionel long after I finished the book; the tics, the words, the creativity, I can't say enough good things about this work. What a great book that balances prose, plot, characters, and originality. This book is unforgettable."},{"rating":"2","title":"fonebone sousamaphone","review":"Lionel Essrog's voice sank so deep into the farther reaches of my synapses that I found my brain reeling in Tourettic fever from it. I had to slow down reading, because the end was coming too quickly. The story, the characters, everything, had a satisfying, true resonance. This book goes beyond Lethem's others, which says a lot. It's a home run."},{"rating":"2","title":"His best yet and this is one case where that means something","review":"I've read all of Lethem's books so far, so I was very excited when I received an advance copy of this. It is, at once, his most serious and humorous novel yet. It seems well-grounded in research and still manages to convey emotion in an impressive manner. It is strange that his last book (Girl in Landscape- the most easy of his novels to categorize as sci fi.) is followed by this one. There is no hint of science fiction at all. This shouldn't scare his fans away, though. The book is still packed with interesting verbiage and ideas. This is the best book I've read in two years."},{"rating":"2","title":"four stars for the Tourette twist","review":"Otherwise, I would just give it two or three stars. But if Lethem does not have Tourette's, he still does an unbelievably authentic job of giving us its quirks - especially the stuttering, bizarre free association wordplay - in an eccentric and likeable character. I wish there had been another character I wanted to root for, however.The detective storyline is pretty standard. What distinguishes it is its main character whose disorder threatens to defeat his attempts to solve a murder case at every turn. This may not be enough to keep some readers' interests, but if you're interested in psychological twists, this one is as impressive as any I've come across. I only wish the same originality had been given to the rest of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique equals fabulous","review":"I loved this book. I crave books which have unique storylines and characters and follow that with clever writing and an engaging plot. This book meets those wishes and more.The writing is clever, the characters are three dimensional with funky personalites and personal histories. I highly recommend this part detective novel/part love story/part character study for anyone who craves a highly unique and entertaining read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Philip Marlowe's orphan brother with a tic - Barnumumbailey","review":"In obvious homage to Raymond Chandler's form - even quoting directly from several of his books - Lethem has created a very creative, highly readable, unique take on the classic detective novel. The first person narrative from the mind of a Tourette's is the real engine that drives this vehicle, but Lethem also does a pretty fair job of building up and playing out the detective story that frames the plot. The book as a whole is written at a level that defies categorization and truly deserves the recognition that it has received as valued literature."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Want Tourette's!","review":"This lively novel is at once a kind of mystery and at the same time a delightful romp through the streets of New York. The central character suffers from Tourette's syndrome, and it is to Lethem's credit that he informs readers about the affliction without being condescending to his character, or making fun of other sufferers. In fact, he makes Tourette's sound like fun, which of course, it isn't. Still the book succeeds in drawing a number of lovely character portraits and in creating a lively plot. Good stuff. Deserves many readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"A minor masterpiece of character","review":"In another writer's hands, the concept of a narrator suffering from Tourettes', and trying to solve a murder could have been a gimmicky mess. Instead, Jonathan Lethem's MOTHERLESS BROOKLYN turns out to be an intriguing, original and fascinating novel. Lethem is not afraid to take chances and his gamble paid off here. While I agree that the mystery itself is secondary to the character studies (and a drop disappointing), the resulting glimpses into the short-circuiting manners of a Tourettes' victim is a minor masterpiece in character study. In fact, the other realm described here, the motherless world of orphans, is equally brilliant and convincing. Give this book a read--I highly and hugely recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clever enough detective story","review":"Seems to suffer from one of the problems that plagues a lot of books the environment created is fantastic but the plot doesn't get going until about way through the narrative if you can hang on for awhile you should be ok. Its not the plot that got me which if I could honest wasn't particularly interesting another guy murdered wow never read that before.Rather for me it was the quite honest portrayal of a man with a horribly frustrating illness. The author does a wonderful job of communicating just how much it controls your life and how it can be overcome with the right support. That was enough for me because at times the plot moves so slow you want to throw the book down in frustration."},{"rating":"2","title":"A page-turner by the master of Brooklyn.","review":"You might think a writer could not construct a brilliantly-worded, completely engaging detective story centering around a protagonist with Tourette syndrome. You'd be wrong. Lethem is a brilliant author who writes books you just can't set down once you have been lucky (or informed) enough to pick one up. Lethem writes about Brooklyn as Dennis Lehane (e.g.Gone, Baby, Gone (Harper Fiction)) writes about Boston---with the authority of experience. In regard to what Lethem says he loves most of books are \\"the mysterious movements of characters and situations and the emotions that accompany those movements.\\" THAT is why you read Lethem. Because his writing is true to his passion and it makes his books incredibly entertaining and intriguing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"Just adding to the general aproval that this book has garnered. I thought it brilliant and compelling. Though I wasn't particularly involved with the plot the quality of the writing and characterisation was sufficient to make it a \\"5\\" reqardless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh. Just eh.","review":"I don't know -- this just isn't that great a book, so why is everyone going gaga for it? It's not all that well written (some sections are painfully awkward), it's not that great a mystery (although the main revelation about the villain's identity is well delivered), the business of viewing everything through a Tourette's lens is handled in a ham-handed and tiresome fashion (i.e., take an element of ordinary life, describe it briefly, then have narrator comment \\"That's just like Tourette's if you think about it\\"), and you exit the book disappointed, especially if you entered expecting something great.Not horrible, but not very good, either, and definitely not outstanding."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my style","review":"Unfortunately this really wan't my kind of book. To me the plot just seemed to limp along without going anywhere interested or engaging. I didn't bond with any of the characters, which probably made the book less enjoyable that it could have been.I don't feel the book is poorly written but I think that it is just simply not the style of book that appeals to me. So unfortunately I can't recommend this book to others but that shouldn't deter those who are interesting having a read."},{"rating":"1","title":"maybe its just me.... but.....","review":"Not very cool.......I love Yamamoto but.. this one just didn't do it for me.. sorry..The recording seems to be not its normal class as well... disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not on the level with Block's other books","review":"This is from a series Block wrote early in his career.

Molloy's research into what sort of colors impress juries and potential buyers is incredibly useful. He even tells you how to dress to be a successful doctor. I find Molloy incredibly sympathetic to the needs of real women, including large-size women and particularly women of color."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book needs taking down a couple of pegs.","review":"This book promises a lot, but when you strip it down to bare essentials, it's actually pretty crappy.

Molloy writes a detailed description of the outfits women must wear to get to the top in the business world of today. Along with clothing, Molloy also gives women tips on makeup, hair, accessories, etc...He gives exact tips of colors and fabrics to wear, things that are usually obvious to people in the business world. (example, for an important meeting, you should wear a classic color suit, not neon green!)Molloy's point of view is not one of mainstream america, although he seems to think so, stating at one point that he has \\"millions of fans\\".Molloy also discusses weight issues, and says that if you are not thin, you cannot make it in business. Molloy recommends plastic surgery and says it \\"works\\" ,especially for women over 50.Overall, I detested reading this book.

But who really wants to read something all about appearance? Our society is superficial enough, and there is no reason to make it worse by devoting one's time to reading this book. Molloy should write something about helping people to find themselves rather than the appropriate shoe. And I cannot believe that someone wrote a novel entitled \\"How to Date Young Women : For Men over 35,\\" and that one of Molloy's books is being sold with it as a special deal. If I was Molloy I would hate to know that someone laughed at me the way that I did when I read that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sexist and offensive","review":"In reading Molloy's book, one could conclude that a woman who thinks that earning a graduate degree, working hard and developing skills is what it takes to get ahead is all wrong. No, what she needs to do (according to Molloy) is to obsess about her looks, starve herself if genetics did not endow her with a thin build and in general market herself as if looks are all that matter. After decades of women working for equality in the workplace, there are still people who think like this?! I believe that women deserve better than this book. True, the advice he gives on appropriate workplace attire is basically sound, but there are many other books out there that give advice just as good, without the sexism and size prejudice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tough love for women's fashion","review":"Mr. Molloy's original book taught me how to dress when I first graduated from college.

Cut your hair short. Don't show your cleavage. Dress kind or like a man.Sounds pretty basic, but many women don't wear such outfits to work. Perhaps it's because while this is a quick and easy read, there should be more images to show exactly what to wear. Also it's a bit dated by a few decades. And it doesn't consider different types of corporations. What about creative companies (web, ad agencies)?

For me, it is Pearl Buck's masterwork, topping even the famous \\"The Good Earth.\\" She wrote so many good books, but please do not miss this one. It is about the soul's search for the highest kind of love, transcending gender, time, place and culture, all set within a fascinating time and place: China on the brink of WW II. Pearl Buck always spins a good story, and her wisdom is astounding."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderfully written","review":"Pearl bucks books are always beautifully written but, this one was exceptional.

All is beautiful, precise, elegant, traditional ... But soon Madame Wu realizes that the traditional ways are not working anymore. She tries to use tradition to satisfy Western, feminist cravings to find deeper meaning for her life. Understanding and then loving a Western man, Madame Wu suddenly sees her life and family in an entirely new way. The novel is poetic, philosophical, and yet personal. As Madame Wu and the world politics of the 40s change forever the Wu family, the mind of the reader is changed as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"To really know what love is . . .","review":"This is an awesome and thought provoking novel by Pearl Buck.

But over the months I found my thoughts constantly flitting back to it-- to some bit of dialog, some passage in this book. A year later, drawn by something I could not describe, I re-read this book. It is not a book for girls, or even young women. It is a book for women. Women who have been married a long time. They alone, I think, would understand, sympathize and identify with the actions of the main character, Madame Wu, who, on her 40th b'day, arranges for her husband to take a \\"little wife\\",and the consquences of this action on the family. I know the premise sounds simple but this book explores the very deep waters of the human heart. To be honest, even after a second reading I am not sure I actually like Madame Wu, and , I must admit, it is not Mrs. Buck's greatest works but , as said before, there is something haunting about this book..."},{"rating":"2","title":"fat jon is the illest","review":"first off, I'd like to say that wave motion is by far the most complete and chill out albums out to date, if not the best. Fat jon's production style is very very harmonic and eclectic. The title pretty much sums it all up. Wave motion takes the listener on a journey through soundscapes and total utopia. It is the perfect album to chill out with your main squeez, clean the house or to just think, and make a rational decision, before you slap somebody; cause music does calm the savage beast. My favorite tracks are #2, feel the void, #9 depths, and the outro, which makes a good intro for a mix tape. To sum it all up, the album is straight bangin!!! It should be bought together with DJ Cam's Soulshine."},{"rating":"1","title":"not my thing","review":"when i picked this up i thought it would be a little ambient and urban like some of fat john's other beats featured on cartoon network, but this really was some sub-par work. it was like he was bored making this album, not much personality, not much depth, not much focus on anything in particular: noise. not my thing, but thanks anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a super album","review":"If there is someone out there who is timid about buying this album, don't be. Superwoman (where were you when I needed you) is one of Stevie Wonder's best song. Immediately, in the beginning of the song, Stevie uses his lyrical skills to turn a simple statement like \\"very well\\" into a double-entendre, and just when I thought the song was ending, it broke into this wonderful melody displaying Stevie's superior skills in many instruments. Than, the vocals at the end are so amazing, and the way Stevie delivers the lyrics is even more amazing. This song is 8 minutes of sheer greatness, and this song alone should convince you to buy the album."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT Fusion","review":"Stevie Wonder is One Of Teh Greatest Artists Ever! this Disc Showcases His Greatness all The Way Thru.As Writer,Arranger,Producer,Instrumentalist&Vocalist Stevie Captures alot Of Feeling on this Great Album.SuperWOman Alone is a Gem.Great Musicianship&Arrangements.Girl Blue is Fantastic.You Feel The Vibe&Depth Of His Genius Here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plodding and tedious","review":"This album is supposed to be the first of Wonder's 70s classics.

Just listen to the preverbial \\"vocal bag\\" on \\"Love Having You Around\\", the complex interwoven melodies on \\"Superwoman (Where were you when I needed You), the natural percussion on \\"I Love Every Little thing about you\\" and the driving funk on \\"Keep on Running\\". An execellent album only outdone by the next two."},{"rating":"1","title":"April Fool","review":"Okay, you sorta root for the guy, and defer judgement on his corruption, but he's a Bad Detective. Not just neglecting his job, either.When he applies himself to solving a problem, he NEVER has a plan, options, or an exit strategy. (Sound familiar?) This continually suprises him.He's always a hair-trigger away from violence - will he blow? - no, the only violence he commits is off-stage. Nor does he ever learn from his mistakes and improve. \\"Victories\\" gained by luck are claimed; inevitable \\"defeats\\" are rationalized away. The guy's a loser, and what little care he has for his fellow man always loses out to his own short-sighted selfishness.The writing, on the other hand, is often delightful. Clipped phrasing. Idiom-tastic. Veddy, veddy British. I have not read this author before and won't again... unless his loyal fans can convince me of a different title I might try."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Shelf Set","review":"This is a wonderful set of TWO shelves. I found the directions a little vague, yet the shelves are fairly easy to put up. (It would be nice if there was a small hammer included).I LOVE the lip around the front edge which prevents items from being accidentally knocked off! I bought TWO sets and hung two on my side of the bed and two on hubby's side. Sized perfectly for smaller items like a cordless phone handset, small alarm/clock, medicine bottles, charging cell PDA, or eyeglasses at night. Now I can ALWAYS find my glasses in the middle of the night.

Hadn't heard of the author, in fact haven't heard much since, but thought I'd give it a try. Unfortunately, I was disappointed.While I did dedicate the time to finish the book, mainly because I really wanted to know how it would all end up; I just wasn't that impressed with the overall story. Judging by the description on the back I thought it would be much more exciting and worthwhile than I felt it ended up.I certainly can appreciate the point the story was trying to get across, about how life used to be in the south for blacks. And while I did find the two main characters pretty entertaining at times- I just felt the entire story and cast fell short for me. It was not very suspenseful or exciting or even what I felt \\"all that deep\\".

I hope I can find many more books by Terry Kay!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Intimate study of post WWII changes in the rural South","review":"There have been many books written about this painful period in recent American History, but Terry Kay shines in his intimate portrayal of the birth pangs of racial equilibrium viewed through various characters of a small southern town. Most notable are two young boys, one white, one black; both sharing the same birth date, childhood friendships and the winds of change. This is also a murder mystery, and though the book revolves around the murders, that is secondary to the theme of change that the author weaves into this first rate novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT!","review":"This is one of the first CDs that my daughter (almost 3) and I both love and could listen to over and over without getting sick of. We borrowed it from our local library and when the CD was due we had to go buy our own copy! It's a great mixture of original and familiar songs and has us singing the songs all the time, even on our morning walks!As a mother and former educator, I listen to a lot of children's music. But THIS is music I actually enjoy!I strongly recommend this album for children and their parents!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Victor Vito","review":"I love this album! This is the first time I have heard of Laurie Berkner and we have listened to Victor Vito about 50 times! It is like an alternative kids album - music parents like to listen to also! She has traditional songs arranged in her own way - and just like she says, she isn't always \\"perfect\\", but rather real, which is GREAT! I'm buying a few for friends as well! Awesome album Laurie. If you ever need a back-up singer, just let me know!"},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect for all ages","review":"im 16 years old soon going on 17 and i love this cd. i work in a toy store and this cd gets played a lot and the songs become addicting. i find myself singing them all of the time. and the customers to this store love the cd as do their children. i highly reccomend this cd, every one loves it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, Catchy, Enjoyable for kids & adults","review":"We have a lot of kid's music, but Victor Vito is an album we always come back to. My kids love it when I sing the slower songs to them as lullabyes. They are easy to memorize, with easy tunes. We love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best CD ever!!","review":"My daughter absolutely loves this CD.

We sing and dance to her songs!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Kids' Music","review":"We love this cd! My son asks for it over and over and the songs are not annoying to me as an adult, either.

It was accurately described and received quickly. Bravo!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Both kids love it!","review":"It took a few playings, but now both of my kids (nearly 4 and nearly 2) actually request this CD. The songs are catchy, easy to sing, and will run through your head 1000s of times each day (one drawback, if you can call it that!). Laurie and her compatriots have very easy-to-listen-to voices and the variety of styles of songs satisfies everyone in the group. It's great in the car too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't understand...","review":"I don't understand why this CD is getting such great reviews. I listened to the samples on Amazon and liked the first song, Victor Vito, but didn't like any of the other songs. I decided to give the CD a try. The first song is the only good one on the album. Some of the other songs are mediocre at best. If I have to hear \\"the cow jumped over the mooooooooooooooooooooooon\\" or the toy museum song one more time, I may just have to get rid of the CD. There are other annoying pieces and bad singing on the CD and the songs are dumb. Also, the recording is not good and the words are hard to understand in some of the songs. If you listened to the samples and you're not sure if you should purchase this CD, I'd recommend that you do not buy it. Take a look at my other reviews for some recommendations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck!","review":"We got this CD after seeing Lori in \\"video's\\" between cartoon's on TV really expecting to love it. We had loved the three or four songs we saw on TV and thought that, even though we didn't know any of the songs on the CD except Victor Vito, we would give it a try. I'm really pretty sorry that we did.The songs are very random. If you like that kind of thing, sort of a kid's version of jazz, then this CD is for you. Some of the lyrics are cute but the music is annoyingly random and the singing is too. And it's not danceable. My kids danced to Victor Vito (though it too was a different version that the video on TV) but very few of the other songs had any sort of a beat to allow for dancing.All in all, if you like jazz and think your kids will too, this CD is perfect. If you are looking for upbeat songs that the kids will like and that you can learn to see along with, take my advice and buy something else. This one was quite disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"My children love Victor Vito and Laurie Berkner","review":"My children love Laurie Berkner's music they first saw her on Noggin and my 4 year old knows the words by heart to Victor Vito and This Hat. My only complaint about Laurie is that she wears a nose ring on her cover of her album. I certainly don't want my child doing that. She should really think about how she is being perceived other than that we love her music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Trash","review":"If I could rate this as less than 1 star I would. This music is TERRIBLE. It would sound better if I picked up a guitar and started singing. And let me tell you, I don't know how to play guitar and I can't carry a tune. Absolutely terrible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not my favorite","review":"There are several really great songs on this album (Victor Vito, Froggy Went a Courtin, The Moon Song, I'm Not Perfect all come to mind) but several that my 2 yr old daughter just cannot get into. This is the only L Berkner album where this has happened. Lots of songs on this one, but we have to skip several. That being said, Laurie is a fantastic folk singer and overall we love her stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"car favorite","review":"A friend gave me this cd and both my 6 year old boy and my 3 year old daughter love it. I'll admit it, I find myself singing along more times than not. These songs are catchy without being obnoxious.

If you have young children that need entertainment this is a great DVD to purchase for them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just for the kids...","review":"I originally bought this for my daughter for Christmas, and since then have bought this CD for countless little preschoolers.

We all have our favorite songs, and I'm not the only one to admit to listening to it even when the kids are not in the van with me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love you Laurie!","review":"Okay, so I'm totally in love with this CD and I think I would listen to this even if my kiddos weren't in the car with me. Is that weird?? We have every song memorized. I just think this is a fun addition to any children's music collection. I plan on ordering Rocketship Run for my son's Easter basket."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I got this cd from the library before we took our just-turned-two-year old on a long car trip. We listened to this cd over and over and over on that trip, and honestly everyone in the car enjoyed it.Victor Vito, if you haven't heard it already on Noggin, is upbeat, fun, and singable the first time through; it is our favorite song on the album. But there are other funny fast songs that are fun to sing, like Goldfish, Bottlecaps, Oleanna, and Shakin' Down the Sugar. Some songs are slower, of course, (Moon Moon Moon makes a nice lullaby) and I love the message of I'm Not Perfect.It is a rare thing to find a CD that my son and I both like (and my husband), and that makes Victor Vito worth its weight in gold."},{"rating":"2","title":"You don't have to be a fan to love this one","review":"My 2 year old daughter loves Laurie and all that she does, but friends of hers who are not fans respond equally well to this CD. Whenever we put Victor Vito on we have to play the title track about 15 times before we can move on to the other songs, which is tedious for us but no criticism of Ms Berkner.If your kiddies like jolly music to move to, and you want to be able to listen to it too, this (or indeed any of the Laurie Berkner CD's) is a good place to start."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank goodness for Laurie Berkner!","review":"Laurie has created the finest, most thoughtful and most original children's music I have ever heard. And of everything she's done (except for her new CD, which I haven't heard), this is Laurie's finest work, period. We have a six-month-old girl at home, and we find that she's especially active and happy when we play the Victor Vito record.I shuddered at the thought of playing children's music in our home: for example, the idea of Barney drives me insane. But we live in a home where good music is extremely important to us, so I knew we had to do something. Without going into track-by-track details, I will say that all of our friends and cousins are having babies right now, and all of them are getting Laurie Berkner's stuff from us. Especially the Victor Vito CD -- it's a really special recording!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Victor Vito - perhaps the best kiddie album we own","review":"Why do I love this album? *) My 2 year old starts dancing as soon as she hears the music, *) She's been known to cry when I turn the music off, *) The 10 and 11 year old neighbor girls who drop by to play with my daughter often ask me to put this album on, *) The music is clever, catchy, and fun, even for grown-ups, *) I feel good about exposing my daughter to this music (see previous reason). It's not \\"Mozart\\" or anything, but it has a \\"nutritious\\" quality to it (i.e. it's not \\"junk food\\"). *) I still enjoy hearing it after all these months!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous!","review":"My sons, 3 & 1, heard Laurie's songs 1st at their uncle's house & then saw her on Noggin.

I can literally listen to that album all day long and never get sick of it.I was soooo excited to get \\"Victor Vito\\" after reading reviews, but once I popped it into the CD player in my car, it was \\"eh...\\" from the beginning. After having had it for about a month now, I have yet to listen to the whole album. It lacks the polished, finished, complex sound I've come to expect from the LBB, and while I realize that it was released before \\"Under a Shady Tree,\\" there wasn't THAT much time between albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for Children","review":"Great entertainment for children. It is a very soothing and catchy CD. My grandson enjoys singing the songs immensely as we do joining in with him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good","review":"I purchased the Victor Vito CD for my 17 month old based on its great reviews. What a mistake. We are very disappointed. There are 3 songs that are tolerable and the rest are down right annoying! Only those few have a beat and can be danced to. My son (and I) would rather listen to Raffi anytime. I recently heard of Laurie Berkner from her videos shown on Noggin. Her renditions on TV are much more enthusiastic and entertaining than the CD. I also purchased Whaddaya Think? I'm glad I didn't open it yet. It will be returned. My husband compares her songs to \\"nails on a chalkboard.\\" My advice, invest in Raffi or the Wiggles."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST - Hard to listen to","review":"I have purchased many CD's for my son and this has to be one of the worst I've heard. My son doesn't enjoy it either and he usually dances to his other CD's. I based my decision to purchase this CD from the reviews and the only conclusion I could come up with for the 5 star rating and glowing reviews is that Laurie must have had frieds writing reviews.

There are (of course) some mistakes, but they are excusable, for the members of R.E.M. often do not know what the songs are about. Comes with a discography and previously unreleased photographs.

The author seems content that a quick overview of scenes from each film is enough to comprise an in-depth discussion, and constantly repeats himself, often putting the exact same paragraph within a couple of pages (Who was the proof reader for this book? ....).When the book attempts to be critical (which it rarely does) it falls flat on it's face. The idea that The Road To Hong Kong is the least of the series purely due to it's Space Travel plot, - meaning it is less based in reality than the other films - is totally flawed.To sum up - a potentially great book is scuppered by repetitious prose, little new information or research and very weak arguments. ....Oh well, nice try - hopefully someone will do the series justice one day..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome CD","review":"Don't listen to anyone who bought this CD because of the Bumble Bee Tuna Song.

Nevertheless, Wildside did rock, and they did it well.Singer Drew Hannah doesn't sound all that unique compared to other metal singers but he still has his own style and thats the main key, that and some great solos by a very talented guitarist.

What a gem. It's hard to put into words what makes Joyce Cooling one of the finest talents ever in the world of smooth jazz guitar. For me, Joyce's upbeat, toe-tappingslick guitar playing coupled with the stylish arrangements andsupport from an equally ooutstanding band, do the trick. Thetracks that stand out for me are \\"Whenever The Rain Falls\\"(whichI believe is a very radio-friendly tune), followed by \\"Daddy-O\\",\\"Mm-Mm-Good\\"; \\"Don't Mind If I Do\\"; and \\"Third Wish\\".Third Wish is a must for any smooth jazz fan. If you particularly love smooth jazz guitar, you'll take notice at howJoyce bends notes, glides over the fretboard, and so effortlesslycreates a sound that has worn out my CD player since I purchased it. This disc is great driving music as well. Don't miss it !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Come On!","review":"I have both of Joyce's first two albums and found Third Wish to be a dissapointment.

Hopefully you do not have to replace the cartridges at one time.Anyhow the best is that the cartridges are not drying out as with inkjets (I had to trow out four ink jet printers because they dryed out).Another factor that made me to pick this printer is the speed which is at least two times than other leading brands in the same price range.A small negative is that if in standby it takes about 1.6 minutes to start printing the first page but for me it's not a problem as the printer is in another room so until I get to pick it up is done.Pros: quality, speed, does not dry outCons: None"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Printer LEXMARK C534DTN","review":"ONE STAR BECAUSE YOU CAN'T CHOOSE ZERO. I would strongly recommend against purchasing this printer. I purchased a c534dtn December, 2006. I understood the unit would have a 5 year warranty. 1 year plus 4 years for registering. After less than two years of use, the unit is showing a \\"950.40 NVRAM Mismatch\\" error and is not useable. I contacted Lexmark and they said the unit is out of warranty - that the warranty is only a year (i plan to continue following up on this) and referred me to a service technician. The service technician told me that to fix the unit, the whole system board would have to be replaced. The system board is $699 (and no stock of the system board shows available). Additional labor costs for installation of the system board (minimum $300) would drive the repair cost above the total cost of the printer.

Lexmark's website does offer Operator Manuals for downloading. However, for several weeks the manuals wouldn't download. After two months of calls/e-mails/letters to Lexmark, an off-shore/contract customer service person phoned ... only to inform me they didn't know how to set-up a C524 printer. Two weeks & 2-3 phone calls later, I finally found someone at Lexmark who knew how to setup this piece of equipment. Approximately 100-150 printed sheets later, the black ink ran out. I was informed that the toner cartridges included as part of a Lexmark printers initial cost are only partially filled.

Far from being a comprehensive work on Japanese weapons, the weapons covered are extremely limited. Cunningham seems to have only covered weapons contained in 'the author's personal collection'. There's a few lines about this and that, but no detail at all about anything.I found this book very much an 'outsider's' look at Japan, giving small pieces of information on Japanese history and culture. As a long-time resident of Japan and martial arts practitioner, however, I found the book rather shallow and lacking insider's insight. I had trouble understanding why some of the sections, such as the recounting of the well-known story of the 47 Ronin had anything to do with 'secret weapons of jujutsu'. Some of the illustrations also puzzled me, not seeming relevant to the text.My conclusion; If you know nothing about Japan and its martial history, maybe it's an interesting read.

Isn't that what its all about?Another song that always touches myself is the album closer, I Believe. It starts off as a poignant ballad but the fade out seems to bring out some grooving R & B tones and some optimism for the future.So many other great moments. Jeff Beck contributes a delightful guitar solo to the breezy Lookin' For Another Pure Love. Maybe Your Baby is another dynamic funky tune. What an infecious hook.

This is one of popular music's most melodic and creative songwriters at the start of his peak, showing off his incredible emotional range (\\"You Are The Sunshine of My Life\\" to \\"Superstition\\" to \\"Big Brother\\") and highly inventive arrangements. Plus, Wonder manages to be one of the very few artists whose use of synthesizers in the 1970's, for the most part, doesn't sound dated today. Which is fortunate, because he uses them a lot, and quite effectively - much the same way Duke Ellington used the tone colors in his own orchestra.

He's got it all. This album reminds me of what trance was back in 1992. I'm talking about pure european trance at it's best, which means a handful of uplifting anthemic melodies.

In the background all the cop cars look like they are tied on in a convoy with string.Quite a good film for a night round the telly with the guys and a few six packs to sharpen up everyones sarcastic one liners.Mainly though its really just a feeble attempt to do another 'Vanishing Point'.Someone must have vanished the script instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just A Fun Movie","review":"This movie obviously isn't believable.

Throughout the day, Jack is chased by the police and becomes broadcast live on every TV channel. Natalie begins to see that Jack is innocent and falls in love. Will they make it to Mexico?

I found this 93 minutes of a frantic highway pursuit very confidentally paced and occasionally quite charming even.An escaped jailbird takes a rich spoilt brat of a girl hostage in a slurpy BMW, all in denial of his incorrect sentencing for a crime we are led to believe he did not commit. Doozy premise, but semi-cleverly executed. And if you think it's too unrealistic, how about the live videos we see in TV numbers such as \\"Cops\\"?The movie squarely points a caustic finger at news-hungry media folks perpetually on the prowl for that next sensational carrion. Plus, there are hints of jabs at inclement parent-child relationships among the affluent.Far from my ideas of cinematic excellence, not the least of which is a lip-devouring kissing scene nearly as unpleasant to sit through as a double root canal.

After returning the first one and burning out the second, I disassembled it and the wire clip to the field coil was completely burned out.

I was careful not to stress the motor too much when doing this, but it could have caused the early failure. Overall, I'm a big fan of Bosch tools. I love the planer, jig saw and angle grinder.

Not only that, but there was a situation where the beats of the two different songs created a kind of mass confusion due to very poor mixing.I was expecting something much different(as the description told me it was MIXED).

It has the star coordinate system (the one in hours and degrees), so you can find planets, if you have a table that tells you where to look.I think you should complement this with a book, such as \\"40 Nights to Knowing the Sky\\", in order to know what you are seeing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Invention for a Novice to Study the Stars","review":"With a planisphere in your pack, during the night, you will ALWAYS know the where the cardinal directions are.

His sole gift to Egyptology was the popularisation of the field, leading at the least to extended availability of funding. While interesting as a piece of scholarly history, no beginner should work from this book alone; Budge's understanding of the language is fallible to a degree that would forever mar the education of the casual student in the Egyptian language. My suggestion would be James Allen's new \\"Middle Egyptian\\", if not Gardiner."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Egyptologist says \\"NO\\" to Budge","review":"I am an Egyptologist who teaches an online course in Egyptian hieroglyphs to the general public. While this book is widely available, don't let that fool you into thinking it is at all reliable. The one reason it is available is because it is out of copyright and the publishers can print it at will and reap all the profits without paying any royalties. If Egyptologists had any say over it, the book would be banned, as it is completely outdated and wasn't even considered a good book when it was first published nearly 100 years ago. When I first started studying Egyptian myself, my instructor started off the class by writing \\"Budge\\" on the board and enclosing it in a circle with a slash through it. That's how bad this book is. In my courses, students use and like James Allen's book on Middle Egyptian. It's recently published so it is up to date, and is written in a way that makes Egyptian comprehensible to the modern reader. It's infinitely better than Budge."},{"rating":"1","title":"Obsolete, incomplete, and wrong","review":"This book may have some remaining marginal utility for people who just want to learn to write their name in hieroglyphics.However, if your interest in the Egyptian language runs deeper than that, you will want to pass this one by. Budge uses a system of transliteration that is no longer the standard, and now only found in reprints of books by Budge himself. If you learn it, you will have to unlearn it later on. His presentation of the grammar is also obsolete and incomplete.More serious students would be better served by Gardiner's -Egyptian Grammar-, or Allen's -Introduction to Middle Egyptian-, or even Mercer's similarly priced paperbacks."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is no way to learn a language","review":"The best part of this book is the beginning, where Budge traces the history of the Egyptian language and then its decipherment. All of these chapters are very interesting and informative. If you want to get a good picture of what the state of Egyptology was in the 1930's, then this is not a bad book for that, although the historical information is rather abbreviated compared to an actual history book.Which isn't surprising, given that this book's main purpose was allegedly to teach the ancient Egyptian language. Unfortunately, the field wasn't thoroughly developed when Budge wrote this book, so any new student would be better off reading a newer work. And, while I can't speak for others, I found the information poorly organized and impossible to learn from."},{"rating":"1","title":"WTH","review":"Ok first off I havent even read this book in its entirety but through the first pages the author doesn't even give credit to the people of whom is writing about for actually creating the language!

If you really want to impress the love interest in your life, skip the flowers, the wine and the chocolate and go with this instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"It sounds trite; however, if you could only own one CD","review":"Hartman, the only vocalist Coltrane ever recorded with, is smoother than smooth. I've listened to my recording 100's of times. If you like the straight ahead be-bop of the golden age of the 50's buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"In the mood to get lucky?","review":"The smooth sensuous sounds of Coltrane's sax combined with the mellifluous tones of Johnny's voice will woo women into a profound state of arousal. This CD is very mellow and is the perfect accompaniment to a full bodied wine and a few candles. The songs are standards and easy to listen to, but the musicianship of Coltrane and Hartman is amazing. Hartman shines in \\"Autumn Serenade\\" and gives the listener a true sense of heart break in \\"Lush Life\\". Coltrane is impressive throughout the CD, particularly because his phrasing and lyricism is deeper than on some of his previous releases. Perhaps that is the result of the interplay between his sax and Johnny's voice. Men, buy this CD. And do it before Valentine's Day."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Masterpiece of American Music","review":"Like Kind of Blue and a small number of other Jazz Albums, this is a flawless masterpiece where everything comes together on every track. The result is heartbreakingly beautiful music - so beautiful in fact that although I have listened to and loved this album for over 25 years, I cannot listen to it frequently. It's beauty and poetry forces me to stop anything I am doing insist that I focus purely on the music, and all too often it puts me on the verge of tears. (Warning - I cry in movies alot too :)This jazz album is one of the United States great cultural contributions to the world and as long as people have ears to hear and hearts to feel, they will be listening to and loving this remarkable album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Much Coltrane","review":"John Coltrane is overwhelmed by the dated, drippy ballads on this album. In the 60's, every jazz musician had to do a ballad album just the same as everyone did a bossanova album. The music audience who had either given up jazz for rock or could not deal with jazz that was more cerebral were putting pressure on declining jazz sales. John Coltrane watered down his sound for a few ballad albums and then went right back to his real \\"sheets of sound\\" force of nature. Even \\"My Favorite Things\\" was transformed into a transcental experience. This album though clearly sounds forced. If you dislike Coltrane because you don't find him accessible, you might enjoy this album. However, you are missing out on the real deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Listening Pleasure!!","review":"What can I say other than if you like John Coltrane And Jonny Hartman on there own separate CDs then you're going to love them together. This CD is Excellent!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"sax'n'voice","review":"The perfect combination of the ultimate jazz instrumentalist, John Coltrane,and the seriously musical crooner, Johnny Hartman.

Their interpretation of The Lush Life, in particular,brings tears to the eyes and soul."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the best.","review":"This is one of the best of all time jazz recordings. Just buy it...you won't regret it. (the system is making me add more words, but I've said it all.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hartman at his best","review":"This is probably the greatest jazz vocal recording ever made. Hartman is awesome led by Lush Life - one of the most difficult of Strayhorn's songs to master. I have listened to this recording over 1,000 times and I still have a lot to hear. Jazz classic and the foundation of my collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coltrane and Hartman ...a classy act","review":"By far the best alblum ever made in the Jazz world.

Thank you gentlemen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential Listening","review":"Separately Coltrane and Hartman are great artists. Together they complement one another so much. This is a must buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful, beautiful voice","review":"I have known about the voice of Johnny Hartman for years, but I have just discovered this CD. Hartman's voice is simply beautiful. Lush and smooth as velvet he carries each song in this CD to the best it could possibly be. Coltrane is wonderful too. Never overwhelming, Coltrane adds just enough to make this a very, very special CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hartman and Coltrane: Jazz Soul Mates","review":"Since this recording was originally issued, I've played it literally thousands of times. And the last time touched me emotionally as powerfully as the first time. Every track is a masterpiece of sensitive interpretation, but Strayhorn's Lush Life gets my vote as the most artistically perfect jazz ballad ever recorded. If my house were on fire, I'd brave the inferno to rescue this recording."},{"rating":"1","title":"hmm, high points and low points","review":"Hmmm, i bought this, and i'll take a few tracks from this for mixtapes, but the album as a whole flops. Other reviewers said his other album is better, I dont know, I havent heard it.Lights, labial, and lysine are good tracks, the other stuff aims high and misses.Lights reminds me of quasimodolabial reminds me of tipsyand lysine reminds me of they might be giantsSo its pretty wild on the influences, and the sound is full of variety, but the other tracks are let downs. They try but don't have the fun and cohesive sound of these tracks. I like the videogame sounds, but the album doesn't use them on more than 2 or 3 tracks."},{"rating":"1","title":"somethings not quite right","review":"i really liked his last effort, mostly cause of its naive charm. it sounded like he was trying to make a serious album, only he had the worst materials to put it together with, whereas on this one its the other way round. he ups the production on it considerably, but now its the songwriting thats cheap and tacky.i dont mean to be harsh, but hes trying really hard to sound all quaint and charming, and theres only maybe three places on the album where it comes off. MBGATE, as mentioned in the other reviews, is one of them cause it sounds like hes trying to make a semi-straight dance track. the rest of the album sounds just way too wink-wink nudge-nudge ironic in its amateurness.compare Cake off the first one to anything off this, and you'll get an idea. instead of a complex collection of songs made with bad source sounds (which works on the first one), this one turns out like an IDM version of mr scruff. thats not a good thing.im sorry, but it gets old quickly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Innacurate Dimensions","review":"First and foremost, the dimensions of the bag are completely inaccurate.The product description states that it's 20.5\\" x 15\\" x 7.75-12.75\\". The bag comes with a product tag attached to it that reflects closer to what it really is: 17.5\\" x 12.25\\" x 6\\".The document compartment on the back should have been made slightly larger to accomodate the standard 8.5\\" x 11\\" document size, which it doesn't. Overall, the bag is nice."},{"rating":"1","title":"meh.. cheap clasps","review":"Not really the Mil-Spec type quality I was hoping for. The strap clasps are plastic and detach easily. They haven't broken, but I don't see them standing up to much real abuse. I've had them detach quite easily on a couple occasions as well when i put my hand on the clasp while carrying it on my shoulder, (since it's a rather natural place to rest your hand.) Having one end of the strap detach sends the bag to the ground pretty quickly if there's any weight in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent on many levels","review":"This film is a must see for many reasons, primarily because it documents the very end of the ~15,000 year legacy of free Native Americans on this continent: \\"Ishi,\\" the last Yahi and free ranging Native American is forced by circumstance to enter modern civilization in the early 20th Century in California. The historical significance alone makes it worth seeing.Beyond that, Graham Greene and Jon Voight give outstanding and moving performances. Greene (who is always excellent - Clearcut, Thunderheart, Dances With Wolves, etc.) as Ishi, and Voight as the genius anthropologist who takes him in.Voight's character is a pure scientist through and through who finds it difficult to get emotionally involved with much of anything. He prefers to look at the world in terms of evidence and hard data. He is distant as his wife is dying, and Ishi tells him (paraphrasing) 'you put me in your book, but not in your heart.'"},{"rating":"1","title":"this movie was not that great","review":"this movie was not some of their best work.

The documentary will give you all the facts if you are a history buff. Graham Green gives what I think is his best performance in any movie roll he has played. The story was well told. It moved me to tears many times and was gut wrentching at times as well. The triumphs of Ishi will make you want to stand up and cheer and you'll laugh at his innocent mistakes. A masterful job by all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Touching movie","review":"I knew this story was based on actual events, and have always been interested in Native American history, so I was pleased that the story was well done, without any \\"over acting\\" or sappiness.

WHEN I MAKE LOVE. THIS IS JUST AN ENJOYABLE PLEASURE TO INDULGE IN. I EVEN OWN TWO OF THEM, FOR JUST IN CASE. 'IN A SENTIMENTAL MOOD' AND 'MY LITTLE BROWN BOOK' ARE TRUE GEMS. BUT THE ENTIRE ALBUM MOVES ME."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"The album starts with one of the greatest versions of a jazz song - \\"In A Sentimental Mood\\". Coltrane's playing on it is brilliant, and Duke's piano playing sounds much better than in the 1941 version of the same song. The bass & drum alternate between Duke's & John's. At the tempos and volumes they're playing at, there isn't a significant difference between the two sets. Coltrane's playing is a slight retreat in terms of adventurousness. It may have been mouthpiece problems or maybe because he was playing with Duke Ellington. Either way, it's lack of challenge doesn't diminish the beauty of the playing. Some have said Duke sounds more modern than Coltrane, but I don't hear that. This album won't turn your personal jazz world on its ear, but it is a lot of fun to listen to. It's also fine for non-jazz fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mutual respect brings two jazz greats together.","review":"Seemingly being polar opposites, I was taken aback when I first ran across this title. It turns out to be a beautiful collaboration. In case we all forgot, Coltrane can play the more traditional ballads with fantastic results. Likewise, Duke strays from what we know him best for, and plays a more loose, improvisational set than we are accustomed to hearing. If you love Coltane's more tame, controlled recordings (ie. Ballads, My Favorite Things, etc.) you must check this album out. Just the fact that these two played together should be enough for most fans of the genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glorified List!","review":"This book is simply an extensive list of artist biographies with a brief summary of their work.

Very Very rugged to say the least."},{"rating":"1","title":"Purity at a cost...","review":"The strength of this CD is its purity - there are no other instruments used on this recording. Only the sounds of Singing Bowls. However, as much as Thea Surasu allows the vibration of the Singing Bowls to stretch out to a complete fade away, there are large gaps of silence between bowl sounds. These gaps often exceed about 30 seconds or longer, and they are frequent - Just when I get to the point that I am used to the singing bowl vibrations, they stop. Just when I get used to the silence, it stops. The back-and-forth keeps me from being able to meditate with these sounds.The vibrations of the bowls is stretched out to such an extent that only about 10% of the sound comes through the 6-speaker audio in my car! Thus, don't expect much from this CD unless you have a good-quality stereo.So, it's no good in the car, and doesn't work for me in mediation. ... Frankly, I expected more from Steven Halpern!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Authors Missed so much","review":"The authors' logistics in this book is as confusing as their language used to try to teach this simple math subject.

They substitute lengthy processes in lieu of essential formulas, such as the confidence interval formula, and the formulas used in hypothesis testing. Examples of problems are sparse, and the authors' work is generally not shown, but rather they imply that the student already knows what they are doing (kind of like moving across four lanes with no turn signal, \\"Everyone knew what I was doing!\\")This book got two stars because, since it is a paperback, it is cheap."},{"rating":"1","title":"The authors missed so much","review":"The authors' logistics in this book is as confusing as their language used to try to teach this simple math subject.
