His amazing honky-tonk voice was the essence of this band (which has had numerous personnel changes over the years). However, I was pleasantly surprised by how good this CD is. Brian Hofeldt has done a great job as the full-time lead singer. While there are a few very fine vintage honky-tonk songs here, the other songs are very good rockabilly/mild country tunes.

These guys were pop-country want-to-bes with little remaining style, wit, humor, emotion or those beautiful harmonies I truly grew to love. I left before the show was over.

The instructions are general and not detailed and contain no patterns. The photos are mostly cute, but the crafts really are only so-so.

My router (also a RangeMax N, not the Gigabit version), is located in the basement and provides decent coverage on one side of my 3 story home. The access point is located on the opposite side of the basement and covers the rest of the home beautifully.

Za-Za, was completely overlooked even by people who were previously fans of the band. This is unfortunate, because this was the best album to date by the band. Nice ballads and blues driven rockers were fairly typical of the band, but their lyrics had matured and their already impressive music talents had done the same. \\"When Pigs Fly\\", \\"For The Damned\\" and \\"Laughing With The Dead\\" stand out just as much as any of the group's hits from the previous two albums. In my opinion, there were even hints of the so called nu-metal sound that exists today. I'm not sure if Godsmack or Disturbed ever heard this album, but I'm sure this band and/or bands like it influenced the music we hear today. If you're a fan of metal, buy this album and see for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bullet Boys - 'Za Za' (Warner Brothers)","review":"Not nearly as good as either of their prior efforts,their self-titled debut or 'Freakshow'.The only two cuts I even thought were somewhat worthwhile are the opener \\"When Pigs Fly\\" and \\"Cross Top\\".The band's big mistake might've been to put not one,but two cheezy ballads on here,their third album.\\"Sing A Song\\" and \\"Mine\\" are not good.I've always thought as the Bulletboys to be sort of like a David Lee Roth rip-off anyway.Still,a good band to catch live."},{"rating":"1","title":"An unhappy costumer","review":"This product did never arrive at my address (hence the poor rating...).

If I met my therapist on an elevator and he aknowledged my presence by closing his eyes and concentrating on his breathing, I would not make it all the way to his office.

From his walks with his grandfather to the questions of life and death. Wisdom and right action should be the goal of our lives. We spend too much time fighting to get \\"stuff\\" we think we need... How do we treat our elders who have cared for us as children? How do we treat eachother and the earth?The lakota views of life, death, and wisdom makes alot of sense to me at least. The CD that comes with the book is Mr. Marshall speaking these wisdom stories.. I really enjoyed the book and CD very much. It made me remember my own childhood and the time spent with my own grandparents. They taught me alot too, and years later the simple wisdom of their teachings shine true still. This would make a good gift for young adults I think.. Enjoy the stories and the teachings!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lessons for life","review":"An easy read, comfortable and story-like.

Anyone with seniority in the airlines will always pick Coach to work to avoid the egos, arrogance, rudeness and tantrums of the rich and famous. Your tongue in cheek outlook will not be picked up by many. Life as a flight attendant, your fellow crewmembers, the behind the scene antics and even the foul language is right on the mark.

BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"An exercise in vulgarity","review":"If art is an indiscretion against oneself, then this book is certainly artful: Ms. Benson admits to things most of us wouldn't tell a twin soul. Spitting in passengers' drinks, expelling fetid gas in their faces, screwing them in toilets in order to score concert tickets - these are the sort of things Ms. Benson not only admits, but celebrates.

The wrappers are just a little too big for the coins. They don't hold the coins nice and tight like the ones you get from the bank.

In this age of \\"green\\" living, and with the title ORGANIC, I was expecting a book on using natural materials, reusing older pieces, or at the least jewelry that is more simplistic in form. This is not at all what you will find in this book. The vast majority of projects are material heavy projects, featuring the only \\"organic\\" materials listed-real gemstone new beads.While the projects are pretty, they are fairly complex for all but the more advanced beader, and are QUITE expensive to make. The author even puts the material costs in each project. The cheapest one listed is $25 (all polymer clay), with the majority being in the $50-$100 range! Unrealistic and out of the cost bracket for all but the wealthiest crafter. I would not recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, please","review":"I just had to write a brief review, seeing as how this album had nothing but five-star reviews. Of course, my negative review will inevitably be declared as \\"not useful\\" to others who disagree with me. Fine. However, let me say that not everyone thinks this album is fantastic - or even good, for that matter. Just because a person has decent talent in playing an instrument does not give him a license to churn out shameless muzak like this, and that's EXACTLY what this is - vapid, meritless muzak. If that's your thing, fine, disagree with me and say this review is useless. I say YOUR MUSIC is useless.

Good choice, I thought. If there ever was a contest to define a perfect album, this CD would probably make the final four. Every tune is smooth, tight and played perfectly by two jazz masters - James and Kluge. I think that if I was only allowed to have 10 CDs, this would be one, along with Time Out and Kind of Blue.

On vinyl it really sounds terrific.One caveat though, is that my disc came out of its protective case with GLUE on Blitzkreig Bop. I couldn't even really clean the stuff off of the vinyl without almost ruining the record. Also the spindle hole was printed wrong and fit too tightly onto the spindle, so that the record got stuck. I had to get a bunch of sweaty fingerprints all over the second side to even get the dang thing off the turntable.But oh well, that happens.Since its rough beginnings, I've heard this at least eight times all the way through, and it sounds terrific. So punk, so tough. You can really hear the drums and bass, and Joey Ramone's snarl.So even though blitzkreig bop now has a pop in it, the quality of the music is five stars, and I'm sure that most of these things are being released without glue on them.ps: this is my favorite record (out of twenty or so) that I own (as in vinyl, not cd)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"I am a long time Ramones lover and when saw this record, became ecstatic.

Mudhoney were there from the very beginning and stood somewhere between Seattle's trashy underground and it's more popular bands. Grunge is about initially wanting to play the cool sounds you love to listen to but realizing that you're not really able to. Or, at least, about being too lazy to keep trying. It's produced by self-proclaimed losers who start to rape musical ideas. You'll find that in perfection on 'Piece of Cake': Noisy lo-fi-songs, nosy lo-fi-vocals and fuzzy guitars, creating some sort of 'garage-rock'n'roll'. They don't use any style-corset. It is what it is. Loud and dirty, but honest. One might call it 'Seattle Soul'. And on this album, Mudhoney found the right mix of fast and slower songs, with a few funny suckerpunches at other music styles, and no filler material. It's their best one."},{"rating":"2","title":"just short of \\"classic\\" status","review":"What's the real skinny on this album? Well, about 50% of the songs are brilliant. The other 50% are just fine/ok. Now realize that in the music world you are often lucky to find an album which has three good songs together. This record has a lot of tracks, and you can find at least 7-8 gems. There are no \\"skip\\" songs, and you can listen right through very nicely. It's true- a lot of the grunge and postgrunge movements have owed a lot to bands that just missed the high point in the hype (the Pixies also come to mind)-- Mudhoney is one of the best of these protogrungers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Crap","review":"Mudhoney was one of my favorite bands until this album.

NO! They run through a dance at top speed, then \\"teach\\" the dance all at once at regular speed, and tell the kids to REWIND IT if they want to learn the dance! There is no way for my daughter to keep up and possibly learn a thing!This appears to be a vanity project set up by some of the parents or something, who decided to show off what dance class dollars have accomplished.Other inanities include: constant blurbs about how exercise is cool, really awful contrived jokes, terrible acting and special features that, if you weren't so mad about the uselessness and frustration factor of this disc, might be fun to ridicule otherwise."},{"rating":"2","title":"The only book of its kind","review":"There are plenty of books about movie collectibles, and some about animal collectibles; but this is the only book that combines the two.

And like the majority of our congregation, I don't like it. In taking gender out of some things and using more modern pronouns and other factors, they have destroyed some of the most beautiful poetry.

In my humble opinion, \\"Dear Lord and Father of Mankind\\" shouldn't be altered to become \\"Dear God Embracing Humankind.\\" It just doesn't have the same impact. Neither does \\"Nearer My God to You\\" in place of \\"Nearer My God to Thee.\\" And don't even get me started on what they did to the Christmas carols. I suppose I can understand the need to change some things, but this is really over the top and overdone."},{"rating":"1","title":"A camel is a horse designed by committee","review":"For Congregationalist churches in the northeast, especially those in southeast Massachusetts, it seems a shame that the UCC, owner of the Pilgrim Press, killed the \\"Pilgrim Hymnal\\" to promote this book. For older church members this replacement seems like a lot of the progressive agenda, shoved down our throat whether we like it or not.Our congregation was told by the (liberal) minister that the Pilgrim Hymnal was \\"out of print\\" without being told that it was killed to promote this hymnal and without opening up discussion on other (better) choices.

I expected to recieve a hymnal like the large print United Methodist Hymnal that truly is a hardcover hymnal with lyrics and music and very little bigger than the standard hymnal.

It is far superior having more hymns, new hymns,and many from diferent cultures. The inclusive language uis good but lacks consistency.

If I could have only one hymnal, the New Century Hymnal would be it. The accompaniments are very musical and the selection is wide-ranging. I especially appreciate the inclusion of Spanish-language hymns and hymns from other countries. People who need to sing \\"thy\\" and \\"thou\\" in the 21st Century aren't going to like this hymnal; and people who don't really think about the text of what they are singing won't like the changes to the language.

Unlike most purple fans, I had always been just a moderate fan but when my favorite guitarist joined the band I grew to love the older purple stuff. And the new stuff with Steve is outstanding. This band is so tight and they have regained that youthful enthusiasm that resulted in classics like In Rock, Fireball, and Machine Head. The concert is well worth the $25 but the added extras make it a wonderful deal. Even if you are just a moderate Deep Purple fan you should try to see this performance. I am confident you will then buy Purpendicular and Abandon (the two Deep Purple CDs with Morse). I also recommend the Live at the Olympia CD from the Purpendicular tour."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware!!!

Don't get me wrong, I like Deep Purple, ever since the 70s. DP's music should sound heavy and rich: the DVD sounds thin and radio-like: whether its the acoustics of the venue or the recording process, I cannot tell. The band plays reasonably well, and Steve Morse shines, though again his guitar sounds lighter than usual, thus lessening the impact of his playing. Finally, Ian, the lead singer, was clearly in bad shape. He fails to hit the requiste high notes and ends up sounding like a squeaky mouse. This from the baddest in the 70s...and it ain't just the recording. If you are a Deep Purple fan look for something else or stick with your audio recordings...avoid this one and don't make th mistake of confusing liking their music and purschasing this DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deep Purple- Live in Australia 1999","review":"Most reveiws are not correct concerning this DVD. While Morse is an excellent guitar player, this DVD sucked! As you would expect, Deep Purple, as it was during this taping, is downright boring! If you are a true Purple fan, you will go back and enjoy Ritchie Blackmore in the older tapings and deal with the 20 year old technology, and enjoy these without hesitation. That was the real and only Deep Purple. No others making up this band will ever compete! I was duped into wasting my money on this DVD by a bunch of wanabee young Purple fans writing reveiws, that obviously can't and will not ever comprehend what Ritchie did for the band. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, Fantastic","review":"I stopped listening to DP since Blackmore left them. I like Blackmore and consider him all time #1 guitarist, but I did not like his new trend. So I decided to give this one a chance. It was great, GREAT. Each member in DP is a whole band by himself. Mr. Lord is as amazing as always. Steve Morse is the right choice and he was so lively in this concert. His performance is just perfect. I'm back to DP. The only song that I did not like was \\"Tedd the mechancis\\". I've been listenig to DP since early 70's and consider them the biggest rock band in history. They just did not get enough attention here in the US. I just feel sorry for the new generation who are listening to nowadays so called \\"rock music\\" which I consider it Garbage, performed by so called \\" musicians\\" who cannot put few words together or write a song that can be remembered for generations or few months.

Sly lays down rhythm tracks so tight, you could count down the next NASA rocket going into orbit with it. And Robbie lays down bass riffs so funky and imaginative, no two bars are exactly alike, yet the discipline to not stray is formidable.Coupled with the raw dub effects and Michael Rose and Puma's voices echoing in and out, this album is one you can listen to over and over without it ever growing old on you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well illustrated","review":"I have read a lot of books on 911.

The venerable South American Handbook, also from Footprint, weighs not much more and covers the whole continent. This new book is also short on info ... only 8 accomodations listings in La Paz, vs. about 50 in the SA Handbook. And there is no listing at all for Iquitos, one of Peru's largest cities, or Cajamarca, one of the historically most significant. I have used the SAH extensively, and thought this new book would be at least as informative for the three countries covered .... what a disappointment. Cannot recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Discipiling Jane","review":"I wish I could have given this book zero stars. It was probably one of the worst books I've ever read. It had very little to do with spanking and discipline. It had more to do with scatologic erotica. It was almost nauseating to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"The retelling of a classic that misses the mark!","review":"Jane Eyre is one of my favorite classics and I thought that an erotic retelling of Charlotte Bronte's memorable heroine would be an interesting read. I agree with this book's preface about Jane Eyre having some algolagnic and sadomasochistic undertones throughout, but this retelling of Jane's rather interesting discipline at Lowood Boarding School misses the mark. I found it silly instead of erotic, wooden instead of smoldering. What disappointment! The unidentified author's imagination is nowhere near as overactive as Anne Rice's when she wrote the Sleeping Beauty series. I'll stick to the classic novel and its vague erotic implications -- whether they're real or imagined."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Erotica of a Special Kind","review":"There is a person who goes under the name of P.N.Dedeaux. His books are consistently related to the English Vice. They are also,unfortunately published by Blue Moon books and other publishers of Erotica, under the name of Anonymous and with different titles.This was originally titled An English Education and is a veiled (very) take off on Jane Eyre. That part is total nonnsense, although it might to some give a sense of historical dating; I guess during Victorian times, some of the 'discipline' did occur in some schools.From that perspective, it achieves what it set out to do. He is singlemindedly after various forms of corporal punishment of young girls, and for those who enjoy such narratives, this author is tops. This book is among the better books. He goes to extremes in the end of most of his books and this one is no exception. Not for the casual erotica readers.The best of his other books are: under different titles: The Tutor, The Sensualist etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Sadists-not purists..","review":"I was enticed by the opening and disappointed almost immediately after. What a shame. There are so many opportunities within Jane Eyre itself, that i was surprised the author did so little with the huge opportunity placed before him(her). The book is purely for die hard sadists. \\"Jane\\" herself isn't even enjoying her descent into submission like a good sub-it all smells of torture to me. It was so bad it made me want to write merely to show the author how it should be done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nostalgic-easy listening and sing along music","review":"How I admire Kathie Lee in her devotion to exel in everything she does. The timing she has as she sings these wonderful memorable songs. As I drive along I am constantly trying to get the timing down as I attempt to sing along with the cassette. I have noticed the difference in her singing since she has been taking lessons all these years. Just keeps getting better and better. I have always wanted to see one of her shows but haven't been able to yet. I highly recommend this albumn, cd or cassette. I would love to see this type of entertainment come back. Where shows are shows, songs are understandable and people are as loving and giving as Kathie Lee is. Thank you for being such an inspiration for me Kathie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kathie Lee's finest","review":"This is one of the few albums I've heard where practically every track is a delight from start to finish. It's like a mint julep on a hot summer's day ---- pleasant, refreshing, and smooth. Every song on this CD has been recorded many times before, and by the pantheon of great American singers. You won't find any undiscovered musical nuggets here. What makes this album a standout, however, is that everything on it is just right: Mrs. Gifford's singing, the first-rate backup arrangements, and the quality of the recorded sound. If I had to single out one special aspect that particularly appeals to me, it would be Kathie Lee's understated delivery. Instead of an obvious \\"belt-'em-out\\" performance, she goes for a more relaxed presentation, as if she were gently singing to her kids before bedtime. While this approach may not work that well in a live performance, it invites the listener to repeated spins of this very special CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Mood Music","review":"If you are a Kathie Lee fan than you will really enjoy this Cd.. It is wonderful to relax to at the end of the day when it is time to unwind or when you just want that quiet time while you are driving. It is very soothing and refreshing. It will take you back in time when music was music. When you listened to the words and the music moved you. I would recommand this to anyone who is looking for mood music."},{"rating":"2","title":"kathie lee sings great!","review":"it always amazes me when people bash kathie lees vocal talents. i bought this when first realeased and have played it ever since. i love the old standards and she does a great job singing them. pay NO attention to those who just want to bash her to prove their cool.

Honest. And it was excrutiatingly painful. This woman cannot sing. She tries, and it makes a normal person wonder why there are certain \\"celebrities\\" who consider themselves talented vocalists. KL is right there at the top of the list. Something tells me that if she were to star in a movie, people would also flock to see it just because she was in it. So its no wonder that thousands choose to listen to KL not cause she can can sing, but because its Kathie(look-at-me)Lee. There's too many wonderful natural born singers out there in the world to waste one's time with this recording."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful \\"lost\\" Williams and Delerue music","review":"Honestly, the only reason I gave this 4 instead of 5 stars is that these are new recordings rather than the originals, and there are subtle faults in these versions of John Williams' otherwise sublime title themes (which I knew very well from watching the show).\\"The Mission,\\" despite the fact that he isn't conductiong, still comes across as classic Williams music, huge and suspenseful and magical. Actually, some his best work in my opinion.The late Georges Delerue's \\"Dorothy and Ben\\" score is without a doubt some of the saddest music I've ever heard. And if you've seen this episode of the show it should be twice as moving for you (it's the one about the old man who awakens from a long coma and picks up psychic messages from a little girl who is still in a coma). Great music from a great piece of television.If you like great film music, you'll love this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"great performance - OK recording","review":"The performance is outstanding (would one expect any less from the Philly Orchestra?)

The book is extremely well structured. The author, in examining, what it means, specifically, to be American, takes us seemlessly through the history of the Afro-American in the US through poignant discriptives of key black trials. Each story is told with meticulous, at times excruciating, detail down to the color of Indian cloth for which young African boys were traded. Every sight, smell, and stutter of speech noted to present the reader with an immaculate image of the moment.I am sure that Prof. Weiner's conclusion that the Afro-American now \\"belongs\\" (i.e. is not an outcaste in American society) is debatable by both liberals and conservatives, but the history and the final arguments are well stated and worth the time to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Threads on the handle keeps wearing out","review":"Do not buy this faucet and shower, I had this for 2 years, and threads on the handle keeps wearing out, replaced the facet twice in two years, but now I need to take out the tiles to put a new unit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bossa Nova rocks","review":"This cd was the first of many brazilian bossa novas I've bought.

Imagine my surprise when, much later, I read Kafka's Metamorphosis, and found that the comic book that the girl found the advertisment in was the same story! Then, when I began to think about it more, I saw that the whole story is based on Metamorphosis, sort of. Especially towards the end, when the main character begins to find herself becomming more and more bird-like, and is less and less in control. If you have ever read Metamorphosis, read this book to see what I mean. If you have ever read this book, and you are over age 15, try reading Kafka's Metamorphosis and you'll see what I mean.

Yngwie Malmsteen is well known for giving 110% at his shows and this video reflects that! Words to describe the performance: Passionate, Powerful, Baroque, Explosive, Antonio and Pure. Today, in a world music that contains Loops, Samples, turntable scratches, and other crutches..Yngwie Malmsteen LIVE! brings forth pure metal and does it honestly without tricks or gimmicks. If your a fan of metal you definately DESERVE to own this video. There are legends we know of who have passed, then there are those who are still alive. Here is one who NEVER gave up and to this day remains the undoubtable Vivaldi ala Pagannini of the Fender Stratocaster. This and more is included in YNGWIE MALMSTEEN LIVE!

The visual quality of this DVD concert is really good, but at times rather cheesy. As for the audio, it is really something to be desired. Not only is it mixed at a terribly low volume, but I can't even hear a seperation within the instruments. I can't believe what I heard. My dad and I recorded a song using a small mic and an MD recorder and it sounds a million times better than this DVD! How can a small mic and MD recorder sound better than the audio mix on this DVD?

Ones where the author and illustrator are less in love with their own abilities, amd more genuinely interested in what will appeal to, and challenge, young minds."},{"rating":"2","title":"There Is More Under The Earth and Sky Than Your Science, Horatio","review":"I really enjoyed this book. It belongs in the category of intuitive knowledge, things which we know from a sense that the science establishment refuses to acknowledge despite overwhelming evidence and a successful track record. The reading is light, with just enough technical detail to lay a good foundation for the ideas which, though they cannot be considered theory, have enough clout to convince the reader that there is more to predicting earthquakes than meters and measurements, or at least an alternative method for the open minded."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ripoff","review":"And the major labels wonder why folks have deserted them...$21 for 43 minutes of music is a disgrace, there is a serious error by the violinist, and the sound is just mediocre. I'd recommend you buy the Naxos with Jando and the Kodaly Quartet: good sound, excellent performance(s) - and the Schumann Quintet too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hayley's Debut","review":"Although she was only 12 or 13 when this movie was made, I consider it to be Mills' finest performance. Many of the scenes in which she appears seem improbable - a precocious young, cute tomboy in a poor section of town who tells lies, stays out late at night, refuses to turn in a murderer because she wants his gun, and befriends him as seeks to escape the clutches of the law. Yet despite the improbabilities, Mills makes her character, 'Gilley' seem as believably real as any of the adult characters and gives little Gilley a larger than life character image. Little wonder it is that when Lillian Disney saw this film she told her husband Walt that he must put Mills in some Disney movies.At times, the movie seems a little soap opery, and the price seems rather high but Mills' performance makes it a movie that one wants to see again and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"So excited to finally have this!","review":"I love all of Hayley Mills earlier movies andwas hoping to find this one, since it was her 1st.I had to find a way to view it, since it is a Region 2,but was able to find a player."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tiger bay","review":"Hayley mills' first movie, and one of the best.-it was made in england-so, you'll either meed a region 2 player, or a region free player, or look up 'dud duplicators' in the yellow pages and have someone put on a region 1 disk.-an old movie, so it is in b&w. very good anyway!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tiger Bay DVD","review":"I purchased this DVD without realizing that DVD's are \\"coded\\" by region; unfortunately a UK DVD will not play in a US DVD player. Amazon promptly refunded my money, so all was well."},{"rating":"2","title":"A remarkable story beautifully told!","review":"I first saw this movie at Goose Bay AFB in Labrador on a cold winter's night at the base theatre. I had no idea what was being shown, nor had any of the other GI's who attended that evening. Near the end of the film there is a particularly exciting moment and the entire audience - well over a thousand guys! - gasped with astonishment! At the end there was applause and shouts of \\"Great movie!\\" Several of us followed the movie as it wound its way to the many theatres on the air base, and we took others who hadn't seen it who were also deeply moved by the story. Over the years, now on video tape and DVD (Hurrah!) this \\"little\\" movie never fails to deliver its huge emotional impact. Hayley Mills (pre-Disney) and Horst Buchholz (pre-Magnificent Seven) will break your heart and then restore it. A truly great motion picture, one once discovered is never forgotten! If you haven't seen it you are missing one of the all-time classic films!"},{"rating":"2","title":"too bad it is out of print","review":"only box set with older blues faves and bob welch era tracks,all in all nice collection from just about every early album"},{"rating":"2","title":"to die for","review":"this album is the best i have ever heard. i love the mac and this is the best. it has all the best hits, all the best symphathy songs, and ALL the best love making songs. i will always be here for anything new and will ALWAYS love Fleetwood Mac....#1"},{"rating":"1","title":"Was ripped off!","review":"was sent one disc when advertised as box set....im very disappointed!

All due respect to Vermonters but his going through Burlington should have gotten a footnotes mention and nothing more. As far as his bad book editing abilities for Burlington and other things.Blame Idle not the publishing company that put the book out. Why should they risk offending a bankable star who wishes to use their company? He could've simply took his book biz elsewhere if they angered him. Away from the other Pythons Idle has little talent of his own as this book proves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time","review":"I love Eric Idle and Python but this book is NOT a pleasure to read. I kept reading it just to be fair to him. I held out hope that it would get better. It never did.While some of his personal accounts were interesting, there's a glut of boring, meaningless details. The funniest part of the entire book was the song lyrics, and most of those were well known Python songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better Than An All Access Pass","review":"This \\"diary\\" is far from a new literary concept, albeit one that sure is amongt the most fun to read. City-by-city, day-by-day we get the oft off-center musing of one of today's genuine comic geniui (is this plural of genius?).We see the towns and venues and audiences from the performer's perspective, which provides some keen insight into the way his unique point of view evolves. After reading this, I think of Eric as a friend rather than a sleb. He's honest and witty. But what is more, he's also not impressed with his star stature in the entertainment industry.Hanging with Mr. Idle is quite imossible for most of us. But this book is better than an All Access backstage pass for the entire tour."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly personal","review":"Of the six Monty Python members, Eric Idle has been the most enigmatic. His work is well known, but Idle the human being has been less public. What is surprising, and gratifying, about this book is that Idle opens up and lets us inside his mind a bit. The picture that emerges is of a thoughtful, intelligent, sensitive man . The book is gently funny, but the humor arises out of his natural wit, and not the antic contrivances of a Monty Python skit. Idle also writes about the death of his mother and his close friendship with George Harrison, with an unexpected emotional openness. Recommended highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good mix of humor, travel narrative, and Python history","review":"I really enjoyed this book on a number of levels. Idle has a lot of heart and a lot of humor and he isn't selfish with either. I have the giant Python book, which is essential, but this one was easier to get through and more fun to read. It's personal and entertaining- in equal portions. That's hard to pull off.I missed this tour and felt like a donkey for missing it. However, this book relieved some of my donkey feelings by letting me know what the whole thing was like. By the end of it I wanted to be his bus driver.It was very interesting to hear the stories about his mum, George Harrison, and Bill Clinton. It was also nice he didn't beat up on the South but took it for what it is.I still feel like a donkey for missing the tour the more I think about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed","review":"I was hoping for the repeated brilliance that can be heard on Art Blakey's \\"New Year's Eve at Sweet Basil\\"or the more recent jazz \\"Nouveau Swing\\" CD.3D is a good cross-over studio CD.

Conflict that takes the characters (Rataxes and his band, anyway) to the brink of violence...It's fine to anthropomorphize to make a point, and with Babar the point is fine, because he's kind, thoughtful, and peaceful. But the poor rhinos, the treatment they receive here, is pathetic...Please -- pass on this one. Go with Shel Silverstein or other rhino authors. Early Babar books, fine..."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Sixth Dimension","review":"From the time I was young, I was interested in astronomy. I thought maybe if I understood a little how God constructed the physical universe, it might throw a little light on who or what God was. It remained a mystery to me. What was the nature of the unseen spiritual world? None of the many western books offered even a clue about this. The Sixth dimension has two figures that immediately caught my attention showing the 7 ascending celestial abodes and the 5 ascending Divine abodes.There is much, much more packed into this book. Swamiji explains gravity, time energy, the human mind, sanskars, psychic powers, astral travel, spiritual healing, in short, all the varied phenomena in the material world. Then he explains the composition and properties of the Divine world and how a soul can actually attain the divine abodes. This book should especially appeal to anyone with a scientific inclination who is open-minded and sincerely wishes to find God."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unlike anything else!","review":"AVA has been one of those books that I return to on a regular basis. Each time I pick it up, I remember the first time I moved through it, sometimes crying, often laughing , but most often marvelling at its beauty. Ava Klein walks us through the fragmented recollections of her life -- things she tasted, lovers she's known, places she's visited and people who have left an impact on her. Maso writes in snippets of thought,her text reminding me of the way the human mind works (our thoughts rarely take a linear path, most often they're kind of all over, spinning around). I urge you to pick up this book and just flow through it, enjoying, if nothing else, the beauty and immediacy of the words. AVA is brilliant and wonderful; it is a work you will come back to often just so you can remember what a gift it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"He,s Good Teacher","review":"He is hendry,hank W7UD is his son when i when to clover park tc back in 1985.I learn how to trouble shoot and real good,so i brout thebook"},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly educational booklet","review":"This pamphlet is available through your physician, midwife, childbirth educator, or other caregiver.

The original (VHS) is soooo much better. Even the ending is funnier and more appropriate. They totally made the ending unbelievable in the DVD.

That didn't change when the license went back to the BBC and they started making the Eighth Doctor books -- if anything, it got worse.\\"Trading Futures\\" is a welcome respite from that. It's a fun, fast-moving action adventure, something like the Third Doctor might have gotten up to.

The rest comes from listening to what latter-day animators and comedians like Robin Williams and Whoopi Goldberg have to say about his influence on their own work, and hearing Leonard Maltin articulate what made Jones's cartoons funnier and more brilliant than anyone else's.

The only saving grace was that he wasn't portrayed as Irish as well!The heroine is a Spinster psychic (another popular Victorian Romance cliche)-what I couldn't understand is why she was written as strong enough to go to the police after having a vision of a murder, but quickly loses all reason and becomes dreary and ditzy-taking abuse from everyone, family included.The final small, but odd straw is the cover-why is a Victorian street policeman wearing a velvet cape like some Elizabethan popinjay?This book was not my cup of tea but others have given it positive reviews so you may want to try it for yourself.2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tepid Romance","review":"My thoughts on this novel, it is a mild and very gentle romance. It had the potential to be a lot more but in some ways fell rather flat for me.Sophie Haversham could at times \\"see\\" into the future, she could foretell certain events, in this case the would be murder of Detective Mick Dunbar a Scotland Yard Detective.The main components of this book, the romance and mystery were bland, tepid. For me the romance didn't sizzle, there wasn't a lot of chemistry between Sophie and Mick. The mystery component was a fizzer, and I really didn't care when the culprit was \\"unmasked.\\" I have read a few books by the author over the years and knew to expect a gentle romance. I just found this romance to be \\"gentler\\" than the authors usual stories. It was a bit of a disappointment for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really glad I didn't pay hardback price for this","review":"I usually enjoy L. Guhrke's books. However this one was no not even close to being up to par with her others. Sadly enough, this is the book she chose to go hardback with. I guess the female character having a \\"special ability\\" could have been interesting, but it wasn't. I will continue to read this author's books unless she doesn't improve with the next few books."},{"rating":"1","title":"In a word...Boring","review":"I am so glad this wasn't my first Guhrke novel. I would have been so completely turned off! I agree with other reviewers who gave it less than 3 stars. I managed to get past page 100 (I think) but had to give up. I wasn't 'feelin' the love'. The hero was boorish and the heroine wishy-washy. It read more like a contemporary rather than a Victorian-era book. My recommendation: stick with her newer stories \\"And Then He Kissed Her\\" and \\"The Marriage Bed\\" and \\"His Every Kiss\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"A paint-by-numbers shred disc","review":"I bought both 'Universe' and Sherinian's 'Planet X' CD and of the two, preferred the latter (being more of a progger than a fusioner). Universe is more of a 'shred' disc and the tunes are pretty lame, bluesy/fusion numbers that you've heard everywhere else. First rate playing but sleep inducing.

I had hoped for something at least along the lines of \\"River of Doubt\\" by Candice Millard which is about Teddy Roosevelt's trip through the Amazon taken after his Presidential years. This was totally boring. Perhaps it would have been better later in the book but I couldn't make myself spend the time reading it to find out. Too many other books I want to read.I really enjoyed reading \\"The Endurance: Shackleton's Legendary Antarctic Expedition by Caroline Alexander (Nov 3, 1998)\\" and \\"The Floor of Heaven\\" by Howard Bloom.

I'm sorry, but I live for summer romance. I read \\"Summer Boys\\",which was awesome, but the bookstore didn't have the sequel. This was the closest thing to romance I could find in the young adult. So far, he's decided he needs to be less goody goody, and met Razzle, who he doesn't think of as girlfriend material. At the moment, they're just starting to become friends. And, I hate to say this, but I don't think there's any romance coming up. So please, don't waste your money on this!

Quite entertaining, but also quite confusing and often misinforming where it touches on the causes of the disaster. It follows the official line of putting all the blame on the station personnel (\\"thankfully\\", most of the shift personnel died soon after the catastrophe from radiation sickness). It almost completely sidetracks the real cause: the faulty reactor design which made it uncontrollable under the circumstances.If you feel confused when reading about \\"operational reactivity reserve\\" -- don't be. The author is either confused himself, or is trying (not very successfully) to cover the inadequacies of the official analysis. Too bad the Anatoly Dyatlov's book (the deputy chief engineer, one of the few first-hand participants who lived long enough to write about the disaster) wasn't ever translated from Russian."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Tragic Detective Story","review":"As the book claims- a minute by minute account of the great tragedy.

I am a fan of Troma Movies so this is right up my alley. The gore and special effects were good for a low budget movie, the girls were hot and the movie hilarious. I was rolling on the floor when the japanese girls pretending to be American Black girls first appeared. I guess growing up in the 70's when people weren't so thin skinned about everything makes my humor politically incorrect but I don't care.

The \\"black\\" humor may try to poke fun at those Yeti/Yamamba girls in Japan (with the orange tan), but it's beyond unfunny - these directors claim to want an international audience, so it's time for some sensitivity training. The cutting gags are just not funny. Also, there is little substance to offset the silliness.

This movie is bad in all the wrong ways and I have a high tolerance for cheesy movies. Here's one example of how bizarre this movie is: One scene has Frankenstein girl flying over the city with helicopter propellers drilled onto her head made of 2 legs. Bad special effects too. It's clear they spent all their money designing the cover. Save your cash."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie Is Racist To African American","review":"I have seen alot of things an heard alot things, whether to believe that most Hollywood movie is racist. If you go see a movie you see that the black guy is the first to die protecting the blond girl or he protect her at the end than the he dies at the end of the movie.On this one movie I can't think of the name where this blond girl, asian girl, and black hair white girl go to a camp, where a friend took the guy who broke his leg by climbing a mountain with his bare hand.So now he's and a wheelchair, time to fastforward a bigfoot attack the black hair girl first in the bathroom then attack the asian girl but she survive, then attacked the blond,but she survive only because the bigfoot went back to killed the asian girl.

They play a number of instruments, sing, and write, which is very cool for teenagers. They've all sung on Broadway and acted in TV commercials too. And this is a fun enough album. But this album doesn't really showcase the Jonas Brother's real talent like it should have. Record executives are manipulating the Jonas Brothers like a kid molds clay. They decide what the Jonas Brothers will do, will write, will play, and play up the cuteness factor with antics and funny faces. Johnny Wright did it before and it works, but for only so long.I really wish this album could have been done entirely by the boys themselves, writing, playing guitars, all that serious stuff, and done their way.

In any case, this \\"Ariadne auf Naxos\\" was a wonderful performance. The production is magnificent: by turns fanciful, fantastic, and realistic. The singing was great. This was Deborah Voigt before she got her stomach stapled and lost her voice. In this run she sounded glorious. So did Dessay in a physically demanding role. Susan Mentzer sounded occasionally strained, but pulled through every time. And Richard Margison sang Bacchus like few have managed.

It can take a lot of time adjusting it for level and you don't want to push to hard on it after you have leveled it or it could get slightly out of level again. My tripod has a wide base on it therefore it comes into contact with one of the rubber feet on the bottom of this level which makes it very hard to tighten this level down onto my tripod. It has different speeds for the 360 degree line so can make out the line in brighter conditions. It can also do something like a 30, 45, and 60 degree line on the wall by moving the laser head back and forth. This makes for an even brighter line. I suppose if I moved the rubber foot and filed down the raised plastic next to it, I could give this level a three star rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could be better","review":"This thing would jam on itself when adjusting the thumbwheels. It would stop spinning in most positions, which makes the adjustments worthless. I ended up removing the adjustable part, which lets the laser spin properly, but then you need a perfectly flat surface to put it on. It was cheap so i didn't expect too much from it, and I've been able to make it work by propping it up when i need to use it. Maybe I just got a bad one, but I would recommend investing more in a quality laser if you need to get heavy use of of it.

And in two weeks I ran out and returned it.This album is boring at best. It's essentially an exercise in rap/jazz fusion which at this point has been played to death. Unlike the Roots who intertwine every element (voice, dj, live instrumentation) to invent music, People Under... basically have two elements. Rappers over a watery jazz sound. And lyrically, they fare no better. Basically an onslaught of empty metaphors and simile. There is no substance in the words.

The fan would stop while oscillating and would only start again if I nudged it - like there was a loose connection somewhere. After three years it died completely. I just stripped it down to see if I could fix it but the problem is in the cheezy switch which is a sealed unit that I can't open without destroying it. Power in, no power out :-(Interestingly, the mechanical quality is generally quite good but the electrical is poor. While I was in there I took a look at the oscillating mechanism which uses two plastic cogs that show considerable signs of wear and are very wobbly.

The VPO has recorded the Bruckner 7th numerous times under many splendid conductors, but nerver have they sounded more glorious than at the beginning of this performance. The yearning, rising theme was played for all its worth, and so went the rest of the symphony. The performance has the typically dramatic flair of a Bohm performance, but benefitted enormously from the matchless playing of VPO and nearly perfect recording of the string sound, which was at once warm and silky. Perhaps the interpretation lacked some of the architectural insights that Karajan brings to the piece (e.g. in his last DG recroding), but then it showed in better lights Bruckner's genius as a supreme writer of melodies and an ingenious orchestrator.

The ghosts are real. The zombies are real. The witches are real.

All of that wouldn't matter if my daughter enjoyed it, but she lost interest in just a few minutes (something that doesn't happen with the other DVDs).Because the actors look much younger, I'm guessing that this was shot long before the 1999 copyright credits would indicate.

And by enacting Nativity plays, Wiggly Christmas isn't afraid to keep Christmas Christian. But in the end, it's the music that makes the Wiggles' videos so charming, a clever and eclectic blend of pop, standards, new-wave--and this is surely no exception. \\"Unto Us This Holy Night\\" is simply beautiful.

Unfortunately the characters put down their stylus or bellows just as another character arrived to chat so Harry Turtledove did not need to describe any of these interesting facets of everyday life in ancient times.Heavy portentious repetitious language weighed down the narrative in an apparent attempt to sound authentic.

The novel talks about the author's childhood memories. The story is about David Maldonado it also talks about his family and there adventures. The reason why I liked this novel was because it is about families and memories that we can all make with each other. When you first start reading you can actually picture what is going on is like you can see what is happening and you can also predict what is going to happen next. The novel also makes you want to read more and more it is so interesting. This novel gave me the impression that the author did love and care very much about his family. If I was to rate this novel I would give it **** stars because is that good. I would recommend that people read this novel because it chouse you how much your family should mean to you and it helps you to appreciate them more."},{"rating":"2","title":"R.E.M.

I bought the book thinking I would learn something about acceleration. What I got was nothing but a sad tale of a dysfunctional family whose mother is completely obsessed with her son's intelligence and her rationalizations for why she kept pushing him. Everything in their life is put on hold and everything in their life is sacrificed for the education of this ONE child. I'm sure Michael believes the world revolves around him -his family certainly believes it...and they don't do anything to teach him any different. Sadly for Michael, life only revolved around him,his education and his intelligence. He never experienced what it was like to be part of a family where EVERYONE was valued for who they are...not just their intelligence."},{"rating":"2","title":"The joys and frustration of raising gifted children.","review":"This is a courageous, honest, brave and sometimes humorous book about raising gifted children. It takes you on a journey and gives you insight into the doubts, the worries, and even the triumphs of dealing with children who have the capacity of understanding complex issues like an adult.Even though their situations may be different, it can give all of us with gifted children a much clearer picture of our options and choices, so that we may also have happy well-adjusted children in an era where intellect is not valued.This book has been a great inspiration to me and my children. I now know what I must do!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome art technique book, widely applicable","review":"Wow! \\"Exploring Color\\" lived up to all of the 5-star reviews, and surpassed them all. I've never been able to say that about a book before. This book focuses mainly on the use of color in artwork -- why some color schemes work, and why others fail. Many other topics are covered and related to back to the use of color, such as composition, presentation, design and types of contrast. Example pictures are taken from a wide range of artwork in different mediums by various artists -- simply wonderful! After each description, the author inserts an exercise for the reader, to help you understand and apply the principle presented. These exercises can be done in any medium (watercolor, oil, pastel, cloth, etc.), and far surpass the \\"paint by number/follow me\\" exercises in books aimed at nervous beginners.\\"Exploring Color \\" targets intermediate to advanced artists. Beginers should give it a chance, also. Try it, you'll be wowed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful exercises","review":"I bought this based on other reviews about it. I don't know doodley about color and have always gone on gut instinct...and I've painted over a lot of ruined canvas and wasted a lot of paint.This is an excellent little book with a lot of exercises to make it all quite clear. Every page teaches me something - I have so far had quite a few \\"AHA\\" moments. I am beginning to understand why sometimes a color works and sometimes it is just a little off...I recommend this for everyone. Thank you Nita Leland."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb!","review":"Exploring Color is the kind of book you'll want to tuck under your pillow each and every night.

Instantly, your world of color will pulse with a liveliness, and a confidence, that's simply astounding"},{"rating":"2","title":"Get this book!","review":"If you are interested in understanding color and really implementing it in your work, then this is the book for you.

I'm using it with the coloring book I got, and I can't even describe how helpful and amazing it is. (Although I'll try to when I review it. ha.) I recommended the seller, book and am quite impressed.

I like the smallest ones and while this one is a little thicker due to the flash drive it's very compact and I don't have to carry a separate flash drive which i also like to keep in my pocket to keep private and vital data safe. I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 because it comes with an integrated pen that I could live without but not a tooth pick and tweezers which I consider a big part of why I want this in my pocket. With a little ingenuity it's possible to switch the faceplate containing the pen out for one from my other Swiss pocket knife that has the tooth pick. I like the small LED more than the tweezers so the light stays. Transfer speed isn't the fastest I've seen but it's acceptable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product - This one seems to be missing the SecureLock though","review":"I have owned the 1gb model in the past. I just bought the 2gb model, and although the packaging and manual references the SecureLOCK function, this unit does not have it. I called technical support (18 mins hold time, got disconnected, 16 more mins hold time at 10am PST). The tech support guy thinks the software is available for download but couldn't find it (I spent 30 mins looking before I called technical support). The URL in the manual is no good (404).The warranty is good, but if you have to send it in, expect it to be gone for 60 days. On two occasions with my 1gb model I had to send it in. Once was a defect with the memory stick, the other time the scissors broke (not just the spring, the entire scissor arm broke off). The first time, I got so frustrated with the amount of time it took, I nearly bought another one to replace it. The second time, in anticipation of the delay, I bought the 2gb model."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good tool, but...","review":"It's a nice tool, but I wish it had more gadgets on it. It only has a knife, nail file and scissors. And a pen. But the 2GB flash stick is great. All in all a good buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Swiss Memory Knife rocks","review":"When I read that this knife had a 2GB memory stick, LED light, pen, knife, scissors and file, I was sure the thing must be huge. It is actually must smaller than I expected. The LED light is also alot brighter in the dark than I would have expected from such a small light source."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great tool when it works","review":"I primarily purchased this for the flash drive component. It replaced a 1GB swissmemory I'd returned because the pen portion broke off (yes, I actually used it, too!) and I needed the larger capacity. Well, when I got this new one, the flash drive seemed a little slower. 6 months later, it died. Completely. All my data is gone. Granted, I backed up what I needed, but I'd expect this to last longer than 6 months. Also, the price - you can buy a new 2GB flash drive for $20 now, and the silver alox version of the swiss army portion of the tool only costs another $20... even adding a courtesy $20 for the convenience of having the two-in-one, that only puts it at $60, half of what it's going for here. Not the best deal, but it's still a cool tool."},{"rating":"2","title":"I found this to be an excellent book","review":"I found Shonna Rhein's assessment of this book to be harsh and overly critical. This book contains all of the information that you need to know about being hand-fasted. It also has a lot of information about Pagan relationships in general. I would recommend this book to anyone that wants to know more about this subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"Author with a VERY BAD ATTITUDE!","review":"I was very disappointed in this book. I have been looking for ideas for my wedding/handfasting and thought this sounded like it might have some good ideas. Boy, was I wrong! The author has a very negative attitude towards anyone who wants a Pagan wedding and is not a Coven initiate, let alone a solitary. She also makes very snide remarks about anyone who wants a Pagan wedding, but doesn't want the whole BWD (Big White Dress) format. Overall, I would rate this book lower than 1 star if I could. I definitely would NOT recommend it to anyone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was very disappointed with this book. I felt that the author was quite judgemental of different people's types of commitments. I follow the Reclaiming Pagan/Wiccan tradition, & I believe that this type of book is too snobbish to have any relevance to an eco-feminist tradition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Handfasted and Heartjoined hits the right notes","review":"This book is of particular interest to any pagans who are in the process of creating a meaningful ritual for their marriages, particularly if both parties in the marriage are pagan, or at least one is pagan and the other is pagan-leaning. The book is well-written, and explains the purpose and history of handfasting, with particular focus on the meaning and significance of the ritual. I would recommend it to any pagan couple that wants a meaningful ritual to mark their union."},{"rating":"2","title":"A serious look at a joyful rite.","review":"This was the first and only book I could find on Handfasting. I had already started (and almost completed) the preparations for my own Handfasting when I ordered this book. Maeve Rhea starts off the book with a negative Handfasting experience as a warning (that's my guess) that this is a rite which should be seriously thought out. I agree with that viewpoint. Ms. Rhea also is of the opinion that pagans and non-pagans should not be Handfast. This is something that should be a matter of choice for those involved. This book has some useful information and is well written. I had finished reading it in a matter of hours. I recommend this book to those who are planning a Handfasting and are sure of themselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Size?????","review":"The size was a toddler sizing, so I assumed it ment a child below 4 years old. To be sure I called Amazon, the person that ansered the phone said that their shoe sizing information was not very good and that he could not help me with it. So I ordered the shoe in a size 4 thinking it was for a toddler as it said. When I received the shoes they wewe more like a big kids or adult size. The shoes themself were very nice, well built. I just hope they are still in style when she grows into them. She is 3 years old now. Also some of the shoes I was looking at went by clothing size, not shoe size."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only One Review??","review":"I'm not surprised. Taggart has created an unusual book on a subject for specialists and fanatics ( like me) only. This book had a long gestation period and when it finally came out reviewers were hard pressed on how to judge it. Here's why;a) It broad brushes an era as opposed to focusing on a specific area of that era. Taggart in his earlier work on steam yachts focused exclusively on this subject to great effect.b) The examples of millionaires he uses are not the world famous ones like Vanderbilt or Astor but rather lesser known ones( but every bit as rich as the others) like Alfred Dupont.But nevetheless the book is important in this subject, if you are an afficiando. I really like the rare photos he's selected. The jacket photo of financier Tom Lawson at his ticker tape machine was worth the price of the book to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT","review":"It has worked great on keeping my hot flashes in control.

Won't run out of it again!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorbitol nausea","review":"A friend got these for me and unfortunately I couldn't take them long enough to experience any results, as the excessive amount of sorbitol in the tablets gave me a blood sugar and insulin spike and made me bloated, nauseous and thirsty. (Don't believe what they say about sugar alcohols not impacting blood sugar--if you're diabetic or have severe insulin resistance, they'll mess you up.) So an expensive gift that was supposed to help me with serious health problems turned out to just make me worse, which was embarrassing and frustrating. I'll certainly stay away from this brand in the future and look for unsweetened brands, and urge anyone with insulin-related problems to do the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work for me","review":"First of all, I'm 64 years old and have never used HRT; have been using NOW Indole-3-carbinol for several months with great success in overcoming symptoms of Estrogen Dominance (bloating, water retention, insomnia). Tried this Calcium D-Glucarate after reading that it aids in ridding the body of xenoestrogens and took it along with the I3C. I started out with 2 tablets per day (1000 mgs) with no apparent results, then went up to 4 tablets. Symptoms returned with water weight gain, a very bloated belly and trouble staying asleep. I discontinued use and within a couple of days those problems were gone. Indole-3-carbinol and DIM enhance \\"good\\" estrogen production, while getting rid of the harmful ones. Think in my case the Calcium D-glucarate got rid of the good stuff and left me with symptoms of too little estrogen, which are a lot like estrogen dominance. I base my one-star rating solely on my experience with this product. It may work just fine for others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sharp!","review":"After reading many reviews I decided upon the Tamron lens.

I laughed at the review that gave it a 1-star for sucking in sand (and I absolutely do not believe it deserves 1 star for that one issue), but I've never taken this lens to the beach, never dropped it on the ground, yet somehow it sucked in dirt anyway. I can hear it grinding against the plastic when I focus the lens and it makes me wince every time, but does not seem to affect anything. It just sounds awful. Besides that, this lens is absolutely perfect and I absolutely recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Lens! Great Price! Great Quality!","review":"I have a Nikon 5100 camera.

Does the job for a reasonable price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressive","review":"I just received this lens yesterday and my first impression is that this is an amazing piece of glass. I debated between this, the Nikon 105 and the Tonika 100. Based on the reviews, price and the ability for this lens to autofocus with a DX camera, I opted for this one. So far I am 100% satisfied with my purchase. While I will be using this lens primarily for flower macros, I tried it out as a portrait lens as well. Very nice. The lens is tack sharp and compared to the Nikkor 105mm a steal of a price. The auto focus is not as smooth as my Nikon lenses, but for macro work I will not be using it. The build feels sturdy and I know I will get a lot of use from this.You can check out my test shots in the gallery[...][...]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tate & Lyle Golden Syrup","review":"Ordered 2 cans, previously had ordered this in squeeze bottle (which is preferred & much better).

The live stuff on this looks fine but you need the other rare cd with Camel Song, I can't Remember, Sean Olson, Jingle Balls, Kick The P.A., and any other locked-up slop that's rotting in the vaults.

This album has a fresh quality to it that is hard to find in jazz. Fans of more 'conventional' jazz might be turned off because this album feels less like sitting in the village vanguard and more like travelling through the middle east. The playing is excellent, but not perfect. Personally, that is how I like the musicianship, when virtuosic playing is abandoned for more emotionally driven solos that have a story-like quality to them. The trumpet is at times sensitive and soft, and other times fiery and alive. The bass playing is heavily groove-oriented, very simple and no doubt excellent in this context. The piano playing is great too-the solo on Assal gets me every time. This is a really fantastic album that showcases jazz musicians jamming on a very high level while still perfectly employing the 'world' sounds they likely grew up with. Recommend this album 100%."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the research?","review":"Where's the research? A lot of generalities and informationthat has been tossed around by everyone.

In this age finding such a book reminds me the verse of Gita \\"Yada yada hi dharmasya ...\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Divine Vision of Radha Krishn","review":"Of all the many books I have read on spiritually, religions and philosophies of the world, by far this book is the most profound. I can not say anything meaningful to describe this book, only can I express a deep sence of awe and gratitude. Hinduism is a great and boundless philosophy. For the most part, it is totally misunderstood. H.D. Swami Prakashanand Saraswati expounds on its totality in only 438 pages with a beautiful style and simplicity.

I purchased Dragonfly Summer based on the reviews posted, and, quite frankly, because of the number of 5-star reviews, was EXTREMELY disappointed. Multiple listenings, over two different headphones setups, and on the big sound system in the living room through very good speakers didn't change my opinion. While this IS decent Franks music, it does not compare favorably to earlier works like The Art Of Tea, Sleeping Gypsy, and Tiger In The Rain, or his recent Watching The Snow. If you're considering beginning a relationship with this fine artist, I suggest you start with The Art Of Tea, and put Dragonfly Summer on the long list."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Michael Franks","review":"This was one of my favorites - I bought the CD years ago and lost it - and so glad that I can replace it now with MP3 files!

I'm sure the horn is a quality horn and works quite well, but it doesn't do anybody any good if the product that is sent out is not the same one pictured on the inventory list.

So I followed the instructions on calibrating it. After the calibration I again made some measurements using the calibrated test scale for comparison. I measured exactly 500.0g using the calibrated test scale but everytime I placed the weight on the AWS scale I got a different measurement. Once it read 507.9g. I took the weight off, waited for the scale to show 0.0g, then placed the weight back on and got 467.7g.

When I first saw this book I wondered if I should bother with a 1000+ page book on the history of Berlin. 1000 pages later, I realized that about the only thing I did not like about this book was the fact that it was so bulky. Nonetheless, I wish it were twice as long as I enjoyed reading every single page. I had never read a history book that was so all encompassing. This book dealt with everything from the psyche, culture, history and military, to the arts, music, work ethics, literature, and social movements of the people of Berlin. The reader will learn so much about Germany, Prussia, Poland, Russia, the cold war, German literature, film, music, economy, and, ... yet never leave Berlin. I wish Ms. Richie would win a Pulitzer Prize for her great effort and contribution to history. I just loved this book and it is by far one of the best books I have ever read. This is for the history buff and all others interested in a great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for comsymps. Excellent for post WWII Berlin history","review":"As I read this book, I thought sometimes what uncomfortable reading it must be for those who were, or remain, comsymps, those who \\"liked Uncle Joe\\" (like FDR), ridiculed the spy menace in Britain and the US, and still snicker at RR. Some of this rancor at being mugged by reality shows, I think, in the negative reviews.This is history well-told, with fascinating detail, and judgements, some of which I don't agree with, but all of which are respectable.The earliest history and Imperial Germany are well done, but, like the Nazi story, have been told many times. But the details after 1945 I have never seen put together like this. They are woven together in a lucid and lively way, and put well into German and international context.I have been interested for some time in the social interplay in grand hotels, from Vicki Baum's great novel to Eloise and the Plaza. I enjoyed following the Adlon thru this book's index."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely biased and vague at crucial points","review":"This book may be entertaining, but there are many places where Ritchie simply ignores information that would conflict with the right-ist argument she wishes to make about the outcome of the cold war. She somehow knows better than all of the politicians who participated in the actual events (e.g., terming Roosevelt's decisions during the yalta conference \\"criminally ignorant\\"). Her presentation of the East German situation is so far right that even I (a moderate) would say that it borders on tendentious. And she makes a number of egregious errors in German.

The unnecessary violence which marks this lamentable and egregiously off-track interpretation of this wonderful detective is sad and hard to watch. I can only wonder what Suchet was thinking when he opted to agree to do this role. By all means watch Albert Finney. He's totally inappropriate as Poirot and no David Suchet but the movie is more Christie in spirit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Abomination","review":"I will make this very brief.

Despite departures from and additions to the original Christie storyline, not all of which add value, this film breathes dimension into the character that many of the other Poirot adaptations lack. Morally complex and more satisfying. Demonstrates Suchet's considerable range as an actor and that Poirot can be more than just a character!"},{"rating":"1","title":"please don't bother","review":"Please don't bother watching this- especially if you are an Agatha Christe fan. The sound you will hear all throughout the film will be poor Agatha rolling over in her grave. Usually, any production of Christie's involving David Suchet is well done and well thought out and can even resemble the stories in the Christie books. Not this one. I knew they would try and make it different in some ways from the movie with Albert Finney- but it seems more like they held a contest among writers who could honor the book the least, and then went and filmed the winner's version. I truly enjoy the David Suchet Poirots- but I am dismally disappointed in this one. It bears very little to the story Christe wrote. I must admit I didn't buy this dvd- thank goodness- I just tvo'd it. I never hit the delete so fast.

In fact, other than making Ratchett more the very poster child of pure evil than was done 35 years ago, this version is a total bomb. I want to point out that this is not the fault of the actor's, as they can only work with what they are given, and in this case the script the actor's are given to work with is in this version of the story is total rat do-do.

If you use the C3000 for prints, you will need a minimum of a 64 to a 128 mg card because of the needed space. The camera now comes with a nice \\"Olympus\\" lens cap.

Boring throughout, it takes a long time for the film to get started, and even at the climax it suffers from a \\"been there, done that\\" feel and it's not remotely scary. Definitely feels like it was made by amateurs. Not good words to hear if you want to watch a film but then those are the words that best fit this film.

The thing I don't like about this one is that the mesh pieces that hang from the top are too low for a tummy baby to play. My son's head is constantly rubbing on it. He got this as a Christmas present at which time he was 4 months old and he already seems bored with it. My friend has the other einstein play mat (the really colorful one) and her 6 month old still uses it daily. She can also sit up and play with it. The water one is too low down (the cross part that the toys hang on). It is also too expensive, you can get something more entertaining for a lot less money. Good luck. I haven't had a problem with any of the other baby einstein products we have. In fact my son loves the movies and the little stationary play saucer keeps him busy for a long time. I hope this helped. Bottom line, too much money not enough product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overpriced and Leaks","review":"I bought this product thinking it was different than the standard square playmats. I like the scalloped edges, the pillow and the colorful pictures, but I am disappointed in the playmat overall. The pat mat leaks so bad that I can't use it.

He never got to use it because the water in the bubble inside the mat leaked out and got all over the place. That's not my only complaint. After really looking at the gym I realized that a BABY does not need a toy that has French and Spanish on it when they don't even know English. I do like Baby Einstein but you pay for the name brand when it comes to this one. A cheaper play gym can make your child just as happy as this on.

Fisher price somehow got wind of this and began I don't know if harassing is the right word but continued calling me on 3 occasions. Anyway none of the fisher price play gyms had this many toys. One featured Mcdonalds type toys and stopped working after two uses. It was promply thrown in he garbage where it belongs.The Baby einstein play gym is easy to fold.

I can't say enough good things about Melanie Fawer's DVD's. There is enough to keep me going for years here. All material is presented clearly and the dual formats (on two DVD's)are a great idea. Ms. Fawer is extraordinary, a joy to learn from. I feel that I have found a great source, not only for insights into Ashtanga Yoga, which takes years to learn, but for elements I can use in my current practice immediately. One small improvement might be more angles to view the asanas, but really, this series is so good, and Melanie Fawer so great to watch, that it is easily overlooked.

I am very frustrated that I can't get to the finishing sequences in any way on the practice video (or the instructional video either, for that matter), aside from fast forwarding to the very end (which would take a very long time.) I can't find any way to add the finishing sequences to my practice without memorizing them and \\"doing them on your own\\", as suggested within the video. Without being able to skip to the finishing sequences on the instructional video, I can't easily memorize them.In my opinion, the lack of any menu at all on the practice video makes it unusable.

The music and arrangements are understated when compared to much of his earlier work, while the lyrics offer the jaded perspective of a man on the verge of middle age who's \\"been there and done that.\\" \\"No More Love Songs\\", originally on Cole's previous album \\"The Negatives\\", appears in a stripped-down acoustic version, while a cover of Nick Cave's \\"People Ain't No Good\\" is aptly chosen for its relentless cynicism. It's a mature work displaying the talents of a thoughtful and skilled songwriter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry Lloyd - not this one","review":"Over the past couple of years I have bought 3 of Lloyd's works - Songs in a Foreign Language, The Negatives, and Antidepressant.Lloyd's clever song writing and unique vocal styling worked very successfully with the backing of the brilliant Commotions, resulting in all those hits of the 80s and beyond. I feel he took a chance with his solo works - exposing his basically weak and fragile voice for scrutiny.This shows on SIAFL where sparse accompaniment and too many poor songs don't carry the day. My Other Life was the only one that I thought worthy of the man's talent.The problem is that every song is of a very similar tempo - you long for some injection of beat and rhythm. In the end his vocal mannerisms grate, and it all becomes rather irritating. For someone new to Lloyd's music this album would make a very poor introduction.For solo Lloyd fans I recommend the gorgeous Antidepressant - it all works brilliantly on this, where SIAFL fails."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Vanilla","review":"As individual songs, many of the selections are fairly good. Mr. Cole continues to write thoughtful, unguarded lyrics that can become self absorbed. The arrangements and melodies are sparse and subdued throughout so it is hard to maintain interest after several cuts. I would suggest people try to borrow the CD first to determine if it is to their liking before making the purchase. His work with the Primatives exhibits a much better balance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"It seems the subject matter should be for elementary age but the way it is presented is for preschool, would not have bought, another on B Franklin is out there much better.

After listening to this CD, I find I like her very much as a singer too. The CD starts out with a bang with I Happen to Like New York, sung with gusto and there are few misses on here. I thought I could never listen to another version of If You Go Away, but her version is very good. As is The Man Who Got Away. She also does some very fine interpretations of Sondheim songs (Children and Art and Finishing the Hat). I dont care for Broadway Baby though (sung as a slow ballad), but its different. The only criticism I may have is that too many of the songs are sung in the same way (a slow quiet start building to a crescendo finish) Well produced and arranged, this is worth your time and money."},{"rating":"2","title":"An outstanding voice","review":"I have listened to this cd a couple of times since I got it yesterday, and I have to say, it is excellent. Maria's voice is really lovely, and she puts so much expression into each song. From soft and tender to powerful and rich, she can sing it all. Her deep love of broadway music really comes across in her music; she sounds like she is enjoying every note. If you like Laurie Beechman, Linda Eder, and Kim Criswell, I believe you will enjoy this cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I loved Maria in The Woman in White. I enjoy the Original London Cast CD of this show, but Maria as a solo artist is simply boring, I wish I've never gotten this CD and had saved my money, I forced myself to listen to this CD about 10 times, and it is just plain and boring. Love the girl, hate the CD.

It seems like people sneer at anything of theirs that came after their late-'70s classics. Oh well. It's their loss.

Can't he put out a decent album that swings and doesn't sound like a trainwreck? His approach to saxophone playing is amateurish. He has no lyricism, melodic invention, and his saxophone tone is forceful and downright annoying. No kind of warmth to be found. Why record companies continue to back no talents like James Carter is beyond me. Thank goodness for the '40s, '50s, and early '60s when jazz was an important medium to express oneself in. Now, all we have are guys like Carter who don't seem to understand anything about being melodic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst CD in my collection","review":"\\"Quick Change World\\" isn't bad at first, the first half of the album really is pretty good with the exception of the first song (total garbage). Then the \\"left side\\" of the album comes on, as it is listed on the CD case, and it's total garbage. The whole second half of the cd doesn't have one good song, \\"What's on TV\\" is a good example of how bad they are.If you are a big cars/ocasek fan, you should check this out for the first part of it but you'll soon find this cd in the bottom of your cd collection if you bother with the other half."},{"rating":"2","title":"She's On!","review":"This has got to be the best solo work of Ric Ocasek ever released.

Definetly Cars material here and some Ocasek."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some Ocasek / Some Cars","review":"Pick this one up, because you won't be able to find it for long. This CD is a great mix of styles from the Cars to Ric's offshoot style of darker tunes. Perhaps the strongest songs on the release are \\"A Little Closer\\", \\"Don't Let Go\\" and the title cut \\"Quick Change World\\". The style on this album is most closely analagous to one part \\"This Side of Paradise\\" (Ocasek solo) and one part \\"Door to Door\\" (the Cars final release).In my opinion, this is the most under-rated of Ric's solo efforts since it went out-of-print so fast. Of all his solo efforts, I would say this runs a close second to \\"This Side of Paradise\\" as his best apart from the Cars.Probably the three weakest tracks are \\"The Big Picture\\" (sounds like a prelude to Ocasek's joint venture release of \\"Getchertikitz\\"), \\"What's on TV\\" (repetitive lyrics) and \\"Help Me Find America\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Sequel To Fireball Zone","review":"Despite his diminished-come-cultish status by the early 90's, Ric Ocasek was one of the most powerful synth artists since David Bowie. He even went so far as to request Bowie's \\"Let's Dance\\" producer Nile Rodgers for 1991's Fireball Zone.Thematically, Quick Change World is a politically charged album with only a few flaws in that it has a little too much variety. Most of the songs are a lot less new wave sounding than you'd think. While certain songs fall short . . . such as \\"the big picture\\" and \\"what's on tv?\\", QCW is a very welcome early 90's album that served as a continuation of massive creativity for Ric Ocasek.My Four Favorities from Quick Change World are :The atmospheric \\"Feelings Got To Stay\\"The driving \\"She's On\\"The beautifully ambient \\"I Still Believe\\"The politically charged Title Track is a groovy and hypnotic"},{"rating":"1","title":"A matter of preference","review":"These are pieces that require a very introspective interpretation, particularly the Ravel & the Fouré. To me, these performances are too precise & stiff. Perhaps renditions for two hands rather than four allow more scope for interpretation.

This thin and expensive publication could have been replace by a three page paper in which the author could adequately cover those few points on fast and accurate gunplay. I don't recommend this book at all. Explanations of \\"Slip hammering\\" were cloudy and the author doesn't immediately explain what this is, until a paragraph of two into the dissertation following the heading.

The cynic in me imagines the artists flipping through a catalogue \\"1001 Sounds to Make With a Violin/Cello Combination\\", and wondering what sort of letter it sounds like.Actually, I think the \\"letter\\" theme is stretched a bit in places, but even then the results are masterful works in which Elvis Costello shines in a fresh medium for him.EC has traded in his magic markers for a set of watercolors, and as we've all known for twenty years, he really knows how to paint a picture.After this album, I'm now a wild fan!"},{"rating":"1","title":"skip it!","review":"Sorry, this is one to avoid.

The movie is intended to portray the fragile and doomed relationship between Melanie Laurent's character with her mother, played beautifully by Isabelle Huppert. However, the movie lacks credibility and Melanie Laurent's character seems half-asleep throughout the majority of the film. I admire both actresse's work, in particular Ms. Huppert, but I have to say this movie left me with a sour taste in my mouth. I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone, unless you enjoy long, drawn-out and very predictable endings. Watch The Pianist with Ms. Huppert instead, or Je vas bien, ne t'en fais pas, with Melanie Laurent, who gives an incredibly moving performance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the Love?","review":"This film was torturous for me and I doubted that I even wanted to finish it. It's hard to watch a self-absorbed, mentally ill woman contort herself in her endless self-castigation. Huppert plays the part well and makes you really hate the character she portrays. \\"Extremely unloveable\\" is how I would describe her. It is the extreme of the famous hard-edged, je m'en fou of some of the other characters she portrays (La Vie Promise, The Piano, Violette).I have been a big fan of Isabelle Huppert and have seen almost every film she's been in at least twice. This film shows her range and ability to make herself look ugly and truly insane. It is a great study in the hideous twists the human mind can get itself into.Where is the love? The love is deeply hidden within her and can't get out because of how her mind operates and her extreme selfishness. This film is like spending a couple of hours with a miserable, depressed person who refuses to snap out of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Door lock units","review":"I installed these in my daughters car prior to installing an alarm. It includes all the hardware to mount and connect to the existing mechanisims that lock and unlock your doors. They look like they could replace worn or defective original equipmetn locks as well. The included wiring is adequate for a mid-size vehicle. The units for the front doors have extra wiring for the switches normaly found in todays cars. The instructions that come with the units seem like an after thought and look like you have to adapt them to fit your car. There is no mention of or suggestion for utilising the four strips of metal that might be mounting brackets. I also had a problem with the ground for the control relay being back-fed through the solenoid. Cutting off the black ground wire to the front door units and leaving the wire to just the relay unit solved the problem. Other wise the solenoids sound strong and capable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to install, a little noisy","review":"It is a good product for the cost, good quality of their components and easy to install.

This book outlines how the wonderful Catholic Mass could be taken apart by liberal bishops of the Church.His thesis is proven by the Vatican II documents them selves and from quotes of those who sat on the council. He shows that there was never any intention of doing away with the Tridentine Liturgy. And in fact he proposes the Church returns to it as soon as possible. See how moderate liturgical reform turned out to be a liturgical destruction.

Frankly, making me wonder what was going on in her life while writing this book.I am also wondering if she has her \\"clients\\" tested for any possible problems prior to placing them on medications that may not even apply to their problems.All I can say is that it made me very afraid for her \\"clients\\"!I think that the term best suited for this book would be \\"Physician heal thyself\\"....before writing a book!Anyone looking for a quick fix?

The colors are very alike, could have been passed for a set. My only complaint was it took my husband 2 days to put together, thinking we had some parts missing. We ended up calling amazon for the parts but was told that the 2 missing parts were actually already put together. The instruction were horrible to follow. Otherwise, I love the dresser!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely item","review":"This really is a wonderful dresser - very elegant and looks like an expensive peice. HOWEVER - the draws are tiny, they look big but are actually half the size of the front. I bought some draw dividers from Ikea and it gives you more space. It looks like it would not take anything heavy in the draws either, or it may break - but ideal for baby clothing. My husband put it together in around 1 1/2hrs. The packaging came very damaged on the inside, torn box and all taped up, but only one peice was damaged and it was in the inside so I did not bother. Its very heavy and the delivery man said as there is usually only one guy per van from point to point while its in transit, and they roll it to get it into/out of their truck, just something to note."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning: Don't buy from Storkcraft","review":"I purchased this item from another retailer and it arrived damaged. I followed the instructions and called Storkcraft to get replacement parts. They told me the parts would be here in 2-3 weeks. Now it is almost 5 weeks later and still no parts. I have called several times and have only gotten very unhelpful CSR's who say my order is at the warehouse but it hasn't been shipped yet. (Actually: The first one I talked to, a week and a half ago, said they were waiting on FedEx.)So, to sum it up...baby could be coming very soon...spent a couple hundred dollars...and as of yet, no changing table."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks nice but horrible quality","review":"So when you look at this, it looks really really nice. Putting it together was so easy! The problem is it is cheaply made. I assumed this would be a decent product since we bought the glider from stork craft and it is very nice. But this once it was put together wobbles. Also, some of the holes were put int the wrong area, so the drawers are not put in correctly and the other screws damaged the wood because of nail hole placement. It is really sad because it really looks nice. I love it with the crib I purchased. I just wish it was stronger. Because it wobbles I am not sure if I will use it as a changing table, which was my orginal plan. I guess people are right when they say by a nice used high end dresser or changing table. You pay the same but at least you will get quality. This isn't a quality item."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice looking piece...and still easier to assemble than the crib.","review":"We bought this dresser as well as the tall chest of drawers and the crib back in 2006. My husband assembled all 3 pieces, but didn't seem to have any assembly issues until he got to the crib. That being said- this dresser was a good pick. In fact, the piece is ideal for anyone who doesn't want a changing table sitting around after the child is too old/big for it.I knocked off 1 star b/c the door is now broken. We had a makeshift fix for it that worked for about 6 mos, but 2 mos ago I just gave up and converted it into shelving/book case. It actually looks pretty nice that way."},{"rating":"1","title":"SOOoooo BAd! Go to HomeDepot and buy some lumber, screws and paint -- it would be easier than this!","review":"This item is absolutely terrible. Quite possibly one of the most frustrating pieces of junk I have ever purchased. It came in a box with numerous pieces of wood and a bag full of 100 different screws and brackets. The instruction manual is something like 25 pages long and is very difficult to understand. In addition, pieces were missing and some of the screws would not fit in their intended place!For the time and effort involved, it would be better to pay the additional money and buy a decent piece of furniture.The assembly of this dresser is a mind game of the worst type: missing pieces, deceptive drawings in instruction manual, etc. I want to take these boards and screws and plummet them at the person who decided it would be a good idea to have a consumer assemble this in such a manner."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM","review":"Do no buy this item. It is a very beautiful peice but it is made out of particle board. The weight of the drawers was not even supported by the dresser. The particle board kept coming apart and we had to send this item back. I would recommend the davinci collection if you are looking for a great piece of nursery furniture. DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM. IT WAS THE BIGGEST MISTAKE THAT I HAVE EVER MADE.

It was an absolute nightmare to put together (took 4 hours). The directions were wrong on several occassions! Luckily we were able to figure that out and basically had to put the whole thing together without the directions! The piece looks nice now that it's together but the drawers are shallow and don't open and close smoothly. We also can't get the door to align right so it's slightly crooked. I'm pretty disappointed with this piece."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!!!","review":"I thought I would give this a try, ignoring the negative reviews, but my bad! Item is cheap, scratches if you run your fingernail across it. Drawers don't line up, cheap particle board is used. This probably won't last much past a few uses. I can just see a small child trying to pull themselves up by the drawer knobs and the drawers coming out and falling on him/her. Do NOT buy!Follow up - I do want to say Amazon.com is pretty cool. We disassembled and put it back in the box and Amazon is taking it back and giving a full refund.

I knew we were not buying top of the line, but I have purchased cheaper and more solid \\"fake wood\\" pieces from Target and Walmart.

It was packaged well but the quality of the \\"real wood\\" is awful. It's particle board with at best a small wood coating on top. I know it's not the top of the line item but just know that you are buying a very low quality product that easily scratches. Also when I was building it, there are some drawer gliders already installed on two pieces. Well, the manufacturer didn't install them correctly and I had to remove and reinstall all the gliders in order for the drawers to close!If you're wanting a lower end product this is for you, otherwise I recommend going to a store first and checking out the product versus buying online. It'll save you disappointment in the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice looking, but does not hold up well","review":"We received this as a gift for our daughter (now 16 months). It's a very nice looking dresser, but has not stood up well to daily use. All of the drawer knobs have pulled off at one point or another, and we've had to request replacements. We've now had the dresser for so long that they're charging us for new knobs. Also, the door hinges have had to be re-tightened several times.The wood is soft, so any nick or ding is clearly visible. This is not a concern in a baby room, but the dresser will not hold up well to toddler abuse -- we picked it specifically so it could transition from a changing table to a dresser.It was perfect for what we wanted it for initially, but it's ridiculous to have to maintain a piece of furniture that keeps dropping pieces. We'll probably end up replacing it with a sturdier dresser when my daughter transitions to her own room, which completely defeats the purpose for us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Purchase from this manufacture!","review":"I received the Aspen Combo Chest. I initially had this item as part of my baby registry but changed my mind. The person who purchased this item for me cancelled the order close to two weeks before it was delivered. The item was delivered regardless of the cancellation. I called Amazon to Return the item and they said I would need to deal directly with CYMAX STORES, INC. After several days of trying to get through to customer service they informed me that in order to ship it back I would be charged a re-stocking fee (even though the items has not been opened) of 25% as well as pay the shipping fee to send back and another fee to the manufacture for shipping. By the time the fees to return the item are calculated it is as almost as much as the cost of the item which is $240.00. I'm sure this is intentional to avoid returns. The Return process is not buyer friendly. BUYER BEWARE!!!!! You can go to the cytex.com site to check out the return policy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value - bigger than I expected","review":"Overall I was quite happy with the product and the sales process with Amazon. One warning is that the items are somewhat darker than I expected from the image. I originally ordered in the Cherry finish to match some furniture we purchased through Amazon from another company, but it turned out to be much darker than expected so we returned it and got a replacement in Cognac which was approximately the correct color.One thing I appreciated was that the pieces were labeled with numbers - something that helped me get the assembly correct the first time. The instructions were passable - I really wish manufactures would remember their customers can read and use some text to clarify things but I guess they would then have to print multiple languages for different markets.The dresser was also bigger than I expected, but this was not a problem for us and the dimensions were listed correctly so you can check them before purchasing.Hope this helps!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the price","review":"This piece of furniture was very hard to assemble.

All of the parts were there and I was able to put it together with little difficulty (I was 8 1/2 months pregnant at the time, the only difficulty was working around the belly!). I have to say for the first year and a half to two years, it did the job. As time went on, I realized exactly why I hate furniture made with particle board or MDF... It won't hold screws when the drawer/door bracket they are securing are used often. I had to fill the screw holes a few times and try to reattach the door bracket and the glide that the drawers use. They will simply pull out after normal use. I would not recommend this or any product made from particle board MDF to anyone. For a little more money, you can get a lot more quality :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product!","review":"Before purchasing this dresser, I read a ton of reviews online and I have to admit, after reading so many negative reviews, I was hesitant to purchase..

My husband and I had no problem with the instructions and it was actually pretty simple to put together. It took awhile because there are sooo many parts but it was great! We also used Gorilla glue on top of the wooden pegs just for extra support and the finished product is great!!! It's super sturdy and looks beautiful in my daughter's nursery! All the drawers lined up, all the parts were included in the box... we had absolutely no issued what so ever!"},{"rating":"2","title":"5 stars...if only to combat the negative reviews","review":"I would rather rate this as 4.5 stars but I wanted to combat some of the negative reviews out there so I'm giving it a 5. I would consider the assembly instructions to be very comparable to most self-assembly furniture in this price range. They are not the best instructions but I didn't find them any better or any worse than comparable pieces. IF you don't do self-assembly furniture regularly (like my wife) you will probably find it very difficult. If you do (like myself) you will find it to be pretty easy. There are a couple spots where it would be easier with a second person but I don't think a second person is necessary. It took me about 2 hours to assemble but that included taking care of my son at the same time; 45 minutes of which was a nap. After assembly, it looks great and is plenty sturdy.

When putting this piece (changing table) together, there is a plastic piece that holds the backing(AKA cardboard together)we overlooked this somehow-don't let it be you. The company gives you screws to put the backing on, but I would recommend that you use tac nails since the screws are a lot of work to get in and we had some that went through the wood(I kept thinking I should have known better). We used tac nails when doing the dresser and this worked great! Also in respects to the swinging door on the right of this product(I recommend you take the sticker number off and clean it as we are having to maguyver it now that it is all together.

This dresser could never be sold in the stores with scratches like these except for the outlet ones.As for the instruction. Yes, it's horrible. 80% of the pieces have no numbers. And there are only pictures instruction, no words. It is not too hard to assemble it, but it could save you a lot of time if you don't have to guess which pieces is which. Of course if your job is to do this everyday, you would know it right away. It took me about 4 hours which could have been 2 if the instruction were better.I do not want to give it back after spending a lot of time putting it together, but I'm not satisfy with the quality so not recommend it to anyone.

Holes in some drawings were on the bottom side of the piece but shown on the topside.Some of the tightening pieces, pull the wood apart.When installing the back fiberboard panels which give the piece some rigidity, several of the screws missed the tiny ledge and angled into the storage space.Harder than it should have been to build, not as good as IKEA product, but I suppose you get what you pay for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor design, received defective product - Get less than what you pay for!","review":"This dresser was a nightmare to put together, and required more than 3 hours of work due to the lack of clear instructions, poor design, and defective parts.

It looks like a previous purchaser had the same issue putting together the dresser and returned the parts, which were then resold to me!

Its not wood.- Because of the glue in the MDF, it smells like glue. It's been airing out in the room for 1 week now and still smells. Hopefully it will air out.- Bought espresso and also bought an espresso colored crib by storkcraft, and the colors don't match. This is probably b/c the dresser is MDF material with an espressor veneer on it and the crib is stained wood.- The parts to put things together are cheap.Overally, we're stuck with it. I'm not too happy about the purchase. If you're okay with MDF furniture, then maybe this will work for you. It's equivalent to Ikea in terms of material quality, parts used, and how it's assembled."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"This product was difficult to put together, and then didn't fit together well.

The first is a recap of the 1982 \\"Duel in the Sun\\" Boston Marathon in which Alberto Salazar and Dick Beardsley run within inches of one another for the entire race - arguably the most exciting distance race ever.The second story tells about the lives of the two very different men - both of which face their own failures and triumphs.Both stories are interesting but in my opinion could have been more in depth. I read the book in a little over one day. The book was rather thin to begin with and the font was quite large and often there would be a blank page between chapters. Also there were some things, especially in the stories of the men's lives, that were repeated multiple times. I felt that it read more like a very long magazine article rather than a book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Empathy for the stars","review":"That April day in 82 was incredible, very few were heat acclimated. I trained in the midwest and was not. The race was run at noon adn I had heard the high was 75. The road seemed to be on fire. Beardsley had the advantage of heat training Salazar not. I was only a few minutes behind them but blew up at the base of hill #2 (Auberndale station).The book gives a good accounting of the race and the battle of these fellows. The painfull part is their physical and emotional catastrophies after such a great performance.Whether it be the marathon, Ironman or other endurance event one is never the same afterward. You gain experience but you also leave some of yourself behind."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Duel in the Sun\\" Shines","review":"If you are/were a competitive distance runner (particularly from the mid-'70s to mid-'80s), you'll really enjoy this book. Not only is the race itself examined, but so are the lives (both before and after the race) of the two runners (Salazar and Beardsley) involved in this \\"duel\\". These two runners couldn't have been more different;their contrasts make the story that much more appealing. While the runners didn't realize it at the time, this one race ended up being not only the focal point of their running careers, but also their lives. This particular race, the 1982 Boston Marathon, can rightly claim the distinction of being one of the greatest American distance races of all time (and one of the last). Even the contrasts between distance running today and 20+ years ago add to the story. In many ways, just like the two runners themselves, American distance running has never been the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"Zim Zam","review":"All I mean to say is this is a good book by a great author and the reader does an excellent job."},{"rating":"2","title":"XTC and They Might Be Giants take in some LA air & get funky","review":"Gegg and Tah throw in everything but the kithen sink (including noise and pre-adolescent poetry), and come out with an involving debut album.

Upon first examination, the bits felt sharp but extremely brittle, usually the first sign of inferior metal. Sure enough, while using the 1/8\\" bit to run a pilot hole in a sheet metal framing stud, the bit snapped.

The bit points stayed sharp and performed better than expected for bits at this price range. Snapped a bit when using it to increase the diameter of a hole (using the side of the bit to grind the hole larger). The individual black bits are not labeled in terms of size, but the case is. The case is probably the best part of this drill bit package, as one could interchange/replace these bits with other manufacturers' types.

Their Charmin Ultra is quilted and soft as cotton when you need to use it in the bathroom. It also really is comfortable in not just the price, but the value.

It wasn't going to be good, but it's vampires so what the heck. The problem with this movie is that the characters were so bland you couldn't really care about them. The movie lacked the humor and the \\"cool\\" of the original. However, Corey Feldman was a treat. His appearance in this movie was pure bliss. The soundtrack was also less than memorable.

Many like myself looked forward to this sequel because of the lively style and the fresh feel of the first (the first was actually entertaining). Why would the producers of this one think we want to watch something so different. This was not a 'Lost Boys' sequel, this was a miserable dark, gratuitously violent, over sexualized (for time filler I suspect) movie trying to get success using the name and setting of the first. I wish I had rented it first, then I would not feel so bad having wasted my money on the dvd. This gets a generous one reluctant star rating from me, and the one star belongs to Corey Feldman, without whom this movie would not have any rateable merit.

The acting was so bad I almost stopped watching 30 min. into the main feature. The main character played by actor Tad Hilgenbrink was remarkably weak for a lead role. The only decent acting was the performace of Edgar Frog played by Corey Fieldman. The cameo appearance and alternate endings with Corey Haim were entertaining, but the rest of this film was a trainwreck. The Blu-Ray quality was only evident in certain parts of the film. The indoor shots are grainy and sub- standard.

This is a great CD -- mellow and bluesy at times; rocking at others, with lots of great instrumentation -- horns, drums, piano, and guitar. I couldn't understand the words to any of the songs, but they sounded nice -- and if I missed the significance of any profound, life-altering lyrics, well, what the hell, I liked the music.I liked the crowd noise (some don't) on this live album which gives an immediacy to the music and I liked the long, loose interpretations of the songs -- some of which run to about 10 minutes.

Unlike most other bands, Dire Straits has recorded strong material from their debut, to their newer albums. All the other songs are great, also. I advise you to buy this album.

This is a better concert than the Alchemy concert, although not as good as the 'Brothers In Arms' tour in 85/86. But it is a perfectly respectable farewell from Dire Straits, as a couple of years later (1995) it was revealed that the group would be laid to rest for good and Mark Knopfler's solo career took off. All the selections here are of a good standard, and its also worth checking out the DVD of this concert, which has a few extra tracks not available on the CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun album - not all tracks are appropriate for young children","review":"My daughter has been a big fan of Johnny Cash (loves his voice!) since infancy.

It may sound a little hokey, but it makes for a great story. During his quest Thomas has to fight against the Scot's at the battle of Neville's Cross, and face his worst memories when he returns to the ruins of his hometown of Hookton. Along the way Thomas meets up with new friends and foes and ultimately ends up back where he began his wanderings in France. Vagabond has it's share of great battle scenes and interesting characters but it is obvious that it was written as part of a series and ends with no resolution. The reader must continue on to Heretic for the conclusion of Thomas' tale."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating","review":"Nice follow-up to Book 1, if you're into historical fiction and 1300's-style warfare, class structure, violence, religion, and love in England, Scotland, and France."},{"rating":"2","title":"Search and destroy . . .","review":"Cornwell picks up the saga of Thomas of Hookton and his Grail quest in this second volume of his treatment of the Hundred Years War. From the Battle of Neville's Cross at the beginning to the French siege of La Roche-Derrien at the end, fans of Cornwell's battle scene descriptions will enjoy a feast of arrows and gore. In between there are plenty of new and old villains, the return of Jeanette, and enough ups and downs to keep the pages turning. If you have read the first volume, \\"The Archer's Tale,\\" you can't stop now--read \\"Vagabond,\\" and you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Grail Quest 2, tale continues","review":"Vagabond, like the first story in the series, The Archer's Tale, was equally historically believable. Since the story is based on real events the author has to stay within what actually happened. The tendency to make nobles continues, but many nobles of the time were pretty despicable. The characterization in this segment wasn't as strong, as some of the behaviors Mr. Cromwell attributes to them seem a little unlikely. Not impossible, but unlikely. People have made remarkable escapes. Happens.In all, worth reading, but it didn't quite rise to the level of the first installment. Part of the problem is the search for the Grail, but people back then were sure it was real."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Sequel","review":"Vagabond is the second book in the Grail Quest series, and the sequel to The Archer's Tale. The book's main protagonist, Thomas of Hookton, is still searching for clues as to the whereabouts of the Holy Grail, or if it even exists. This search leads Thomas from Durham, in Northern England, to Thomas's home town of Hookton, and from there onto Normandy.I found this book, like its predecessor an enjoyable read. There are a number of great battle scenes, and they are described in vivid detail. You almost feel you are standing in the fields watching the events unfold, particularly, the battle at Durham. The weaponary of the day is described in great detail, also.The cast of characters around Thomas, both friends and foes, are reasonably well developed, although, there are quite a number of them. You will be familiar with some of them from the earlier novel, Harlequin. Overall, a good sequel, and worth a read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Turns History Into Adventure","review":"Vagabond turns one of our least-studied periods of history into high adventure. Of course \\"those people\\" \\"'way back then\\" were real men and women with strengths and foibles.

He has a velvet touch at the piano.

The book is amusing enough, but it leads to terrible stereotyping if children really take its message to heart. Basically, it says not only that it's okay to be gay (and I'm sure it is, because the media keeps telling me so), but then here's how you identify the gay people in your own neighborhood - boys who don't play sports well (or don't play at all), boys who dress up in mommy's clothing (as if mommy dresses in just frilly stuff these days), boys who like to cook (we would have starved in college if we hadn't figured out how to cook), et cetera et cetera.

Anyone that wears something totally wild anywhere is setting themselves up to be mocked. We all have common sense. Wake up people and recognize the gay agenda. My daughter brought this book home from Kindergarten and if you could see how the other ducks look at this little guy Elmer. They have extremely mean faces. Very unrealistic.

His martials arts comes from the tradition of hard training where you only fought if you had no choice and then you fought to the end.Case-in-point, the diagram at the end of the book emphasizes strike points that can disable or kill an opponent.

I've done taekwondo for 10 years, and practising these forms (which are also practiced in tang soo do schools) help improved myself greatly as a martial artist.If one is studying karate, or its similar arts, this books is not only good in explaining how to do kata, but also how to use various techniques practiced through them.

The only problem was that 1983's \\"Salute\\" was too much of an over-the-top electric patchwork that didn't flow very well and 1986's \\"East of Midnight\\" was a jaw-dropping adult-contemporary nightmare.After having taken a break from the writing and producing for a spell, Gord returned in 1993 with what is possibly his best since \\"Dream Street Rose\\". \\"Waiting For You\\" has everything that made Lightfoot records of old so enjoyable. The songs are easy-going, listenable and singable.

Look Elsewhere.","review":"I have always appreciated Gordon Lightfoot's music, but of all of his albums I have, this one is by far his weakest effort. The opening cut \\"Restless\\" is half-decent and autumnal, but the rest of the album is forgetable. Lightfoot's vocals are lackadaisical and uninspiring, and the lyrics are often very difficult to understand. Sadly, it often sounds like he's just mumbling to himself. This is a dull and unimaginative album, and would only appeal to only his most avid fans. His best days of making really good music have long since passed, and maybe it's time for Lightfoot to sit back, relax, and take the rest of life off by going fishing or hunting in his native Canada (See my album review for his double CD set \\"The United Artists Collection\\" for reviewing Lightfoot's BEST music)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this really Spirit, the great jazz-rock fusion band from L.A.?","review":"This sure doesn't sound anywhere close the the great jazz-rock fusion band from the late sixties and early seventies!

After that I had several disappointments. As a single Mother I am looking for suggestions and guidance. This author states that no matter what we do as parents are children's lifestyles and habits are based on how their brains are formed!! How discouraging. There were also other references that go against my own personal and spirtual beliefs. My suggestion to other potential readers is to read this book from a different perspective. Do not read it as a guide as I did. Read it as another viewpoint out there about the incredible world of boys."},{"rating":"1","title":"Against mothers","review":"I bought this book with high expectations for advice on understanding boys. I was extremely disappointed. There was little practical advice, and the tone towards mothers was bitter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsupported claims and misinterpretations of data","review":"I agree whole-heartedly with the other readers who gave this book a very negative rating. As a clinical psychologist and mother of two boys, I was very interested in reading this book but found that early on already, Gurian makes claims that are not supported by any empirical evidence, and even misinterprets findings from the psychological literature. The former would be excusable if he clearly stated that this was only his own view, not a well-established fact. However, there is no excuse for the latter, and it makes me wonder about the effort Gurian put into his background research (if any!). As if to add insult to injury, the book is also poorly written and disorganized. I had a very hard time reading even half of it before I threw it away, disgusted. Parents, don't waste your money on this one. A much better book on the same topic is \\"The courage to raise good men.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"His theories are narrow and off base.","review":"The chapter on Mothers and Sons is mostly about what mothers frequently do to hurt their sons physically or emotionally. The section titled, \\"What mothers should do during their sons first decade\\" discussed the importance of continual presence and bonding during the first year of life (the mother needing to be the primary caretaker, or problems may arise in adolescence), then jumped to \\"working mothers\\" and \\"single moms bringing home boyfriends\\". What a completely useless chapter. I learned nothing about positive actions, and felt the author was condeming me because I am a working mom. I plan to file the book away permanently."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alarming Reductionism","review":"In sociology, there is a term that fits this book to a tee: reductionism. The author, in near-fascist glee at times, tries to convince us that \\"boys will be boys\\" by virtue of their biology, and that we should just accept that they are different, even superior, to their female counterparts.I found it hard not to close this book time and time again with the blatant misogynistic overtones, but I'm afraid I had to read it till the end to believe he was serious -- he is.Many of the studies he cites in the book have been challenged by behavioral psychologists, and sociologists all along have pointed out that you cannot reduce issues of social causation to a mish-mash of biological excuses. Non-biological social factors contribute much more significantly to boys' behavior than Mr. Gurian would like us to believe."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE WONDER OF BOYS","review":"There were some very interesting facts in this book, but I bought it for my 21 year old granddaughter.

Taken literally, this book says that our boys and men were healthier when they were little \\"Warriors\\", and bemoans the fact that our males lack this war-time outlet now. It is implied that without war-toys, etc., our boy children will be maladjusted. I think our young men today are pleasanter to be with than those of days past, and perhaps the author simply yearns for a return to HIS father's lifestyle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gurian seems to have mom issues.

Gurian's philosophy is truly dangerous. He states that men are biologically determined to be violent and dominant over women, and that women should not try to change this fact. He wildly understates the consequences of the \\"boys will be boys\\" attitude, such as sexual harassment and rape; and he seems bitter about the economic strides that women have gained in the past twenty years. This is a backlash book masquerading as a parenting guide."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete and utter garbage","review":"There are only a few books that I have seen as disorganized, unfounded, and dangerous as this particular \\"text.\\" I fear that someone may read this pop psychology rubbish and try to apply it to their own lives.

I wish I had read some of these negative reviews before I bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Conservative or Christian Buyers Beware","review":"If you liked the women's rights movement, you'll love this. Michael Gurian starts with the idea that boys have been asked to be more like girls than men because of the victim/villian stereotypes of the women's rights movement. Unfortunately, he does not recommend a conservative correction to this injustice. What he recommends is a liberation of male culture. Teach boys that whatever you feel is OK, you just need to channel it in the right direction. For instance, Guirian hails masturbation as a proper channel for sexual urge. Gurian also favors the biological basis of homosexuality, explaining that there is a genetic tendancy toward being homosexual. He believes that we should just accept the facts if our sons \\"are\\" homosexual. This makes as much sense as allowing them to drink alcohol because, as we all know, there is a genetic tendancy toward being an alcoholic. Buyer beware, this is not a conservative or Christian approach to raising our sons."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a very dangerous book.","review":"In The Wonder of Boys, Gurian begins with biological \\"facts\\" and launches off into agenda-driven, obervation-based opinion. His mix of observation and facts in the first few chapters especially is very effective for convincing readers of his perspective; most readers will not read critically enough, nor be informed enough, to notice when he makes gross assumptions about brain development, for instance, or posits a common boy behavior as biologically based when socialization plays, I and many others would argue, the definitive role. He refers to cultural and anthropological \\"trends\\" only when they serve his argument, not citing cultures where those same \\"boy\\" traits are manifested very differently than in our culture."},{"rating":"1","title":"boys need punishment??? WHAT?! and rarely, a spanking???","review":"At first, I thought that Gurian had some very helpful/insightful things to say about what boys need....THEN, he goes on to say that boys need rules, and consequences, and punishments... he suggests how to punish a boy.... and then even goes on to write about SPANKING! saying that it should be very rarely done, and then quotes John Rosemond's guidelines for spanking !!!!After reading Raising Cain, I was definitely expecting more from Gurian than punishment....I can see how the other reviewers would say that they think his poor relationship with his mother (as he describes it) made an impact on the writing of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Research is laking and gay lifestyle is okay?","review":"As the father of 4 boys, I'm always looking for books that help with insight into raising strong men. Although this book has information and research, I find much of it anecdotal and question the methodology and sample sizes. I also do not agree nor like the authors assertions that because society has grown more accepting of the gay lifestyle that this is okay for children and a natural environment for them to thrive. The entire premise behind this book is that boys are different than girls. I agree. Which also leads for me, how kids need a mom and a dad. We provide different support, discipline, approaches. Again, being one who's raising 4 boys, I see a huge difference in how my boys of various ages respond to my wife and myself. Our goals are the same, our approaches of often different. I will be returning this book and would recommend Bringing Up Boys, also found on Amazon as a good book for this type of subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"Realistic view of boyhood with tough solutions.","review":"As I read this book I knew many women would have a tough time with this straight discussion about boys and men.

I have found the Elm Street in my own town.)As was expected, Bentley Little wove a terrifying tale of terror in which the line between nightmare and reality is blurred to oblivion. Yes, a fascinating world indeed.I have to give the book a 4 star rating. As strong as Little's contribution to the book was, some of the other writing was not up to par. All in all, a great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it","review":"Enjoyed it and learned some things about Mr Eastwood...............Both my husband and I thought the DVD was fantastic.Would buy it again.............."},{"rating":"1","title":"another borefest","review":"This is the second dud in a row that I've read.

Other notable songs include Jesus Told Me To Love You, The Road To Damascus, I Prayed About It and more. This CD is very good listening anytime.

It sometimes may sound a bit cheesy, but it's got a real sensibility.

I picked this CD up at a used CD store for about [price] and it's some of the most beautiful music I'll ever hear. Songs range from the cryptic (Low Red Moon, Sad Dress, Someone to Die For) the pristine acoustic (White Belly, Untogther, Stay) alternative guitar heavy (Dusted, Angel) and unforgettable (Gepetto, Feed the Tree, Slow Dog). In every song, Tanya Donelly loads it with millions of hooks and she can pump out the most amazing guitar riffs ever heard. Her voice is light, airy, saddened, and dry which makes for an easy listen. Her vocals, unlike most bands, go with the songs. The magic of Star, to me, is unexplainable, but it just works. This CD is a rare gem that you can get under [price] now a days, so there is no reason not to buy and atleast try it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Early '90s Goodness","review":"This CD has a few songs that were somewhat popular in the early '90s, and a bunch more songs that, while also good, have been heard by a lot fewer people. Tanya Donelly's lyrics tend to be a bit strange (\\"see-through skin, the kind of skin you can see through\\"?), but the songs work. There are a variety of styles and tempos on this CD, and overall the mix is good. My one problem is the fact that all the faster tempo songs are on the first two-thirds of the disc, leaving the last third of the disc somewhat unbalanced."},{"rating":"2","title":"a Beautiful Feast For a Big King Cat","review":"I have loved this book.

However even as my Pentax K100D camera is listed in the camera matrix spreadsheet (available on CaseLogic's website) for this backpack, it will only fit, if I remove the lens, which is not really practical. Alternatively, remove the suspended base, lay the camera on it's back and loose the benefit of the shock protection.The straps on the side of the bag is to short to hold on to a tripod, which makes me wonder what they are there for. I tied on bungee chords to hold on the tripod.Construction and build appears good. Fit for the lenses are tight but workable. If you have a lot of extra gear like cables, filters, etc. you will likely end up using one or more lens places to hold that.I have a CaseLogic shoulder bag SLRC-2 which works great, but should I make the selection of a backpack again, I would likely go for a larger model."},{"rating":"2","title":"Practical - safety for your precious camera","review":"Many reviewers have commented about this bag being slightly cramped, but that's exactly why I like it.

You would think the author was going somewhere with a project, and then he'd just start a new paragraph with something else. Plus, many figured did NOT match the text. The author was also guilty of many \\"but, we'll cover that later\\" or \\"but we covered that in chapter X\\". This was a poor, poor buy. IDG books are usually good, this wasn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent video","review":"My baby and I love, love, love this video.

It has cute songs and graphics. I would highly recommend this DVD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not professional","review":"I purchased this DVD based off the positive reviews. This DVD was a bit odd. It is very cheaply made, the music is jazzy which does not seem to fit with baby massage and the joy segment is almost exactly the same as the peace segment just a little different music. It is not enjoying to watch. I gave it two stars because I did learn some good information. Once I have mastered the massage moves I will not longer use the DVD because it is really annoying. I wish I had purchased baby TaTa insead, it looks more professional."},{"rating":"1","title":"This DVD was repetitive and a little bit boring","review":"I found this DVD to be kind of boring and repetitive. It was not very professional and I didn't get a lot out of it. I thought a lot of the information was just common sense. I also purchased Aimee's Babies and I liked it so much more. Aimee is a pediatric occupational therapist with a ton of information. It was much more informative and professionally made. I would definitely recommend Aimee's Babies over this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect companion to that intimate candle-lit dinner for 2","review":"If you're looking for an album to set the right mood for a romantic rendezvous, look no further than this soundtrack.

Boyzone is the only really gifted singing group (or person) on this album, and the reason for that is because the person who discovered them was Andrew Lloyd Webber. (Andrew Lloyd Webber also wrote \\"No Matter What,\\" by the way, for his musical \\"Whistle Down the Wind,\\".)

Schmaltzy, but funny and reasonably well-observed.But the soundtrack........well, Elvis Costello and Al Green must be short of money. I can't think of any other reason why they'd consent to have their songs used alongside this pile of sub-R. Kelly, sickening, soulless soul trash.Confirms my impression that Ronan Keating is going to be the same horrible influence on 90s/00s UK music that Babyface has already been on the US. Although to be fair, Another Level et al are quite happy to provide similarly uninspired material...Bye bye originality, hello songs for people with double-figure IQs to meet and reproduce to. If anyone can think of any other purpose for this album, I'd love to hear it.Boy-band pop's always been brain-dead, but at least it used to be fun...if you buy this album, make sure you have your brain AND adrenaline gland removed first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing Songs","review":"Where is the incredible Pulp song that was in the movie?

Now you can also have the formulaic soundtrack.

Ruggie's argument, and this is one of the biggest problems with multilateral liberalism, is limited to about a dozen countries, namely Western Europe, Canada, the US, and I suppose you can throw in Australia and New Zealand, and he isn't always consistent in dealing with this limited scope.

I thought this would be even better, with the cordless option and two speeds. I used it once with no problems. The next time I tried to use it, the battery was almost dead (it had been plugged in and charging all day). When I plugged it in, it would not turn on. I had to unplug the charging cable in order for the epilator to work at all, and when plugged in, the charging indicator light didn't go on, and it did not charge. I did not receive a packing slip or receipt with my order, so I emailed the company and asked how to return or replace it, and they never responded.

Unlike Esquivel, Randall conveys these parallels through a collection of poems, most of which double as recipes, some for delicious meals, others for life itself.In the thirty-five poems tucked inside the covers of Hunger's Table, Randall addresses how food is more than nourishment for the body, it is also nourishment for the mind and soul. The quantity and kinds of food eaten are often influenced by various factors and events in our lives--family reunions are celebrated around a bountiful table, a woman depressed about her love life (or lack thereof) may comfort herself with a pint of Ben and Jerry's, etcetera. Taking everyday situations as these, Randall creates a series of powerful, beautiful poetry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Using the force","review":"The reason I bought this book was to gain knowledge on how we can use \\"energy\\" as a force.

I have been searching for years to purchase this so I can watch it again and again. I first watched this series in England in the early 80's. It is absolutely riviting. Maybe it was because I watched while living on an RAF base, that it meant so much to me.It helped me understand why some of the locals of that generation were not too thrilled with American servicemen, dating their daughters/granddaughters. I love historical fiction and this is a fantastic example. Very easy to become involved in the lives of the characters. I remember waiting eagerly for the next episode. I can't wait til September. Again, thank you Amazon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A different perspective of a Historical Period","review":"I just finished viewing this series and enjoyed each of the episodes. They were all logically done. The stories had a soap opera ring to them, but the scenery, acting, and social atmosphere of the times really carried the series when the story line bogged down. The story was predictable and had been portrayed in other films, but still, it was a refreshing take. Everything was done in good taste. There were several stories combined in the series and the transition from each story to the next was handled very well. I was happy that I purchased the set and hope there is a follow up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Film","review":"The scenes between Susannah York and Michael J. Shannon were very convincing.

This was worse than American daytime TV soap operas! The acting is appalling and stilted, which is a shame because there are some decent actors in the show. Apparently they couldn't make sense of the awful script and terrible writing. The last show should have tied up all the loose ends but instead leaves viewers hanging by a very thin thread--perhaps they made a sequel I'm not aware of.

The best is that the sum is even better than the parts: both play energetically and tastefully off the other.I personally found the quality of the album variable from a sound perspective - it is, after all, a live performance. However, unless you are a complete sound snob, it is easy to get past this and appreciate a glimpse at what it must have actually been like to be there. However, while the quality of the recording is very high given the setting, if you want perfect studio production, this isn't it.If you like Jaco, you probably already own this; if you like Brecker/Mintzer, this is a must have. The Chicken and Invitation alone are worth the price of the album."},{"rating":"1","title":"4 1/2 stars?","review":"I don't understand the reviews of this album. Jaco was an amazing jazz bassist.

We glued it back on with wood glue, which put the toy out of commission for a day.PLAY TIME: It worked great! For half an hour. Then the back wheels fell off. No amount of screw tightening will keep them on for more than a few minutes of basic, driving around the living room play.OPINION: What a piece of wooden junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Appropriate for Children, Poorly Made","review":"I put this on a wish list for my toddler, only to discover when it arrived that it was meant for ages 6 and up. My husband had to put it together (way too complicated and intricate for my 6-year-old), and he found the pre-drilled holes were off, it was difficult to follow the instructions, and it was hard to get the pieces to fit together. The finished product has dropped wheels, making it downright dangerous for the variety of age groups in my house. It is also extremely heavy and hard for children to move. It is a hazard and a disappointment and makes me question Melissa & Doug's quality control."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fell Apart after 2 weeks","review":"I purchased this for my 2 year old who LOVES trash trucks. My 11 year old put it together, along with my husband and myself(yes it took 3 of us). My son loved it, although the screws were stripped where you dump the trash so that part never worked. Over a period of 2 weeks, it fell apart piece by piece, and not just the parts that had to be screwed together, the pieces that were glued literally started breaking off. I was so happy for him to have a wooden trash truck but this is junk. It now is in the trash, beyond repair. My advice not worth the money, especially if you have a toddler who wants to play with it all the time. Go for the plastic one, soooooo worth it.

However, the screws that came with the truck were not long enough, and the wheels and other parts kept falling off, no matter how tight we pulled the screws. We replaced most of the screws, but the wood is too soft and even the longer and wider screws keep coming loose.

I got this truck for my son because he LOVES garbage trucks and I thought this one would be better quality than the other garbage trucks on the market. Boy was I wrong! It looks like a piece of crap once assembled. Pre-drilled holes are off, resulting in the whole thing looking crooked. One wheel doesnt even touch the ground. The velcro that holds on the trash can is pathetic and barely holds it. One piece was missing a sticker, so one side doesn't have a \\"door and window\\". Save your money and try another garbage truck. I no longer hold the \\"melissa & doug\\" name up with \\"good quality\\" -- I've had about 5 M&D toys recently that were very poorly made."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"I bought this toy for a unit on wheels for my preschool classroom. It took me TWO hours to assemble this truck. Several pieces were not designed so that you could screw and hold the part at the same time, thus making it difficult to snug up the screws. I put out the trash truck on Monday morning. My morning students played with it. In the afternoon I saw a broken piece of yellow wood laying on the carpet. Discovered where it came from.

Secondly, there is no nice way to say this, the patterns are ugly.

There are few individuals who embody Christ's heart quite the way that Rich did. He was humble even when he had every reason not to be. He was poor even though the had the ability to be rich. He lived in a trailer when he could have chosen to own numerous homes. He was a ragamuffin at heart and his life is probably more impacting that his music.This book is filled with great stories about Rich that show you the heart that he had for God and others. Reading this inspired me to be more like Christ in my everyday life and to live out what I believe in every way that I can. Though Rich's music is amazing, this book illistrates the amazing life behind that music.For fans of Rich Mullins this is the a must.

Mullins strength lay not in his ability to overcome temptations, but in his willingness to rely upon God's grace.For all of us who struggle to live meaningful, Christian lives, this book is an inspiration!

It speaks of the things about which he was most passionate (the love of God, detachment from possessions, unconditional acceptance of others, the longing for heaven) and makes God the real focal point. I appreciated the fact that Rich Mullins still struggled daily with sin and was very open about that fact when he ministered, but, like another flawed individual, King David, he was a man after God's own heart. Rich lives on, not only in heaven, but in his music and in the legacy he left behind. He began a work among Native Americans that others will continue.

After reading this book, I suddenly understood that some of the root causes of the economic dilemmas for working mothers are actually caused by our tax system.McCaffery is right--we need change, and this book explains why."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprisingly dull","review":"Even after hearing about the uneven writing, I was surprised by how meandering and unfocused this book is. It's a mishmash of confused metaphors, irrelevant details, and unclear points. I can't tell whether it's meant to be instructive, or merely illustrative. If you're already familiar with the technologies described, you'll be bored. If you aren't, you'll be baffled. None of the men discussed in the book are portrayed as being particularly interesting, aside from the obvious, though unexplored details of their various technical abilities. I was excited by the subject matter, but put off by the plodding and pedantic prose. It feels like Gilder wrote this while half asleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"very boring book","review":"I was very disappointed in this book. Gilder writes in a very obtuse way and it is hard to connect the dots with him. Save you money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor pictures","review":"The pictures are so poor and blurred that this concert never should have been released on DVD. When purchasing a DVD the customer should expect far better pictures than what this DVD is offering. The selection of songs and arias is excellent, but that can not compensate for inferior pictures."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better on VHS","review":"I liked most of the selections included on the tape. The sound and video quality were much better on vhs than dvd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor technical reproduction of a good concert","review":"This should have been a great concert DVD since Sutherland, Horne, and Bonynge are amoung the best of their time. Unfortunately, the video and audio looked and sounded like 1960s TV (it was actually recorded in the mid 1980s) with mostly out-of-focus video (it appears that the problem was a very shallow depth-of-field since the extreme closeups were more in focus)and dolby stereo (2.0) that sounded more like some of my old analog LPs than a digital recording. Its too bad they didn't digitally remaster the concert."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"The Druid Duo\\"","review":"This wonderful concert reminds those of us fortunate enough to have heard these singers in person of the excitement their outstanding vocalism alone was able to generate. Highpoints here are the fiendishly difficult duets from \\"Semiramide\\" and \\"Norma,\\" both of which are sung almost to perfection. Horne is in her absolute vocal prime, moving with ease from lush, long-held low notes to fleet coloratura passages. Sutherland is somewhat past her prime. Consequently, her very highest notes are noticeably thin here, and her release from held notes sometimes has her slipping from pitch. Nevertheless, these are small faults when taken in conjunction with her still mostly present, extraordinary elasticity and power in taking on such demanding duets and arias. Altogether, this concert amounts to a grand night of singing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Would've given it 5 stars but...","review":"The pendant itself is beautiful and the little moonstones glow beautifully. Over a black background they look like aquamarine cabochons-so blue! Love it! However... the silk chord isn't worth a penny: it broke as soon as I put it on. No glue on one end. Into the trash it went! Luckily, I had on hand a better quality rubber chord and there's no chance of the color running. Silver Insanity might consider switching to rubber chords-or using glue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Faerie Star Pendant","review":"I was very disappointed with this pendant. From the picture I couldn't tell how small the moonstones would be. While I like the overall seven-pointed faerie star design, the heavy silver star overpowers the moonstones. The moonstones are much too small."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good disposable bags.","review":"Great cleanup, strong and can put up with a good session of decorating with multiple refills without showing much in the way of losing form.

I had to throw it away because the cream cheese frosting I saved to use the next day was forgotten, and it sat in my fridge a little too long. These disposables are perfect for me. I recall some users saying it was a bit too small for them. I agree. It's a bit smaller than what I'm used to, but as long as you put less in there it will be fine.

Clark shows complete confidence in his work, dropping clues along the way to the horror that has invaded the town. His characters are believable and likable. The story is original and well thought out. Many thanks to Don D'Auria (editor) for bringing this incredible talent to the states. Simon Clark is not the next Stephen King, he's the improved Stephen King. I rank him now in the top 10 horror authors working today... Clark, Laymon, Wright, Clegg, Little, Ketchum, Hautala, Lee, Piccirilli, and Lumley."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing memorable + not entertaining","review":"Ordered this based on glowing reviews, and was disappointed.

Ended up selling it to local bookstore for far less than paid for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasn't Impressed!","review":"Judging by all the reviews, I decided to read this book. I am a big fan of Graham Masterton and James Herbert (our other token British horror novelists) so I expected to be wowed by Simon Clark's talent. All in all the book was just mediocre. And most reviews pointed towards this novel being his best. I was rather disappointed. The book just didn't have any guts really! I found myself hurrying through this book to pick up something better. Now if you would like great British horror try Prey by Graham Masteron (awesome!) or anything by James Herbert."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, Creepy Fun!","review":"Been quite some time since I read a book that actually gave me that dark, creepy feeling.

Looking around at what is out at the market I cannot really see a better book to start with. Each chapter is well constructed with easy to follow instructions. I cannot really fault the book. Though it was written a fair while ago it is still applicable to magic today. If there was one fault with the book I would say that you will find that you work your way through the book quite easily and all of a sudden you come across the pass which you would expect to be at the end of the book due to the nature of its difficulty. However this is only a minor point and one which does not merit giving the book a score lower than 5. If you are interested in buying a book on card magic buy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tons of Knowledge, Difficult Read","review":"I cannot begin to explain all of the things that I learned from this beginners book on Card Magic. This book definitely is a must read for all of those looking to further their ability with cards. There are many great tricks hidden in the pages too. My only complaint is that the book isn't caught up with times and at times it takes a lot of effort to figure out what the author is trying to say. But it is the sleights that make this book golden. This book is chalk full of the fundamentals that every card magician needs to learn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This book so far has been excellent. The beginning chapter is easy and the first few tricks will get some ooohs and awwws. Take your time and read and practice. Do not be scared to make mistakes.

Lastly, never, ever reveal how your sleight is done. mikeh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bootleg Copy, Don't buy.","review":"The book seems fine, but this copy was an obvious bootleg knock off.

Very Strange."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Royal Road to Card Magic","review":"If you are looking for the easy and no effort method to card magic, this is definately not the book for you. HOWEVER, in conjuction with the DVD set with the same title, then, with a little to a lot of effort, you will be turning out card tricks that will sometimes amaze yourself, even while you are doing them!By itself, the book's graphics are somewhat difficult to discern. But careful reading of the text resolves most of these issues.Again, what makes this book so very good is the DVD. They enhance each other so that understanding each process is very easy.Good Luck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"I have only had this book less than a week and I have made much progress thanks to it's detailed instructions.

If you dont already have a basic understanding of how to handle cards you might want to start with a video first. It's usually a bit easier to learn when you can actually see whats going on. A side from all that, this is a really good book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can be very hard to read/understand","review":"I'm having fun with this book, but at the same time i get extremely frustrated with it! i love doing the tricks, but some (about 1/4) instructions are just written very poorly, then i give up on that trick :(i'm needing to read some tricks over and over to understand the mechanics of it (not becuase the trick is hard to do, but because i can't figure out exactly WHAT TO DO, becuase the instructions are unclear, and the english is funky) i recommend the a newer version of this book which might have better english.

It said to get the DVD set instead... which is partially incorrect. If you're truly interested in learning and perfecting, get _both_. The DVD set corrects some of the mistakes in the book, as well as offers different, more effective methods of some of the tricks.The book is surely one of the classics in magic, and I'll have mine until the day I die.

I loved it.I thought it was a wonderful, midrashic-style retelling of the story of Esther. It is engaging, and the author successfully draws the reader into the characters.What I enjoyed the most about the book is it doesn't sugar-coat the story. The story of Esther is told to children, we have Purim carnivals and kids dress up and play ~ and that is all well and good but the story is really an adult story of love and betrayal, of hatered and strength, and of that which is hidden and that which is revealed.This book is a must-read for Jewish book groups, and highly recommended in general!We have also read: The Monday the Rabbi Took Off, I Asked for Wonder, The Covenant, Destined to Choose, and Matches. Each a very different book, all have led to fabulous and thought-provoking discussions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Promising but fails to deliver","review":"This is one of those books I found most promising and I wanted to like it even more. But it gets to be boring and it doesn't completely deliver. The idea is there. And it has an excellent start but then it doesn't lift off. Still, it can make a good easy read. The characters are quite one-dimensional, particularly the heroine Queen Esther, who never truly comes to life. Historical fiction is such a hard genre and this book proves it. Yet, it is not completely bad. It has its moments."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"The story of Esther is one of the most exciting tales in Bible. If you can get past the archaic format, you can see the makings of an amazing and passoinate epic: an orhpan girl, taken against her will into the king's harem, rises up despite the odds to become a queen and her people's savior. Esther could have been smart and cunning, or a heart-warming anti-heroine, or a dozen other distinct characters. Instead, she's just boring. Khon takes the ancient text and rewrites it in modern language, adding some filling, but nothing new or fresh. The characters are one dimensional and the narrative is flawed.All in all a very disappointing retelling of a tale with a lot of potential."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland and Boring","review":"I would really like to give this book a good review because the subject matter is surely captivating, but I found the book to be bland and redundant.

Everything was bad about this book> wouldn't recommend anyone to buy this book if you do your going to be very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not faithful at all","review":"This book was a quick read, but it was deeply flawed. To begin with, in place of depth of information about the time period, we get repetition, such as constantly describing the same beauty regimen. Esther isn't much of a character; she comes across as a bored whiner. Mordechai is basically slandered by Kohn's writing that he's discarded his faith and only rediscovers it at the end. The Book of Esther is short but there are many explanatory stories that flesh it out pretty well. Kohn seems to have either not heard of them or ignored them so anyone who knows the Book of Esther and the other stories will find this book very unfaithful because only the bare bones of the plot have been kept. Finally, the Gilded Cage is billed as a feminist story, yet it is anything but. One of the subtexts in the Book of Esther is that men and women need to respect each other, while in the Gilded Chamber this is completely missing."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love the harem type novels","review":"I have found that I love the novels that take place in a harem type setting, more so then other time settings and places. This one was good, especially since it was that of a real person. The characters are vast and full of life, believable above all. Although I had a little trouble believing in Esther's love for Mordechai. How could she love the man (yes, he did take her in when she was orphaned) that didn't really speak to her or see her the entire time she was in his household. Her long lasting love for him was pretty pathetic when she had a man who would have done anything for her. Though it was good, I felt the ending was too abrupt and not satisfying enough.

Sealing joints and corners with duct tape works ok, but will unwrap as the tape ages. This is easy to cut and shape around the pipe and corners. What is great is the fiberglass gets sealed in under the cloth and away from your skin so you don't get itchy when changing filters or working around the furnace. Nice professional look too.Simply wrap the pipe and let it dry. Then paint the cloth to make it water tight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Im very pleased","review":"I ordered this for use in making Dioramas . My first expirience using plaster strips was using woodland scenics plaster wrap and while that is an excellent product it doesnt come with nearly enough to finish large scale project . I finished off the 10 foot length pack and my project which was a cave still required more . I ordered the Pacon because it comes in a 20 lbs size and so far its great .The only diffrence between this and woodland scenics is that woodland dries to a nice white hardness and the Pacon turns grey when its dry . As far as texture it tends to blend out evenly so you dont get as many lil bald spots .I will be using this for all of my large project needs .Side note I did notice that my hands itch with this product , Im allergic to alot of stuff so its problably just me but the woodland gave me no itching .

At first, I erroneously thought that the authors were British. When they had American characters saying \\"maths\\", I put this down to a gruesome and horrific lack of research on the part of the authors and prepared to put it down unread. Then I did some research and found out that the authors were American. So why the British quotes, spelling, grammar, etc? Because it was typeset, printed and bound in the UK. From an American manuscript. Anglicizing the entire content of a huge manuscript in American English is about the funkiest and most pointless thing I have ever seen. Ever. Especially when they release it on the American market. I can't be the only American to find this so odd that it detracts from the story. I would like to find a volume printed in the US. I doubt very much that I have the patience to finish all four volumes published this way. My loss, I guess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good ideas, bad writing","review":"The Hickory Staff is a bit of a mixed bag. On the one hand, the basic ideas are pretty good. I like the storyline, overall. However, it's full of the most awful cliches and lazy writing imaginable. Imagine a movie adaption of The Loard of the Rings, but this time directed by John Woo and starring Vin Diesel and you'll be just touching the edges of how cheesy this book gets.I did a search on Amazon for the authors and one of them seems to be a true crime writer, which would explain the penchant for being constantly overly-melodramatic. (Imagine a Steven King story as told by a 13-year old drama queen.)The characters are paper-thin. There is no real depth to them and their emotions and reactions are canned responses with all the sophistication of a beer commerical.This book gets two stars for the ideas and nothing at all for the story-telling itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"A terrific book","review":"Not just an historical tale, but a meditation on the contradictions of privilege and power within oppression.

I found this in audio book form and decided to give it a try.First I'll comment on the audio book. The reader was Stefan Rudnicki and he did an excellent job with the characterizations. It was obvious who was speaking and the voice fit the characters well. I liked especially how he portrayed the queen as is dripped with evil and sarcasm. The sound quality was excellent and it was easy to understand everything.The story itself fits squarely in the fantasy genre. The world he creates is interesting and the story line grabbed my attention. Be warned that this is a brutal and graphic book, more so than I expected from Card. Overall I enjoyed the book and would recommend it to readers of fantasy. I would not consider it a kids book though."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful, Very Important History of Offshore Oil.","review":"This well-written, researched, and readable book, is probably the most important work that there is on the history of offshore oil in Santa Barbara.

His collection of radio signals during the war gave what he thought was a clear picture of the N. Vietnamese air defence system, which I thought was interesting since it was the first time I have ever heard of such a thing.This was not by any means the main point of the book. The book discussed all political developments about the POWs thru the 70's and 80's.The book does get bogged down in what I considered too many personal capture stories of the POWs.

Your editorial review picks a bit about the production, and in a couple of respects I agree. The ballad, Wishin' is absolutely georgous, and Christy's voice could have carried it, my opinion - that it was kinda overloaded with pedal steel (which I usually love) and such, I dunno, it sounds kind of stock here. Plus, besides adding star power to the festivities - I do not see what use those REM malletheads add to the equation, they play with equal lack of feel, no matter what genre they attempt.

The DVD is very well done, and Ortberg's style of presenting is not only inspirational but fun. The participant's guide is a little overwhelming, so we've had to pick and choose what we discuss after the video portion -- there is far more material than can be handled in a one-hour session. I would recommend this video to any pastor or leader who wants to present some great material that will really help people grow spiritually. We did not ask people to read the book first, but after two sessions people indicated they wanted to buy the book to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Needs a math editting","review":"I agree with the other reviews, except for the math editting. Its apparant that the book wasn't math editted in its entirety, because the math notation isn't consistent.

The illustrations of the cat and Grandpa both depict human genitalia. In case you think that this is just my misinterpretation of the drawings, I polled multiple adults without telling them about the pictures and they all had the same conclusion. My 5 year old daughter did not like the modern Peter and we couldn't understand why the duck has such a ridiculous upper bill. The classic version of the story is better.I enjoyed the accompanying music and narration- it is creative and not overdone. I would recommend purchasing the music CD separately."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it!","review":"This purchase was a supreme disappointment!Those familiar with the traditional rendition of Peter and the Wolf will immediately notice this versions diminished story line. Although the music was technically/creatively competent, the numerous omissions were a clear distraction.The accompanying book was an absolute flog. Bono's illustrations were feeble, and at times inappropriate (especially the rendition of the cat). His jaunty presentation of Peter, wearing sunglasses, was an obvious narcissistic self-homage. Family and friends universally agreed that this book had a \\"negative feel\\" to it.

This Nutcracker, which I have owned ever since it was released, leaves all other versions earthbound. Nobody else captures the emotion within the fantasy so delicately and yet so forcefully. As a former ballet critic who saw more Nutcrackers than he cares to remember, this is the one that leaves visions dancing in this kid's head. Bychkov, whose Eugen Onegin also remains nonpareil, gets a spectacular and detailed sound from the BPO. Yes, Bychkov's Rachmaninoff symphony is also ravishing. Now exceedingly hard to find, this Nutcracker is a treasure. Pounce when next you see it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Joan deserved another Oscar for this one---","review":"Portraying a wealthy woman looking for a purpose in her life, Joan Crawford beautifully acts her role in this one. She finds lonely, dirty Esther Costello, a young girl blind, deaf, and mute from a mental shock during the war. With visions of Helen Keller, Joan unselfishly begins to work with her. At this point her ruthless, although handsome husband, re-enters her life, hoping to cash in on the financial success the Esther Costello funds have been bringing in to help other young people who have suffered as Esther has done. After a morbid rape scene, the unfaithful husband has a just end, but unfortunately it takes Joan, too. What a movie! It is fasinating to watch Joan work. She herself said if she deserved one Academy Award for Mildred Pierce, she deserved two for this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"I AGREE WITH rivercircus REVIEW ENTIRELY","review":"Rivercircus' review was well written and I agree wholeheartedly with every word written there.

But, I tried it again the next day, this time without much activity, and I intentionally smelled my pits throughout the day. There was no smell at all, well maybe a slight smell of table salt, but very faint.

I held off judgement and just kept reading, and when I finished, I was so glad I had done so. I really liked the mix of science and paranormal events, because I believe that we need both in order to make the most of our lives. The descriptions of the Amazon were amazing.

I was intrigued by the cover, and curious; but I have never read any of Isabel Allende's works before, and as such have nothing to compare it to.All that I could think about while reading this was how often she repeated herself, and how terrible the dialouge is at some places. The characterization leaves alot to be desired. The only really interesting character was, in my opinion, Borbora, Nadia's pet monkey."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I really enjoyed this book in the beginning.

Even though there are some slow parts, most of the book is full of action and adventure. I like this book because you can't predict what will happen and it makes you want to keep reading. I would recomend this book to people who like adventure and fantasy and people over the age of 12. It can be hard to understand at some points so you would want to be a farly good reader. All in all I would say that this was a good book for some people, but truthfully not me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment....","review":"City of Beasts is a book that rockets off to a great beginning, a mediocre middle, and a plunging, just awful ending. In my opinion, it are the books like City of Beasts that disappoint me the most. I mean, you have a fantastic opening. GREAT! Keep going before you lose both the suspense and the momentum! However, the plot just keeps slowing down and twisting. By the time you reach the end, BAM the book finishs with a crash, and you end up with wasted money and time. I bet if Isabel Allende had spent a couple more months revising the ending, City of the Beasts would have been an A+ novel. But sadly, it isn't...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good gift.","review":"City of the Beasts is being marketed as a children's book, apparently because its leads are teenagers, it is heavy on educational passages about the jungle, and its green theme is preached rather than developed.However, it is not likely to appeal to young readers. The translation uses academic phrasing rather than natural. The characters do not grow through conflict, they just add on capabilities as needed, and the ending hands off the resolution to grownups."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beastly Boring","review":"I found this book in Perugia, when I was desperate for new reading material in English (besides the copy of Dan Brown's hideous ANGELS AND DEMONS someone left in our hotel). Had it not been for the dearth of reading material, I would have never finished this book. I thought at first it was a problem of translation from Spanish to Italian, then Italian to English, but that was not it. This book is written for young people, but seems to assume young people are terminally stupid. Would not recommend this, even if you are out of reading material. Read your guide book again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eye-Catcher!","review":"Slowly wandering the school library I happened to come across a book; City of the Beasts.

Far from it. There are militant Palestinian's whose mantra is to eliminate Israel. What are they to do?

The author has a point of view and goes through great lengths to edit facts to get to a conclusion. This is a book that is great for learning a way of thinking, an agenda, but not a good book to get to facts. If you can see the difference than this will be an interesting read."},{"rating":"1","title":"A ONE-SIDED DIATRIBE","review":"Not meant for folks who want a balanced and serious retrospective on the relationship between the 3 peoples.

Her face just lights up as soon as she sees the monkey. She responds to the soothing voice by cooing back. It is a great toy for me to use when interacting with my daughter.

I can't even sing \\"Head Shoulders Knees and Toes\\" now without making her cry. Even if this monkey didn't scare the pants off my daughter, I think that it is not the best quality toy, and certainly the idea that a child is going to learn any more from it than from an engaged parent is a lot of marketing hoo-ha."},{"rating":"1","title":"badly organized, incomplete","review":"The back says \\"In-depth walkthroughs of every quest\\", but a quick examination reveals that they don't even include information on where to find a couple of the class promotion quests, which are very important. Also, they've organized everything around the regions instead of around the quests, which makes it difficult to find the info you want without accidentally seeing stuff about quests that happen in the same region, but much later in the game.It's an OK book, and does cover the things that are likely to have you stuck, but the MM6 book was superior in many ways."},{"rating":"1","title":"Second-worst strategy guide I've ever read!","review":"I'd give it first-worst but frankly it does not deserve first-anything.

And another thing, he mixes every single song exactly the same way which I find gets annoying to listen to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great reference for fans and those new to Tolkien's work","review":"I love this book and thought it was a great idea. I've read The Hobbit and The Lord of The Rings before and am currently reading through them again after after fifteen years. I'm finding this book a nice reference when I want to know more about a person or being (Tom Bombadil, anyone?). I am also involved in online gaming and am currently playing The Lord of the Rings Online and have used this book just to recall certain things in the storyline which I have actually found in the game so, inadvertently, this book has been helpful in-game as well. Just a convenient resource for those who want to dig a little deeper into Tolkien's world of Middle Earth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book ever!","review":"This book is perfect if you are abso;uetly obsessed with Tolkien's world, The Lord of the Rings.

The most wanted quality of a reference is its completeness. I assure you: there are NO entries missing. Places, people, topics and events are ALL present. There are many cross-references that help you find more about a specific subject. I've been in Sciences for quite a few years and read intensively. In many books I've read, the index is often weak and incomplete. As an index, the book fulfills my wishes, everything is there. Furthermore all entries receive a complete description and explains relationships with other subjects. This work is apparently a Ph.D., well it certainly deserves the title."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely Serving Its Intended Purpose","review":"This is an excellent handbook for any Tolkien zealot who seeks to learn more about Middle-earth. Indeed, it's pretty much ALL here from the practical to the useless. It even makes for an entertaining read by itself if you're as huge a fan of the Master of Fantasy as this reader is, and it will reveal to you in full the complexity and vastness of the place Tolkien's mind produced. It's a very nice addition to any pureblood fantasist's bookshelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"A-Z Complete!","review":"This is a great book to have. This guide has every character, place and event from The Hobbit, LoTR and The Silmarillion. If your really into Tolkien, you need this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best \\"Glossary\\" Written","review":"This book has been THE reference book to use for years. I used to consult Foster's earlier edition (before the Silmarillion was published), then replaced that edition with this one. It remains the only book you'll need (in addition to Tolkien's works, of course.)The only minor detail I have ever found is that Foster says that \\"half orc\\" isn't used in LOTR's. It is. I'll let you close readers find it for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"You need to be a tolkien head to understand the explanations","review":"Somehow, I was always of the opinion that an explanation was supposed to make things EASIER to understand. Many of Foster's explanations only seem to make things murkier. Witness the first sentence of his description of Sauron: \\"Ainu, one of the Maiar of Aule.\\" Now, if that explanation means anything to you, you probably don't need the Complete Guide. For the rest of us people who get out sometimes, this explanation is useless. Admittedly, the explanation picks up after a bit, but why force me to wade through a paragraph of gibberish to find out what I need to know. Why not just tell me that Sauron is some really bad guy or something, you know, English. But then again, if he wrote that way, Foster couldn't impress you with his Tolkien Fluency.Don't impress me. Just tell me what I need to know.Otherwise, a somewhat useful book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Way to Read and Understand Tolkien","review":"Reading the Lord of the Rings trilogy with this book next to me was a whole new experience. There are hundreds of incredibly subtle references that you can shed new light on, and a wealth of background information on every character and culture to be found in the guide. The reason it does not get 5 stars is this: This book is abridged from a similar book released in the 1970's. The older version contains more, unofficial information from various other sources. I was able to find that at an antique store by a stroke of luck, and I found that it was even more helpful, it even had maps showing troop movement at the Battle of Pelennor Fields. So if you find the old version, get that, but if you can't this is well worth it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the best reference book for Tolkien out.","review":"This book was very helpful.

Overall helpful as far as history (and very extensive character explanations)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book To Understand the Middel-earth World","review":"This is a very well written though guide book for the Middel-earth world.

You need this book :)","review":"This book is the best for looking up specific people, places or things found in JRRT's 'The Lord of the Rings.' Even the most obscure item is in this book. I personally think it's better than the encyclopedia by David Day. I even used this book for a report in a class comparing Beowulf to LOTR :) It's just a great book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Must Have Guide for LOTR & the Hobbit","review":"Tolkien's books were so well-developed, with so much back-history, they read like they actually occured. You will find yourself referring to this book often while reading the books, or after viewing the movies, and it will make the experience all that better. Every place, person and event is chronicled in here. I hope they will consider a new edition, asThe Children of Hurinas since come out. Every Tolkien fan: Get this book andThe Atlas of Middle-Earth (Revised Edition). These are must haves for an immersive experience into Middle Earth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good... could be better.","review":"I agree with others that the definitions aren't often that clear and require that you know the character/item ahead of time. But there are a few areas of improvement that would really make this book shine:-Including guide words on the top of pages would make finding terms easier.-The genealogical charts at the end are full of errors - mostly typographical - including obvious ones such as switching the names \\"Aragorn II\\" and \\"Arathorn II\\".-Maps would make geographical descriptions so much easier. They may have not been included for other reasons, but would make this truly a superb reference.In conclusion, this book may be misleading in its appeal and not be so well suited to the casual reader. It may also spoil some events you have not yet read if you are reading Tolkien for the first time. It is great for that occasional (aka frequent) confusion though. It is a useful reference and with a good edit would be vastly more excellent and accurate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent CD!","review":"This is an excellent CD! I loaned this CD to a friend, who got in a car accident and left the CD in his totalled out car. I had to get on eBay to get this CD back and it was well worth every cent.

The reader knows and senses that he is being set up for something BIG.

Having said that; BUY THIS BOOK. This is more than a presentation of the Hegelian right. It is a fantastic text for \\"hermeneutics\\", if you happen to be teaching that class. It is primarily a grad-level or post-grad-level book; but with good lecture you could use it in undergrad. He respects jurgen moltmann which is also another big plus.

More than anything else, Johnny's lyrical originality is evident on this album. His backing band does a good job of playing in a minimalist manner.

Freedman puts many other authors to shame, many of which get a lot more recognition than he does. Grisham for instance, is a good author, and I like his books, but Freedman is definitely a better writer. He writes with a lot more depth than others. Maybe that is his problem; his books require a little more thought and are a bit more subtle. But as far as I am concerned, he should be right up there with Grisham, Connolly, Baldacci, Patterson, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Disappearance by J.F.

His struggle as he renters the world that he left after his divorce is a powerful story. The scenes where he confronts people he once knew in his old life are well written. They are written in such a way that the reader understands Luke's struggle, very few writers can write like that.The problem with this novel, however, is that the bulk of the novel is about the case Luke takes on. This part of the novel is non belivable. There are to many holes in the story and the conclusion of this tale is rushed and less belivable than the rest of the story.On the whole I would not recomend this book the good scenes with Luke are outweighed by a dull unbelivable court case."},{"rating":"2","title":"BOOK OF THE CENTURY!","review":"The disappearance is a thrilling book that anyone who loves mysteries should read.

You don't find out about them til you are at the end of the book. One would think that you will never know who the real killer is but when you find out you will be absolutely shocked and you will shake your head in disbelief.

It also combines courtroom drama with thriller to form a dual trial when the apparent perp starts to look a little less likely.Of course, the ending did really bother me and would have been REALLY distressing if this were the kind of novel that asked for an emotional investment. Fortunately, the price tag reflects the toll: cheap and simple."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too formulaic to really grip","review":"Freedman writes better than most of his rivals - especially the legal thriller authors, many of whom rarely rise above cardboard where the characters are concerned - but I found I could see where this story was going to easily to fast.

What I hope for in a conversation is an opportunity for enjoyable dialogue with other people with no hidden agendas.I found the book to be very repetitive.

If it was a one-hour movie, it probably would have been more entertaining. The Big Bad Evil Ice Guy is attempting to conquer the Good Guy Fire King, but most of the time is spent with the Fire King's scantily clad, fantasy-proportioned princess running from ape-like soldiers and being rescued over-and-over by a sole-surviving warrior from one of her father/king's tribes.

Awesome characters, good plot and lots of action although there is quite a bit of scantily cladness of the main female character Teegra (voice talent of Cynthia Leake).

A Conan-like movie like this made nowadays, with today's computer animation, would be bloody spectacular.But this still holds up for today. Frank Frazetta's timeless artworks holds an appeal that enfolds millions in both breadth and scope. Like may others, it was his wonderful cover artwork that enticed me to read many a paperback novel back in the 70's.And this movie is still very enjoyable. The colors in the new DVD are more vibrant.

Until Gary Cooper returns to the island and reunites with his 16 year-old daughter, this film is a warm and moving interracial love story. While the last 20 minutes don't sink the film, they undercut what could have been a genuine classic. Still very worth watching, especially on a cold, snowy night in January!

When they arrived, I could smell the cologne through the packaging, so I opened it up to see if a bottle broke. Indeed, one bottle had leaked.

Peter has lead vocals on two tracks, including the touching \\"Father and Son\\" and the rocking \\"The Tower That Ate People\\" He shares lead vocals with the other three on the wonderful 10 minute epic \\"Make Tommorow\\" which closes out the album. Each song gets better each time you listen, the Peter Gabriel \\"vibe\\" is there throughout the CD. Peter plays many instruments on each track and is joined several times by his usual bandmates:Tony Levin, David Rhodes and Manu Katche. The lyrics and the music combine to make a must-have CD!

The acousticcaptures the BA Trio so closely that one can hear their playing in minute detail. At the same time, the orchestral playing is equally detailed and attractively unbloated. The BA plays the concerto from a chamber music perspective more than a triple superstar perspective. Nothing drags and thebouyancy helps. Pressler and Greenhouse are especially eloquent. Both play with beautiful tone. Try the cello intro to the second movement and both in the polacca section of the third movement. However, Isidore Cohen sounds a bit scrawny/anemic at times. On the whole the trio playing isaddictive. This performance faces major competition from Serkin/Laredo/Parnas/Schneider/Sony and Demus/Jochum/VSO/Tacet (see the review of the Tacet).

It is not a solo album and this line up of the Modern Lovers is really great. Jonathan's songs here are all rockin', too.

And moving Hercule Poirot away from country houses was not a good idea as he traipses uncharateristically all over the continent. His famous gray cells seem a little slow as well as all the puzzles set before him will be readily apparent to the reader long before the famous detective figures it out. The saving grave of this otherwise dismal entry into the Poirot library is the return of Hastings and the development of the relationship between Poirot and himself. A mystery to be skipped except for the die hard Christie fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely not Christie's best - possibly her worst","review":"I love, love, love Agatha Christie. When I read the back cover of \\"The Big Four\\", though, I became a little skeptical about how she could cover such world intrigue with huge characters in such a short book.I should have listened to my instincts. This book seems as if A) she was in a hurry to get something out on a deadline, or B) it was written by someone else entirely.It was choppy, predictable, pointless, and very far-fetched. I hope this is not the first Agatha Christie read for someone, because otherwise it will be their last, and they will forever wonder what the fuss is about her.I gave it two stars instead of one only because it's worth a read ONLY if you are trying to read her complete collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the usual Christie book, but still fun to read","review":"This book is totally different from Christie's other stories. In this tale, Poirot faces a secret society formed by four criminal minds that seek to take over the world.And the plot reminds a lot of a James Bond film. But Poirot has no guns or gadgets but his wits. The book has a racist touch, but then, so have many James Bond books and films. And this book was written at a time when the political situation of the world was a lot different.So, what's this book worth? I personally believe it is highly entertaining. The mysterious Number Four is an intriguing character, an assassin and master of disguise. We never get to see his features, not even after he has died. As the story unfolds we face Poirot's death, his \\"return\\" from the dead and Hastings torn apart his loyalty to his friend and his wife. And the ending is equal to the rest of the book: Unrealistic, yes, but still fun to read.I read this book almost twenty years ago and I still like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who are you? And what have you done with my friend Hercule Poirot?","review":"This, Christie's 5th Poirot book (although it takes place earlier in time than the third,The Murder of Roger Ackroyd, as this novel was earlier published as a series of stories), is by far the weakest to that point. Poirot is up against a conspiracy for world domination, and he runs around in disguises, with poisoned darts in his cigarettes and little bombs. It is not unusual for Poirot to - as he says - \\"play the comedy,\\" but much of this action feels out of character. And the ending is unsatisfying. The plan of the villains seems supremely inadequate.I found it entertaining enough, but any of these others are better: The Mysterious Affair At Styles, Murder on the Links, Poirot Investigates, the Murder of Roger Ackroyd, and Peril at End House (i.e., every other Poirot book I have read recently).

If you like other Agatha Christie novels, this might not be for you, as it is more like an action \\"lara croft\\" game, rather than an adventure book.Those that like things changing constantly will love it.Recommended as one of the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"No more stereotypical Chinamen, please...","review":"Using Agatha Christie's term for Chinese, I was bothered by her unfortunate use of somewhat racist remarks in this book. However, it was the 1930's, what can I say?However, that is not the reason why I gave this only 2 stars. I don't blame people for using beliefs popular at the time in their literature. The reason 'The Big Four' deserves only 2 stars is because it was: a. lacking a realistic plot (even more so than N or M?) b. badly written. and c. It had Poirot. I hate Poirot. Give me Marple any day. So, basically, I just didn't like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not her hest","review":"I don't think Agatha Christie is at her best when she tries to do conspiracies, international affairs,etc. This book has so many plots and weird characters that it became boring after a while."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst Agatha christie's books","review":"I admire Agatha Christie very much and am a big fan of her mystery novels. She is at her best when she writes a murder mystery novel with any of her well known detectives such as Hercule poirot or Jane Marple. But Big Four is a \\"Big Disappointment\\". It has no mystery, no exciting plot and it seems to have been written when Agatha had run out of ideas and had to meet a publisher's deadline. Similar novels of her which fall in this category are Nor M, Passenger to Frankfurt. I am sure there are others which I haven't read which are similar to these titles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious and Uninteresting","review":"Coming in the wake of Murder of Roger Ackroyd, this book is a major disappointment. It is less of a novel and more of a collection of short mysteries tied by a thin thread. Like the other reviewers point out, the plot is highly unbelievable, and seems to be satirical of other crime literature.I am really glad Agatha decided to ditch Hastings in her latter novels. The running commentary provided by this latter-day Watson is redundant, distracting, and makes the whole thing look more like a story about the greatness of Poirot rather than a mystery that involves the reader. This whole book is too Sherlockian to begin with. There is much going about and doing action, despite the purported emphasis on sitting and thinking and psychology. True, some of it is in jest, such as the twin brother, but the shadow of Holmes is too dominant in this to allow enjoyment of Poirot as Poirot."},{"rating":"2","title":"A CLASSIC BY FAR","review":"I fell in love with this book. Like the last 2 people who wrote in, I feel that this is one of the best--very close to the best--Agatha Christie books. I would only put it behind The Man in the Brown Suit & The Murder of Roger Ackroyd. So I guess take it from me--The Big Four is one fine work of fiction!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of fun","review":"Goofy early Poirot has so many plot twists to it, you'll be out of breath keeping track of them all. Hastings narrates again and proves to be his usual muddled self. A nice follow up to Murder on the Links, where he first met his Cinderella, who's only used here as a plot device and never seen. The ending is vintage Christie and vintage Poirot in one. The humor interweaves nicely with some very creative death scenes. Try to overlook the Asian stereotypes as a sign of the times. Once in a while, you can notice a few other remarks in similar fashion in Christie's early works. The English mind set in the 1920's wasn't exactly illuminating"},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent","review":"The novel The Big Four is an excellent novel to read especially if you enjoy reading mystery novels. The novel is full of suspense and a little drama. It's a novel that you will not want to put down because you're going to want to know what will happen to Hastings wife after The Big Four kidnaps her, and the big question you'll have will be will Hercule Poirot ever defeat The Big Four? To find the answer to these questions Iguess you'll have to read the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Big Four","review":"I read The Big Four by Agatha Christie for school and was amazed to learn what a great book it was. I have read many other books by Ahatha Christie, but none of them even compare to this one. This book was a great read because it was action packed with many surprising revelations.The themes of this book would generally be to never jump to conclusions and never give up. These themes are clearly exposed throughout the book and make it even more meaningful for the reader. The age level i would recommend ranges from young adults, beginning at 12 because of difficult words and mild violence, to adults of all ages. I recommend this book to anyone in that age group who wants to read a great mystery."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very slow paced book.","review":"I was not real impressed with this book. Agatha Christie is supposed to be a great mystery writer, but this was not a great mystery. The only mystery was how I got myself to finish this book. It was very slow paced. The highlight of the book was when Poirot faked his own death to get the jump on the Big Four. Other than that I would not recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"un-Christie-like","review":"I agree wholeheartedly with the Reader From Dallas. This book is un-Christie-like in the extreme.

The LED's came defective. I tried wiring them to separate power source to test what part of their circuit was defective. For sure the LEDs are blown out (out of the box).Anyway, they are still useable for what I am doing but they should be about half the price given the quality and the LEDs.

It covers all aspects of wave science without the heavy textbook feel. Those with a formal science background will find this an easy read and be tempted to look into the references for a bit more of the equations behind the science.One point that it did not cover was the physics in the surfing of waves.

Tatum O'Neal is too 'knowing' for a 15 year old and I'm afraid Richard Burton (whom I normally think of as some kind of acting God) simply sleepwalks through his role. Tatum (as Sarah)comes across as too smart, knowing and sophisticated; Richard (as Ashley St Clair - what a name!)is wooden and almost tight-lipped in his scenes with Sarah. I was really quite shocked by how bad (and thin) Richard Burton looked in this film and, quite frankly, I was surprised that he'd taken on such a miserable script. Much more could have been made of this if only it had had more bite and sting to it. Instead, a convenient (and conventional) ending is what we get and it's such a disappointment. Sorry, but this one's a turkey (and I HATE saying that about anything with RB in it!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Burton fan","review":"This was an interesting film to watch because of the story line of an older male and a young female.

The young Tatum O'Neal does an excellent job despite a rather weak story line. It is worth a look if you are a fan of either actor. If you are a fan of Burton it is required viewing simply because it is one of the last full length films that this true genius made.Burton fans of the world, look at this film and see what a genius of an actor can bring to a less than spectacular film. I still bow to his memory."},{"rating":"2","title":"Burton still a powerful force.","review":"Sometimes you run across a movie that just moves you.

I especially liked \\"Imaginations Real\\", which has some tasty guitar licks, and \\"I'm not like everybody else\\", a mean 6 minute scorcher of a rock song that's part of a 4 song encore on here. He gets a little psychedelic with \\"Psycho Lounge\\", where he starts out singing Strawberry Fields and ends up doing his rendetion of \\"Girl From Ipanena\\", all done tongue in cheek. And then he kicks it in to high gear with my favorite on here \\"One Night With You\\", a song written like it was supposed to be played live.

And what prompted me to write my first review was the experience of reading Social Problems for a sociology class. The book is not too technical, in fact it is quite an easy read, but my main and only issue with the book is its distracting bias. I am a conservative, yet I do enjoy reading liberal material because it forces me to challenge my own beliefs and question the world more; but this text goes too far. Nearly every example is one that would favor an American Liberal ideology, and any conservative counter argument is either not presented, or misrepresented and labeled a logical fallacy. Finally, a good portion of the research used in this book is out of date. Many quoted sources are from the 1950s, 60s, and 70s.

Made in Sweden in 1977 with Swedish all-stars including Ove Lind (cl) and Lars Erstrand (vibes), it's a date that found everyone definitely in the mood to play. The CD opens with a superb swinging version of JUBILEE, with Wilber and Lind both playing clarinet. In fact, all the best tracks feature the two playing clarinet. LIMEHOUSE BLUES is excellent, but the supreme performance comes on AFTER YOU'VE GONE, taken way up-tempo with terrific solos from everyone. On some of the slower tunes (SUNDAY, THERE'S A SMALL HOTEL) Bob switches to soprano to good effect. The whole CD is 60 minutes of solid swinging, tasty mainstream jazz. Definitely worth checking out."},{"rating":"2","title":"what seems like a string of words can carry much weight","review":"These poems insist on their verticality as they run down the page. Their weight and glow however resides in little unexpected turns in meaning that place us squarrely in the thouroughly ambiguous world we live in. We are told that wasted time and other common negative experiences need to be accepted as maybe something like a musical pause, as crucial as the rest of the notes to the sound of the music. Reading these poems I can feel a connection with the anecdotes of Porchia or Francis Ponge's underrated work.

It is Arroyo, Lamberti, Manuguerra and Morris from an earlier met performance of 1975. I recognize it because I was there. You also cannot miss the voice of Martina Arroyo. Now, if you want Bumbry and Bergonzi, dont buy this. But as a good performance you wont be dissapointed. Arroyo recorded so little, this is a nice addition to her small catalogue. Sound is good, and the other performers are acceptable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good reading","review":"I encountered Bill Miner first in the wonderful film \\"the Grey Fox\\", which still is not available on DVD. I picked up this book some years later and was floored when I found out that Miner was born about 30 miles from me in Clinton, Mich. Miner's story is interesting and much of what was in the film actually happened. The part that the authors lost me on was their claim that Miner was a homosexual preying on younger men. I did not see any evidence of this in their material and feel it was purely specualtion on their part. As another reviewer pointed out, maybe it was to try to sell mpre copies. nit O dpm't see how that would habe helped."},{"rating":"1","title":"Might have to read this","review":"The critic's review of this book is rather depressing when one considers what happened when Francis Ford Coppola's Zoetrope Productions hired Richard Farnsworth to play the title role in the early 1980s film, The Grey Fox. The film was brilliant from beginning to end as are most of Farnsworth's films. Also, in the film, there is no mention of a gay lifestyle though back in the early 1980s, that was more taboo than today. Find the video and enjoy the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very cool short","review":"Originally bought this on iTunes. Really well produced short. Great photography, acting and writing.

Uninteresting.The Pajama Game cd is great. Loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better to wait for PAJAMA GAME to get a separate release","review":"The Roundabout Theatre Company's revival of this 1954 musical sold-out every performance thanks to stellar reviews and the Broadway musical debut of Harry Connick Jr. He and co-star Kelli O'Hara add sparkle to this classic, and Connick's jazz piano riffs on \\"Hernando's Hideaway\\" are alone worth the price of the two-disc set.Yes, there are two discs packaged as HARRY ON BROADWAY ACT ONE. In order to get THE PAJAMA GAME you also have to buy a second Cd of jazz interpretations from Connick's failed 2001 musical THOU SHALT NOT. It does appear that the two discs will eventually be released separately but for now it's a package deal only.The booklet is disappointing: No synopsis or production notes and only four black and white photos from the show."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent CD!!","review":"I was lucky enough to see The Pajama Game and even meet Harry Connick Jr. He is such an incredible performer and singer that this cd could not have been released soon enough!

I highly recommend this cd to any fans of Broadway musicals or Harry Connick Jr!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Misinformation","review":"Shirley MacLaine did not play Babe in the Broadway version of The Pajama Game. The role was originated on Broadway by Janis Page and then played in the movie version by Doris Day. In both these versions the play was written with the female character as the lead part although it was redone with the male part as the lead for Harry Connick, Jr. in the recent Broadway revival."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"The music from the Pajama Game is the best part and it could't be better than with Harry Connick Jr. singing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprising Historical Document","review":"This is the world premiere performance of the opera, with the composer conducting and Elisabeth Schwarzkopf as Anne Truelove. Although the sound is 1950-live, the voices and orchestra emerge acceptably. Most of the cast are non-native speakers of English, so one of the other recordings (all have their virtues) is a better place for a beginner to encounter this enchanting work. Nevertheless, Schwarzkopf's diction is good and her voice absolutely radiant. The accommpanying booklet contains much more information than usually comes from this label, and the price is fantastic. According to the booklet, this is the only performance of the premiere conducted by Stravinsky himself, another circumstance that makes this a recording I will cherish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worth one histroical listen, but that's it","review":"All the defects noted about this set are true. The sound is extremely murky, and the ensemble is very ragged. Stravinsky could be a decent conductor of his own music, but on the night of this premiere he must have been nervous, since the tempi are lagging and dragging throughout. The continuo is a piano rather than a harpsichord (the instrument used on every other performance). The two leads, Rounseville and Schwarzkopf, do their best but are clearly hampered by Stravinsky's failure in the pit. All in all, this set is worth one listen for historical purposes, but that's about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money","review":"Wonderful opera, beautiful performances, HIDEOUS recording. I can't make out anything at all.

The characters were fairly deep and well-developed, and the circumstances were at once amusing and understandable. And then I was halfway through the book and nothing had happened yet. Lo and behold, I finished the book, and still, nothing really happened. There is a rushed bit about robbing a restaurant and running from gangsters, but it all happens so fast that there is no time to really care. The writing is good, the characters are interesting, but this book should have been at least twice as long as it is. In its present form, it reads like a story from a talented writer who realized on Monday night that he had a dealine on Tuesday morning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rushed to print?","review":"I've read all of Bourdain's other books and had a special liking for his \\"culinary gangster\\" stories.

Sorry Tony."},{"rating":"1","title":"No, no, and no.","review":"I read someone's review of this book that was positive. I wish I remembered who so I could write them a nasty letter. It may actually deserve only one star. Paper thin characters, no substance, gratuitous violence, and, oh yeah, no real story. I hope the author cooks better than he writes. Save your money o serious readers; there must be something better out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not his best work, but still enjoyable","review":"The Bobby Gold Stories follows in the mafia-esque footsteps of Bourdain's previous efforts at fiction, and comes up somewhat short. There's not a whole lot of character development here, and what serves as a plot is rather choppy and incoherent throughout most of the book. It was almost like Tony couldn't decide if he wanted to write a novel or a bunch of short stories. Sadly, references to the food service industry were sorely lacking in this one. I think he should keep that, as it really sets him apart and makes his work that much more unique. Regardless, it was still fun to read, and I look forward to more of his work."},{"rating":"2","title":"K-Swiss Ultrscendor Mid sneakers","review":"This is the third pair of these sneakers that I have owned, I love them.

Maybe a few discordant tones on the short \\"Bring It\\" or the funk bass of \\"Pretty.\\" The quicker \\"Pen to the Pad\\" tries to raise pulse rates, and the darker \\"Boo The Hero\\" grooves with a touch of psychedelia and jungle, but, overall, sort of blah."},{"rating":"2","title":"The American aspect of this album...","review":"I remember when I first heard this album, I was slightly disappointed. It had to grow on me, big time because of the fact that I had got it for one reason: THE REMEMBER WE REMIX! As if you didn't know, that was the track that caught a lot of folks attention. Nowadays, being that I am a collector of CD singles, I bet someone is just holding on to that one single on CD (albeit a DJ or a fan of the crew or sold somewhere overseas.) Anyway, this CD did have some bangin' tracks assisted by Mauldin & Dupri (father + son /sorry about that Kanye...) Ali Shaheed (ATCQ) and Da Babees demselves!

Since it was broadcast in the early days of television I can overlook the tacky sets and cheesy costumes. It follows none of the original story, Porter songs have been inserted willy-nilly and Frank Sinatra looks totally lost and out of place. The idea of Sinatra & Merman as a couple actually turned my stomach. Lyrics have been changed (\\".....you're Crosby's salary\\". Crosby was not around in the 20s) and Sherri North seems to serve no purpose than to strutt her \\"stuff\\" and add to the scenery. Bert Lahr may just as well be in his Cowardly Lion costume from \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" because his shtick has nothing to do with anything. What a hideous mess............"},{"rating":"1","title":"Anything Goes","review":"I loved Frank Sinatra and like Ethel Merman but this Video was terrible. I thought it was going to be a movie and you stated in the Information that Bind Crosby was in this and he was not. This was a live TV show and it was terrible.

I have not read Treadwell's ownAmong Grizzlies: Living with Wild Bears in Alaska, but, in hindsight, I feel that both the Herzog film and Nick Jans' \\"Grizzly Maze\\" were much better and more objective treatments of the guy. Nick Jans' writing is far better than Lapinski's also, and one gets the impression that this book was banged together too quickly.

While the author has compassion for Treadwell and values him as a human being, he does not sugar coat his behavior and actions that ultimately contributed to his death. A great read for bear enthusiasts and those interested in Timothy Treadwell. He seemed like a sweet, likable, but misinformed and troubled individual. May he rest in peace, along with his girlfriend Amie.A very tragic story, perhaps others can learn from it."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor treatment of a compelling story","review":"This book is a surprisingly dull and poorly written treatment of a compelling story. The author strains to make psychological insights and reconstruct events, repeating the same few bits of information over and over in an attempt to bolster his assertions. In one off-putting chapter he imagines 2 alternate scenarios that would have enabled the subjects to live in a way that is inappropriate for an ostensibly fact-based book.The prose style is inconsistent, pedestrian at best and leaden at times. The text is marred by spelling and grammatical errors that should have been corrected in copy editing. The organization of the book is poor and reinforces the impression that this is not a very well written or well thought out book. The author does not succeed in illuminating this tragic story with his mix of fact and guesswork."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the audio equivalent of poking sticks into your eyes","review":"I wanted to like this album a lot.

I have it paired up with a Dewalt 12\\" miter saw. You have to build a custom base to mount this fence and your saw to (which needs to be shimmed to match perfectly with this). You would need to do that with any fence, though. One nice feature is the small gap between the table and the fence that allows small sawdust particles to drop out of the way.

After their early 2005 farewell tour, Luna will no longer exist. This album is amazing and nearly perfect in every way. The songs range from beat driven, energetic tracks like Speedbumps and Astronaut, to sweet and languid tunes like Cindy Tastes of Barbecue and Star Spangled Man.One of the highlights of this album are the two songs written by guitarist Sean Eden, who provides lead vocals for the first and last time on a Luna album. Broken Chair and Still at Home sound somewhat different than typical Luna, but are beautiful and feature the amazing guitar work that has become synonymous with the band.If you have never listened to Luna before, I highly recommend this album, as well as their third release Penthouse. These two albums are Luna at their finest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great Luna CD.","review":"I the past year I have become a huge Luna fan.

But that's Lou and you can't discount his committed input, because he's there and he is engaged, listen to his rhythm playing and his voice sounds fine.

So shut up and turn it up!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Essential only for hard-core fans.","review":"Get this CD if you already have all 4 of their albums, 1969 live, and the box set. If you are still hungry for VU (and you probably will be) THEN get this set. But beware: 1993 is over 20 years after they disbanded and the energy that pervades their earlier recordings is not present here. This isn't a completely meritless collection.

Venus in Furs is still powerful even if Lou can't quite keep the melody and misses some lyrics..keep listening it will grow on you.

This recording is certainly much better on the ears than anything availablepreviously. Why carp and nitpick about little things. AMG's2 star rating is preposterous! At last I can hear what everyone'splaying! And the tunes sung by John Cale are refreshing, especially \\"the Gift\\".

However, we didn't want to invest a small fortune because it's hard to know what will intersted a kid in 2 or 3 years. This was the perfect compromise. The slide has a little zip to it and our son gets to climb to his heart's content. But if after a year he gets tired of it, we won't feel bad for wasting a bunch of money. My husband also likes it because it's small enough to move off the grass in order to mow the lawn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Safe and Fun Climber","review":"Great product - inviting design... best for kids who like to climb on things. It has gripping holes on the platform, so kids can pull up as they climb securely without falling. It has the right height for the platform - not too far from ground. Platform has enough room to bring stuffed toys. Indoors fun all through winter. Now outside, still played on every day. At birthday party, kids and ages 18 months to 4 1/2 yrs. had fun for hours on it. Primary colors look nice in yard. Well worth money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Little Tikes Hide & Slide Climber","review":"For once a toy that works as advertised. Easy to assemble. Very durable.

We plan to bring it in this winter so that she'll have something to climb on when she can't go outside. The greatest thing was the price from Amazon. I did a web search and found the best price here (as much as $100.00 difference). Shipping was kind of expensive (around $40.00) but the lower price of the slide made up for it. I recommend this toy for toddlers because I believe it is very important for them to be active and not sitting in front of a TV."},{"rating":"2","title":"The perfect outdoor toy for a toddler!","review":"I got this for my 22 month old because she always wanted to stay at the playground at school and play on the slide. She LOVES it. Very sturdy, light and easy to move around. And, it doesn't take up too much room in the yard, which is great if you have a small yard! I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Open Back a Problem","review":"My 19 month old son loves this climber. However, the design of the back side makes it possible to have a pretty nasty 3-4 foot fall if a child were to lean or slide too far back while sitting on the top platform. With older children this may not be such a problem, but for them the short slide will be pretty tame. Also shipping added about 30% to the cost."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for little climbers!","review":"Santa left this piece of equipment for our 15 month old son who was beginning to climb on everything. It was the first thing he saw on Christmas morning and was overjoyed. He spent a half hour exploring and climbing on it right away. He loves to play peekaboo and hide things on the top shelf or underneath.We put it together in our (admittedly oversized) playroom, so he can have a gross motor playtoy indoors for inclement days. Though a young child should always be supervised on any climbing apparatus, I did just order a gym mat for the bottom of the slide, as the angle is steeper than forty-five degrees and provides a fast ride with a quick stop. It's also a nice way for practicing going up and down stairs."},{"rating":"1","title":"How Many Tips and Tricks?

It has interesting and different designs and the projects are pretty. However, I have had trouble trying to replicate these projects with my own hands. I have been working with wire for a couple of years, and I would classify myself in an intermdiate skill level. I felt like the projects that were listed as an intermediate difficulty were actually pretty hard, which has intimidated me and made me feel like I will never be able to do the advanced projects."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book for wire and bead jewelry makers","review":"Full of great illustrations and directions, Michler's book is a great design reference. I tackled one of the bracelets with some rather intricate wire work and was very pleased."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book if you have some experience","review":"When I read some of the bad reviews I wondered, \\"Are we talking about the same book?\\" This is one of my favorite jewelry books! It is not the first wire working book you should use. Learn basic techniques from \\"Bead on a Wire\\" which is a wonderful beginners book. I'm a wire wrapper with intermediate experience and it was perfect for me, I don't care for every detail to be pictured and explained. This book has a nice variety of projects and is very inspiring, I use it all the time. The ideas in this book jumpstart me to make other projects."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thank god for the library","review":"I really liked the cover project and I was going to buy the book but I am so glad I didn't. I checked it out at the library first and I am so glad I did. There are a couple of projects out of the 50 projects that are okay but the rest are very so-so. I'll do the cover bracelet but that's about it. The directions are definitely lacking. You can't see the project from all angles which makes the written directions even harder to follow. I like to see some pictures of the project in progress as not everyone can understand the directions as written. Oh and don't get me started on the WOTWS stupid abbreviation - there's plenty of space on the page - just write it FFS. Quite disappointing book so I'm glad I only paid the reservation fee at the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wouldn't want to wear most of the projects","review":"I was disappointed in this book. First, a lot of the projects are VERY basic, and similar projects are covered in other books, so if you've read one or two other wireworking books, this will be a repeat. Since the instructions are not very detailed, so a beginner might find other books more useful. There were very few projects I would want to wear, though, in all fairness, I found a few good ideas that might inspire me. There are also a few bead stitching projects, something I did not want to see in what I had hoped was a wireworking book. While some obviously liked this book, for the most part, I didn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a Lack of Instruction Book","review":"This author gives no detailed instructions on how to do the projects pictured. There is one photo of the finished project...not pictures of the actual process of making the projects. The instructions do tell you how long to cut a piece of wire and what tool to use, but then states \\"BEND THE WIRE ACCORDING TO THE DIAGRAM\\"! The \\"diagram\\" shows the separate pieces of the finished project but NOT how to make them...for example \\"make the first bend 1 inch down the wire\\" or \\"use the small end of the round nose pliers to make a small coil\\" (rather than using the large end to make a large coil). I tried making 3 projects, using a LOT of my time and wire and becoming very frustrated, before doing something I rarely do.....GIVING UP! I gave up on this book. I advise NOT BUYING this \\"Lack of Instruction Book\\" when there are so many good ones out there!"},{"rating":"1","title":"disapointed","review":"If i had looked at this book before buying it, I definatly wouldn't of bought it. The instructions were very brief and hard to understand. There was plenty of empty space for the author to put in step by step diagrams, buut there wasn't any. The projects weren't that nice either. In the whole book I only made about 2 of them. there are a lot better free wireworking projects on the wigjig website"},{"rating":"2","title":"inspiring for your own projects","review":"I purchased this book after looking through it at a crafts store and think it is just great. There are a lot of 'do-able' projects for the beginner to advanced level. The book contains basic fundamentals to get you started on the beginning to intermediate level, and clear photographs of all the projects. It does not spoon feed step by step instruction beyond that. Some reviewers have disagreed with this, they want the step by step. However, once you have mastered the basics of wire work much more instruction isn't really needed. Many pieces can be figured out by the photos alone. The value of this book lies in the inspiration it provides you, the wire artist, to look beyond someone elses work and become original with your own pieces."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I put this book on my Christmas wish list, and was very happy to find it under the tree. My excitement soon faded when I saw how lacking in basic instruction it is. The coverage of the basics is okay, and there are some nice looking projects, but, while some of the simpler elements are explained (though not well), the reader is left to figure out other major elements on their own. Drawings are poor and don't relate well to the actual piece -- as if graphic interest was more important than accurately detailing what the element should look like. I found the \\"WOTWS (Working Off The Wire Supply)\\" abbreviation used on many of the projects to be silly and slightly annoying. In every case, there was plenty of room to spell out those five words, and if I don't pick this book up for a month or two, I've got to go hunting again (page 12) for the meaning of the acronym. I would recommend Sharilyn Miller's \\"Bead on a Wire\\" over this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where are the directions?","review":"The designs in this book are interesting and varied and many are really beautiful, But the directions are pretty much non-existent. As an fairly experienced jewelry maker I could figure those I made, I would not recommend this for anyone who isn't very good at figuring out how to copy from a picture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Projects For EVERYONE!!","review":"I found this book to contain a lovely selection of projects. There's something for everyone's style, as well as their skill level in creating it. The instructions are good, but not spectacular, and that's why it got 4 stars from me instead of 5. But basically, this book has broad appeal with it's great jewelry and terrific photos."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing but the best from Eddie Daniels","review":"I am a relatively new fan of Eddie Daniels. Being a music student in college, this CD has brought an incredible amount of musical enjoyment as well as musical material for study. As a woodwind player myself, it has everything I could ask for; it has burners on both clarinet AND tenor sax, plus some gorgeous ballad playing on both horns. For a newcomer to his music, this is must get and possibly one of his best to get.I can only tell it's a live recording when I hear the audience applause. It's that good of quality. And the playing from the entire band is incredible the whole way through. This is me tipping you over the fence...go ahead and add it to your cart."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Solid Set of Tasty Jazz","review":"Eddie Daniels is a talented and versatile musician who has recorded both jazz and classical music. Homecoming is a jazz recording featuring Daniels on both tenor sax and clarinet backed by Joe Locke on vibes, Tom Ranier on piano, Dave Finck on bass, and Joe La Barbera on drums. With a 2-CD program that includes both standards and originals, ballads and up-tempo romps, Daniels and his bandmates provide as solid set of tasty jazz that should appeal to a broad spectrum of jazz fans.Especially enjoyable is the interplay between Daniels on clarinet and Locke on vibes on several of the cuts, such as \\"Under the Wire,\\" where they really get into trading off with each other. Another highlight is the band's take on John Lewis's classic \\"Django,\\" which provides more than 14 minutes of musical pleasure. With good sound and informative liner notes to boot, this is a first-class production all the way, well worth seeking out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Music mobile","review":"It is not at all what I expected.

Cache Girl follows the story of Ta'li, portrayed by Thirza Defoe, as she attempts to make an understanding dust. The story begins with her as a young runaway, and it follows her as she communicates with nature to make the understanding dust.

However, he should not be seen as an imitator but a brilliant and soulful interpretor in the Coltrane tradition -- no less than any great player in any traditional music form. Lloyd has a lot of heart and a wide range of musical ideas to draw upon, and that really comes through in this superb recording."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lift every listener","review":"Nothing more can be added that hasn't already been said about this transcendant work. This is more of a plug to see Charles live if you get a chance. I saw him last night for his birthday at L.A.'s Jazz Bakery and it lifted me way up there.

Am very happy I brought it and It totally exceeded my expectations. As the water measurement differs from the conventional rice cooker, it takes a few tries to get the right ratio of rice to water. Rice is our staple food. The rice from this cooker is nice,fluffy and fresh even if left for 2 days after cooking. Cooks oatmeal better than a crockpot. The timer is such a saver , especially when you have a busy schedule. Thought the price is high, it is worth ever penny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really great - perhaps more than you need, though?","review":"Reliable, easy to clean, and nicely sized for 2 - 4 people. We've done everything from rice to buckwheat to millet to the best oatmeal I've ever had in my life. The induction cooker really does make a difference and we get wonderfully evenly cooked rice. And the timer function is a lifesaver, especially in the morning.The only reason it gets 4 stars instead of 5 is because I wish there were cool-touch handles on the bowls, but the rice is easy to extract and this is a minor complaint. Also, one reason we got this instead of a cheaper Zoji was because of the GABA rice capability, but if you want to save the $$ there are directions on how to make GABA rice just by soaking the rice ahead of time.Do buy it with the Ultimate Rice Cooker Cookbook if you're planning to do anything more than rice - in addition to recipes, the book is great for giving water-to-grain ratios for just about any grain or legume."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything people say--fantastic","review":"We've had this for two weeks and used it 10 times already, for oatmeal (steel cut oats, NOT quick-cook version, use the porridge setting), sushi rice (to make onigiri rice balls), regular rice.

However, after 2 years it stopped working - just doesn't turn on anymore. We read that induction function is very capricious and many people had the same experience with this rice cooker.

While I was shopping these cards, I noticed that several of them provided only passive ports, so that connected USB2 devices would have to be self-powered; even worse, those cards would have required tapping into the remaining port to provide power. Get this card. It just works.That thunderstorm/surge also took out the Elgato 250 Plus that was connected to the fried USB2 port.

I burnt out on the genre back in the 70's, and haven't felt the need to return to it. The front page of the newspaper has all the international intrigue I can handle. But this wonderful book , with its indepth psychological insights and interwoven histories, had me wishing I could call in to work so I could keep reading. It was given to me by someone whose taste I admire, so under his recommendation I gave it a shot. If it's possible, each section should be read (as all short stories should) in one sitting. The continuity and suspense are masterfully handled. Of particular interest is the reader's guide that follows the text which sheds illumination on the most potent section in the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine \\"Literary Thriller\\"","review":"Hospital has done a fine job grasping hold of this reader and not letting him go. There were a few aspects I didn't like -- all those quotations from other authors -- Camus, Defoe, Borges, etc. -- at the start of sections (Why do academics and literary types like to do this? Do they hope to bask in reflected glory?)And there was some awkward \\"fine writing\\" that broke the illusion and deflected from the story and exploration of the characters. But the story is powerful and the story-telling quite strong. Once involved, it was hard to put this book down. If you crave good writing applied to a strong plot, you will definitely like this novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slumming among the Blockbusters","review":"This book has been billed as a literary thriller, but--and this is sad, as Ms. Hospital is a writer with considerable gifts--it works only fitfully as a thriller and never even a hint of a whiff of a little as a literary novel. It's turgid and stagy; the main characters are badly underdeveloped; and the climactic scene in the terrorist bunker is as staggeringly pretentious a bit of hooey as I've ever read. That said, the book has some lovely lines, some persuasive details, and enough narrative momentum that I did slog through to the end. Due Preparations reads like the work of someone a little too desperate to write a blockbuster . . . and at the same time Ms. Hospital asserts her literary ambitions and respectability by strewing the text with clumsy allusions to Defoe and Camus and and Boccaccio."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disagree with the editors","review":"I realize that this is an Amazon Editors pick for 2003, but I'm not sure exactly what they saw in this novel. I found it to be tedious, dry and uninspiring. The author's writing style is confusing and overtly manipulative, so I couldn't buy into the story that she was trying to sell me. By the end I was feeling completely cold toward all of the characters and didn't care whether they lived or died - I just wanted to the book to end. I kept reading though, fully expecting an amazing ending that would warrant the Editors Pick, but I was sadly mistaken. I could not believe how terrible the ending was. Turner Hospital tries to throw a surprise into her conclusion, but it falls completely flat (probably because I didn't give two shakes about the characters in the first place.) Anyways, don't buy this book. It's bad. Really, really bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Janette Hospital is my favorite author. Her best books are 'Borderline' and 'Charades'.

Beyond that any CD that includes the Ragtime and Les Miz parodies along with the star turns by a faux Elaine Stritch and a Patti Lupone is one that belongs in everyone's library.

In recent years, however, that theory has been challenged, and it now seems that it most likely was not Roy Brown. So who was it?The program reveals that von Richthofen was killed by a single bullet entering his right side and exiting on the left; such a trajectory could not have come from above, where pilot Roy Brown was when he briefly pursued the Baron. Instead, a conclusion is drawn that is similar to one in an episode of PBS's Nova (\\"Who Killed the Red Baron?\\"): namely, that it was not Roy Brown, but a member of an Australian infantry unit that fired the fatal shot. Interestingly, although both programs agree that the bullet did not come from Brown, they differ on which Australian on the ground that day was actually responsible. So who was it?

Sure, there are some stylistic similarities in places - maynard and loeffler (sp?) have similar voices and the music has that melodic but not pretty feel that alternates (just like the vocals) between hard and soft - but these guys definitely have their own sound. And it's a great one. This is very emotional and powerful stuff. The lyrics are creative and poetic, if a bit ambiguous, but that doesn't bother me that much. It just leaves room for interpretation, and they also avoid the preachiness that detracts from so many Christian acts these days (bear in mind as I say that that I am a Christian myself). I don't know what else to say about this cd except that it jams."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as the newer ones...","review":"I'm a big fan of Chevelle and after it getting this album I realize it definetly doesn't match up to their newer albums but its not bad either. It actually sounds like a totally different band. Most of the songs on this album you have to listen to several times to get used to them. But if your looking for a good Chevelle album \\"This Type of Thinking (Could Do Us In)\\" is their best in my opinion. Anyway, here are my ratings for the songs...1./2. Open/Point #1 4/53.

They had extremely simple chord progressions, the lead singer/guitarist was trying too hard to sound like the unmatchable Maynard James Keenan of Tool, and the band also tried too hard to look (and sometimes sound) like Green Day, with thier geek clothes and haircuts, it made me want to gag. And, a christian band should have no earthly business opening for a band that wrote a song about \\"Hypochristians\\". (eg, Christian Woman) What were these guys thinking? They were nearly booed off the stage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of the Best","review":"Point #1 is a hard rock cd, the best kind of music there is. Now adding onto this, it is the BEST hard rock cd. Pete's talented voice and his dynamic guitarist abilities make for a great lead singer/guitarist. then there is Joe and Sam who beat any other bassist/drummer duo out there. Best songs (they are ALL good) are Point #1, Prove to You, skeptic, long, and mia. Get this cd. Your hard rock experience depends on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Start","review":"Chevelle is a pretty good modern rock band and with this first release, Point #1 is a great start. This is just a sign of things to come for the band. Each track on the album is at least okay. There aren't really any bad songs. Some of my favorite tracks on the album are \\"Point #1\\", \\"Skeptic\\", \\"Blank Earth\\", and \\"Peer\\". Here are the track ratings...1. Open - 10/102. Point #1 - 10/103. Prove To You - 8.5/104.

Peer - 9.5/10Overall: 91% A-This thing probably deserves 4.5 stars but since you cant do that on amazon it's going to show up as 5. It's an overall solid release with plenty of good tracks. Basically no bad points throughout this cd. It's slightly different than modern Chevelle as it is less commercial but it is good. If you like bands like Tool or Breaking Benjamin you might like this. Hey, even if you enjoy modern Chevelle this is worth checking out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Arrg.. starts off good, gets annoying later!","review":"I liked this band when I first heard them!

First of all their music doesn't sound like Tool. You people need to open up your freakin ears! Most of Chevelle's songs are more up-beat than any of Tools songs. The vocalist does sound somewhat like Keenan but you can tell the difference. Their music is very uplifting. It has raw emotion that comes straight from the heart. Everyone keep your eyes peeled for a new record in the summer of '02. I have heard a few songs and they totally rip hard. Stop comparing this band to Tool, it's a waste of your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its Worth the money trust me","review":"The haunting vocals, the simple yet very effective guitar parts, the super low rumbling bass, and the solid drumming make this album great.

From what I've seen in the reviews people arn't rating them on their \\"christian\\" beliefs, but on their musical talet. I consider myself an Atheist, but it doesn't bother me to see a Christian band, as long as they don't try to convert people with their lyrics like some other bands(Creed, Jars of Clay, etc...). I am sure it's very tough to be a metal christian band, because it's not cool, or whatever.I do believe that for a three peice band, that they do an exellent job of keeping guitar chords from sounding repititious, and keeping the meanings for the lyrics, I say that because I've seen them in concert. thebest songs are \\"Skeptic\\", \\"peer\\", \\"blank earth\\", and the best \\"mia\\", but rally the whole cd is very good.

I can't recommend this album enough!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Listen to this, Listen to this!","review":"Offensive to some, but the fun thing about this cd as well as the other RevCo stuff is that it's presented as a tossed off jokey affair. While the discs do contain humor, in title and lyrics, sonically and atmospherically, there is much attention to detail, musically. The musicianship on this disc is superb, especially the grating, distorted guitar work. As an aside, the front cover art features the track listing and running times of the songs, much like a promotional release would. Nice touch. Until this gets the proper rerelease treatment (w/ bonus tracks) seek out the Crackin' Up cd single as well, as it features Gila Copter 2 as an additional track, with a completely different stream-of-consciousness lyric by Dr. Timothy Leary. Out there...way, way out there. Recommended!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hangover music at it's best","review":"This is an album to slip on the stereo on the morning after the night before. This is industrial easy listening music at it's best.From the initial mellow beats of Gila Copter through to the choir of children at the end singing \\"It's a RevCo world\\", this album slides seamlessly through a number of musical styles. It has Alien Jourgensen's usual array of samples gathered from who knows where. Don't expect the relentless pounding of Ministry though. This album is more subtle than that. Instead of making music which beats you over the head, RevCo crawls inside your ears, disturbing whatever thoughts you might have at the time.As much as I dislike to judge a band by a cover song, Rod Stewart's \\"Do Ya Think I'm Sexy?\\" is the standout track. A few lyrical liberties have been taken with the song, to make rockin' Rod's original intentions more clear.Smooooth!"},{"rating":"1","title":"please don't give up on them","review":"I hate to give anything a bad review, but for this CD I will. RevCo is one of my favorite bands, because I am a diehard Ministry fan. You must understand however, that this is not Ministry, and if that is what you are expecting, you would be well advised to look at something else. Actually, if you are looking for real RevCo, try another one of their CD's like \\"Beers, Steers, and Queers\\" or \\"Stainless Steel Providers\\". Besides a couple of tasty tunes and pretty hard laughs, this CD just left me flat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not too impressed","review":"Overall, an OK Broadway recording to add to your collection, but there are others that are more worth your money. Previous recordings of The Music Man are much better, and are more true to the way Meredith Willson created it. The modern up-beat percussion of \\"Rock Island\\" I found to be very annoying. Bierko sounds very good as Harold Hill, but he seems to basically be a re-creation of Robert Preston as Harold Hill. If you already have a recording of The Music Man, you probably own something that is better than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"If its barbershop you want, get the original","review":"This CD is incredible, and although the standbys are flawless (namely 76 Trombones and Rock Island), if you bought the CD to hear the new quartet as I did, you may be in for a disappointment. The Buffalo Bills (the quartet from both the original Broadway and motion picture version) are hard shoes to fill, and the new singers just don't have that full rolling sound. Their sound is much more tinny and staccatic. However, I was very excited to see the entire scene in which they are taught to sing (Ice Creeeem) was included. Overall, the CD is incredible, but if its barbershop you want, buy the original."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply ghastly...","review":"no friends this is not the wonderfull music man you may have heard on the previous cast albums or in the film. While there are some wonderfull things on this album that make it worth the purchase such as the dance music on several numbers, The Pick-A-Little reprise, and a few others. But when it coems down to it the album is inferior to the orginal. Im not referring to the gentelman who portrays Harold Hill or the lady who portrays Marian as they are both marvelous. But everything else lacks the smooth flow of the orginals. Forget the revival and get the original."},{"rating":"2","title":"perfection!!","review":"I bought this cast album only days before viewing the production in New York, and the music has not left my CD player, nor my head, since then. It is a brilliant revival in all respects, and I for one enjoyed it far more than the film. Craig Bierko is outstanding. If you think he's good on the disc, then see the performance as quickly as you can, and he'll surely take your breath away with his sparkling presence and the twinkle in his eye. This was my fourth time seeing Rebecca Luker on stage, and let me assure you she has never been better: these songs seem to have been written for her silvery voice. The supporting cast is flawless, and the fantastic show was very well preserved on this totally terrific new recording."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the Original!","review":"This recording of Meredith Wilson's classic is outstanding!

The onstage chemistry between Craig and Rebecca tranfers remarkably well to disc. A fun, lively, and exciting recording!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"76 Trombones\\" marching right into your hearts!","review":"This is the best! This CD gives the only complete score to this wonderful musical. Meredith Wilson's score will strike chords with everyone! Plus Rebecca Luker is in one of her finest performances. Her voice sounds full and strong, unlike the Showboat soundtrack. Unfortunately, Craig Bierko does not bring any new interpretation to the songs (at least from just the CD). He sounds just like Robert Preston and I feel it's important to bring something new to each producation of a musical. However, if you want a recording of the full score and a wonderful Marian with a marvelous ensemble (especially the Barbershop Quarter!) and a rather OK Prof. Harold Hill... This is the CD for you! The orchestrations are awesome! There are even some new twists to such a traditional score that add flare and panache! This CD is for everyone! This CD evokes the old fashioned Broadway melodies in a new manner which shines!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE defective product!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"this is the third battery of this kind i have bought in the last 6 months , the first one worked fine no problems the last 2 have not worked, from the unpackaging they have not accepted charge and the last one was big enough that it almost didn't fit my pda, let alone the pain it was trying to get it outi was willing to accept 1 battery failure right out of the packaging but 2 consecutives no sir."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really neat book, but way too short","review":"This book is really cool! It has basic information on pressing flowers and leaves and a whole lot of good ideas for using your flowers once you have them all pressed. One example: using flowers and leaves to make letters and spell out your name. The photos are excellent, and the book is full of color. It is written in a fun, conversational tone, although some of the instructions are slightly more complicated than they really need to be. My only complaint would be that the book doesn't seem to be quite long enough. I got to the end and wanted a little bit more. Besides that, this book is inspiring, fun, and entertaining, and a great introduction into the world of flower pressing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for everything","review":"I really like this combination slow cooker and skillet. I bought it in the clearance section of a major chain store because it had no product manual but was able to get one from manufacturer.We used this for breakfast items like bacon, eggs, hashbrowns. On days we were going to be gone I would put in a whole chicken and have the best waiting for us when we got home. On Sunday morning before church I would put in some meat and a few vegetables and potatoes and have lunch ready when we get home.I even make fried chicken in this you can open the vent to get the skin crispy and still control splatters . .BUT oh my, I got up this morning and either the thermostat or the fry skillet isnt working. I think I can get replacements parts (I think) but it might be cheaper to get a new skillet??? I do LOVE this . I paid $25.00 on clearance.I want another one so bad.

They have a dark morose sound and lyrics, a similar disjointed, syncopated style, a heavy stop and go drum and guitar beat with unusual melodies, somewhat de-emphasizing the vocals for the sake of the strong instrumentation. That's not to say that, as a singer, Graves doesn't have his moments. He has a pleasant mid to high pitched voice and a decent style that together, with echo chambers and dual tracks, happens to compliment the music.With each progressive release by both bands, it's gotten to where Deadsoul Tribe sounds more like Tool to me than Tool. Well at least somebody sounds like Tool.If you have never heard of these guys or know little of them, I suspect that is about to change! For fans of Tool, Nine Inch Nails, Filter and Type O negative."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for a Day at School","review":"I have these and realized that I saved money when I used them.

With this juice box, I buy a carton, large bottle or frozen concentrate of juice. I save money, and being a college student, saving money is good.This is also much safer in my car. With a bottle, you have to unscrew the cap, which isn't very safe if you're driving down the road. With this bottle, I just pop the top and the bottle is open.This bottle also keeps my car cleaner. I don't have to worry about the juice spilling being the drinking spout snaps closed. I also don't have juice bottles all over my car."},{"rating":"2","title":"My daughter loves her \\"EMO\\"","review":"This is a great toy and considering that I got it for free along with other purchases; it's just awesome.

The clear and concise text makes this book very readable. While you may not turn into a table tennis champion overnight, following the instructions by Mr. Hodges by disciplined practice, a newcomer to the sport can learn the game, but it can also be used as a reference for intermediate players to correct their stroke or to improve it.This book is useful not only because it explains the different strokes but it also contains sections on physical training and tactics against different style of play.Table Tennis: Steps to Success is a must-have in any table tennis player's library."},{"rating":"2","title":"good beginning tt book","review":"good beginners book covering basic forward hand, backhand, ect. but, does not cover some needed pointers. however, i haven't seen any book that covers all the aspects of each of the strokes adequately. therefore, highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's good but i still can't play well","review":"This book is very detailed and has many well points the help rise the level of your game.

None of the free maps I found came close to be as legible and understandable. The fact that it is a trifold lamninated map makes it very easy to keep in your jacket and use.A definite must have for Prague in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful Map - No Detail","review":"I am in the process of movie to Prague and bought this map as a resource for that move. I can't find any of the streets I am looking for on this map.

It is not worth $8."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great as far as it goes","review":"Really good map, with the information you need, esp. tram lines, without being cluttered. One half star off because it doesn't quite cover all the places in Prague you might reasonably go, such as the lower end of Vysehrad or Olsany cemetaries.

That said, I can say that I love this cd simply because of the talent that was put into this cd. Being a rock drummer, I appreciate good drums in Rock music when I hear them, but this is just amazing. I was blown away by some of the Jazzy drum chops layed out here by Dave Weckl. I still havent figured out how to do a lot of the simply amazing drumming on this album. Even more astonishing is how Weckl is able to keep perfect time, while adding so many fills, and remmembering all the different rythms in each song. If you are a drummer, you will be blown away by Weckl's ability to play poly-rythms the way he does, without even hearing the same rythm twice. Not very catchy, however, but this intriguing cd will leave you puzzled and amazed at some of the chops layed out in this cd. A truly good cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Plain old great music","review":"Mix some jazz,alot of funk,some rock, throw in a bit of latin and add a pretty ballad and you have great music,no labels,just great music.

Shortly after the first use, we were unable to watch the recordings on a tv screen. After being transfered to numerous people at Sakar customer service, we were told the problem was with the AV cable and they would \\"happily\\" send us a new one.It has now been 7 months, 7 phonecalls, and 7 more promises that they would send a new cable, and they still have not followed through. I have talked to several managers, but when I call back to speak to that particular manager they are somehow never \\"available\\". I think they have a phantom employee named Andrew and he is the scapegoat for any troubles. When you call to speak to him, he doesn't exist . . . yet he was the manager that made all of the promises.I would NEVER buy anything from this company ever again.

The characters in these books are flat, boring, and stereotypical. Morris seems to be suffering from senility, as he has a habit of changing his characters' eye color or hair color from book to book. This annoying problem is obviously partly a lack of good editing, but also leaves you with the feeling that Morris does not know his own characters- a serious flaw! The romances in these books are passionless and so predictable they made me laugh. The only redeeming quality these books possess is their interesting historical settings. Even the history, however, is made somewhat boring and colorless by Morris's comic book style. These books can be described in one word- predictable."},{"rating":"1","title":"ranks of mediocrity","review":"Sure, this book could inspire great designs, but so could a box of chocolates.

If you are looking for a book filled with page layouts and designs that market themselves only to the trade, then this one's for you. I agree with the review that suggests this book as a great addition to your library of graphic design books . . . however, I did not find it to be helpful in developing page layouts for real life clients.

Injecting some much needed volume, chaos, and general racket into the pop genre, Deerhoof breath life into a stale music scene by keeping it simple. Simple lyrics, powerful chords, and a Boredoms-aesthetic work wonders, and thus Apple O became Deerhoof's most cohesive release thus far. Perhaps a better place to start than the scattered, yet excellent Reveille, Apple O is the perfect record for the listener looking for the brash simplicity of early punk, the disregard for conventional sound of noise-rock, and a certain arty disregard for song structure.

If you are just looking for a different band, that doesn't sound like all the stuff they play on the radio, deerhoof is your band and Apple O is a good introduction to Deerhoof.

When mom tells dad it is his turn to \\"change the baby,\\" he does so, literally, changing the baby into a cat and telling his wife \\"its your turn to feed the cat.\\" She responds in kind, and things escalate in a picture book version of \\"War of the Roses.\\" The play on words is cute; the pictures are cute. In the New Yorker this would have worked beautifully, but the underlying message -- that the competitive spouses are willing to give up everything including their humanity and their home to avoid the responsibility involved in caring for their child and their pets -- makes for a disturbing picture book theme."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book for all ages","review":"My two year old really enjoyed this book although it's designed for older children.

A waste of time and money. 1/5"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much cartoon violence","review":"As a parent, I bought this for my 7 year old based on the E rating.

I had seen the ads on TV, and this was the only reason I bought my N64. After about an hour, though, I soon grew bored. I had found it extremely easy to beat the 1 player mode with \\"extra hard\\" on and only one life. Neither of my parents wanted to play, and I could defeat the computer instantly. When a boy at my school found out that I had SSB, however, he would follow me home and play with me every day. I guess some people enjoy this game but I didnt.

With Fighting games, you usually think that there is going to be blood and gore and stuff, but that's not the case here.This game can be played by all ages.It basically just has cartoon violence in it, nothing major.The characters have different attacks and can use all sorts of items. It has great replay value and can be played with up to 4 people.While it may take a while to master, this game is great and is reccomended to anyone. Also if you liked this, then you'll really like Super Smash Bros. Melee for GCN.

The only downside is the main game, kinda boring, and the bonus stages are really bogus stages. But despite one negative, this is a great game! The nice thing is that you don't have to have two people play in order to play multi-player, because of the automatic CPU player. The characters have a wide variety of attacks, ariel attacks, smashes, etc. The arenas are superb, each one with their own unique dangers or safeties, each one fun in their own way, adding to the lasting fun in the long run. Which segues me to the gameplay, it doesn't get boring after a long time, I've had it for several months and it's still one of my favorite games.

You can set up the difficulties and also set up how many lives you can use.Multiplayer mode is also fun. You have the ability to play in teams or not. Still you can set up the difficulties.

The music is good, but good is all that can be said about. I can understand why they broke up; they didn't seem to be going anywhere. Technically the songs are all played very well, but at the end, I'm left with an \\"Ok, what can I listen to next?\\" kind of feeling. I'm left with an unsatisfied feeling, especially when I kind of hear the same song twice. They had an album previously under the band name Seka, and then they got Sully for this album and a new name.

It has it's weak points in some of the lyrics, and voice of the lead singer but, overall, it's worth the listen.

All really good songs.The only song that I didn't really care for based on the compositions of the other songs by lyrics, and music, was \\"Licking the V....\\"; I felt that it was a bit too amatuerish for this album; but the music of the song is pretty good, just felt it didn't really belong on the album, as a whole, for this second album.Overall: 4/5-Nam"},{"rating":"1","title":"Eyeguard fogs up fast","review":"The eyeguard fogs even before I have completed the first set.

Then he startd sitting in it and he'd ride it \\"Fred Flintstone\\" style by moving his feet. Then he got tired of that and started climbing up on top of it. Now he likes to throw if over onto its side and climb up and over onto it. His favorite thing is when he sits in it and I push him up and down the hallway.

He can only go backwards right now so it's a little frustrating to him but I know that issue is only do to his age. I am a little disappointed the lights on top didn't actually light up but it's not a big deal. I don't see what kind of educational value he could get out of it (besides role playing) so I had to rate it a 3-star in education.

We do let her use it in our house on our hickory hard wood floors and haven't noticed that it scratches at all.It was a little hard to put together, Toys R Us does offer assembly for $10 but I thought I could do it, i did but after much frustration!Overall this is the absolute best and most loved toy we have bought for our daughter."},{"rating":"2","title":"A stunning book, beautiful knits, but be aware...","review":"If you are a Sue Bradley admirer, be aware Travellers' Yarns and Around the World in Eighty Sweaters are THE SAME BOOK.

The quality was all I expected. The operation is smooth and accurate. I purchased the \\"50\\" to Right\\" model because it was the only one available at the time. Don't know if I'll ever use that capacity, but it is nice to know it's available. I found the installation on a Craftsman 10\\" (1970's model)saw to be very straight forward. I had to drill one hole in the cast iron table, but it was easy to accomplish. Set-up and adjustment was simple. All the test cuts I've made have been accurate. I gave the fence 4 stars only because it lacks some of the features of one of it's more expensive competitors. I'm confident the fence will out perform my skill level."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Upgrade","review":"I purchased the Vega Fence to upgrade my Grizzly 1022SM Table saw. The Vega fence bolted to the table with no problems and with no need to drill extra holes.

I now can set my Fence where I want it and be sure its dead on.Simply put this was a great Investment."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a MUST for Craftsman owners","review":"I fought with the original fence to my Craftsman for 10 years. It's not worth it. Adding this fence made my saw such a joy to use, it was just like I got a new one. My fence is square to the blade over the entire span of the table (it never was with the original fence). The microadjust mechanism is extremely useful. No more tapping the fence. Movement on the rails is very smooth.Even better, installation was great. I did it in an hour and a half, taking my time, and I had my 3 year old in the garage with me.I can't wait to get time to build a router table for the extension!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's worth it if you put it on a good saw","review":"I bought it because I thought it would help the used Craftsman table saw I bought. It didn't. I shoulda knowed better. Then, like Lester, I bought a Grizzly 1022 which came with a barely adequate fence. Putting a good fence on a cheap saw is dumb. Putting it on a saw with a little mass and muscle that'll hold its adjustments makes a world of difference. The only reason it doesn't get five stars is because I'll have to completely remove the measuring tape and glue in a new one if I want the thing to zero out at the blade. Right now it's a half-inch off and that's a bit frustrating. But that's the worst thing about it. It's dead-on square and it STAYS that way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy Setup for Accurate Cuts","review":"Several years ago I purchased an older tablesaw at a yard sale that was as dependable as a newer one except for the accuracy of the fence. After several years of being frustrated I set out to research product availability to replace my undependenable fence. After several months of research I made a choice that has lowered my blood pressure considerably.The first problem I ran into was that the previous owner made numerous modifications. Your directions were easy to follow and addressed the problems I encountered in setting up the Vega Utility 50\\". I had to do some drilling and tapping, it was very easy to do, into the front rail . The fact that you can make adjustments after everything is in place makes the final setup that much easier.The real sense of accomplishment occurred when I ripped a piece of plywood at ten and one-sixteenth and it was actually that size when I measured it for my project."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ignorant of international steel protectionism","review":"This book was a big disappointment.

Avoid it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful.","review":"I didn't think it was possible for a book filled with such clichés and ridiculous plot lines to actually be published. The over-verbalization of every sentence is painful to read and distracting from the story itself. Example: \\"Lust jitterbugged in her gusset\\". Seriously, what? When I first picked it up, I thought it had actually potential. Admittedly it had a few laugh out loud lines but generally that was ruined by the unrealistic interaction between the characters and the storyline that even the writers from Passions would scoff at. The ending itself caused me to throw the book across the room in utter astonishment that someone had taken the time to edit, publish and market.

Unfortunately no refunds given","review":"If you are looking for something actually educational about Japan and it's secrets... keep looking.This volume is an extended rant by an obviously disatisfied outsider who managed to learn that Japan is a society where rule dictates action (SHOCK!) and not reason or free thought. Oddly enough, the author was astute enough to descern even some of the more obsure dictates of Japanese society, yet seems to have been completely dumbstruck by the concept that his time in Japan would be better served attempting to fit into the rules instead of acting like a dumbstruck tourist. This book comes off as little more then a baby \\"waaaa\\" rant that Japan isn't a western nation, foreigners are not equal to Japanese, and no.. you're opinion really isn't wanted. I suspect half or more of the authors semi-fictional difficulties with the Japanese could have been easily avoided had he merely followed the rules he clearly knew enough about to write in the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still usable but ugly","review":"I recieved these as a Christmas gift 3 years ago.

The outsides are discolored and pitted, the edges worn off, and the nonstick coating is....not nonstick. We are careful with our expensive cookware, but I wouldn't buy Kitchenaid again. It seems to me that they are making more and more tacky, cheap things, as in the plastic measuring cups I purchased, most of which handles have broken off, rendering them unusable.

I have a similar set that has worn out and I especially wanted to replace this pan with the same size because I use it almost every day. Amazon was the only place I found this size pan. WRONG! The item in the set I received from Amazon that is the closest in size is only *2 quart*. It's freaking tiny compared to what I ordered, what the description says on Amazon.Additionally, the lids are glass, not metal as shown on the photo.Something is very wrong here!

It still works fine, and I haven't had issues with the non-stick coating flaking off, but the red coating has gotten really discolored from normal use -- black in some places, faded in others. Also, I think the pots have warped a bit. The strainer inserts I have for the pots don't really sit flush in the pot anymore. It's disappointing, because I love my Kitchenaide stand mixer, and I really really loved this set's color.

Then when I took the shrink wrap off and twisted the top off, the little plastic piece with a hole in it (so you can squirt out the lotion) was removed. I couldn't think of another reason this would be besides they refilled it. Okay, first two things are frustrating, but as long as the product is good, so am I. Well it wasn't.

So far I have used this scope through the Michigan winter on days varying from clear sunny days in the 30s to lake effect snow showers down to about 10 degrees F, and the sight picture always remains clear. The scope hasn't fogged up from breathing on the lenses or from melting snow. The adjustable objective is smooth to adjust and doesn't move until you want it to. Also the target knobs are fairly smooth to turn and once you have your zero you can remove the turret caps and reset them to the 0 position keeping your zero. The target turrets let me zero my rifle at 100m and then click them up to 300m to take some shots and then click back down to my original zero. The scope also comes with a nice metal sunshade.

We lost in Vietnam and the rest of South East Asia did not become communist disproving the domino theory which was used to justify the war.

Readers that impute H&C;'s subjective views are in lockstep with present day efforts by the neo con's to annul the extraordinary social achievements of the 60's generation.This book's transparent viewpoint is another lop sided, subjective hack job by Horowitz who is still trying to prove to his parents that they were wrong and he is right (pun intended)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Explains how the Democratic Party got to be the way it is!","review":"The seeds planted in the Sixties are in full bloom today, and this extraordinary book illustrates just how our current messed-up values got to be accepted as \\"politically correct\\" thinking.

I thought the camera work was choppy and didn't add much to the actual story. In fact, I dare say it took away from it. I know the director wanted the viewer to feel as fragile and vulnerable as the two main characters by hand-holding the camera, but instead it left me feeling nauseous.Although I thought the story was there, I just felt that I had no true feeling for either main character and in the end I found myself thinking 'They're both butt-heads, who cares?'But, again, Michelle Williams AND Ryan Gosling!

Michelle Williams mopes around convincingly, but she's such a depressing sulk, who cares about her and her crummy life. Williams gets pregnant in high school, abandons her life plans to be a Dr. and marries a loser. Since when did this constitute a movie plot? You could watch any fat slob with unwanted children in a trailer park and it would be the same entertainment level. I particularly like how they aged Ryan Gosling like 25 years (his fake pattern baldness was a gem), but Michelle Williams looks identical to her teenage self. You see, they flash between the present and past to seem deep and artsy. Finally, Michelle W. realizes Ryan is a baby, and doesn't want to raise two children, and she leaves. Movie over. Many yawns for this one. Will someone tell Hollywood to bring back the radical concepts of plot and action."},{"rating":"1","title":"To Be Avoided","review":"Even though I am an longstanding afficionado of off-beat independent films, this one was really a major disappointment. In fact, the theater was largely empty despite the fact that this movie is an Acadamy Award nominee.The main issue is that the dialogue is muffled and mumbled in many scenes. and the action itself is frequently devoid of meaning or difficuly to decipher. Moreover, the length of the film is esxcessive given the ephemeral nature of the plot.I should add that the switching from \\"past\\" to \\"present\\" and vice versa is annoying. The only high point was the cuteness of the little daughter. Some critics also have praised this film's depictions of physical intimacy, but I frankly didn't notice anything out of the ordinary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad and depressing","review":"this is one of the most depressing and pointless movies I have seen in a long time.

HOWEVER, it's a disappointing story about a man desperately in love, a woman who doesn't return his love but uses him when her life hits a snag, and the relationship problems such a coupling encounters. The dialogue is lousy, and there are a few degrading sex scenes thrown in for good measure. I definitely will not view this movie again and do not recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible movie","review":"I can't believe people liked this movie.

Ryan's character really did love her, but she treated him like dirt and the movie tried to make it seem like it was his fault - but really, she was the jerk in the relationship. Why do I want to waste my time watching two people who are pathetic?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring/Rip Off","review":"This movie tries so hard to be revoluntionary road modern version but cant come close. The movie is boring. Scenes have little to no dialouge or boring unecessary ones. They are both so pathetic its hard to watch. I want to divorce the both of them by the films end. Thank goodness that I got to watch this movie for free when direct tv gave me a free weekend on showtime and I didnt have to go out of my way to rent or go to the movies to see this crap. Without the sex it could be a lifetime movie. And life time movies are better produce than this crap. I gave it a one star for decent acting. The acting made it tolerbale to finish till the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not into it...","review":"I thought I could see them improvising, it just didn't seem like enough material for them to work with. Top 10 of the year? What?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring film","review":"This film is only going to be interesting to serious film buffs who are tired of the usual Hollywood trickery of showing an interesting story that actually flows, making the appropriate use of flashbacks and a dialogue that isn't forced to capture a more realistic sense of boredom around anticlimactic events. I really tried to pay attention to this thing but I became so bored that I just sat and worked throughout most of it.That said, I didn't actually pay for this movie. A resentful ex friend who delusional believes that we were in a relationship at one time overnighted it to my home on my birthday. So, I guess it was a birthday gift and all that I am really out of is the time wasted sticking it in DVD player and deciding how to occupy myself until the credits rolled. Perhaps I will resell it on here? I see that plenty of others enjoyed it so why not?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip it.","review":"One of the worst movies I've ever seen.

It's worth mentioniong that during the time of sale or at least be creative and find one on the internet to print out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heartbreaking realism","review":"Overall, I was quite impressed with Blue Valentine. Both Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams gave powerful performances and the cinematography and score were great as well. But be forewarned this film deals with some very heavy issues. Perhaps it just hit a little too close to home for me personally but there were a number of scenes that I found difficult to watch. And by the end I was left feeling pretty depressed and defeated. Nevertheless, it was an excellent film and is certainly worthy of the praise it has received from critics. I recommend this title for those who appreciate realistic relationship oriented dramas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very moving, yet depressing","review":"This is definitely worth watching. The two leading actors make it well worth the time spent. Keep in mind this film is Rated R and is not suitable for young children.Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad, depressing, nothing happy to pass on","review":"It is well acted. It is sad. It is depressing. It is not for me. Others think it has positive things in it, but I did not see them. Maybe that is today's society for most, but it is not where I want to dwell or even think of. It was a mistake for me to view it. Sorry I can' recommend other than saying these young actors really did depress me....and since they are well paid Hollywood people they don't have much to complain about in their daily lives. Must be good acting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent drama from two of our best young actors","review":"This film is essential an acting vehicle for the two leads, Michelle Williams and Ryan Gostling as Cindy and Dean respectively. They are in one hell of a train wreck marriage. The movie takes the now familiar path of using flashbacks throughout the movie to give us a sense of how the characters got to where they are now. It's very effective and for once, easy to follow. Both actors give Oscar-worthy performances in this believable story of love and its destruction. The director uses a minimalist approach both in sets and acting ensemble. The movie is difficult to watch; we see they still love each other, but are certainly no longer \\"in\\" love. For another film with a similar theme check out \\"Two for the Road\\" (1967). As far as the notorious sex scene...paalease! If that's of interest, just turn on the TV, you'll see more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Durge","review":"This film is durgey and dank in combination. I'm not a fan of Ryan Gosling so I think that is why I didn't connect with his character. Michelle Williams is hit or miss. I liked her in Shutter Island and If These Walls Could Talk 2. Another thing I didn't like about this film is it was filmed docudrama style. There was something odd going on when the camera was rolling. It was filmed pretty harsh so it wasn't easy on the eyes. I understand they wanted this film to be charactery, with alot of character types roaming around. I saw right through this attempt. I also hated the character that played Michelle Williams other love interest. He was a typical white guy who looked like he should stick to gay porn. I DID NOT need to see her having sex and bent over. I can see how some people could relate to the story, but this film was depressing and dark in a bad way. All the dialogue and drama was in vain, I couldn't care less about either character, it's like break up or shut up."},{"rating":"1","title":"disk error","review":"Unfortunately, the disc can not be read, try blue ray on multiple devices, but does not read, apparently is a problem area, the presentation of the disc and the box is fine, the problem lies in the disk is not stop reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a film about love at all","review":"Acting is first class. Of course, the attractive & superficial looks of both actors are bound to draw you inBut it is a dark story, with characters one can only struggle to feel any sympathy forThe film shows the pain and obvious destruction resulting from certain types of behaviour. So the outcome becomes more predictable the longer the film runs, and I became more and more disinterested in the characters with every minute"},{"rating":"2","title":"Touching","review":"This emotionally touching love story has very realistic characters. I love the way it switches back in time to when the couple first fell in love and how, which makes it all the more heartbreaking when you see them struggle to stay in love as they navigate through all of life's trials. How does one fall out of love or keep a romance from becoming mundane? It touches on fears that many couples face and fight to overcome. You can't help but get deeply involved with the characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waiste of money + time","review":"This thing just doesen't work period.

The team that created the video must have been making a high school production; I trust they did not pass the course. It was shot from the wrong side and did not show any close shots which would have been helpful. The written directions were so vague that my husband and I could only get parts put together after we waited a day or so between attempts to put the duplicator together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vega 36\\"pro duplicator","review":"This machine is supurb.

I recommend the vega to anyone who wants to turn out quality turnings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mommy Dearest","review":"As a mother of adopted children, I would be interested to have this book reviewed through the eyes of an expert on Attachment Disorder. I cannot defend Joan Crawford; neither can I say her adopted daughter is a liar. But I can say from first hand experience that an adopted child often deals with attachment issues of varying degrees. Without healthy attachment from the adoptee, the adoptive Mom can become the target for all sorts of rage and fabricated stories intended to destroy her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deeply fabricated thru Christina's eyes","review":"Christina Crawford failed at becoming a success at anything. She couldn't act, couldn't stick with one job...and continued to accept money from her \\"horribly abusive\\" Mother.If Joan was indeed that cruel, I seriously doubt that Christina would spend many a evening with her in NY and be in touch nearly everyday. So what is left to do, that might bring in a couple bucks and exaggerate an unhappy child that Christina was?You got it, write a book and publish it AFTER JOAN CRAWFORD HAS DIED...SO IT CAN ALWAYS REMAIN ONE SIDED AND SYMPATHETIC FOR CHRISTINA.Both her husbands have admitted they believe her story was concocted,Christina admitted in print, she was never beaten with a wire hanger.The other children have denied Joan was a child abuser.This book is trashy, untrue, and reveals a very jealous, spoiled sad for herself,daughter of a legend.......this book doesn't deserve space on your bookshelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mommie Dearest","review":"You sent me a wrong one. I received a orginal book that was published in 1977, not 25th anniversary. I am not very happy with it. It spent 30 dollars for the wrong book! Shame on you, Amazon!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Golden Age of Hollywood Was Not So Golden","review":"The golden age of Hollywood was not so golden. Some of Crawford's friends disputed Christina's book. In particular, Myrna Loy, Joan's friend since 1925, became one of her staunchest defenders in the aftermath of the book. Other stars such as Helen Hayes, June Allyson, Bette Davis, and Betty Hutton have verified some of the stories in Christina's book. Hutton had previously lived near Joan Crawford's Brentwood, California, home and has stated that she saw the children during or after various moments of abuse. On the internet there are many pictures of Joan and Christina and they seem friendly. I believe like many abusive parents she mellowed with age. This book is a horrible indictment of the old Studio System. Louis B. Mayer and the blue suits in the Thalberg bldg at MGM knew the children's plight but hushed it up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Trashy, but entertaining","review":"A very quick read, and an interesting glimpse of mid-century Hollywood. Joan was a true monster and her daughter captures that well. I was so \\"inspired\\" by the book I immediately went out and rented one of Joan's movies, \\"Queen Bee,\\" which Christina says made her shriver it was so true to life. Recommended if you're looking for a diversion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crawford","review":"Took a courageous spirit to write a book such as this. I wish that Christina would address the rumor I read that she may have been one of the stolen babies Georgia Tann stole, that monster. Crawford clearly only wanted kids as an accessory, a way to make herself look good."},{"rating":"2","title":"A sad tale...","review":"I really enjoyed this well written account of the childhood of Christina Crawford. But I do wonder why it is so hard to believe that it is true? Is it so hard to comprehend that a famous actress is not the greatest person she pretends to be? Some people are blinded by the glitz they see on screen and refuse to see that the actress tried so hard to gain publicity she adopted two children, verbally and physically abusing them when the cameras were turned away. It is a sad, tear-jerking at times, story...one that is too impossible to be a lie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look before you leap","review":"I bought this from CPO and it's a nice unit. Problem is that the CPO and Amazon sites don't explain that this is Right Tilt only so I can't use it. The CPO site says the 963 is for contractor saws, and that may be, but it is not for Left Tilt contractor saws like my 36-979.Talked to Delta looking for the right part number, and it appears with all the merger activity their inventory systems are a mess, and they can't even identify which part number you need for a Left Tilt spreader. Actual production of the correct one shouldn't take very much. They would need to machine one part of the bracket a bit different, so I have to believe that at some point someone did that, but it doesn't seem to be available.If someone knows the answer, post it so we all know."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Design - Don't Buy It.","review":"I bought it...but wish that I didn't. The base metal is soft and bends very easily. I found it impossible to get it aligned with my thick kerf blade. I messed around with it way too long. It caused binding between my saw and fence since it was slightly leaning to the right. The bracket could not adjust it based on the pivot area. The anti-kickback pawls would catch in the standard Delta Unisaw insert slot, so use a zero clearance with this product. The bracket attachment slot needed to be filed for it to release with the pull-pin, there was about .005\\" of interference right from the factory. The attachment scheme is weak in design, it requires several washers to be mounted. Don't waste your money or time. Buy a bearing-buddy or similar and make sure that your fence is parallel to your blade - this is most important. Amazon does have the best price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice but over priced.","review":"An easy install it only took me about 15 minutes. I suppose that is because I have the contractor saw and can reach the bolts from underneath. It works great, wish I had one sooner and probably would have if they were not so pricy.Biesemeyer stuffed the wrong spreader in the box first go around but Amazon got the correct one to me pretty fast. Good job Amazon!I rated this four stars because of the price and the fact the first one was a foul up by Biesemeyer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless with Thin Kerf Blades","review":"I knew it was overpriced, but then that's to be expected with Delta (which now owns Biesmeyer) :( But the worst of it is that the spreader portion measures .120\\". Thus, thin kerf blades can not be used with this product. I called the manufacturer to see if a thin kerf spreader was available: it is not. With a major investment in thin kerf blades and no desire to go back to .125\\" kerf blades, I either machine down the spreader (more$$) or return it and do without. Hmmm......"},{"rating":"1","title":"Less is More","review":"Fine book for fans with an interesting look into Thomas's life before London, but not one I would recommend for someone new to the series. Too many characters and a complicated (and boring) plot about the exploitation of Africa by Europeans. I had a hard time sticking to it and I don't usually struggle to get through Perry's work. Really not one of her best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dyke \\"AKA\\" Arlester Christian","review":"There is something about Buffalo that produces Funk Genius, before Rick James came on the scene There were two Titans from Buffalo that most of you never heard of.

As always, the lyrics are ten grade levels above average rock fare, and almost every tune is a winner. The full steam rockers such as Shameproof Flirt (typical clever title), 2nd class citizen, growth spurt, and Off the Face are some of my favorites, the latter being a great choice for an album closer (as Cant f(x) is on Placeholders).I have to disagree with the older review about NPB being derivative. I humbly suggest it to be the other way around, since this ensemble started in the late 80s. If there is to be any criticism, it might be that Monte Carlo Method is not much of a departure from their earlier stuff. Thank God for that.

I don't think he put it down for the whole 6 hour drive to Disneyland.

Highly recommended if you have a dinosaur lover or artist in the family."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book on the subject yet!","review":"You may think me biased, since some of my reconstructions where used in the book, but I did not write any of it (and I don't recieve royalties based on sales). While there are a few nit-picky details I would change, this is easily the best book on how to draw dinosaurs ever made. It is the only one where the reader is given a short anatomy lesson, and shown skeletal reconstructions so artists can learn how to reconstruct extinct animals themselves. It also shows off the remarkable diversity of dinosaurs to good advantage. Highly recomended."},{"rating":"2","title":"superb drawing book","review":"This is probably the best book on drawing dinosaurs out there, especially for adults.

Many dinosaurs are featured in here, including Triceratops, Spinosaurs, Therizinosaurus, Chirostenotes, Saltasaurus, and dozens more. Generally depending on which dinosaur you are drawing, it can take you between 1-4 steps to complete your picture.

The cover displayed on this page states that there is Wunderlich singing, and for sure, if he is, his role was Don Ottavio, and not Masetto, as Rudy Avila states.

Why is reflection covered along with inheritance? Why do examples contain anonymous inner classes (which the author admits are bad)? Why do the examples consistently use concepts that are covered chapters later? The answer is because the book is poorly written and organized.Save your money and use the Internet to learn Java. It's free, and it's better.I get the feeling that those who favorably review this book are defending Java more than the book. This is not a debate over the technology.

It doesn't go into a whole lot of mumbo jumbo but goes right into the point. The explanations are very clear and an important learning tool it uses (which is a formula most authors should know by now) is it does give example codes that work correctly, for most of the book.Another good thing about this book is it does give you insights about certain topics.

If you have a dino-nut on your hands, look for something with more heft."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book","review":"this book is great for little dino lovers. My 3yr old daughter loves this book and uses it as a reference guide, whenever she sees a dino on tv or some where, she pulls it out to find the name of the dino she saw. The illustrations are great and it gives good little facts for kids to learn about the dino's. The only thing I don't like about this book is that the pronunciations of the dino names are in the back of the book instead of with the pictures of the dino's."},{"rating":"2","title":"So complete","review":"Ullendorf made here a complete review of research possibilities, without commiting the usual errors or misunderstanding about Ethiopia's faith and religious culture.

Needed to file a couple holes a little bigger for height adjustment. It glides smoothly, locks positively with little effort, is easy to remove and love the micro adjustment. When I up date my saw, I'm keeping the Vega fence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vega /U26","review":"The fence was everything advertised. It was installed on a Delta Contractor II. Installation was easy. My early uses leave me very pleased. Much better than the original fence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Luv It","review":"I contemplated alot about whether to get the pro line, and decided on this model. I really wonder what could possibly be better on the pro version? This fence has absolutely everything you could want in a fence. I don't care whether you are a weekend woodworker, or someone who does it for a living, this fence is the best I have ever seen. The micro adjustment is great for the perfectionist or for the person who needs to tweek the setting just a bit after cutting that first board. I was reluctant to buy a fence that did not have a rear lock, but this fence is SOLID, and did I mention that on my 1970 craftsman I didn't have to drill, tap, bend a single thing. I read some reviews that knocked it down a star for the instructions and I have to say, anyone who has put anything together out of a box should not have a problem. I would give it an 8 out of 10 for its instructional material."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful fence!","review":"This is really a great buy. It is one solid and accurate fence. It is really easy to remove fence from the table when needed. I have a really small space so I got this fence. It can cut 26\\" to the right as mentioned in the description. People with tight space may want to know the total length of the rail. It is 48\\".I installed it on a Delta Contractors saw and found it very easy to install (even though the the instructions are not very clear). It already has holes drilled in right places for Delta and some other saws. You may have to drill a few holes if you have a different saw. This is a top quality product. Hope they improve the instruction part. Don't hesitate to buy this fence system."},{"rating":"2","title":"*After* installation I was happy with its operation.","review":"My tablesaw is made by Sprunger which has been out of business for approximately forty years according to an old hand at Skaries in Baltimore. Modifications including grinding skirt areas to provide room for the fence mounting hardware were required. Once installed I must admit all the pain was made up for by the accuracy of this fence. It cuts just what the ruler displays.My complaints are the lift off bracket does not clear the rear fence mounting hardware so I've opted not to use it, and the mounting instructions are rough. The second is compensated for by the fantastic customer support, even weekend messages prompt return telephone calls on the weekend, provided by Randy at Vega."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Upgrade","review":"My 70's era Craftsman is smaller than most tablesaws but the Vega 26\\" Utility went on anyway. I simply drilled a front and rear hole through the right extension and the rest was easy. Oh, I had to move the rear fence \\"foot\\" inwards with a new hole but the self-tapping screw went in well. I can now slide my fence rather than bump it.Don't suffer stuff like bad fences, upgrade and be happy doing what you wanted to be doing in the first place."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent rip fence","review":"I installed this fence on a 1950 Craftsman table saw. It took about 30 minutes and I had only to drill one hole for the back rail. It aligned very easily and is dead on. I am very pleased with how easily it works. After so many years of the original fence it is a real treat to set this one and be sure it is accurate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Saw fence","review":"I bought this for 20+ year old Tiwanese table saw. The Vega fence is acurate and versital. Because of this fence I won't be buying a new table saw in the near future."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Bit Boring","review":"While Larry Long's heart is in the right place, and his songs show compassion and tolerance, I'm afraid that the CD is not very interesting. Unlike other folk singers who can meld the political and the lyrical or whose passion carries the music, this sort of drifts by and I have had no desire to re-play the CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Clown Album","review":"Cheap Trick were always more than a mindless rock/pop group.WOKE UP WITH A MONSTER is in itself a monster of an album.LET HER GO,DIDN'T KNOW I HAD IT,and TELL ME EVERTHING are all great songs.The band never sounded better.I call it the clown album because of the cover and the inside photos. Any band that releases an album with a cover like this one is alright in my book.The sound is good,Robin Zander is in great voice, Rick's guitar is clear, sharp and biting, as usual.Petersen's bass and Carlo's drums are wonderful,rich and strong.Listen to the drum intro to LET HER GO. Another great song is GIRLFRIENDS. Zander just screams the song! The band photos are hilarious. I think one vital element missing in today's new bands is a sense of humor.Cheap Trick provides that as well as great writing, singing, and playing. Get this album and enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Monster Wake Up Call.","review":"The opening track \\"My Gang\\" lets you know that Cheap Trick is fully awake and ready to rock. This 1994 release restored my faith in this exceptional band. There is plenty of that signature CT sound here with the classic tongue-in-cheek lyrics to boot.\\"Woke Up With A Monster\\" is a very entertaining return to form with a heavy emphasis on the word \\"entertaining\\". There is no need to worry about having to program out (skip) any of the songs on this disk. All are good and some are exceptional. My personal favorites are \\"Ride The Pony\\", \\"Girlfriends\\", the aforementioned \\"My Gang\\", and the title cut. The bluesy \\"Cry Baby\\" and the bass-driven \\"Love Me For A Minute\\" get plenty of special attention from me, also.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"hideous cover didn't help this good cd","review":"The first three songs on this one are just excellent. The rest are decent for sure but the hideous cd cover really hurt sales I would wager. Noone wants to be seen as a rock and roll clown, this is where you say? \\"whose idea was this bad cover?\\", it's not as bad as the 1970 free cd though in which you can't see the name free; instead you see 'highway' so it caused alot of confusion, you know this is trick and it's worth owning all the way. All of their music is pretty good I would say and this is enjoyable but not as great as what came before but it's still fun though. And cheap trick made fun music and that's a good thing although it's not clownrock by anystandard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loud, noisy and poorly produced","review":"I have changed my opinion a bit about this album, because it's actually not a nightmare. I totally agree \`tho with Mike Acquisto about the technical criticism, and I think the album have more than a touch of a frantic feeling. \\"Woke up with a monster\\" sounds loud and noisy for some reason but I guess that's the way producer Templeman wanted it. Underneath the surface, there are in fact some really good songs buried, but since they chose to go at full speed from the beginning there's no way to put in overdrive when it comes to the choruses, and I guess this doesn't benefit the songs at all. Among the better tunes are the opening rocker \\"My gang\\" and the melody driven \\"Didn't know I had it\\". Some might consider Cheap trick being the American answer to Slade, both regarding the musical direction as well as the humorous side, but if you gotta chose - go for Slade!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good milk.","review":"But four stars instead of five because there is no pour spout on the side of the box like there is on the boxes I buy in supermarket. We use this for baking, not drinking. With a spout, you pick up the box, slide the spout, tip out enough to fill a measuring cup, close the spout. This product has pouches. You have to open the pouch, pour into measure, reclose up the pouch which sounds good but it takes about 3 times longer. On the other hand, there is an advantage where you make a quart at a time. Each pouch makes 1 quart, which is extremely handy, no measuring."},{"rating":"2","title":"These were at local store for 1.99 a box!","review":"These were great and easy to measure and mix. My only issue is with the price here as I found these at a local store for about 2.00 for the 3-pack box. That was only a couple of months ago. So what gives with the prices here? Amazon definitely does not have the best prices on groceries even though you think you should be saving money buying cases...I found this has seldom been the \\"case\\" for me. I gave the product 5 stars but wish Amazon was more price competitive on their groceries as they are on other items."},{"rating":"1","title":"too expensive","review":"The price of 43 dollars makes this product over 4 dollars a gallon for this product.

Or wait until price drops back to 22 dollars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good tasting for instant non-fat milk powder","review":"Non-fat instant tastes okay, it will never taste like fresh milk, but the SACO brand is probably the best tasting of the bunch. Mix it up and chill it well for the best flavor.What I do use this milk for is cooking and baking. I either make up a small pitcher of the milk for cooking or use about 1/3 cup dry milk powder with 1 cup water for the recipe.You can also use this milk to make homemade buttermilk, if you have some buttermilk as a starter. Search the web for a recipe.If you want milk to drink, using milk powder, I'd recommend theNestle Nido Milk Powder, Imported, (400 gm), 14.1-Ounce Cans (Pack of 3)as it tastes is very good.Recommend for cooking and baking."},{"rating":"2","title":"best milk for condo dwellers.","review":"Remember going to the store and bringing home a gallon of milk and it was sour.

What a ride.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious, poignant, and absolutely perfect!","review":"I like to refer to Bill as the \\"John Lennon of comedy\\". It's easy to see his idealism turned upside down with repulsion toward the hypocrisy of the fanatical Christians, the insanity and lies of the government and some of the ridiculous rules of society. He truly gives us an important message presented perfectly in a comedy routine that fills up the belly with laughs! I love Bill and this cd has much of his best routines.I wonder what he'd have to say about the current [...] regime if he were alive today.Miss you Bill. RIP"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of his best","review":"My problem with some of Hicks' comedy routines is that he focuses so intently and viciously on preaching that the comedy is less prominent. \\"Salvation\\" is a great mix of strong comedy and strong preaching. One of the best Hicks albums you could buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stimulating","review":"The Wisdom of Solomon at Work was an easy, enjoyable read that stimulated the mind with ancient Biblical stories and applied those stories to rea-life management issues in business.One of the most interesting components of this book is that all of the authors come from different religious backgrounds (Protestant, Catholic and Jewish). All three united in telling some of the wonderful Old Testament stories of Ruth, Job, Moses, David and Solomon and gave examples of witnesses that used these teachings to improve a workplace.I thought the book was insightful for those Christians who search for methods to apply their faith in their workplace. Whether you are a Christian or an atheist, this book provides wonderful illustrations of how to become a better manager.Give it a try and enjoy learning about our God and principles in management."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON\\"T leave on burner!","review":"Loved this pan for the first couple of weeks........until I left it on the burner with no food in it for about 10min........it warped and now does not heat evenly!

Their experiments into industrial sounds did not really complement Lisa Gerrard's phenomenal voice, and it is just too diffrent from the rest of their body of work. I have all of DCD's albums, but, even if this one has some good pieces, it is the one I listen to the least."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my all-time favorites...","review":"Although this album may suprise some whose first experience of DCD is with their more recent albums like Aion or Spiritchaser, it's surely a classic of the 4AD label. This is my favorite of all the DCD albums. All the tracks are masterpieces, from the hair-raising \\"The Fatal Impact\\" (are those samples from the movie \\"Zulu Dawn\\"?), to the beautiful \\"Wild in the Woods\\". If you like the Cocteau Twins' \\"Garlands\\", Xmal Deutschland, and Colorbox, or later bands like Enigma and Verve, then you might appreciate this, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where it all started","review":"The best album DCD released. For those of us \\"old school\\" people out here. This is where the legend began. Pure 4ad sound that ranks up there with \\"And Also the Trees,\\" \\"The Swans,\\" and/or \\"The Cure\\" but the sound is more lush, more moody and more inviting. My personal fave of all the DCD releases. Worthy of any collection, especially those of us who were there when the whole \\"darkwave\\" phenomenon began."},{"rating":"2","title":"It might be old,","review":"and it might not sound much like later DCD, but it is still an excellent album. Many of the Lisa Gerrard chants sound similar to later work, so DCD: DCD is not completely foreign to most fans, but Brenden Perry, who really seems to have been the evolutionary element of DCD, sings mainly to old school Goth Rock. Every song here is excellent. The highlights, I would say, are 'A Passage in Time' and 'Frontier'.This album is a must just to hear where it all started, and after you listen to it for a while, I'm sure that you'll also find it one of your favorites."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly Weak","review":"Well, the only purpose I bought this was for my Ash costume [of The Evil Dead series] for Halloween.

Too implausible even for Evanovich.I guess I'm a bit bored of the sterotypical 'single people who cannot cook...' humor. Been there read that. Also the cutsey baby humor and the way the heroine oozes over the baby made me roll my eyes. If I'd known this was one of those baby books I'd never have picked it up.I gave up halfway through when the heroine and the doctor conspire to keep the baby for the holidays... I just found I could not maintain any interest.2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Silly","review":"The main character, Meagan, is very silly. and the Pediatrician, Pat, is not realistic.

The author states in the preface she cleaned up some \\"embarrassing mistakes\\" prior to the reprint but the only embarrassing mistake I could find was that this book was ever printed at all.

The Second Season showed that more time had been spent on the story lines and the character of Cheyenne was developed to show that Clint Walker had become a very good actor.

When using it to rip it tends to lift the board up and also away from the fence at the rear of the cut into the back of the blade giving you a bad cut in addition to a possible kick back.

The first time I took it out I had the camera in my pocket doing my normal stuff. When I pulled it out, the LCD screen was broken. The Samsung guys fixed it under warranty with no problems. I will give them one star for that.Since getting it back from repair, I have had this camera pretty much stored in my camera bag, using it once for a family get-together. I did not need to otherwise use it because I got a Kodak EasyShare C653 to use when I sent the Samsung off for repair. The Kodak I have literally put through hell using it in dusty, muddy, spiderweb-infested crawlspaces. It lasted about 9 months with this abuse but died. When I pulled the Samsung out to used it, it failed the first time I pushed the Power button.So, I encourage anyone reading this review to NOT purchase this camera. Although the price is cheap, the camera is junk, unless you want to pay that amount for a paperweight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap but mediocre","review":"Got this as a compliment point and shoot digital camera, replacing a number of Nikon CoolPix models that I have used in the past. The immediate impression was of the cheap fabrication feel: the bad fit and the poor plastic material used. Next in using the camera I am not finding any manual white balance and the camera will run out of battery in less than 30 pictures(!) and 'no', it does not come with a rechargeable battery -so go figure... As for picture quality it quite poor as well and I get the idea that they have stretched the capabilities of the imaging chip way too far when taking 6MP out of a component that is maybe good for half...I would not recommend this camera to anyone, not even to beginners: start with a camera like this and you're not going to grow the hobby..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay for the price","review":"For the price it may be an all right camera but the few sample shots I took didn't seem to have nearly the clarity of pictures taken with my Fuji digitals. I didn't have the camera long basically because the layout of the buttons and menus was very different than my Fuji mind could tolerate. I do love the black body though! As to the battery life, everyone is right. It will destroy a fresh set of alkaline batteries in a few shots - but that's typical for many digital cameras. By the way, I never found out how to get the icons off the LCD while taking pictures and the manual is almost worthless."},{"rating":"1","title":"In the trashcan now","review":"After using this camera for several months, I threw it out after it broke for the last time I wanted to deal with it. I thought this would be a decent camera due to the easy-to-use features and the pictures taken being adequate for the price. The computer interface was not as user-friendly as other digital cameras I've had or seen, but the battery consumption was a bigger problem. Taking about 15-20 pictures was average for me before having to reload another set of batteries. That can become expensive. Worse is finding the lens \\"freezes\\" when the batteries are low and one changes them. The lens on mine refused to open after the last battery change. After finding out this was a common problem, I got a more dependable camera."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this camera","review":"After a few months this camera does not work.With new recharged batteries just shows 'low battery'.Service is hard to get also.Look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Takes great pictures, but disappointing durability","review":"I've had this camera for a little over a year. The thing takes wonderful pictures-when you can use it. First of all, the battery life is terrible. Most alkaline batteries peter out after a couple dozen shots in this camera. About three months in, the camera started randomly switching between modes, and about 6 months in, the flash died. I'm disappointed in the quality of this thing, and hope my next camera performs better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible...","review":"For about a month, my Samsung worked O.K.

La vida de la bateria es muy corta pero compre un cargador SONY con 4 baterias AA de 2400mAh y la combinación es excelente, no soy adicto a la captura de imagenes y no es necesario llevar las de repuesto, aunque debido a la tremenda pantalla LCD de 2.5 pulgadas, es una tentación el ver las fotos desde la camara pues se pueden apreciar con gran calidad.Es super liviana y sumamente practica de usar, puedes usar una memoria SD de hasta 4 Gb y con una de 1Gb es mas que suficiente.

Also most indoor photos are too dark/dim even with flash. The color calibartion is poor too. Don't spend money on this product. It was bought for one of my teens and she would not accept it. It was replaced with a canon that was 100 times better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Samsung digital S630","review":"Quality of the picture is average for a point and shoot. User friendliness is average. With only the screen to frame your picture bright sunlight can be a problem.The biggest downside to this camera is battery life. Eight pictures and the camera shuts down. Upon checking the battery with a battery indicator power indicator they still register high to normal power. So..if you aren't taking more than a dozen pictures you might be able to accomplish that feat with just two batteries."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok, but what can I expect for $90?","review":"I suppose the camera is fine enough for a non-camera nerd, but for me, I felt the quality just wasn't there compared to other Samsung products I own. The bulge on the side of the lens is very big and the pictures on the internet don't really show that. Take my advice and if you are planning on buying this, go to an actual store and check it out in real life. I ended up sending it back without even trying it out because I was so unimpressed with the shape and size."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good","review":"I bought this camera when I realized I had left mine in my husbands truck & I was leaving on a girls trip. Didn't do any reasearch. Many pictures are blurry & this camera is SLOW in processing a shot. With the many comments about battery life I suspect that is the problem. But even fresh batteries don't seem to help. ONLY good feature was I literally pointed it in the dark & using the night time mode & the pictures came out really good. But something else. This one is getting passed on to my employees for their work vehicles in case they ever need a camera."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth it","review":"It has nice features, which was why I bought it. At first it even seemed to do okay on battery life, I liked it. Now it kills batteries without using it - it may have a short. Today it started shutting down while zooming in on a subject. It shuts down at a consistent point in the zoom, so I think it could be a bare wire, etc; something that causes the power to go to 0 as it abruptly shuts-off.It hasn't traveled much nor been used much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great price for a lot of features","review":"The camera is very good designed, with plenty features, and very good picture's quality.

The screen is a large (for the price) 2.5\\", the lens is glass and of decent quality, and the fit/finish is better than the Canon A-Series. There is also quite a few color/focus effects built right in, which can make snapshots fun.The only real downside I've found is that battery life is lacking, although Ni-MH batteries help quite a bit.Highly recommended for a backup camera or for novice photographers that could eventually use the manual controls on this camera."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unacceptably poor battery performance","review":"Using the two included Panasonic alkaline batteries the unit came from, I ran out of juice after taking a dozen pictures and transferring one (as test) to my computer. My old, battered, taped-together Nikon Coolpix 5200 (does everybody have trouble with broken battery doors on Coolpix units?) *never* gave me a low-battery warning. The rechargeable battery seems to run forever - I recharge it \\"preventatively\\" every 5-6 weeks!

Big mistake! Most companies making USB flash drives make two or more models that differ significantly in performance. This drive is Sony's slow model and you really don't want a large capacity flash drive this slow. It is hard to find performance specs for flash drives; you have to dig pretty hard and most slower models will not have performance specs published. Sony advertises write speeds of 18 MB/s for the Turbo model, one of the faster drives available. This drive tested at about 2 MB/s writing, a HUGE difference, almost a factor of 10 slower. I suggest you look elsewhere for a usb drive this large."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good flash drive, over priced","review":"This drive was reasonable for about 2 weeks, then it broke (not recognized anymore) I'm in IT so I deal with alot of flash devices, this one was a gift and at $50 this thing should have been bullet proof. Instead it feels like something I got out of a 25 cent toy machine at Wal-Mart. It scratches very easy and has slow write speeds. I've gotten two of these and both became unusable very quickly.

The difference is that I am excited about what I am doing, I see meaning in all of this, and my gut level passion to reach my goals has returned. I wake up in the morning excited about my day. I enjoy the personal stories, as I can identify with a lot of the personal creative struggles listed. This is my second Eric Maisel book. The first one just did not speak to me like this one.

Hallowe'en is only incidental in that the storyline takes place on that one night. There was very little suspense and lots of confusion.

Sorry, Mr Greer, I just didn't get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A roller coaster ride of an album!","review":"The album is a real hybrid of diverse sounds. It starts off with the hard rock of Don't Believe in Hell, before splitting away into more diverse forms. There are country tinged songs, songs echoing with Floydian atmosphere, and just about everything else you can imagine. But the two centerpieces of the album revolve around Southern Rock: Promise Keeper, a critique of the the Bible Belt mentality, and Harmon Polster, a tribute to a fallen hero. If you're looking for something a bit different, try it. Like Southern Comfort, it goes down smooth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Emporer's New Clothes","review":"A slow abstract meditation on death that is not at all entertaining.

The second downslided some, but was still good. This third CD of theirs is in my opinion better than the first one. They do a great job in combining all different styles of music to please all audiences, and the words in the tunes are powerfull. If you like any of Third Day's CD's, I would greatly recomend this one to you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sincerely Spiritual Southern Rock","review":"This project by Third Day features an excellent mix of meaningful lyrics and cool southern rock riffs. The message in the lyrics is unmistakably edifying and without any compromise of musical variation and depth. Mac Powell and company have truly laid down some tracks that will stand the test of \\"Time\\". From the soothing ballad \\"I'll Always Love You\\" to the uplifting sing-a-long \\"Sky Falls Down\\" to the rythmic U2ish ending with \\"Give\\", this album is a pleasure to listen to. I have to give this one my highest recommendation."},{"rating":"2","title":"my first DCD...","review":"It was the late 80s, I walked into a funky little record store in Cleveland, Ohio searching for 'something different'. I told the owner what I liked, and he said try this -- you'll love it. He handed me Spleen and Ideal. Wierd cover, I thought.

I love it. For me, the best songs are \\"Mesmerism\\" and \\"Avatar\\". However, \\"Avatar\\", sung in glossolalia, is alone worth the price of the CD. It is my favorite song, period, and I told my wife that it must be played at my funeral.

Since then I've bought and grown to love their other works and Spleen & Ideal is now my favourite. No other album stirs the emotions and conjures images from a previous time in the same way. Takes a bit of getting used to, but it's worth it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Toward the...","review":"...well, toward the Dead Can Dance sound, I suppose. This release was the beginning of DCD's move away from the 'typical' 4AD label sound of darkish, goth-pop-styled music and atmospherics to begin to craft a sound that took advantage of a multitude of musical influences. And you do see some of this, particularly Western classical directions, starting to make major impacts here and there on this album. But by and large, there's still a lot of that 4AD feel here as well. A mixed bag, albeit a very well-done one. But I'd suggest skipping this, going on to the next album (\\"Within the Realm of a Dying Sun\\"), then coming back here if that clicks with you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Your Typical DCD","review":"I have only been into Dead Can Dance for the last few months. I have purchased most of their cds. I can honestly tell you that this was the worst one I have heard. The vocals are too heavy and so is the music. Where is the lightness of Lisa Gerrard? A better choice would be Spirit Chaser. That one is mesmerizing. Plenty of airy vocals and pounding yet soothing instrumental work. An even better choice is Lisa Gerrard's Duality. It takes you to places you have never been before. If you want to really feel the music you are listening to, Duality is a must."},{"rating":"1","title":"Miss Balmain","review":"Don't let the pink bottle fool you, this fragrance is neither sweet nor girlie. After reading the notes on Fragrantica I felt like this was a \\"must have\\" but the opening is so strong/awful hairspray & leather that it obliterates the potential for me to detect any notes. Comes off very masculine, but not in a spicy/musky way. More like a bitter/green masculine with Lemon Pledge in there. I don't HATE Miss Balmain. It doesn't give me migraines or make me want to gag, but I certainly do not like it.

It's still in our living room and our almost 4 1/2 and 3 1/2 boys still love playing with it. Probably this Summer we'll finally put it outside! Anyway, I'm writting to let folks know that there ISN'T susposed to be any pre-drilled holes for the screws. The idea is for the insertion of the screws to bore their own \\"hole\\" into the plastic. This makes the installation more tight and secure. Yes, of course you're going to need an electric screwdriver! It really isn't that difficult to get the screws in with the electric screwdriver. Drilling holes first to enable \\"easier\\" screw insertion may very well leave you with a loose and wobbly house once together if you make the holes even a bit too large. Hope this is helpful for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"mom of 18 month old","review":"My daughter received this house for her first birthday in April. Since it was still too chilly to play outside everyday, we assembled it inside. She played with it so much that we left it inside in the play room. Six months later she still plays in it every day.

This is a great size house for indoors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful house!","review":"Our 17 month old son received this playhouse for Christmas and it has been a big hit!!! It is just the right size and our living room is not huge by any means but not small either and fits nicely in the corner. He loves closing and opening the door. It only took my husband, brother, and dad 20 minutes to put together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Investment","review":"We bought this playhouse for our son at Christmas, he was 16 months then and fell in love with it right away. He likes to ring the doorbell, open and close the door and shutters, put various toys through the mail slot and much more. He has a chair in the house and loves to take toys in it and play. We have had the house indoors since we bought it because it was too cold outside, however with summer coming we plan on moving it outdoors (purchased foam padding for safety). We're sure our son will fall in love with it again as it moves outdoors. Great size for indoors or outdoors, perfect size for toddlers."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Child's Own Home!!!","review":"When our twin girls enter this little playhouse, they feel they're right at home within their home. There's lot to do, and places to sit, and windows to look out of, and a door to go in and out of. All the simple stuff wrapped into one. And when they bring their toys with them, or their tea set, it truly becomes a magic world!!Highly recommended!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great House, too wide for doorways","review":"We bought this house for our son when he was one year old, and at age 4 1/2 he his still using it-- even sharing with his little (1 year old) brother. Both boys love it as a hiding place when we play hide and seek, and they both use it for imaginative play on their own intiative. Of course they also love diving out through the side window . . . but we have been very pleased with this purchase.One caveat: We initially installed the house in the kids' playroom (what most people call a living room) to keep it nicer for a while, and to set up a nice play area for rainy days. However we now have another item to put in that spot and want to move it outdoors, but it won't fit through our front door or sliding back doors-- the roof is just a shade too wide, and we've had difficulty reversing the screws to take the roof off. So indoors it still is. I'd say the width of the roof is the only design flaw; otherwise we are completely satisfied with the product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two words -- Electronic Screwdriver!!","review":"Thank God I had somebody to help me put this house together!! We had no problems following the instructions until it came time to screw the holes into the house. There were no predrilled holes in the plastic for the screws to bore into, so with our non-electric screwdriver, it was a very hard task attaching everything. Got a few blisters on this task. SO be kind to your hands and save yourself some time -- either use your own cordless screwdriver or borrow one from a kind neighbor.

I constantly refer to this book while doing research on The Rolling Stones chart positions in the Sixties. Of course it can be used for just general research, or for a particular artist. It tracks the Top 100 singles and how they charted week by week. The charts eventually expanded beyond the Top 100 during the decade. You see how each song climbs to its peak position and then declines off the charts. I felt like I was going back in time and watching the weekly charts myself during a decade which I was way too young to remember. A great book I highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"A memorable decade for music","review":"The 60's marked a turning point as far as music is concerned-In January 1964,four young men from Liverpool,England set out to make history-I'm referring to The Beatles of course-Joel Whitburn's book clearly shows the 60's was an electic decade for music-You had Motown,the British Invasion,Phil Spector's \\"wall of sound\\" hits,surf music (Jan & Dean,The Ventures,Beach Boys) to name just a few-Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Billboard Hot 100 Charts The Sixties 2010 Edition","review":"This new edition is a mixed blessing. If your looking for just the charts and not much more, this is it. Before ordering I was aware that the charts were 70% of their original size. What I didn't realize was that I would need a magnifying glass to read the artists names. Yes the printing is that small. I wear corrective lenses that give me 20/20 vision so that's not the problem. No problem reading the song titles. What does make this book interesting is that you can pick out your favorite tunes and follow their chart life from week to week. There is aproximately a 3/4\\" white border surrounding each chart. I wish this space could have been used to make the charts a little larger. For $79.99 you can't really go wrong considering the internet prices elseware.

Although I'm not as familiar to the music of 60s as much as to the music of the succeeding decades, I enjoy browsing through the chart pages and get the feel of the sixties.However, the back cover information somewhat misrepresents what's inside. It says \\"HOT 100 charts reproduced EXACTLY as they appeared in the original issues of Billboard.\\" The fact is: the charts are reproduced in xerox-quality black and white, not in colors as the original pages actually appeared.

The machinery moves quite effortlessly on this base. The leveling feet are located in a convenient location and are easily adjusted for uneven floors. The mechanism that engages the swivel wheels works quite well with the large handles on them. The only down side that I can see, compared to the Delta mobile base is that Delta uses a 3 wheel setup and it handles uneven floors somewhat better, and the 3 wheel design allows for only 1 lever to be engaged to move the machinery around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product for cramped workshops","review":"I bought my second HTC2000 for a home-built miter saw stand.

It takes a bit of time to assemble because of its many pieces, but has not required any tinkering since setting it up under the tools.

I used a short piece of Scotch tape to hold the washers in place while I lined up the wheel and inserted the axle. The bases are \\"heavy-duty\\" and adjustable to accomodate different size tool stands. The HTC2000s have made moving heavy tools (13 inch planer with stand, 10\\" radial arm saw, etc) a pleasure.

I bought three, and they arrived super fast in great shape. All parts accounted for(!), and easy to assemble. I'd recommend attaching the base to the tool with some bolts, though (not included).

When I say light duty I am comparing it to the Grizzly/Shop Fox 7314. It is a much stronger unit, heavier casters and boxed rails. I own 4 of them and can say they do their job. I ordered the HTC as a cost saving measure. It is $59 vs $69 for the Griz. The Grizzly is actually $20 more since no super saver shipping, but worth the extra. More heft for the buck.

The first one was a model 1000 and this one is the model 2000.

Like anything else once you have done it is a no brainer. Instructions were very good and these units work as advertised. Both the saw and the stove \\"FLOAT\\" across the concrete floor! I got them on sale for $49.99 each. I have a welder and have manufactured some of my own mobile bases, but these work much, much easier.

Big mistake.Unlike the dedicated bases, the fixed wheels have no brake on them. THe machine rests on two small rubber pads and the wheels when \\"stationary\\" and that does not work out well. The base is prone to movement as there is insufficient locking mechanisms- if this base had brakes it would be a nice option for odd pieces of machinery."},{"rating":"2","title":"Would Buy Again","review":"I put this on a Ridgid jointer. I did not put the adjustable feet on the jointer instead I put bolts through the legs directly into the mobile base existing holes. Very easy to assemble, and very stable when in the up or down position. My only concern is the plastic levers that raise and lower the unit. I contacted HTC about registering the base and they stated the product is guaranteed for life. I will buy this unit again for the next tool that needs a mobile base."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too small for a normal size table saw.","review":"Come on guys. I have a standard size Dewalt table saw (Model DW744) with a 10\\" blade. It is on a Dewalt stand (model DW7440 type 2) which has a foot print of 26 1/2\\" X 37\\" and your mobile base is too small to fit it. Also the instructions and diagram are pretty bad, not user friendly at all. The diagram needs to be bigger and clearer if nothing else. And would it have killed you to separate the parts in individual bags with the sizes marked on them to make it easier?Fortunately for me I had some extra frame parts from one of your earlier models many years ago when the locking levers where metal, not plastic like now and with the help of my bench grinder was able to modify them to expand the mobile base to actually fit the saw. You can do better than this!One final thing, advertisements for this item should have a couple of fields (blocks) on the screen where you enter the width and length of your stand and it comes back and tells you if it would fit or not."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK if you have a hacksaw","review":"The HTC2000 adjusts to a minimum of 23\\" but the short side of my new Grizzly G0555 bandsaw (which this is supposed to fit) is 18\\" (16\\" between the feet, which are set in from the edge). You can make it work if you take a hacksaw and cut off 5 inches, but that shouldn't be necessary.

You get some serious weight steel channels, nicely welded and painted. Some assembly required. But pretty straight forward. One drawback is that when disenaging the casters, depending on their rotational orientation, the frame lowers onto the caster roller itself and thereby suspends the frame from the floor, preventing the sticky feet from touching. So, you have to twist or kick the rollers to the right orientation to get the stationary feet onto the floor"},{"rating":"2","title":"Universal Base","review":"This was to purchased to allow me to move the miter saw table in my garage.

I enjoyed the fact that he used the vocabulary of the era - the words that would have been accessible to the Traveler...as in, explaining the nanobots rather than naming them as such, because the term didn't exist in 1891. This was indeed a magical story and one I would highly recommend. It certainly adjusted my thinking regarding what \\"immortal\\" really means. You know that silly bar room subject that comes up from time to time, about whether you would want to live forever? I used to say yes...because I want to see how our story ends up.

Wells would not have taken..The whole Dyson sphere thing threw me and I found myself reading in hopes that things would \\"get better.\\" The fact that the Time Traveler DID return to the very night he had planned (in \\"The Time Machine\\")seemed to derail Mr. Baxter's entire premise, that being, I assume, that it was impossible for the Time Traveler to return to his original point (time?) of departure.. In spite of my disappointment with the book, I read it twice..However, it did inspire me to finish my own attempt at a novel which is titled \\"Epilogue: Time Machine Chronicles\\"..Perhaps I was expecting a more H.G.

Baxter's way of describing it made me believe every word of it though I don't actually think that any person will ever be able to travel through time. I identified myself with the main character and enjoyed every moment of the adventure. For me Baxter is a genius who gave me a very interesting reading experience and much inspiration for my own literary purposes or studies about time (I'm working on one at the moment).

Well's THE TIME MACHINE. Wells time traveler ends the book by intending to return to save Weena. Baxter sends him off, but because of factors unknown e begins a series of loops through time that expand Wells' original into a work of immense satisfaction. Baxter's other efforts are well thought out extrapolations of current science. This is an extension of the science of an earlier era that manages to blend in today's space-time theory. Baxter's THE TIME SHIPS manages to propagate the style of Wells' work and, to me, expands upon the original, making it are more completed whole. Highly recommended for any Time Travel fan. The best of THE TIME MACHINE sequels (and I thought Jeter's was great). Hard to beat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worthy Successor to H.G. Wells' The Time Machine","review":"Baxter does an excellent job of blending current scientific and ecological theories with the look and feel of the original story of the Eloi and the Morlocks. Most importantly, he does this with the proper mood and writing style of the era of the original--a much more difficult feat than most people would think. He also does a good job of projecting the politics of Wells' characters. The only real drawback for me is that the main character is just insufficiently thoughtful and intelligent about a subject that he has devoted a good portion of his life to. While this provides an expedient way for his Morlock companion to explain many things to him, and thus the reader--a fine literary technique--the main character's rashness and simplicity is sometimes frustrating to an intelligent reader.

If you enjoy deep explanation then you will like this book ... if your looking purely for an action packed time travel drama, you may get bored. I enjoyed the read because I had no idea where the story was going.If you were scared as a child of the Morlocks this may challenge your preconceptions :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"By the end of the book I didn't care about the characters","review":"Interesting premise with a few fun points but the book becomes rather dull. The author spends way to much time on trying to explain the scientific principles behind the story. Plot and character development are sacrificed to technical muble-jumble. At the end of the book, I did not care about the people in the story.This story can turn someone off unless the reader loves to hear about science."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"I've read almost all of Baxter's books, and his career has been a mixed bag.

To be honest, I was bored, and when I got to the end I realised that I hadn't really been reading the last 100 pages or so.And how is it that a guy who invented time travel before Wilbur and Orville worked out how to get men even a couple a feet off the ground can be so thick?Perhaps Baxter is a genuius.

Highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flawed, but amazing","review":"I didn't understand why there were morlocks in the alternate world, & the war segment didn't fit somehow. The detached 19th century style was a little difficult to get back into when I took a break. Regardless this is one of the most rigorously scientific science fiction books I've ever read. Also I don't remember it having any sex or language. It made me want to re-read \\"A Brief History of Time\\" by Stephen Hawking. I thought the Time Traveller was pretty aware for a Victorian. I've always been opposed to posthumous sequels, but this novel works on its own merits. If you think all good fiction is about characters read something else. In fact when characters died it made me say \\"I wonder how that works\\" instead of \\"oh, how sad\\". Still if you like science in your science fiction read this."},{"rating":"2","title":"great cover","review":"These are great machine covers.

With thorough lists of correspondences (tools, deities, etc), suggestions for making the computer area an altar or extension of one, and spells to get us started, I'd gladly recommend this book. It was suggested that some of the spells were too simple to be effective. I've not found that to be the case. A good spell doesn't have to be elaborate to work well. That all depends on the caster. With the Twitter craze and so many conversations happening via text, the section of emoticons and webspeak are perfect for making cyber magick. As of this review the title is not in print.

This was also after I had thrown away the packing materials that the base came in.Amazon was very understanding, given the length of time after I bought the base and the fact that I threw away the packing materials. They were still going to take it back!!But,have welder, will travel.(I do) If you have a welder and the inclination, it is still a pretty good deal if you can catch it @ 20-25% off.As much HTC's fault as Amazon's, but Amazon's customer service saved the day (at least mine)."},{"rating":"2","title":"hrd-10x","review":"2/14/2007 Love this product mine has a third wheel lock.

You have to lock down both the main clamp and the micro adjust clamp just to keep the fence from drifting or deflecting, and even then it needs to be checked repeatedly. I have wasted a lot of stock because the clamps loosened and the fence drifted. And with the face of the fence painted black, it's nearly impossible to tell if stock is pulling away from the fence.

I can not recommend this item, especially when there is so many others out there to choose from.

I have many suggestions to the manufacturer, one that would make it much cheaper for some to buy, but they are not interested in any outside help.

Unfortunately, when you position the fence and engage either the main or micro adjustment locks, the fence and head rotate about and squareness is lost.

And, in either case, it throws the set dimension off at the blade by about 1/32 inch. Unfortunately, there are no adjustment mechanisms as there are on the Unifence and others to correct this.

Better charachter development and possibly a more structured plot could have done the trick, but still a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good novel","review":"This novel had already been around for a while before I read it, but I liked it, and it was cool to read a book that had been published before I was born. The book revolves around a teenage boy with a peeping problem. The first peep isn't entirely intentional, but then he finds out that he likes it and decides to keep peeping at his cute neighbor girl. What happens? Well, I really don't want to spoil it for you, so read it for yourself!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Delicate sentimentality","review":"Judy Blume's wonderful book should not be missed by any child about to enter the turbulent years of adolescence. When I first read this book as a fifth-grader, it mean little to me beyond the facially charming stories. As I travelled down the sometimes-painful corridors of pubescence, it became a constant companion that helped me through the ever-increasing trials. I, too, had an \\"older sister\\" that was the subject of my ocular ministrations. This book is real, in a way that I truly needed at that critical time. I hope everyone derives as much benefit from it as I have. Even now, I think back on those few crucial passages with visible delight. Many's the time . . ."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite judy Blume books.","review":"This is one of my favorite Judy Blume books (I've read all but about 2 of her books). This time it's written about a boy! I'd never really read a book about a boy going through puberty, so it was interesting to see Tony's point of view. I don't think it's too mature at all, I think it's appropriate for anyone about 12 and up. Boys and girls will like it. If you're ever looking for a good book to read, choose any Judy Blume title. Her best books are Just As Long As We're Together, Here's To You Rachel Robinson, Fudge-A-Mania, Superfudge, and Then Again, Maybe I Won't. Chose one of those titles, and I guarantee you'll love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tony moves to a new neighborhood and his life changes","review":"Tony, a thirteen year old boy, moves to a wealthy neighborhood and his life seems a mess.

I wasn't sure if I'd like it,but I tried it. Usually I don't read a lot of books with male protagonists;this is an exception. Tony had to deal with new wealth,moving away,coping with problems,and making decisions about his future. Like real boys,he and his friends tried to do macho things. \\"Then Again,Maybe I Won't\\" is like a guy's version of \\"Are You There,God? It's me,Margaret\\",but without religious elements. I could look into a guy's mind. Girls and boys aren't that different in some ways. We both have our insecurities. I'd reccomend this to novel to preteens."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow...this sucks.","review":"This book is essentially a glorified pamphlet. 64 pages total and more than half the book explains the rules and why Texas hold'em is popular.

His germanic tenor radiates and casts it's spell. I knew Klaus in the east village in the early 80's. I found him visually amazing, and had the fortune of being serenaded in his apt. He sang the great Dietrich song, \\"Falling in LOve\\", and his anthem \\"Total Eclipse\\".

A really worthless film that could have shone in better hands."},{"rating":"1","title":"A static bore","review":"The story did not have enough scene shift relief in its screen adaptation (it was a one set play). When there are essentially only two characters in a screenplay there should be some diversion of scenery from time to time which is why one is captivated by a film like \\"Sunset Boulevard\\" which is fundamentally a two person drama. However, Gloria Swanson and William Holden are afforded shifts of scenes away from the mansion where most of the action takes place so that the viewer does not feel \\"imprisoned\\". Also, neither of the two actors possess the allure of Swanson and Holden, nor does this insipid story pack the punch of that of screenwriter/director Billy Wilder."},{"rating":"1","title":"UGLY VIOLENCE TOWARD ANOTHER","review":"THIS MOVIE IS INTOLERABLY UGLY.

It's based on the terrific John Mantley speculative fiction novel; this is not it, nor is it a remake of any sort. Those looking for the original won't as yet find it on DVD, and should not mistake this film for that one in any way. This is a completely different genre, and far from a classic.

Don't Watch. Terrible Public Message","review":"As soon as I realized where this movie was going, I became terrified. I guess that's the thrilling part of the movie. I am astonished by the positive reviews. Maybe they are all young people. Maybe they haven't thought much about AIDS. Maybe they believe in false imprisonment and retribution in this setting. Maybe they cannot detect the heterosexism and AIDS-phobia. These are real issues. This movie trivializes them. Go ahead and vote that this wasn't a helpful review. Just because I disagree with you this does not mean my review isn't helpful. For mature individuals, if you want a complex discussion of AIDS, avoid this.No one INFECTS YOU with HIV. Your failure to protect yourself leaves you vulnerable to the virus. The entire premise for this movie is terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Preaching dressed up as entertainment","review":"Two strong and convincing leads don't make up for the cheesy stage-play feeling and meandering dialog from two characters who I never really cared much about. Neither seems too redeemable or likeable.This film is preachy without being very entertaining. There is a message here, and it's a good one, but it's delivered in a melodramatic (and unnecessarily violent) fashion that's overdone and lacking hope or redeemability.

One is HIV+ looking for someone from his past to blame, the other is a serial player who has no memory of their first encounter.The \\"twist\\" of this is really more of an unravelling of your last nerve should you be able to stand the entire thing.DO NOT waste your money or time on this enourmous flop."},{"rating":"2","title":"Postmodern Parable Displaying Traditional Certitudes","review":"A filmed play.

I got it for my sister, who's as much of a Tsubasa fan as I am, hoping she could wear it with a nice outfit as a pretty necklace. The fact that it's plastic doesn't really bother me (you can't tell by looking), but it's way too big to wear as a normal piece of jewelry. It's basically just for wearing to anime cons to meet other Tsubasa fans. I wouldn't recommend it for everyday wear or special occasions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book of spy props","review":"Primarily a photographic rendition of the author's prop collection from various spy movies and TV shows. It's a cool book but not as in-depth as I would like, despite the formidable assortment of items the author has gotten his hands on.

Recently watched Get Smart and saw the stereophonic gun featured in the book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"UNIQUE PRIVATE COLLECTION PUBLICIZED","review":"Danny Biederman is the actual author--the forward was by Robert W. Wallace. Biederman's collection of fictional spy artifacts is interesting to both movie buffs and to those involved in real-world espionage. I hadn't heard of most of the movies in \\"the Incredible World of Spy Fi,\\" so I'll be looking them up on DVD. The spy gadgets and props are almost as important as the actor--the gimmicks are characters, too! Who can forget John Steed's steel-lined bowler, Maxwell Smart's shoe phone, the U.N.C.L.E.

Anyway, Mr. Connick does his best to convince everyone he's the second coming of Frank Sinatra (it's tough to say who's the better actor, however), crooning his way through \\"Save the Last Dance for Me\\", \\"The Very Thought of You\\" and many other standards. So how's ol' Harry do? Not really that well, to be honest. His mood is too subdued, his voice too average-it's like he's trying too hard to give people what they want. And what do people want? I'll tell ya: they want bonus material like interviews with Harry and the band, a photo gallery (why must every DVD come with a photo gallery?), and behind-the-scenes footage."},{"rating":"1","title":"lost tone within 3 weeks","review":"i prefer the remo heads , i dunno why this head turned for the worst . i take care of my set"},{"rating":"2","title":"Never expect anything less","review":"Wow, Ani has yet to fail to impress me. I'm already sold -- I'll buy any album from her for as long as she makes music... she's that good.Anyway, this is wonderful. Her words are piercing, provocative... they make you suddenly stop and ask, \\"what the hell did she just say?\\". She pours her heart right into those songs, those words, that music... like she never fails to do.The songwriting style is like Rev/Reck. The horns play their strange harmonies while the drums are fantastically keeping me guessing. I have never heard her guitar playing any finer. Be ready. These songs will lunge at you, wrap themselves around you, and lure your willing consciousness right into their very existence.This is genuine."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring...","review":"I love Ani! I began listening to her back in college and the first album I bought was her first one (self-titled). I had since bought most things working from her oldnest to newest. Recent years have found me less angry and I'd moved away only to see Evolve the other day and thought 'hey how about a new Ani album'... this one sucks! I keep skipping all the tracks. It compares not all with her wonderful early years. Granted it has lost the annoying pop quality of UP UP UP UP... but it sucks compared to Dilate and Living in Clip etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"different...but good","review":"Although I much prefer Ani's older work's , this album is fun and funky.

Not that this gives me any authority, only insight. We know she's an amazing song writer, a profound poet, and a deeply intellectual being, but this album leaves me speechless. I find it to be her most mature and deeply moving innovation since Not A Pretty Girl, and maybe Castles. While she has been EVOLVING through all of her c.d.'s, for better or worse, it seems to me, that with this particular release, she is perhaps finally, THE most prolific artist of our time. If her evolution were to cease here, and all her c.d.'s managed to capture the beauty of this one, I would be quite content."},{"rating":"2","title":"i love ani","review":"ani is not finished nor is she tired played out or over with. this cd is amazing just like every other of her other CD's. i recommend this CD to anybdoy who enjoys good music"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull when Compared to Recent Projects","review":"For years I've been a huge fan of Ani Difranco, and as an old fan I've been rather impressed by her newer material; however \\"Evolve\\" is my least favorite \\"Ani\\" record.The lyrics contain statements of weariness, regret and self-loathing, and that unmistakable and optimistic, Difranco sense of humor is hard to find. Much of the music seems forced and lacking spontaneous inspiration. In \\"Slide\\" Ani even reuses an old ear-catching line first heard in a song titled, \\"Out of Habit.\\"Evolve isn't all that bad though. The title track is great as well as \\"In the way\\" and \\"Phase.\\" If you're a die-hard Difranco fan, you'll certainly want to take a listen. But in my opinion this record doesn't even come close to any of the musical standards Ani has set in the past."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ani Difranco \\"evolves\\" into a cliche","review":"I hate what Ani Difranco has become. Her earlier music was deep and complex, she sang about interesting topics and used really interesting music styles. It was always kind of preachy, but in a way that seemed unintrusive, because of the way she was able to make her opinions somehow beautiful and intriguing.I guess she's \\"evolved\\" though... into a smug, self satisfied, holier-than-thou liberal extremist. In some of the songs I felt like she was barely making an effort to pass off her preaching as music... in one long ranting song, she simply plucked at guitar strings while stealing lines from Utah Phillips and talking about how bad average americans are and how virtuous she is."},{"rating":"1","title":"There was a time","review":"when waiting for Ani's next CD was maddening torture. The day it arrived in the mail, I would blow off whatever I had to do for the next several hours and lie on the floor listening in drunken bliss.

I have all the respect in the world for Ani and can't imagine ever not buying her work, but musically (the lyrcis are as strong as ever) it just doesn't do it for me anymore and hasn't for several CDs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has ANI gone soft?","review":"Ani Difranco's new CD Evolve does a good job of how she has \\"evolved\\" in her music. It's a different sound unlike any of her other CD's. It encompasses more of a blues/jazz sound. The music is still high quality but the lyrics lack the passion and desire that has fueled her music for so many years. If you're looking for music to loose yourself in, then I would recommend listening to any of her previous CD's. Those are the ones that grab hold of your soul and won't let go.

I found it hysterical that someone pulled the \\"this is what happens when she marries a man\\" card, and I think the pulling the gender card on Ani by way of an old school fan is incredibly ironic.Again, it's too easy listening to me. She rocked out, she doesn't so much now. That's all fair and good. I've heard it by way of my roommate who loves it. I can't give it one star because that puts me in the class of people who scream \\"Ani you're a sellout how could you desert us!!!\\" which means very little to me.

Over. Tired.

Count me out for this release."},{"rating":"2","title":"I absolutely love Ani","review":"I think that this album is wonderful. Although, I do think that To The Teeth is still my favorite. She adds a little bit of jazz and a little bit of funk. My favorite songs are evolve, O My My, In the Way, Promised land and Here For Now. In the 2 songs Evolve and Serpentine she adds her liberal political ideas which I always agree with. Here For Now,has a jazzy and latinish feel. O My My is mixed with jazz, folk and she also puts in a part that sounds like 1930-1940ish jazz or folk. In the Way has a funky and jazz feel. Alot of her songs she tries to do something different which makes her very interesting to listen to."},{"rating":"2","title":"His best yet!","review":"Can an album get more than 5 stars? :) This is by far my favourite Luka Bloom album. It's an album that I FEEL as much as I hear. There is some gorgeous songwriting here.. 'Cold Comfort', 'True Blue', and 'Diamond Mountain' will take you in, hold you close, make you feel warm. 'I Did Time' and 'Sanctuary' are immensely beautiful; immensely sad. The first is about prison, the second about the death of Luka's mother.

All of his stories are told through his experiences with women he has been involved with.

So what a pleasant surprise for me to discover the music of Earl Klugh, a true genius of jazz, no matter how you classify him. The \\"Move\\" album contains these great 5-star tracks: \\"Across the Sand\\", \\"Far From Home\\" and \\"Big Turtle River\\". They are relaxed melodies which evoke wistful bittersweet memories.

First off the questions are based on the same movies and other Disney related topics over and over again. There isn't nearly enough variety making the game very repetative. Second, some of the cards are miss printed so that the answers don't match the questions. Third, the board was not designed correctly. Like Trivial Pursuit you have to acquire five colors which are red, yellow, purple, green and blue. Every space on the board has a Disney picture outlined in the color of the question to be asked. The problem is, there is no blue outlined spaces on the board. This means you can never be asked a \\"Blue\\" question, and you can never acquire the five colors to win the game. I was very dissapointed in this shotty product. You would expect quality from Disney. This game is anything but. I would definitely recommend not buying this game and going with the original version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"I had eagerly anticipated this book for a long time, but I found it very dissapointing.It's more of a quick retelling of the struggle for the throne after Henry VIII's death than a biography of Jane. She's a minor character in her own biography, emerging only for brief, tersely described events."},{"rating":"1","title":"Catherine Parr on the cover of a book about Jane Grey?","review":"A book with Catherine Parr on the cover using a few embellished facts, very little research and fanciful story telling make this a book only for the passive reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing reprint, no revisions, cover portrait?","review":"I was honestly hoping that the issue with the cover portrait would have been resolved with the reprint. There is no new information that I had so hoped for from a writer as well-known as Alison Plowden. I am disappointed and would not recommend that anyone seeking facts about Lady Jane read this book. In an \\"information age\\", I had really hoped for facts, the book is so reflective of 1986. There are plenty stories about the Tudor period of our history but little factual compositions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jane Grey fan","review":"I didn't read much of \\"Lady Jane Grey: Nine Days Queen\\", but that's due to the author. However, the book is skimpy and regulated to \\"this event happened\\" and \\"He/she did/said this and that\\". Alison Plowden is a good and factual writer, but this time she paints by the numbers. Also, in her excellent four-book biography of Elizabeth I, Plowden's attitude resembles Hester W. Chapman's; she tends to get a bit terse and condescending. I guess this is why I didn't finish \\"Lady Jane Grey: Nine Days Queen\\". I simply didn't want to encounter Plowden's attitude again while reading about my favorite Tudor princess."},{"rating":"1","title":"That's NOT Jane Grey","review":"Too bad the front cover has a portrait of Queen Katherine Parr, NOT Jane.

Indeed, her study of the Groundwork of the Metatphysics of Morals is just as insightful and complex as that of Roger Sullivan or Allen Wood.What makes Professor Korsgaard's work stand apart is that it can be not only read but actually understood by someone who is familiar with the primary texts. She uses plain, concise language to get her points across. She is to be praised for this.I recommend this book to anyone with a desire to dig deeper into Kant's moral philosophy. The work should be especially appealing to undergraduates, who are in dire need of more intelligent and intelligible books like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS WAS A WONDERFUL BOOK.","review":"I LOVED THIS BOOK.

The 3 year extended warrantee does not cover bulbs, which after I called for service the technician told me that is usually what fails--so the extended warrantee in my case has proved useless.

It's so lightweight yet also sturdy. He rocks & rocks and sometimes even tumbles to the side for fun (hence my love for the lightweight construction). He loves the buttons and sounds, and has learned about the \\"key\\" feature where if you keep rocking it \\"speeds up & the lights go on\\" and it \\"decelerates\\" when he slows down. Very cool! He plays in his superyard with this for long periods of time. Experiments with sitting frontwards & backwards or leaning over it, just has a blast. Worth every penny!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great eye appeal!","review":"As with most little tikes stuff, this is incredibly sturdy and durable. This rocker cycle's appearance is very enticing and it is equally fun. It is one of a few toys in our house that always holds the greatest desire of any boy or girl who visits. My sole complaint is that the realistic siren sound is very loud. It didn't scare or seem to bother my boys, but I tire of it at times. If your child turns the ignition key on and rocks away eventually the motor runs faster and louder and the siren starts alarming. I've had this toy for about a year and a half and just recently the batteries need to be changed-but I'm in no hurry to do it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"We LOVE this","review":"My son just got this for his 1st birthday because his daddy is a police officer.

After putting together a list of the \\"best toys\\" for his age, I began my quest to find the police rocker. Where we live, there are three Toys R Us stores. One store didn't have any in stock. They checked their system and sent us to a second store which had two in stock. I purchased one to find that the speaker was defective. I returned it to find that the other rocker had been purchased. I drove thirty miles to the third store that, according to the Toys R Us inventory system, was supposed to have three in stock. They didn't have ANY in stock. Ultimately, I ordered one from Amazon.com and paid for shipping (which is really irritating). I received the police rocker yesterday. The speaker is DEFECTIVE on this one, too! I'm terribly disappointed in Toys R Us and Little Tykes!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun, rocking toy","review":"My son has had this toy for over a year but has not used it much. I don't think anything is wrong with it, perhaps my son simply does not like it a whole lot.When he does use it, he has a lot of fun rocking and pushing the buttons for the sirens.It is a bit noisy and there is no volume control. That would be the biggest drawback to this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great size for 1-year old rocker...","review":"We LOVE this rocker, and so does my son. We bought this for his 1st Christmas, when he was almost 12 months old. He didn't take much interest in it then, but about a month later when he learnt to get on and off it, he took great delight in getting on and starting to rock with a huge smile on his face. It's the perfect size too - a friend bought him a fisher price rocking bike that converts to a trike, and at 14-months he still cannot get on that by himself. The only real problem with this bike is that the key does not always work - Adam can never get it to work and I can only do it if I pull it slightly towards me while turning. I'm sure that Little Tikes would replace it, if only I could find the time to call them.... Also, it's extremely loud, so be warned if that's of concern to you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Safe for Adventuresome Toddlers and Too Scary for Non-Adventuresome Toddlers","review":"My 22-month old loves this toy, but I do not. My daughter is a thrill-seeker and loves nothing more than rocking as high as possible and going as fast as she can. Knowing this about her, I ensure that she wears a helmet when riding this toy and always stay close to her. I may sound over-cautious, but was glad to have taken such precautions. She easily rocks this toy over-top and lands on her head, flipping forward. I have tried placing bumpers under the toy to limit the rocking ability, but she is pretty observant and quickly removes the bumpers. So, yes, it is a fun toy, but not safe. A few neighborhood kids (age 3-5) are afraid of the toy because of the loud noises."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tremendous singing","review":"Song of Sophia is hauntingly beautiful.

Later, they are called upon to investigate Houdini's death.As well as showing Holmes' deductive powers, the high falutin lifestyle and odd circumstances of the death of Houdini, the novel manages to cast light on the political situation of Hungary between the two world wars.As a bonus, Andrews throws in two encounters between Holmes and his creator, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.By combining diverse plot elements with a fine touch in characterisation and a surprise outcome, this book, like most of Val Andrews' Holmes pastiches, is a satisfying read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fodor's 00 Pocket New York City: The Best of the City","review":"This guide is filled with great information.

In fact, Christmas is just a good excuse to buy what is a superb collection of music from some great Irish and other musicians.

Before, he could be counted on to inject some musical drama, some bombast, some spice. That's what made songs like \\"Si Me Recuerdas,\\" \\"Acepto Mi Derrota,\\" and \\"Morenita\\" classics. Now all we get are musically indistinguishable ballads with intrusive, ever-present strings. My suggestion: Solis should try a Bernie Taupin/Elton John-type project where he does the lyrics and leaves the melody in the hands of someone with a totally different perspective, like Julieta Venegas. It would certainly produce something more interesting than the geriatric sounding easy-listening he's putting out now."},{"rating":"2","title":"House in the High Wood","review":"Where have all the people of the village on the lake vanished away to? One man remembers the horrific truth...Barlough creates an astonishing--one hesitates even to call it an imitation--believably nineteenth-century gothic style in this novel, which is more horrific in theme than its similarly styled prequel. His chosen style means that Barlough sacrifices something in characterization perforce, but he manages to do a fair amount. In this second book the plot is less unwieldy than in the first, and is timed and handled gracefully. Though the style will put off some readers, I found this an enjoyable book, strikingly original in its combination of period and fantastic detail."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absorbing book, frustrating universe","review":"Barlough's virtues have been well listed by the other reviewers. His characters are compelling and his style, often compared to a Dickens-Doyle-Lovecraft blend, is different and absobing. The world of these books, however, is a bit odd. Although sometimes described as psuedo-victorian, in fact it feels older, perhaps 18th or early 19th Century. Curiously, unless I missed it, there appears to be no gunpowder, and the cities do not have railroads or any other late 19th Century devices. And how does the \\"sundering,\\" be it comet strike or something else, explain those prehistoric animals? Perhaps the next book will explain, perhaps not. In any event, these are certainly worth a look."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOO EXPENSIVE","review":"Please send me $10 back. This is way over priced. Shame on them!!

He is fixated on Franco and torture in Spain; this gets somewhat boring.Other quirks that really made me want to put the book down even though I wanted to know the stories were his repeated parenthetical explanations of things like the fact that 'Giro d'Italia' is the Tour of Italy. If he thinks his readership don't already know this, he could explain it once and then leave it alone. Lavishes praise on Armstrong, bags out Pantani, and ignores Virenque.Some good stories, but I found the grammatical and stylistic problems greatly distracting."},{"rating":"1","title":"good doorstop","review":"While it's no fault to promote its own country's music industry, as a guide it is misguiding. After all, in the over 300 years from Bach to today, the only composer from Britain and its numerous former colonies who ever made to the periphery of major league is Elgar. The Britisher's authority on this matter then very likely relies on the domination of the English language and that Americans are even less likely salesmen of fine music. Its coverage on British composers is out of proportion as if one had to take film composers such as V-W, Arnold, Alwyn, Bliss etc. seriously. Its enthusiasm on British lables and performers is effusive and embarassing as if the British Isles were a Hollywood of classical music."},{"rating":"1","title":"practically useless but huge","review":"I have a huge classical CD collection and hoped this would help in my decision making for new purchases.

The narrator is no great hero and he knows it, but there is a quiet, understated, real-world heroism in his compassion and sense of duty toward others in his life. It's the sort of quality we often find in ourselves when things go wrong and our superficial concerns automatically give way to what counts. The characters in Verticle Intercourse are as vivid as friends and acquaintances passing on today's Castro Street, or in the neighborhood you know. Though entertaining, this novel is ambitious, and the real story is not the everyday drama but a community surviving after two decades of AIDS, and still putting trust in friendships and love. The ease of Reed's narrative fools you, the pace is quicker than you realize, and by the end you don't want to let go of these lives and their stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"The PRETENDERS capture true spirit of Rock n Roll","review":"If you don't have this Pretenders album and thought you had the best of their work, your collection is not complete without this one.

In my opinion, \\"Last of the Independents\\" is by far their best album. Chrissie Hynde still has the cocky attitude from the first album, but this one is more melodic. While many of the group's other albums contain a couple of weaker filler songs, all the songs on this album are great. The song sequence is just right, with a perfect balance between the faster, energetic songs and the slower ones. It never gets dull. Chrissie Hynde's voice is as good as ever, seeming both confident and fragile at the same time.

They (she) made a nice recovery with Last of the Independents. It is interesting how a group will release an album every year, but as they get older, the time between albums gets much longer. Packed was released in 1990 and this came out in 1994. The next Pretenders album (the poor Viva La Amor) wouldn't come out until 1999.This is an album of very good songs, but nothing sensational. There aren't really any bad songs on the album (unlike Get Close, Packed or Viva La Amor). My least favorite song on this album is the one hit, I'll Stand By You.The song writing is strong throughout, with many interesting ideas and phrasing, like Just Another Night in My Veins. The music is strong and rocks.I would get this, and the first three (Pretenders, II and Learning to Crawl) and skip the rest, unless you really need your Hynde fix."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read For Any Silver Anniversary Celebrants","review":"Susan Downs, Kristy Dykes, Sally Laity and Carrie Turansky serve up four poignant tales of Wedded Bliss? As four couples' silver anniversaries approach, they wonder: when had their love changed? Where did they grow apart? More importantly, can they find that love again?Facing situations that unfortunately happen in life, each couple manages by seeking God, to get back on the right footing. The well written stories are touching, occasionally humorous, but always thought provoking.I enjoyed this book thoroughly and look forward to reading more by these talented authors."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what I expected","review":"I did not like the second story in this book, and so I threw the book away after reading it.

There was no adultery, abuse, or abandonment. The story bothered me, because in real life, many who seperate end up divorced.

While the product was as advertised, we didn't realize that the wagons came in different sizes. This wagon will fit our 43\\" tall child riding solo. However there are other Little Tikes wagons that will fit him and two friends. Also the build quality was a little lower than expected since the axel holes within the wheels were not clear and we had to punch the centers out. This ultimately led to the wheels being too tight to easily turn on rough ground. We really should have drilled them out, however it would have been great if they had come from the factory that way.All in all, my son loves it and out expectations have been reset."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy this video!","review":"This was Frank's coming out of retirement special in 1973.

And there is even an admission that it is \\"preposterous\\" for an Egyptian video to imply that European Jews \\"deserved to suffer genocide\\" and that Arab suffering is the result \\"of Jewish existence.\\"Yes, there's quite a bit of material that a scholar could find useful.

In fact vol. 3 was the first DVD we purchased because Liberty is such a masterpiece. I expected some of the other films to be filler, but so be it. Hal Roach studio re-release is a fraud. The copies used are horrible at time, especially in Liberty. In a film where timing is crucial, missed frames kill several scenes. The worst part is the soundtracks or rather, soundtrack since there is only one for all six films, constantly repeated and almost always incongruous. The result is boredom for something which should be close to pure joy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Out of Sync","review":"To the point: for much better quality, buy the U.K. version.

In this LOST series version of \\"Libery\\", for some reason the title \\"I wasn't nipping!\\" was re-filmed 3 times for a grand total of 17 seconds, putting the sound way, way ahead of the picture for the rest of the movie.

It's about the relationship that develops between a sheltered, over-religionized teenager, Ben who goes to work for over-medicated, hyper-eccentric washed-up actress Evie.The whole plot is predictable. It's obvious from the start that Ben's home life is tottering from the weight of over-religion. You see that coming form the first few scenes and can predict almost how it will end up and it ends up like you imagine. Evie's neediness borders on paralysis and it's painful to watch. Julie Walters plays a good turn as Evie but with a lack of charismatic acting by fellow lead Rupert Grint, it falls on Julie Walters and she just couldn't carry the movie alone."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a pleasant surprise!","review":"My husband and I had never heard of this film but it met our criteria for renting from the video store - not more than a couple of copies available to be checked out and winner of some rather different sounding awards.

He lands a job as a helper for a retired actress, brilliantly played by Julie Walters. Although Ben's mom is giving him driving lessons (that's what she calls the time she spends in her affair with the town priest), it is the often cranky Evie who teaches him to drive, and so much more. She opens up the world to Ben -- swearing (not done in his household), camping, and in general helping him learn that there is more to life than merely acting in his mother's Sunday-school plays. I laughed and I cried. Watch this one--you will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice lesson","review":"This movie was brought to my attention by my sister. She wanted to rent it becasue she saw that Rupert and rented it. It was hilarious. Every second there was some sort of joke or some sort of hilarity that set you over. The great casting was very much apart of that. Laura does an eccelent Job and Rupert does as well.

The only complaint I have with it is finish. The angle supports under the rail have sharp edges I had to smooth out. also the micro adjustment was very very stiff when I got it. I had to take it apart and go over the gears with a wire brush to smooth it outn and lube it with some graphite.

That said, operationally it is outstanding."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vega Pro50 Table Saw Fence","review":"Seems like a well built and robust product. Installation manual could be a bit more instructive, but overall the install was fairly easy. This unit went on an older Craftsman contractor saw (didn't need to drill any holes)and the extra width ripping capacity (if you have room for it)would be the choice over the 30. The only drawback to the entire installation, you have to make your own table insert to fit outboard of the R/H table extension. And once that's done you'll find you need to add support legs for the unit as loading anything on the extension of any weight will tip the saw. I have used the saw extensively over the past months and find the fence to be an excellent addition, much better than the original fence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Upgrade","review":"Nice upgrade for my old saw.

I have a Saw Stop contractor's model. I got the 42\\" system and it seemed a bit large for the saw.

Robben and the other stellar players listed on this recording (Charlie Haden, Bill Frisell, Kenny Garrett, etc.) were obviously drafted as guns-for-hire on the date, but despite the plethora of talent here, the music itself is criminally boring.

The verse 3:54 clearly says Allah will cause Jesus's death before he can be raised. Death must happen before he can be raised in any manner. The book misses this point. It reiterates Hadith to claim that Jesus is alive - but Quran specifically said he is dead. If not, then Quran is full of contradiction. All scholars agree the meaning of \\"wafat\\" is death but in this verse they disagree! I recommend you read a web site www.geocities.com/Athens/Cyprus/8878 to know what may have happened to Jesus.

Pratchett's Discworld characters muddle their usual way through a story that offsets the points that Stewart and Cohen make in the 'Hard Science' chapters. Stewart and Cohen maintain Pratchett's familiar voice throughout, and there are frequent references to other Pratchett stories, a feature that serious Pratchett readers will enjoy while not detracting from the enjoyment of first time readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"I am an avid fan of the discworld series, even though I am not a huge fantasy fan. I had run out of books in the series, so I thought I would give this book a try. I was sorely disappointed. The book is divided into chapters about science, and chapters on the discworld story. I found the science section to be rambling and useless, completely unlike such offerings as Bill Bryson's A short history of nearly everything. I would have accepted this if the narrative was good, but it was lacking in the usual Pratchett irony. One problem may have been that it is a return to the Wizard characters of the early discworld books, who have faded in favor of Sam Vines and other characters. I feel that these characters are far more superficial- humor coming from their idiocy, rather than the irony of situation or the implied commentary on current events."},{"rating":"2","title":"Travel Trailer leveling jacks","review":"The jacks were just what i wanted and very easy to install.

They're very straightforward and Frankel has a great attitude about training dogs that is persistent throughout the book. The techniques that are said to pertain specifically to city life are excellent- even if you don't live in a super urban area- because they help you teach your dog how to deal with traffic, strangers, following you up or down stairs, and other scenarios that can happen everywhere.My only critique is that the housebreaking section is a little weak, and I would have liked to see more information about the dog's psychology. But, overall- we're learning a lot from Frankel and on our way to a very well behaved dog."},{"rating":"2","title":"What do we Know","review":"Mary Oliver uses words as I would like to play the flute, or paint.

It's pretty cheap and questionable as to how long it may hold up. I would have preferred a more robust attachment mechanism than what this product has.All in all though, the mat does its job and protects my leather without scuffs, indentations, or marks, so it's a PLUS purchase recommendation, and far better than any of the competitive products that claim the same function.Overall: Recommended"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have...","review":"We have three kids - all in car seats.

The inspector said this was the case even though many of these products say they are crash/safety tested, etc. We really wanted to use this mat to protect our seats (and we also liked the little storage pockets), but safety first is our motto--especially when it comes to our baby.

There is no serious guitar on this record, just eighties synths and, of course, drums. The only decent song is Holy Mother (instant classic about one of Clapton's friends who gave up on life and committed suicide), where Phil Collins had the common sense to back off and leave it to Clapton. That song is the reason for two stars, but it is not enough to save the entire album from the deadly grasp of a highly overrated producer - Phil Collins. He should be severely punished for what he has done to this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cold August","review":"August again finds Eric Clapton teaming up with Phil Collins and much like Behind The Sun, the results are disappointing. \\"It's In The Way That You Use\\" was featured in Martin Scorcese's The Color Of Money and is a solid song, but the album doesn't offer much else. It is mostly made up of glossy songs with alot of synthesizers.

When I was in high school I bought my first Eric Album--a 45 which was \\"For Your Love\\" and have purchased every record and CD of his since. Eric Clapton is God. One of the smoothest most tastefull guitarists ever.This album stinks. It is overproduced pop garbage. To me its like if Van Halen did a standards album. I just never thought of Eric doing pop, and well, he pulled it off, but leave pop to the Babyface's or other slick musicians of this world to do. Ugh.There are simply no tastey licks, no screaming guitar solos, no inspiration, and no emotion.

Eric was lost for directions at this time and it shows in this recording. He says it clearly in \\"Holy Mother\\" which is one of the very few high points on this album. I do like \\"Tearing us apart\\" but even that energetic song doesn't age well in time. Thank God he found his path again with the wonderful \\"Journeyman\\" cd later on but this one reflects a very uncreative stage of his marvelous career.

Clapton is great, but you'd never guess from listening to this trainwreck of an album.I can only stand three of the songs, \\"Holy Mother\\", \\"Behind The Mask\\" and the duet with Tina Turner. I'm not sure if these songs are actually good or if they only seem good because everything else may be the worst music ever committed to tape by a major artist.

Clapton is still God in my book..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Probably Clapton's Worst","review":"Most of this sounds like a Phil collins album but without the energy or the wit. Collins has put out some interesting material, and some bland material. This Clapton album is right up there with the worst of Collins. This was such a disappointment, coming right after \\"Behind the Sun\\" where Clapton had returned to form. There is nothing wrong with experimenting with new styles or pop music. It's just this style is ill suited for Clapton's talents and most of these songs are just bad pop. There are alot of significant guest stars on this album, but they really don't contribute anything.The album does start out with Tearin' Us Apart, which is an excellent duet with Tina Turner. But that just makes this an expensive single. For the B-side there is It's In the Way That You Use It, but I always found this song annoying with its bombastic intro and chorus."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album","review":"This is a terrific album that started Clapton's comeback from some mediocre stuff in the mid-eighties. I see it as a precursor to the style that was fully developed on Journeyman. August is not as good as Journeyman, but if you can afford both, definitely get this one as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Of Eric's Worst Albums","review":"There are some good songs on this album, but not enough to make it a good one. \\"It's In The Way That You Use It\\" is a pretty good song, but since it was added on later to cash in on the movie \\"The Color Of Money\\", it really doesn't fit in with the rest of the album. Other highlights of the album are the storming duet with Tina Turner \\"Tearin' Us Apart\\" and the beautiful ballad \\"Holy Mother\\", written for the late Richard Manuel (formerly of The Band), who had commited suicide not long before the album's recording. \\"Behind The Mask\\" isn't particulary bad, but it doesn't sound like anything Eric has recorded before or since. Otherwise, this album is crap. Save for the songs previously mentioned, it's just one boring, unmemorable song after another."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definately not his best","review":"Eric Clapton is one of the greatest musical artists of all time and has some great albums, but this isn't one of them.
