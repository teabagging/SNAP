It fits into the Toslink digital jacks, but not well or tight. Doesn't really lock in like a good Toslink either.

It's surreal musical plot focused on a town that lived in a TV studio, Denton, the Home of Happiness. The music is carefree and fun, it doesn't hold any of the darker images of TRHPS, and it is hokey, but most of all, it is infectious. Each tune is a bouncy, stuck-in-your-head masterpiece.

Come on! It's the gods who are usually overlooked in Greek mythology, if anything. Who runs the whole show in the Iliad? Athena, Hera and Aphrodite. Zeus is a helpless henpecked husband who does nothing, while Apollo has his hands completely tied because the goddesses always get their way. Athena dominates the Odyssey.Meanwhile, the monologues really don't work. They just feel weird, having the goddesses narrate their own actions, at times nice, at times evil. Godesses are meant to be looked up at, and talked about. They are also supposed to be somewhat irrational beings.

Not only are the performances without life, there is very poor recording balance between the two instruments with the piano vastly overshadowing the cello. Ma, although a fine technician,is especially lifeless and unexpressive in these performances as he has been in other recordings. I would rate the Starker/Sebok Mercury recordings as being my favorites for many decades. Originally I had the Starker/Sebok performances on LP and later acquired the CD version also on Mercury which is coupled with the Mendelssohn Cello Sonatas. Amazon.com states that this CD has been discontinued by Mercury but it may be available through another retailer. It's worth the hunt to find it.

We wasted 10+ hours on the phone with them, all the while they tried pushing the problem onto us before (finally!) getting permission to return the computer so they can fix the problem.Then, when the computer returned, we had to, of course, go through all the hassle, yet again, of loading and reloading software. Another 7 months went by and now, the computer's on the blink - again! This time, problem reading the CD/DVD drive!

After the third read, and slow ingestion, it continues to plow into my world view, asking me to define my spiritual underpinnings, and take responsibility for the authorship of my life. More painfully perhaps, but richly appreciated, it's helped identify my own brand of madness as it fits into Symington's structure of the narcissistic complex. He develops his theory with some compassion, while he uses examples that cut to the chase. I will be facinated to see how this overarching and bold theory hits the psychology profession. I am deeply grateful for his effort, and his willingness to confront his own narcissism in a profession of wounded healers. There is much to be learned here toward the world's healing. Dare I say, I won't be delivered in the rapture, and this life alone will be my legacy. Symington asks for my courage to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Original Contribution","review":"One can't claim theoretical coherence here, nor can one pretend that a very rigid moral perspective isn't being laid out here under the guise of psychological truth. But Symington is convincing and his metaphors, which at first seem ludicrous, gradually acquire genuine power. One wishes Symington would think through his ideas more thoroughly so as to expose them to critique, but at the same time one must recognize that a good deal of explanatory power would be lost in the process. A vexing and quite thrilling book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Complicated Mess.

What I found, however, was almost unreadable. Dr. Symington's writing is niether clear nor concise. His incomplete logic, mixed metaphors, and poorly thought out conclusions indicate little more than muddy thinking. Most of his foundational conclusions . . . and even idiosynchratic wording of certain ideas . . . have been clearly stolen from well established philosophical traditions and sewn together in a way that lacks logical integrity. I wish I could recommend this book, but I cannot. Complicated, abstruse, and even incohenet passages may masquerade as genius to some, but in truth reflect only unclear thinking. I'm not sure even Dr. Symington knows what he's trying to say."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sweatshirt!!!","review":"It you know Carhartt then you know your getting quality!

Considered by some piano music lovers the Richard Clayderman of classical music, Entremont has been unjustly -- and stupidly -- relegated to the dull realm of piano music anthologies and theme albums. I admit that his playing is sometimes a little theatrical -- after all, Entremont is a virtuoso! You'll be tempted to look at the score. Do it: You'll be surprised at how thoroughly respectful he is of the original music. Don't let his originality deceive you: this man is not Liberace. An absolute highlight of this album is Entremont's interpretation of the Clair de Lune from the Suite Bergamasque.

I've been looking for this on CD for ages, and finally, amazon.com has come to the rescue! This CD has something for lovers of different types of African-American music. That's something you can't say about many CDs today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only for the true at heart and the wise in mind!","review":"It has taken me over three years to find this CD and it was worth every day. I searched and longed for the inner ear satisfaction that I received when I open the jewel case. The movie was monumental as far as cinema to capture the the love and turmoil studying at an HBCU (Historical black college and University- Fisk University representing). From EU-Da butt to the sleeper of the CD which is the late Phyllis Hyman's-Be one. If you have this CD, share it with friends, but guard it with your life."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Soundtrack of the Eighties","review":"This soundtrack is one of the best art forms assembled for a soundtrack. I have been looking for this CD for years after it was stolen and it is a dream come true to finally find it. \\"School Daze\\" holds a special place with me because it was out just as I was entering Grambling St. in 1988. From the fellas chillin' in the dorms, the football games, the beautiful sisters and seeing my brothers of Alpha Phi Alpha, the music and the movie typified Black College Life in a way that only Spike Lee could interpret. My favorite songs from this masterpiece are Perfect Match, I'm Building Me a Home and Be One by the late great Phyllis Hyman. If you are a true music lover and if you would like to think fondly of your collegiate years, you must get this soundtrack. In addition, pick up Mo' Betta Blues. It's just as tight. You will not be disappointed in these collectors items."},{"rating":"2","title":"I have been searching so long!!","review":"I have been searching so long for this soundtrack. I loved this movie every since I was in elementary school. My cousins and I used to pretend to be the Rays. But the main reason I was searching for this soundtrack is the song by Keith John, I never knewn his name until now, but that song just speaks volumes to my heart and spirit. I wish he would remake it or maybe you all will hear me remake. Look for me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is an awesome soundtrack","review":"I just finished watching School Daze on DVD this weekend, and I've been humming one of my favorite songs since. \\"We've only said goodbye.\\" I enjoy all the songs on the soundtrack, but this song is my absolute favorite. I have this soundtrack on Vinyl, but not having a turn table I'm not able to listen to it. Well knowing I can finally buy this soundtrack on CD will change all of that. This was when soundtracks were well put together, and the songs were from the movie. I used to play my vinyl copy all the time.My favorite songs on the soundtrack are the following:2. Perfect Match - this is such a sexy song3. Be alone tonight - Tish sings the heck out of this song!!!4. Straight and Nappy9. Be One - by the late Phyllis Hyman11. We've Already Said Goodbye(Before we said hello)This is a must have for your CD collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better late than never","review":"Even though this soundtrack is almost 15 years old, the music still hasn't lost it's touch. There's a bit of R&B ( I don't wanna be alone), Big band (Straight and Nappy), Jazz (Be One) and spiritual hymns. This soundtrack sounds good to this day!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I FINALLY FOUND IT!!!!","review":"Hey ya'll! I'm a white sistah who purchased the tape when it first came out, lost it, and been searching for it ever since. \\"Perfect Match\\" is mesmorizing - takes me back to when I started dating my husband. Isn't it strange how listening to a song can literally take you back to the time and place you first listened to it? I also love \\"Don't want to be alone tonight\\". I used that song in a lip-sync contest back in '89 and flat-out won! hahaha... thank God for Amazon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Spike Lee Flick","review":"This is one of my favorite Spike Lee flicks! Though the end of the movie is a bit over the top, the message is quite clear."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love the song Perfect Match","review":"I'm very happy with the CD. I bought it only for track number 2 entitled \\"Perfect Match\\". The song is beautiful and I loved the snipet I heard of it in the movie. The CD came quickly and in the condition it was advertised. I'm very pleased and satisfied with my purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so useful....","review":"This is really a source book lacking in new and useful information. It concentrates on who would bond familiar of type X (animals, outer planar creatures, undead, snakes, vermin, etc) and expanded lists of those creatures. I personally think it have been much more useful as a source book for the familiar it self; IE creature \\"motivation\\" for accepting the bond, feats for them, and maybe even \\"personality\\" traits. After all, if you use the basic familiars and those available from Improved Familiar feat as a guide you can easily replace most of this book with a 10 minute conversation with your DM. Sure this list of extra creatures is nice, hence the 2nd star, but a great deal of this type of information could be reasoned out on your own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just the facts","review":"Written concisely, this is the interesting story of John C.

You won't get a lot of bass, but these are 5-1/4's!I would and have recommended these to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Done","review":"This is a first person account of the story of Joseph. It feels as though Joseph himself is telling the story to my kids. The illustrations are great. One of few books that makes Hebrews look like Hebrews instead of Americans. This book and Esther are the only 2 in the series that I can find. I would buy more for the reason of being ethnically correct if I could find them. As for the previous writers mention of Potiphar's wife asking Joseph to go to bed with him, I just skipped that line when the girls were 3 and 4. Now that they are 6, I include it and they don't even ask questions about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little shocking","review":"I purchased this book to be part of a character education program at a Chiristian pre-school. Imagine my surprise when half way through the book the Queen asks Joseph to go to her bed! I know this event was in the biblical original, but for kids it could have been toned down. It will not be included in our progrom - some parents may not choose to face the questions yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!","review":"This heavy rock band with thought provoking lyrics and a driving dynamic sound remind me of Black Sabbath, Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, Sound Garden, ZZ Top, and the Beatles all at once.

I found the digital scale to be useless, the saw itself does not cut well or accurately, the blade visibly moves through the cut and it is quite heavy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hitachi C12LSH Miter saw","review":"Saw was bulkier than I had anticipated. Pleased with its overall performance though. The only thing I wish Hitachi would change is make the laser line visible as the blade is cutting your material. When you power up the saw your laser line is visible until you start moving the cutterhead down then it blocks the laser and your line disappears. Overall a well built saw with plenty of power and smnooth angle adjustments."},{"rating":"1","title":"junk","review":"Not only is this the ugliest saw I have ever seen it is the most unfriendly to the user. I work professionally in a commercial setting as a finish carpenter. Of the 20 + guys I work with none of them have liked this saw. Big, heavy ridiculous styling. Falls out of square constantly. Nobody uses the digital gauge because it's stupid and pointless. Buy Hitachi's saws and tools that don't look like toys for kids and you'll be money ahead in every facet. I'm embarrassed to use this saw when it shows up on a job-site."},{"rating":"1","title":"too much slop","review":"I played with this saw at my local tool store and I was unimpressed. You can actually move the saw from side to side about 1/4 inch each way with it locked down. It's the worst play of any saw I've ever seen. I do high end trim and stairs and I'm a perfectionist. There is no way to get an accurate cut with this much slop. I would like to see if other Hitachis would do the same. Bigskybob"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor cutting saw","review":"I just finished setting up this saw in my cabinetshop tonight and got to cut with it for the first time. Yikes the cuts are bad! I removed the stock blade and put on my Forrest Chopmaster and the cuts were still bad. The left hand fence had a noticable warp along it's length, and the saw will not cut plumb. It is adjusted plumb, but wanders to the side during the cut. Also it seems to wander a good bit on slide cuts, I could not get a cut close to square when crosscutting a 12 inch wide piece of plywood. I thought this saw was a great deal for the $399.99 special, but now I know why it was on special. Sending it back and going back to my old, but dependable Makita 12\\" slider. This saw is a major disappointment, and I do not see how it would cut the mustard for any professional."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hitachi was the best, but....","review":"I own 4 hitachi slide mitre boxes 2 10's and 2 8 1/2's. I build furniture and install moulding. We bought this saw for use in our shop but promptly returned it. The laser is ok but not neeeded. The digital display only works to the nearest 1/2 degree and that does not help much for fine tuning cuts. The side to side slop in this saw is real bad, most slides have some but i could not get this saw to cut 1 single straight cut. It moves as far as 3/16 in either direction???? The blade wobbles and it is one heavy heavy saw. This is not acceptable for the percision work I do. The head dosent have enough spring to return to the up position itself. Hitachi spent too much time making this saw look pretty and forgot about accuracy. I will buy another hitachi 10in. I do not reccomend this saw to anyone unless you have a pretty shop where the tools dont get used. Hitachi could not give me this saw I would have to use it as a paper weight."},{"rating":"2","title":"nothings perfect","review":"I have owned and operated this saw for well over 18 months. The upside; we were doing 9-1/2 \\" crown mouldings, in a large upscale house in Mt.Snow, Vermont. It performed well, with only minor challanges. Many of my crew used the saw daily, and as long as they all remembered the cardinal rule of not overtightening adjustments and keeping the saw slide clean and lubed, all miters were accurate and cuts were true and good.The down side is the weight, which I expected and deal with on a regular basis. No big deal. A lot of the weight is the stand it sits on. I also would like the digital read to be more accurate, giving real degrees in a more tightley callibrated fashion. And, for some reason, the pull stop which allows angles to the right broke off, a bad casting. Overall, it is a good saw, with more improvments needed. So, what doesn't?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Saw","review":"To me this is the king of miter saws. Amazon had the best price on it that I could find anywhere online. I got it for $100.00 less than I could have gotten it locally. The unit works great. It is dead on on cuts. I was also very pleased with the fast truly free shipping from Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seemed to work better without it","review":"I bought this to hopefully make the process of brazing AL easier.

Definitely worth the few bucks to own this wonderful book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent resource for glass designs!","review":"I love this design book! While I was student teaching I used it to explain the layout that Wright used for his stained glass windows.

Don't get me wrong-I like sweet. But these are way over the top, at least for me. I'm sure there are devotees of these who think I'm crazy.

I've heard it's nearly impossible to find this part and essentially IT is non-existent.I don't have the owners manual and I haven't been able to use the bike since.

I'll probably donate it just to get it out of our garage. maybe a mechanic can make a part for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"So good this is the second one purchased","review":"This is the perfect trike for my two year-old grandson. It is very sturdy and folds up to hang in the garage. It will tip if he gets going too fast and tries to take a sharp corner, but it is also low to the ground and stays upright most of the time. He loves to put rocks and toys in the carrier beneath the seat on the back. One thing that did disappoint me was that the picture shows the trike has a bell on the handelbars. Well, ours didn't have one. Luckily I was the only one disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tips easily","review":"I asked my sister to buy this bike for my daughter for xmas last year - she decided to buy another one for my nephew also since he is the same age as my daughter (2 yrs old at the time). She bought the two bikes at the same time, same model, same color, same store. My daughter, who is far more coordinated then my nephew, tips over very easy, my nephew seems to do fine. My daughter is taller and that may be where the difference lies. Perhaps the height of the child using the trike is what is causing the trike to tip easily. Not sure - but I know I regret that she ever got the bike -it was a total waste of money.Update: I was recently at a playdate and every kid who tried using this bike was tipping over and getting hurt."},{"rating":"1","title":"yikes!","review":"THIS WAS HORRIBLE!

And it was a hand me down, and has still held up much better then the spiderman bike which has not been used nearly as much. He loves riding it around and collecting rocks, ect in the back bucket. It is also SUPER easy to just throw in the back of the car and bring along anywhere. And when he is tired, I hang it on the stroller handles and he sits in the stroller. I even bring this bike to the mall and it is great, he is happy and I can peacefully shop while he contently rides from store to store. It is nice and small so it does not bother anyone at the store.

Not an easy thing to handle when his 4 year old sister is trucking away down the road in her fancy Schwinn trike that is beyond safe.

At the time she was still too small to really use it, so she pushed it with her feet.

Now that our daughter is almost 3 and is actually much more in to riding this trike we are getting rid of it. It just tips way too much, to the side, to the front, to the other side. I just ordered the new Schwinn Roadster Trike to replace this one. Now that she wants to ride, I want to get something that is safer and easier. For some reason it also seems a little hard to petal...the tires (which are hard plastic) sometimes just spin and don't go anywhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"C's Mommmy","review":"I have to agree with the others.

The same thing happened.Fortunately, her helmet took the brunt of the fall. The trike is going in the trash. I will not even sell it at a yard sale, as someone else suggested. How can someone knowingly sell something they think is too dangerous for her own kid???"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tipped over 4 times in short ride, under normal conditions","review":"This is a very cute tricycle at an okay price but unsafe. My daughter rode this 1 time down the sidewalk only a few houses and tipped over 4 times. the first when she slowly turned right out of the drive. the 2nd two was when she was riding it relatively staight, the last was while she was quietly sitting on it but not moving. She will have nothing to do with this bike now and I don't blame her.After the fact I did notice that the rear wheels on this tryke are significantly closer together than some other tricycles, which is likely the cause for such instability.To summarize, toddlers injuring themselves repeatedly on the same ride is no fun for anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous","review":"Fun in a strait line, instant tip over when attempting to turn. A very disappointing experience for my first childs bike."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be recalled","review":"This trike tips over no matter the size of the child. Totally unsafe especially around turns. It should be recalled and redesigned with a wider base."},{"rating":"1","title":"DANGER-TIPS OVER-DO NOT BUY!","review":"We bought this for our daughter's 2nd birthday and she has not gotten on it and successfully pedaled it for 5 feet without tipping it over. She has excellent gross motor control and can climb anything you expose her to, but this trike has a high center of gravity and it seems that the back wheels are too close together, so they don't keep the kid steady. A waste of money and time. We will be returning it..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tipping Trike","review":"How could this Fold 2 Go Trike have such great reviews? I have a 27 month old son, who is 35\\" tall, and can actually pedal this tricycle. He loves riding his trike, but this thing constantly tips over and over when he turns, regardless of what speed he's going. Good thing for helmets! At least he's learning why helmets are important! The build of this tricycle is good and will seem to last long, despite the multiple crashes it will probably see in it's lifetime. Honestly, this Fold 2 Go Trike should be recalled, redesigned with a wider wheelbase to prevent/reduce tipping, and/or come with a push handle like other models. NOT RECOMMENDED, unless you're a fan of bringing your kid to the ER/Urgent Care... I'm just thankful my son hasn't been injured using this product. It's off to try the more expensive Kettler Tricycles. This time we'll bring his helmet to the store and have him test it before making the purchase. His safety is worth the extra hundred plus dollars!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tip hazard","review":"We purchased this tricycle for our 24 month old son. As soon as he would shift his weight away from the seat and turn the wheel, the tricycle became very unstable and tip. I thought the main idea behind having three wheels was stability. This bike is a hazard.I am returning the tricycle immediately. I do not recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Tricycle","review":"We bought this trike for my grandson's second birthday. He has a chopper ride-on toy, but he can't reach the pedals. The trike comes set on the closest setting to enable reaching the pedals. He can reach them easily.The toy comes assembled, which is very nice, and it folds up easily for transportation between our house and his. He loves the little basket in the back of the bike.He is still learning how to work the pedals so I would suggest buying a push pole for parents."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wouldn't buy after trying it","review":"I've been looking for a good, safe trike for my almost-2-year-old and I've seen this one in a few stores. My daughter likes the look of it, but after trying it in the store, I will be steering away from this model. Of the two times I let my daughter sit on it, she tipped it over both times. No joke. The first time she tipped it with both feet on the floor by simply turning the wheel (not jerking) and the second time she had her feet on the pedals and jerked the wheel with her feet pressing down. This trike is not sturdy enough for the age group its recommended. It's cute with a nice design and bucket, but cosmetic value does not beat safty by any means."},{"rating":"1","title":"nOT for a tall child","review":"My son has recently turned 3yrs old and i bought this toy with the idea that it would be a great transition vehicle for him to go to the bicycle. i dont know who they found that can ride this toy at 5ys old but it definitely was not for anyone tall for their age. The handlebars r just too close to the seat so it creates an uneven distribution of weight but most importantly the knees are too close to the handlebars. The handlebars are also hard to steer. He had to continuously pick up the trike and point it in the direction he wanted it to go. My son is 38inches tall. IF YOUR CHILD IS OVER 38inches, DO NOT BUY THIS TOY AND SAVE YOURSELF SOME DISAPPOINTMENT."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for an active child!!","review":"This is one of two Tricycles my daughter has. After tipping and falling off several times this is now limited to only indoor over carpet use. She does wear a helmet so thank goodness we did have any bumps on her head but I didn't think that she would need elbow and knee pads as well as a face mask!! This is unsafe for a child who is very active."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great 1st bike for little ones","review":"Bought this for my grandson when he turned 3 and he loves it!!! He rides it inside and outside and has a blast on it everytime. He even entered a race with other 3 year olds and many had the same bike and all the parents said they would buy it again because it was sturdy, dependable and the kids love it. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"radio flyer bike","review":"We purchased this bike for my Granddaughter and it tips over continually.

LINDA"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tires are not durable","review":"Our 3 year old has had lots of trouble with this tricycle. The tires don't grip and make it hard to go up even slight inclines. Despite the fact we kept the tricycle inside, the front tire split and now it is even harder to ride. The tires are just suboptimal. It's a cute little tricycle, and my daughter loves the little yellow storage basket, but I wouldn't get it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"not safe","review":"I bought one at Target - my daughter was very excited and eager to jump on. Right after she sat on it and move foward it tipped right a way. We returned it in 5 minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute but tips over too easily","review":"This bike may be cute, but it tips over too easily.

If I have another chance, I would look for something that is more balance, wide and low. I will give this toy away soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tipsy","review":"Bought this for our son when he was 18 months old. He's a very physical child and picked up on peddling quite quickly. By 2 yrs old this trike became unsafe. He was going so fast that this trike would constantly tip around corners. Not due to my sons steering but the trike being so \\"light in the pants\\". We bought him a 12 inch big boy bike just after his second birthday and he is much safer on that than on this trike."},{"rating":"1","title":"it should be called the tip and go","review":"This bike tips over so easily. My child went to turn himself around and smacked his head on the pavement. At first we thought it was bad luck but after other kids at our barbeque tried and it fell over my husband threw it in the trash where it belongs. the wheel base is not wide enough or sturdy enough!"},{"rating":"1","title":"*** T I P P I N G *** H A Z A R D ***","review":"I do not review many products, unless I have strong feelings (good or bad). This trike's design needs to be seriously reviewed by Radio Flyer since it tips so easily. I bought it in the Toys R Us store, and after my 20 month old tipped it several times, and then an older child (more experienced rider) also tipped it, I took it back. Avoid this bike, I am now looking at Kettlers since they tout their anti-tipping features."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tips over easily","review":"I agree with the other reviewers that although this bike is very cute and adorable, it tips over extremely easily. We tried it out at Toys R Us, my son tipped over at least 4 times even when he's not moving! As much as we want to purchase the bike, I think I would want to find something more stable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lawsuit waiting to happen","review":"I absolutely wanted to love this trike. It's cute, colorful, and the perfect size for my 20-month old son. So, we saw them at the store today and decided to try one out. Well, the thing tipped when he tried to get on it. No biggie, I thought, he must have pulled it over. So, I held it while he got on. He started pedalling, turned the wheel to the left, and the thing flipped right onto its side - my poor little boy hit his face on the shelf at Toys'r'us. Whoever thinks this bike is safe must NOT be reviewing the Fold-2-Go model - this one's a tipping hazard for sure and should be taken off the market before some child really gets hurt."},{"rating":"1","title":"It Does Tip Easily.","review":"My husband and I went to the local Toysrus store to see which side of the mixed reviews is right. This is a cute tricycle for sure. When we were looking at it in the store, an employee aproached us and said, \\"I wouldn't recommend you that. Unfortunately, it tips easily.\\" I pushed one side of the handle down, and it did tip SO easily. The employee went on and said, \\"I'm a mother, too. I can't recommend something I wouldn't buy for my own children.\\" She showed us another trike, which was around $60, if I remember right. This was MUCH stabler than the Fold-2-Go, and didn't move a bit even when I pushed one side hard enough in the attempt to make it tip. We didn't make any purchase that day after all, but we sure appreciated the honesty and kindness of the store clerk."},{"rating":"1","title":"HAZARD To Your Child's Knees (& other body parts)","review":"This trike should be recalled immediately. I can't believe that the manufacturers can market a product that is so obviously faulty. My child tipped over, not just sideways but head first, at least 5 times within the first 30 minutes that he had the trike. I was so disappointed because we were so excited about giving it to him. The size seemed perfect and we thought he would be able to pedal. He couldn't even ride with his feet on the ground and pushing, because he still tipped over. BIG THUMBS DOWN FROM OUR FAMILY. NO ONE SHOULD PURCHASE THIS TRIKE IF THEY DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO PICK THEIR CHILD UP FROM THE GROUND CONSTANTLY."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this trike","review":"I bought this trike for my son at Target. He saw it and fell in love with it. He has another trike and is able to ride that one with ease. Don't be fooled by the handiness of being able to fold it up, and the cute look of this trike. Anytime my son was pedaling and turning the handle bars at the same time, the trike tipped over--sending him flying to the ground. There's something about the construction that is defective. He fell off of it at least five times within the first 10 minutes. I took it back the same day. I think this is a dangerous trike and it should be recalled. If you are thinking this is a cheap alternative to a Kettler trike--think again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous!","review":"I bought this bike for our 2 year old son. Both of our young children have tipped over on this trike so many times! The wheel base does not seem wide enough to be stable. My son sported a nice bruise on his chin after one of his falls. The Kettler my daughter has is so much safer and now we've ordered one for my son to replace the Radio Flyer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tips over too easily","review":"We have had this trike for a couple of years and my daughter has never really liked it. Once she was big enough to use the pedals (instead of her feet) the front wheel is not real rubber and so slides instead of getting traction. My daughter continues to get frustrated with it. Another big issue is how easily she can flip over on it. Once she does start getting some speed using the pedals, if she turns too quickly it flips thus causes a hurt knee or again just pure frustration. We have enjoyed the My First Scooter from Radio Flyer. I am going to try to find something that sits lower to the ground so she can pedal with speed and confidence that she won't flip over. Wouldn't buy again or for anyone else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Safety Hazard.","review":"My son received this for his 2nd birthday from his grandparents. He has another trike, but they thought the fold 2 go feature would be convenient. He has no problems pedaling either of the tricycles he has, but this one seems to slide and tip over easily when he tries to turn, either indoors or out. I think it has a lot to do with the hard plastic wheels that, in my opinion, should be rubber, or at least rubber coated. I've contacted Radio Flyer regarding this tricycle, and am waiting to hear back from them for a possible refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsteady trike","review":"My twins have had these since they were 2, and they've never been a good fit. These tricycles are very unsteady and tip over constantly. It's like they are too top-heavy... the wheels should have been designed further apart from each other to provide a more stable base. I can tell my sons don't feel comfortable riding them, so they always opt for their Radio Flyer Scoot-Abouts instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"granddaughter loves trike","review":"I just recently ordered this trike for my 2 yr. old granddaughter. She absolutely loves it. The high back is really a help for new riders. She also likes to put her blocks in the little carry all on the back of the trike."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tips over too easily","review":"I got this for my 15 month old for Christmas. She is not yet big enough for it but my 3 year old has been trying it out. It tips over way too easily. She fell off 4 times in one riding session. I think I may bring it back for something more stable. When my younger one is big enough to ride I think it will be too unsafe for her. Good price for a first trike, but you get what you pay for. Very disappointed in such a good brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yard sale here we come.","review":"My son doesn't like this at all. He never did, we have had it for about two years and I kept thinking that he will be ready for it soon, he tipped once and didn't every want to ride it again. Now he has out grown it, fortunatly it is in such great shaped (from lack of use) that it will sell well at a yard sale."},{"rating":"1","title":"tippy","review":"I am so very surprised by the difference in opinion on this bike.Overall: My (just turned) two year old tips this bike constantly. She likes it. (except when it tips) She wants to be a big girl like her sisters and ride her bike, but it discourages her when it tips. It is cute. Nice little bucket....but bottom line is I am trying to find a bike that doesn't tip as easily."},{"rating":"1","title":"tips over too easily!!!!","review":"This trike is very cute and easy to ride, but is too easy to tip over. I haven't tried out any others to compare it to, but my child is now scared to ride it b/c it tips over anytime she is going remotely fast and turns the wheel. She is 3 and hasn't had another that she can ride well, so it may be her inexperience combined with the light weight frame, but it scares me. I don't normally write reviews so take this seriously."},{"rating":"1","title":"So disappointed in this toy","review":"So dangerous, so disappointing - tips over so easily. Thought we could trust this toy. I am taking it back ASAP. Don't buy this trike!"},{"rating":"2","title":"confused by other reviews","review":"This trike is great! I am really confused by the other reviews. First off I won this trike as a door prize so the price was great but am planning on buying my daughter the pink one. Now I know people are concerned about their child tipping over well it has 3 wheels not really something to go with for the \\"sturdy factor\\". My son and my daughter have a blast on this and don't tip over very often. If they do it is usually when they are trying to hurry to get on or off the bike but while riding there are no problems. Would highly recommend this trike."},{"rating":"1","title":"MY SON HAS MULIPLE BRUISES ON HIS BACK!!!","review":"My son's grandma bought this bike for my 2 1/2 year old and it is not safe. At first he tipped it over over time he turned just a little so we did not ride outdoors for a while. Later he seemed to be getting better at it, so we have been using it outside.A few days ago I noticed bruises on my son's back. At first I thought he fell on something but I have been noticing he is peddling really slow lately and today he complained that his back hurt all day. He has multiple bruises where the seat is hitting his back. Please do not buy this bike! It is not worth the bumps and brusies to your child.Kari"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love our trike!","review":"I purchased this trike for my son about 5 months ago and we absolutly love it, but more so HE loves it. A friend is looking to purchase the Kettler which is an absurd amount of money for a TRIKE, anyways when I looked at the fold 2 go, I was astonished at how poor the ratings were on it. My son was 2 when we purchased....he is clumsy, crazy, rough, loves to go fast, tall and thin and has had minimal problems worth whining over with this tricycle. When he's even remotely tipped, it was from tearing around our kitchen (which is done daily for hours) and cranked the handles to avoid hitting the cat. This trike has been a favorite and the only reason we'll be getting rid of ours is because he's getting a bike. As with the other Radio Flyer products...we love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"i've already bought a second one","review":"This is a great trike for my toddler. She loves it and unless she goes too fast, we have had no problems. The other reviews were not so great, but we love this trike. Our neighbor ran over it and broke the wheel, so we bought a second one and are trying to replace the wheel so our twins will be able to use them in a year. The only problem is you have to have the warranty to get another part from the company."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY!!!","review":"I have never been one to go with reviews so I ignored the ones that I had read about the bike tipping over and bought it anyway for my 2 year old's birthday. What a mistake! Within 5 seconds of getting on the bike, it tipped over and did so every 2-3 minutes thereafter. Definitely not a safe bike. It may be cute and smaller than some of the others out there, but you'd be better off buying a kettler. Frome now on I'm going to pay more attention to the reviews. What a disappointment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous bike","review":"We bought this bike for our 15 month old and when he tried to get on it kept tipping over. We were going to put it away thinking he was too young for it. Well our 3 year old got on and was just riding it normally and he went around a corner and it tipped on over. Took bike back immediately. We are very disappointed in Radio Flyer. Love your wagon...hate your tricycles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Danger!","review":"We bought this for our 3 year old and were very disapointed. We found this trike to be very dangerous. He rode this bike and fell over many times, we also have the fisher price 3 in one bike and that never happened before. We bought this trike as a rite of passage beliving in the radio flyer name brand and tradition. Took it back to the store! Just because it looks cute is not worth the risk of injury to our son. Sorry Radio Flyer but you need to redesign this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Safety concern","review":"Bought this when my grandaughter turned 3. I found it to be extremely tippy when she tried to turn right or left - it tipped over nearly every time regardless of how fast she was going. I was really disappointed in the product. I bought it based on the company reputation and the convenience of it being foldable, but I wouldn't let any of my kids ride it now since it pins their arm and leg between the bike and the handlebars at a really sharp angle when it tips over, preventing them from being able to protect their head at all when it tips. Also, the trike seems very small - grandaughter is small for her age and outgrew in within months. Wouldn't recommend it due to safety issue."},{"rating":"1","title":"radio flyer should provide replacement!","review":"I bought this for my 2year old grandson and I am very sorry I chose this one! The trike tips over constantly, he won't ride it because of this. My 2 year old nephew and a few other children has tried to ride it aswell and it tips with too. I put it up, thinking about putting it in the garbage. This trike was not cheap in price but it's designe is all wrong. Sad that this is my grandson's first trike and it has made him a little discouraged to get on riding toys.Radio Flyer Fold 2 Go Trikeshould be recalled and radio should offer a nice replacement."},{"rating":"1","title":"I should have listened to everyone else...","review":"I really should have believed the other one and two stars reviews.

We returned it and ended up buying the Schwinn roadster."},{"rating":"1","title":"folds up, but tips easily","review":"For careful riders this tricycle is fine. It folds up nicely to hang up in the garage when not in use. HOWEVER, if you have a little one who likes to turn (at all) then expect it to tip. Older toddlers can catch themselves, but the littlest ones just tip and land hard."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Grandson First Bike","review":"My grandson just turned 2 years old and wanted a bike. I broused Toys R Us and found this Trike. When I brought him to the store he went crazy. He just loves it and puts his \\"sippy's\\" in the back of the trike. It is the best toy I could have bought him. It folds up so you can take it anywhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor design","review":"If i had to do it all over again, i would not have purchased this trike now knowing what i know. It really is a very poor design. Unlike most 3 wheelers, the rider sits right over the front handlebars, making it very unstable. Most 3 wheelers, have slightly extended front forks, which adds to a better center of gravity. On this 3 wheeler, anytime my grandson would lean the slightest bit forward, the trike would tumble forward. He hit his head on the floor once. I really wouldnt recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tip over easily","review":"I didn't believe what I read about the tip over hazard until I saw it happen to my 2.5 yrs old. The tricycle just tip over when she tried to steer it. OK, she's still learning so she may have steer too far but we still don't expect it to tip over at such a low speed. Fortunately she had helmet on so only got a couple scratches on her legs and arms. She has never tip over in her other tricycle, Kiddio Steering ST2 by Kettler."},{"rating":"1","title":"Caution!! Don't be swayed by the cute factor","review":"This trike has tipped over so many times I can't even count them. Every child that sits on it eventually falls over (it's been banned by my playgroup). But it's so cute you say. Don't be swayed by this. Try pushing down on one side of the handle bars like you would if you were two and getting on the thing. Wham. If falls right over. Try turning the wheel sharply to the left or right and barely touch it. (Your young child will do this over and over again) Wham. If the tassels and the bell are too irresistible make sure your child is wearing his/ her padded body suit and a helmet. The fold and go has gone back. I ended up buying a much, much, safer trike from a different manufacturer."},{"rating":"2","title":"If this is the Right EP!","review":"I picked up an EP by Red Snapper that was released around the time that this one was and it has the song Heavy Petting on it. It also has nine other songs including two live songs: one is a version of 4 Dead Monks played live.I compare this with the import \\"Americanized\\" release- It's All Good, which I did not think was \\"All Good\\", except the first song on it.This EP is launching Red Snapper in a new direction that really IS good! Granted, the trip-hop days are over, but not the creativity and passion I hear in Red Snapper's music. You might just say that they are feeling out their new ground. It is a litle more dancy without being cliche, melodically creative, without too much pretense. The Band never hits me immediately- but good things grown on me and this will grow if you open yourself to hear a new direction. Awesome Spin!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice player with nice price","review":"Nice little player... light weight, and uses one AAA battery...Can display mp3 file names in Japanese/Chinese/Korean without any problem at all...Transfering speed is pretty decent as well (USB2.0)Only drawback...No neck strap!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard To Handle","review":"The idea and size of the SanDisk is great but the control toggle is just to small.

I returned and guess I will have to save up for an Ipod."},{"rating":"1","title":"Feels cheap, wouldn't turn on","review":"I happened to get this model as a great deal, however, when I brought it home it wouldn't power on, even after trying my own battery that I knew worked. I ended up sending it back, but while I had it I noted that it had a single sheet of documentation, a cheap battery, and the unit itself felt like the plastic was too light, the buttons too flimsy. Instead of getting a replacement, I \\"upgraded\\" and got an iRiver unit instead, and after examination found it to be much better made, with much better doc.

I was considering Creative, Yupp and Sandisk. 512 was a must for me because I am planning on using it while skiing and mountain biking (all day events).My main concern was durability. After reading reviews about creative, many said it was made of very cheap plastic and was afraid of breaking it. This player feels very solid but I think the battery flap will prolly break off but its no big deal. I can care a less about the arm/neck band debate but the arm band does look like a quality product.The CD that the SanDisk comes with is worthless! The player is drag and drop making it amazingly easy to use without any software.At first the player's options can be a little confusing. Although it is very basic, it took me a few minutes to figure out how to change folders but once u get used to it, its a breeze.I am totally satisfied with this product and it is worth ever penny! I will write another review if the player breaks."},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST for gym use","review":"I bought this for $30 at a pawn shop as an impulse buy. I wanted something for the gym and didn't want to pay hundreds to look like every other iPod drone out there. I knew that I would eventually drop it and bang it around so the price was right for something that I would inevitably break.That was a year ago. This thing is still going strong. It's a tough little sucker. I dropped it while running one day on asphalt. When I jogged up to it to pick it up, I accidentally kicked it (Hard!) and it slammed into the curb. I was sure that it would be all busted up but when I picked it up not only was it intact, it was still playing!If you want something relatively inexpensive that you won't be heartbroken if you break it in the gym, then this is your player. If you want to look like every other faceless idiot out there that doesn't mind overpaying for a subpar product, get an iPod."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice little Digical Audio Player plays mp3 and wma","review":"I am surprise by how good the sound is with this unit.

Sound was good and it was easy to transfer music, but so what? The controls were NOT user friendly. The case looked, felt, and was cheaply made. No wonder the price has 55% off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome MP3 player!","review":"I love this mp3 player! It's so small and light, making it perfect to jog with. All the features are great, and the battery life is awesome! While exercising I prefer this over my iPod.To the person who recommends the iPod: Not everyone has $300+ to shell out for an mp3 player. Have you even tried the Sandisk player (and how does buying it make you a dork? haha) Besides, you can't really jog with an iPod hanging from your arm or hanging on your pants. I've tried clipping it to my pants, and the weight of the iPod makes my pants slide up and down...so uncomfortable. It also freezes up after a while because of all the movement. Buy the Sandisk MP3 player if you're into exercising and want a player with some solid features."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was full of pleasant surprises","review":"I wanted an MP3 player, but the best surprise about this particular model was what a fantastically good FM radio it turned out to be. The second unexpected attribute was that it survived an entire machine wash cycle in the pocket of my shorts, and even a full cycle in the dryer (low heat), and still works perfectly. I was positive I had just ruined it - but no. It's not advertised as water resistant, but seems to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"worked well for about four weeks","review":"I got this for Christmas from my kids. I loved it the first few weeks. I use it while running. After four weeks, the player shorts out, then resets itself and shorts out again. I've tried changing batteries and head sets, but this is obviously not the problem. I'm very disappointed, yet afraid to let my kids know it's not working properly since they just bought it for me six weeks ago. Prior to this problem commencing, it would lock up and I would have to uninstall the battery and reinstall it to get it to turn on. Buy the dell dj ditty instead, or an iriver or ipod nano. My husband got the ditty and my kids the nano's they work great. More money, but mine is now basically worthless after just six weeks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better than I expected","review":"I just got this for a few hours and I am extremely happy with it.After reading so many reviews, I actually had low expectation.(I tend to focus on negative reviews to see if a product should be avoided)However, it performs flawlessly. The music match software isoptional. You can copy the mp3 files directly to the device asif it is a hard drive. Or through music match.One negative thing which might be true is the interface. Ittook me a while to get a control of the device. It is not toouser friendly.After all, I am excited.

Would I buy it again, without question!"},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful mp3 player","review":"It is a wonderful mp3 player and I bring it with me all the time.

Anyway, I will highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money","review":"I purchased this player based on the reviews. The player is very cheaply made, the controls are difficult to maneuver, and the instruction book sucks. While trying to program the player it became stuck in \\"Chinese\\" for the language.

Needless to say, the player is being returned to Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked well... for about a month","review":"Initially I was pleased with the SanDisk 512mb; earphones weren't very good, but with the money saved, could get a better pair. Eats a AAA battery up faster than the manufacturer claims.Unfortunately, the device doesn't seem built to last - within two months of use, sound output to one channel cut out. At first thought it was a problem with the earphones - but it wasn't - same loss of sound in the left side with 3 different sets of phones (including the ones that came with it). It was nice while it lasted..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paid $99.00 in 2004 for this piece of junk","review":"One of my friends had these and i decided to buy one in 2004, little did i know, i should have waited for the iPod instead.This mp3 player only lasts for about a year, and the sound quality degrades over time, to a point where you hear rasping sounds in quiet areas. Additionally, the ear buds are too big, and as time passses (8months) you start to lose sound in one ear piece, then both. I tried other ear pieces but it was the same.I figured out that it is faulty wiring in these pieces of junk that cant be mended together.You're better off buying an iPod shuffle than this crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its great until it quits working!","review":"This thing is sensitive. Ive had it for a couple of months and first I had to order a complete replacement for it because it worked for about 5 minutes then it died and simply WOULD NOT function anymore.Then, the replacement unit worked for 6-7 weeks and it too has died. Ive tried replacing the battery several times and it just won't turn on. Ive wasted my money. If you're going to buy this, I would suggest also buying the replacement warranty because you'll need it!The few weeks of use I got out of it were good though. The recorder worked well in class."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this piece of crap!!!","review":"This device does not work. Could not put in a single mp3 that I downloaded into the device.

Very frustrating and confusing!!! I am returning and getting the IPod instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont Buy this!!!!!","review":"I hate this and it is really confussing and it freezes all of the time. Swithc the mode from music to radio to recorder is almost impossible. Half the time the tilt wheel works backwards and sometime the song title shows up in another langueage. Do yourself a favor and buy the Ipod Shuffle instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"This mp3 player is great!","review":"I don't write many reviews online but really wanted to for this mp3 player because I bought one recently and really like it. I've only had it a week or so but it is very easy to use, sounds great and the price is unbeatable. I'm very picky when it comes to the sound of my music and this player has eq presets AND a user defined eq setting. The way I have mine set sounds great even with the earbuds it comes with. I actually think the earbuds sound way better than the brand name ones I tried.The other things I like about the player are it has an FM stereo, lots of settings and is amazingly small and light. The plastic case that you can wrap around the player makes it durable too. You can even buy a lanyard and wear it around your neck. I highly recommend this and hope this helps!"},{"rating":"1","title":"MP3 Blue Defective and Return to SanDisk","review":"My MP3 stopped working 6 weeks after delivery from Amazon. Followed instructions from SanDisk to return for a replacement and have not heard back from them in 3 weeks. Call the customer support number and they do not have access to my replacement order number or inventory at there warehouse. I rate their after sales support terrible at best. Agent said warehouse is focused on retail sales for holiday and has no idea when replacement will be shipped. Obviously focused on $$$ and not customer satisfaction."},{"rating":"1","title":"It may be good if it works.","review":"Got this one as a birthday present. Looks not as good as an iPod at my first glance. But it can play wma DRM which I can get the song cheaper than iTunes. And it use AAA battery so I can use a rechargeable NiMH without worry about when the built-in battery will die someday. The whole package feels like a cheap crap. And it really is. Mine never woke up, it's a DOA. Totally CRAP!!! Got to return it to Sandisk, not the reseller. What is the hell I need to wait for shipping?? Feel very very unhappy about this product. Go to get a new iPod mini now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of expensive crap!!","review":"This mp3 is total junk!! I got it as an early Christmas present and was psyched since my husband had just gotten the Sandisk 1gb. I saw how easy it was for him to download blah blah blah. Well unfortunately mine turned out to be crap. It would start to download about 3 songs and then a window would pop up saying I had to insert a disk in drive E. I would have to unplug and replug to get it to do something. Finally, after about 2 hours it only downloaded 4 songs. We thought there HAD to be something wrong with this one so we took it back and got a 2nd one. Same old thing happened. Customer support was useless because they were closed. The user manual on the one sheet of paper and the manual on the disk were completely useless. We finally got fed up and took the worthless piece of junk back to Best Buy. I went over to Circuit City and bought the RCA LYRA 256mb. I am so happy with my new mp3.

The horror is clique and very predictable.Throughout the course of reading the book, i was trying to guess the ending. And seriously, i actually gave the book more credit than i should have.

I would recommend a different color for a light colored keyboard.I use \\"Russian standard\\" when not typing in English and they fit just as they are supposed to.If you need a multi language keyboard this makes getting that a lot easier. I did see that most other types have a high shipping rate (like up to $9.99!!!), so I would look around a little. The seller I bought from here on Amazon had free shipping.

The story moved along at a nice pace and even though it never perved out in a big way I still felt satisfied and would watch it again.The picture on the DVD was great, but I wish there had been a commentary track by somebody.

The ideal bike is an undersized one without pedals, ridden like a scooter. Since my daughter's bike has a coaster brake, I decided to add a basic hand brake.This brake set is generally simple to install. The instructions are seriously lacking. But the components are decent and complete. I like that they even include the ferrule for the cable end. Even better, this set will fit a 16\\" bike. It is a little oversized, but it does fit over the rear fender on my daughter's bike.Besides the instructions, the only other complaint is the color choice. I received a black set. It looks out of place on a purple and pink with white tires bike."},{"rating":"1","title":"Parts were cheap and not easy to assemble.","review":"I am not an expert bike repair person, but this product just did not work with my son's bike.

I bought this for my wife and it was a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"wrong size description","review":"I bought this to replace my center pull front brake on my vintage road bike. I had several issues with this product. The bolt holding the lever on was not long enough to stay on my drop bars, and of the two bolts that came to attach the caliper only one was long enough to make it through the fork but even then it was too short to even use the included washers.(probably because it wasn't designed for a 27\\" wheel/fork etc) I was almost tempted to by a replacement like i did with the lever bolt. The spring on the caliper itself was already awkwardly bent upon arrival and the caliper wouldn't open up until after i sprayed some chain lube on there. The biggest issue i had was that the sellers description said it would fit a 27\\" x 1 1/4 wheel/tire but the brake shoes at the highest point still clasped below the rim. Hopefully i can still return this item even though it's been opened."},{"rating":"2","title":"did its job for cheap","review":"it brakes nicely and looks clean but the only problem I had was it's instructions.

In the Broadway version, William Daniels (John Adams) is more frantic, almost screaming at moments.

Regrettably, it's hard (impossible?) to find the soundtrack version on CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love 1776","review":"I am a huge broadway fan, and 1776 is up there on my list of favorite shows with Les Miserables and Rent.

Wrong! It's still a great musical, but 80% of this cast can't sing! My favorite song, The Lees of Old Virginia, was just butchered (if you don't believe me, listen to Track 4 at about 2 minutes into the song for a nice clip). Neither was I impressed with the man who sang the part of Thomas Jefferson. The only singer whom I liked more on this CD than the 1997 version was Betty Buckley as Martha Jefferson. These men all sing flat! I was just floored at the low vocal quality. Not to mention the really...hollow voice acting. They put no passion into the dialogue. Please don't let my low rating put you off the entire musical, however. It's brilliantly written, wonderful score, and very entertaining, but please, please, PLEASE listen to the 1997 version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated Tony Award Winner","review":"How could this musical win the Tony award having as a competitor a play like HAIR which - for many people - stands as an emblematic theatre piece of the 60's? Who remembers a tune out of this musical? On the contrary, \\"Aquarius\\", \\"I Got Life\\" or \\"Walking in Space\\" are still popular and they play all over the world. Even ZORBA and PROMISES PROMISES - both candidates for the award in the same year - have songs that are still remembered. 1776 may wake up patriotic feelings to American listeners which is quite understandable but the music and songs are old-fashioned, overrated and awfully boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"an insult to American history","review":"Oh...my...God. In my social studies class we were studying the signing of the Declaration of Independence, and my Social Studies teacher thought it would be a good idea to have us watch this musical. Being the enormous fan of Broadway that I am, I was psyched. What a let-down. I mean, really. The concept that Thomas Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence because he could have sex with his wife is insulting to anyone with the least bit of patriotism. And not only that, the music was lame. It lacked variety (except for \\"Mama look sharp,\\" the one decent song in the show, that didn't include Jefferson's violin screeching into uncomfortable silence)."},{"rating":"2","title":"All Aboard!!!","review":"Part of the The Illustrated Directory Of series, this book is a real hoot!Following a reasonable timeline, some of our most importaint locomotives in the history of Railways are covered, Steam, Electric, Diesel and GasTurbine.All regions are covered but the U.K., Europe and North America get the most coverage as the need to create communications in these large land mass areas saw the most development in locomotive technology.The contentious issue of who built the first Pacific type (4-6-2)locomotve is settled with Baldwin winning by a couple of weeks with their order from the New Zealand Government Railways for that country's Q class locomotives in 1899-1900.Other magnificent feats of engineering are covered, the mighty Big Boys, the sleek GG1s, the Hudsons, F7 Diesels etc and the modern locomotives and High Speed passenger trains of today all get a look in.

This direct to DVD movie is about as B as B-movies gets. I won't give away the plot, which is very cliche. How many movies have we seen where corrupt people claim they are \\"owed\\" and that is why they have sold out. Why can't they admit they are greedy, and don't have a soul? Why always blame whoever it is they work for? Oh well. Like I said. Very cliche.Gun battles in this movie are lame. Watching Snipes blindly fire hundreds of rounds from a suppressed weapon, simply looked stupid.But, I guess aging action stars have to make a living too. And of course Snipes needs to get caught up on those taxes, so it may have simply been a case of desperate times calling for desperate measures. Rent it if you like Wesley Snipes movies. He's still a decent actor. Just makes too many less than decent movies. Would not recommend buying the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love Wesley but...","review":"Wesley Snipes ? i love that homie but what the hell is that movie right there.... if you are just a little bit smart you will hate this movie.... if you love this movie you are not an intelligent human beeing... ahaha im joking im joking, but the movie is straight garbage"},{"rating":"1","title":"don't waste your time or money","review":"Don't waste your time or money on this movie.

I have lately been frustrated with the decline of songwriting, and how little effort is put into creating melodies that go beyond the cookie-cutter riffs that are out there. However, the songwriting in \\"Subjects\\" is refreshingly unique and stimulating. The mood created is edgy and real, yet fun and optimistic. This, embellished by interesting arrangements and the superbly blended voices of the brother and sister, makes \\"Subjects\\" an enjoyable, worthwhile investment for anyone who wants to hear really good music that isn't depressing. I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Always great","review":"These two get it. Melody, lyrics, harmony.

Most of these tracks were recorded in the mid sixties to the seventies. As usual, Jamaican singers looked to America for inspiration. Just about all the artists here are well known to anyone familiar with reggae music. As always there are a few sprinkled in that are not as well-known. Singers like Stranger and Patsy,Bob and Marcia,Stranger and Gladdy are represented,along with people like Maxie and Niney,Bunny and Ricky and others not well-known. However,the quality is always fine. This is a more \\"upbeat\\" sounding collection than other sets put out by Trojan. Perhaps it has to do with the many artists here. Artists whose only hope was to make a \\"hit\\"record. In doing so they have left us a fine sampling of soul and r&b music,done Jamaican duet style."},{"rating":"2","title":"moving!!! many a bad girl's dream. an unparalled voice!!!!!","review":"this cd is a must for anyone who ever loved and lost. it is raw emotion laid bare. as open and honest as it gets!

For anyone who would like to see Burton on the silver screen, don't miss \\"Melanie\\" an early 80's film starring Paul Sorvino, Don Johnson and Glynnis O'Connor. Burton also has tracks on the soundtrack for the movie California Dreamin'. I never tire of the vocal prowess this man has been gifted with.

This Rhino collection proves that Cummings is a long lasting Canadian/World treasure of an artist. Most people will only recognize \\"Stand Tall\\", a huge hit from the seventies, but there is so much more to this twenty song collection. \\"I'm Scared\\" is as soulful as Cummings gets and \\"Never Had A Lady Before\\" is a romantic masterpiece. For bouncy rock 'n roll, there is the clever \\"Charlemagne\\" and \\"My Own Way To Rock\\". Never one to ignore his balladeer side, Cummings gives great performances on the essential \\"Timeless Love\\" and \\"I Will Play A Rhapsody\\". Other than the first cut, \\"Fine State Of Affairs\\" should have a been a huge single. It is one of the most finely crafted pop singles he has ever created and a testament to this fine collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Burton Cummings beat still goes on and in a new direction!","review":"This is a excellent CD album by the talented former band member. Who decided to leave The Guess Who in 1975 and started going into a new direction of his and became a solo artist. And did his first self title album that year. Cummings was the lead vocals and spirit of the rock'n roll psychedelic sixties group The Guess Who and sang their first song called \\"These Eyes\\". Now with a greatest hits collection for the very first time in hislifetime. Cummings performs most of his most memorable songs about himself like \\"Stand Tall\\" \\"I'm Scared\\" and \\"You Saved My Soul\\". Which these are my favorite tunes to listen.

Instead of the incredible call-and-response climax of Part II, what more than one critic has called five minutes of pure sexual release, the song just stops. And that's just wrong, sort of like...well, a novel without the last chapter, The Messiah without the Hallelujah Chorus, the Shawshank Redemption without a prison break, or...well, you know.So buyer beware.

That was my problem, as this mess does not even vaguely resemble Thai food and has no discernible ginger or coconut taste. Plus, the noodles stick together, even when prepared as suggested, and come out in a big clump when you try to eat them.Also, the nutrition label is misleading. I am dieting and read labels very carefully. This says a serving is one cup and also says one package weighs 4oz (half a cup). I figured, as it did not say otherwise and as this type of meal is usually one serving, that after adding water there would be one serving per package. Not so, one package is actually two servings, or over 500 calories. This is far more than any other pre-packaged noodle meal I have seen.The excessive calorie content might have been OK had the product tasted good, but it doesn't. I would definitely recommend you stay away from this mess."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Quick Meal","review":"This is a great meal for a quick lunch - the taste is good, and I really like the texture (the noodles do stick together into a clump).

One box makes enough for me to have 2 very filling lunches or for my whole family to share as a side dish. (The kids always lunge at the opportunity to have these!)The only negative thing I can say is that I wish there weren't so many separate little seasoning packets to mix in (3, plus the noodles); a single combined spice packet would be easier.

Lucky for Evan, Meg was there temporarily. Yet as they took care of the babies together, arguments changed to playful banter, and the harshness in their eyes gave way to understanding...and more.

Dana Spiotta has truly burst onto the literary stage with all the wit of an Updike or Armistead Maupin, the pace and intricacy of a Robert Altman screenplay and the subtlety and nuance of Gore Vidal. In short, fantastic, witty, insightful on the many facets of our complex urban lives and loves, and a real stonker of a read. Please please tell us you're working on a sequel, Dana Spiotta!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lightning Failed","review":"Try stream of consciousness meets Sex in the City, LA of course. Bland, rambling, is there even a thought out plot? The writing...the writing? Try insipid excursuses ad infinitum. I've read one heck of a lot of good contemporary lit, and I gave it a strong try, but I can in no way account for the good reviews. All I can guess is she's done some good stuff in the past that blinded the reviewers of this one, however, I doubt I'll give her another chance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Most uninteresting; in fact, it is the first book in a long time that I threw out--waste of money.

Sorry, but wish you luck in the future!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Robben Ford shines!","review":"Whoever produced this cd should be shot. It is way too slick. However, it contains a fantastic slow blues called \\"Nothing's Changed\\" that is one of Robben Ford's all time best solos. Spoon sings this one great as well. I think Robben does 3 or 4 solos and this cd is worth having for those alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"jimmy gets funky","review":"Not your typical Jimmy Witherspoon blues album.

I thought it was a great movie, but years later I got the book, Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH, for my younger brother. I read it to him when he was about 6, and I discovered that the book is far superior to the movie, having superb background and description, and presenting the dilemmas in real and difficult terms, instead of the simplistic magic and clear-cut good and evil of the movie. I recommend this book as an intriguing children's adventure story, and worthwhile addition to any library of children's literature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting story about a mouse trying to save her son's life.","review":"Mrs Frisby is the mother of four children and trying to save her son who is suffering of Pneumonia.

First of all, it does not blend well with anything--water, juice, milk--everything I tried blending it with just ended in a layer of sludge on the bottom and sides. Even if it did blend, it would not disguise the horrible taste. My usual vitamin powder has a pleasant citrus taste, but this tasted and looked like banana-flavored baby vomit.I did not take it for very long, so I can't really attest to it's energy and health boosting capabilities. I just could not get past the taste and texture--the unappetizing brownish-green color, chalky texture, and vomit flavor are not for me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Taste!

This album is a gem to those familiar with the works of Carla or other musicians involved. However; if not thought posssible it is more of an acquired taste than SGM or Secret Chiefs. The compositions within this album play a lot more on minimalism and abrasive soundscapes. I'd give it a five star rating if not for the risk of you not liking the unique sound that this album/band has to offer; but have settled for 4 with a warning that if you come expectations for SGM or secret chiefs you might find yourself disapointed. However; if you come looking for compositions that tweak more with sublteties in their tunes you can aprreciate this album for all it is worth.-Sir SMudge"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute","review":"Very cute.

Even if you haven't seen the musical, I would still recomend that you buy it (but watch the musical first)!!! There's a perfect combonation of romantic songs, emotional songs, and humurous songs.

The movie is so good,especially Russ Tamblyn's performance. Russ Tamblyn(Riff), the bestactor EVER- his voice is great, he dances and sings very well too in West Side Story. The best songs(it's hard to choose) in my opinion are \\"Gee, Officer Krupke\\", \\"Cool\\", \\"America\\", \\"Jets Song\\" ,and \\"Tonight(Quintet)\\". George Chakiris is also in this musical, and he is also a great singer. Rita Moreno, Natalie Wood, and Richard Beymer's voices were dubbed, but they are very talented actors.

They could be better for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shoddy Quality","review":"We were extremely disappointed with the poor quality of this hooded towel. Buying organic baby items was something we did without hesitation because we believe it is better for our daughter. The downside is usually the cost, and we were eager to find an organic hooded towel for such a low price. The reason why the price is so much less than other organic hooded towels is the terrible quality. The trim came off in several places after 2 washes, and the towel itself is unraveling in those areas. It's also not nearly as absorbent as other hooded towels, which is frustrating when we are trying to get our daughter dry as quickly as possible after a bath.You get what you pay for...don't buy this towel!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT \\"finer baby products\\"","review":"I wish I could give negative stars for this item.

This is the only chair I will ever use. It is the only one I have used where when I stand up after hours of sitting in it, I don't have to grab my back and groan!Sometimes hard to find in stores because it is such an economical chair for the features you get.

It has a very high back which is kind of nice if you want to lean your head back but it looks too tall. Overall its pretty comfortable.

Every time you scoot the chair or lean a bit forward the mechanism slips and you end end up having to tilt it back again."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I had returned this chair.","review":"I have regretted buying this chair since it arrived. It was difficult to put together, and it is one of the least comfortable office chairs that I own. This is a definite case that I would not have purchased the chair had I sat in it first.

There is an irony and an irreverence here that I find refreshing, and the nods to Genesis are often quite clever, but after the nervous chuckles you're left with the music, which isn't complex, the storyline, which is ridiculous, and the recording quality, which is lacklustre.

Even if I am three feet away from the router and get full bars it could sometimes take an hour to actually connect. And when it finally does it will occasionally drop and have to reconnect, which could again take an hour. It's like a lottery with the wireless connection of this router. You can't rely on it if you need to do work. I have a friend with this exact model who has all the same problems.I would strongly suggest getting the Linksys WRT54G instead. If you are tech-savvy, get the WRT54GL and hack the firmware. The wireless always connects immediately and has never dropped.

My son's desktop that still is connected with an -11b usb adapter seems to run faster, as well. Overall, I'm very pleased.

With the original firmware, the router crashed and rebooted whenever it had a slight bit of sustained wireless load - not even 20 KBps. With upgraded firmware, some configuration web pages don't work in Firefox, and it spontaneously reboots for no reason at all (that's if you're lucky - sometimes it just stops working until you unplug it from the power and plug it back in).D-Link's only suggestions have been to attempt to slightly reduce load by disabling UPnP (which never worked anyway, along with dyndns support), which, needless to say, didn't help.

Additionally, it requires a reset everytime you make a change to its configuration. This is extremely annoying, especially having had a router that never had to do that (LinkSys WRT54G.) I normally used this DI-524 in case I needed wireless from the LAN in a hotel. I had to pull this router out since I hosed my LinkSys from being too inquisitive with third party firmwares. D-Link has truly shown me how much I'm missing from my LinkSys WRT54G and so with that, I'm going to grab another LinkSys router. Some of you may not even care about the firmware factor, but if you do like to keep your routers up to date, and you're an advanced user, please don't buy this.

It instructed me to turn modem off for 2 minutes, turn router off, turn router on, etc. etc. After I did this it worked!While I'm not a sophisticated user (i.e. multiple wireless clients, complex security setup needs), I would guess my setup is pretty average. For this type of user, I would recommend this router based on it's price and features (security).

I will admit, I at first was hesitant, because it was another women captive who falls for her captor story, but it still worth the effort. Malik may at times seem like an unsympathetic hero, because after all he does capture innocent women and sells them into the slave trade, all under his cause of freeing a people under an evil dictatorship. Amelia was one of his captives. (...)

Overall, I'd say if you're looking for something to minimize contact with messes, opt for a disposable liner (Amazon sells a great biodegradable, disposable liner).Just because I have them, I use them if we're leaving the house for a tad bit more absorbency in the prefolds. They certainly don't act as doublers, they only avoid having to clean small messes...not really beneficial for big blowouts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Non absorbent, just more cloth to rinse!","review":"Just bought the kushies ultra diapers, cloth inserts, and disposable rolls.

If you're looking for something that you can switch out and not have to change the diaper every time (keeps the diaper dry), just get the gerber or carters cloth diapers and stick those inside folded, they absorb everything in these diapers! you can cut them down to size as well, which is what i did. they're only six bucks for a six pack at walmart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"Unless you want something extra to rinse off after your little one poops, don't bother buying these. They are too narrow for the BG 3.0s that I use, so the poop spreads off the edges. I've used two at a time overlapping eachother, and that helps.

This would also be a great liner to put on top of a pocket diaper if you wanted to start potty training to help them recognize when they are wet without buying all new diapers or adding something big and bulky.

Since this is my first time using the hitch, I bought a locking hitch pin.The quality of the rack is decent and is comparable to $125 racks I saw. The included straps are actually just a roll of Velcro, but do a sufficient job of tightening down the bikes. The fit and finish of the rack are not perfect but are decent. Bottom line, this is an excellent rack for the money. If you expect to use a bike rack all the time, then you may need to invest in a high quality $200+ rack.

It offers just a VERY short, half-page synopsis of each clan and then a photo of their primary tartan. Better information can be found on the internet as well as access to several other versions of clan tartans; most clans have more than one tartan (eg. ancient, modern, weathered, etc). If you are the type who wants an overview of every clan, you might like this, but if you want detailed information about a specific clan, you will not find it here."},{"rating":"2","title":"80's Goodies","review":"Definetely one of the better compilations.

It's kind of like a high school production of the Thriller video...Insomnia is a funny thing sometimes...gives you a chance to watch bad movies on the internet that you might never get a chance to see otherwise. This one is hilariously bad...bad writing, bad acting, dumb zombies, dumber \\"zombie bait\\", beautiful location, attractive cast. One of my favorite quotes was \\"He has as much courage as his Dad. His Dad was also courageous...and brave.\\" (Turns out his Dad was the President...turned into a zombie). This isn't really worth watching unless you have some time to really waste...but a really bad movie is so much more entertaining than an hour of American Idol...and much more memorable.I hope the production of this movie worked for the guys that made it...that they \\"got some chicks\\" and somehow made all this worthwhile.

This movie was so bad that it moved me to warn other people to save your money and your time. The acting was horrible at best, the special effects were missing. The camera they used was something like that of a 7-11 type security camera. I think the purchase price of the dvd cost more than the movie did to make. I forced myself to watch the whole thing as punishment for spending the money. I gave the movie a 1 star because the system would not let me rate it 0 stars like it should be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Movie","review":"Do not trust the review by Mr John Blake. He is a member of the cast/crew.I will start this review by saying this is not the worst zombie movie I've ever seen. That honor goes to Forest of the Dead(not to be confused with Severed: Forest of the Dead) or Ghoul School. This was still a bad movie though. The voiceover is terrible, the echo annoying. The acting in this film is bad but with some work the cast could do a better job next time around. The effects were passable but not great in any way. The fact that at least 5 times during the movie a black screen appeared with the words Cousins Brothers Productions was extremely annoying and stupid. This movie is very forgetable. In fact I'm having a hard time writing this review because i've already started to forget about the bad script,etc. There are much better ways to waste an hour and a half.

The shaky acting, the thin, drawn-out script, etc. \\"Fast paced action\\"? It's about as fast-paced as a lullaby. I will be honest, the movie does boast an attractive cast, and I will give them points for their attempt at special effects. Also, filming in the lush tropical jungle was nice but don't be deceived. \\"The Rising Dead\\" probably won't make any Top 10 Lists."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite Christmas CDs","review":"Oh my, this is just one of my absolute favorite Christmas CDs.

The most electrifying bass intro of the 60s is left off the beginning of Tighten Up, one of THE funkiest songs of all time. No opening bass line! Not only that, but the linear notes disses Archie and the Drells' early albums, loading up on their mid-seventies disco crud. True, the album has the three big ones - Tighten Up, I Can't Stop Dancin' and Gonna Be a Showdown. But Tighten Up is the only song from their first album included on this CD. No I Don't Wanna be a Playboy, A Soldier's Prayer, Give Me Time, or any of the others. Whoever put this compilation together for Rhino is NOT an Archie Bell and the Drells fan. The minute I put the CD on and heard Tighten Up start with the drum roll and not the bass line, I knew I would be disappointed. Let's hope someday Rhino comes to its senses and releases whole albums of Archie Bell and the Drells, not this pathetic compilation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Oldie","review":"I got this order much faster than expected, in excellent condition just as the seller stated.

Directed by Leigh Scott and starring Eliza Swenson, Amelia Jackson-Gray, Jon-Paul Gates and Jeff Denton; this 2006 film is about Princess Vanir who must traverse the haunted forest of Sidhe in a desperate attempt to save her kingdom from an advancing army of dark elves. With the help of Cador and Artemir, they encounter a mysterious sorceress, an army of elves and a dragon hellbent in standing in their way. Considering this is part of a trilogy, I'm looking forward to the sequels in everyway. This movie might not be liked by most who saw it but, for those of us who accept it for what it is, it isn't that bad a flick.

In the code behind page (.vb) you can call another class, do a database query and populate the label with the data.What this author does is have all code in one single .aspx page for the most part. You miss out on knowing the main cool feature of asp.net of separating design and logic!!

I have way too much else to learn to deal with learning C#! It's also peppered with notes about differences between classic and .net.I also found some subjects in here that I didn't find anywhere else, specifically the use of GDI.net to create images on-the-fly.

I'm not sure how this could've escaped the editors and the publisher. Either they knew there would be no CD and didn't care to revise the material or they didn't ship the CD.

Great characters, great universe, great action sequences. Potentially the kind of subtle plot line that takes time to develope and is worth sinking your teeth into a la Robin Hobb. Unfortunately, I am not sure this is going to happen. Either this is a stand alone book that finished way too soon or this is the first in a trilogy that somehow included the first two chapters of the next book. Way to many subplots and characters that somehow seem to get in the authors way so she just either kills them off or forgets about them.

It has no power whatsoever compared to my previous Norelco, and I can go over light stubble several times and still feel plenty that it has missed. Just turn it on and you can feel that it's a pretty wimpy motor inside. Plus the trimming blade is set at such an angle that it's very difficult to use without it closing on me all the time. Again, my previous Norelco had much better design/placement for the trimmer in addition to being far more powerful and effective. This model is only passable if you have a very light beard and/or you use it every day.

The main problem is the low speed at which this razor runs. Previous Norelcos that I have owned ran at much higher speeds and cut far more efficiently. The 7140 is hell on the neck, particularly with a 2 day growth and tends to pull hairs rather than cut them. I would pass on this razor unless you have a light beard.

I've worn out 3 Norelco shavers so this was a confident purchase I thought.

I have tried to exercise the utmost care to keep this thing from ripping my face apart, but it continues to do it at least 4 times each shave, and with nothing more happening than just moving to another place on the face.

From what I've read it takes around a month for your face to get accustomed to the razor to get the cleanest shave so I'm going to give it more of an effort and hope it goes as well as I hope it will :) Overall I would recommend the razor after seeing what a good job it did with my 4 day old scruff.

If I go a day or two without shaving, I have to shave three to four times to clean up areas it misses.I still own my old 90's vintage Norelco. I am tempted to buy it new blades and use it over this razor. Before I do that, I will buy an upgraded Norelco and try it.

I forgot how deafeningly loud the Braun is. So I went out and got this 7140. It's everything my old Norelco was, but better. For one thing, it's whisper-quiet, which is nice in the mornings. It shaves close without tearing up my face, and it takes far fewer passes than the Braun to get my face fuzz-free. It's essentially waterproof and easy to wash it one out under the tap (the instructions encourage you to do it this way) and get it squeaky clean after every single shave."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a GRRRRRRRRRRREAT SHAVER!!!!!!!","review":"I purchased the Philips Norelco 7140 about a year ago.

Not sure what all the fuss is about. The bear character is just mean with no redeeming qualities. He eventually goes away because he is not successful in his squashing. What's the moral in that story? Meaness sometimes fails to cause the intended damage? The little woodland creatures are just hapless and passive victims of a bully. What's the moral for them? Just keep running until the bully happens to get unlucky, and goes away? My 4-year-old said he did not like the story because the bear is too mean. He agreed we should sell it, and buy another book. I would have given it 1 star, except that the illustrations are nice, in a retro way.

Tonight my sister, somehow, found a new copy on amazon and had it sent to me for Hannukah. I burst into tears.

At that young age, I knew right from wrong and Mr. Bear was very, very wrong in his behavior. I really don't remember any of the ensuing pages, as I was devastated by the totally unacceptable and dangerous manner of the bear.So, go ahead, buy this book and traumatize your kids.If you insist on buying this book, at least read it first and consider that young minds might not bend to nuance as aptly as more mature minds.The Horror!(Update)I recently received a rather vulgar and, I assume, negative comment on my review.

The dynamic she creates between her main characters, Kit and Nick, and the intensity of their feelings for each other made this novel a joy to read, even as the conflicts that surround their lives sometimes caused me to cringe. This book, while about two men and their love for each other, can speak to any reader of any orientation and show that real love between two people is not restricted to a man and a woman.

I struggle to find enough light for long focal length shots. The noise of the auto-focus annoys me so much I wonder if the internal parts aren't grinding into pieces. And I've yet to take a photo that's sharp and acceptable - they are all incredibly soft. The focus is so bad I wonder if there might be a problem with the specific combination of my Canon 20D and this lens. I've shot a few hundred pictures with this lens and not one has been worth printing. It's become an expensive paperweight. The 20D's kit lens takes better photos."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great lens for the price!","review":"I have had this lens for a couples months now, and it has been great for me!

This was the quickest rebate return I ever applied for ! The way it SHOULD be for all of them 8-) BTW, now over 2000 shots taken with this lens and I'm still happy.Update: Now at over 6000 shots taken and it's still a gem to own ! No problems to report."},{"rating":"1","title":"Versatile, but lacks sharpness","review":"I bought this lens because it's very inexpensive and compact. The 28-300mm zoom gives a lot of versatility. I'd give up some of that versatility for better image sharpness. I have a Canon 28-135mm lens that knocks to socks off the Tamron lens for image quality. The Tamron is also quite noisy. I remember a couple instances of trying to shoot some birds. As soon as I depressed the shutter button half way to focus, the birds flew off, startled by the raucous noise of the lens focusing. I still pack my Tamron along for trips for the zoom factor, but I'm thinking of the Canon 75-300mm lens that goes for around $400. I own several Canon lenses and you just can't go wrong for image quality. I think it's worth the extra bucks for Canon quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst","review":"We have two of these lenses. Both shut down and stop working at long focal lengths.Tamron wants to charge 140 dollars to fix each one, even though the fact that both have the same defect shows it is their fault.Forget Tamron.

HOWEVER, if you are hoping for very sharp photos this is not the lens for you. Furthermore the lens (my sample anyway) had quite a bit of chromatic aberation and color fringing. I could have lived with the lack of sharpness but not the color fringing so back it went."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy with this lens","review":"I have to say after using this lens for a month that I'm glad I ended up with it. I wanted a lens that would give me a range of options, and that is what this lens has...I can use it for macro or for wider views. I have a prime 50mm lens for portrait purposes, but I wanted something that could be used as a walkabout. The quality of the photos is good...(although in dimmer light, I do up the ISO on myD300, which is okay as the D300 does fine with higher ISO).There is a bit of search for focus on the longer end of the lens...If you are shooting birds, that can be annoying, plus it makes a noise...but over all...I can work with it.I do recommend this lens for someone who wants a deal (price wise), but good quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short on sharpness and focus capability","review":"Sure I'm an \\"L\\" snob I suppose, but I wanted to try the Tamron to see if I could just carry one lens on an upcoming trip. The lack of sharpness and ability to focus in a rather large depth of field were among the short list of things I didn't like right away. I shot pictures at a wedding for a friend...and was VERY disapointed. This morning, I tried one more experiment, catching a blue jay out in our oak tree. Could hardly tell the blue jay from the tree at 70 mm. It was just a black blob. I pulled out the L and did the same shot with crystal clarity.The lens is easy to use, light weight, and as others have said...if you don't require the sharpness...it is a perfect lens for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tamron 28-300","review":"The Tamron 28-300 lens is highly versatile and of good quality. It allows me not to have to change lenses. Most of my photography is for slide shows or Keynote (Apple's version of PowerPoint) presentations so the slightly lower contrast at the longer focal lengths is no problem. The drop in contrast is, in my opinion, not a serious problems (I do make prints of 8x10 and larger and they are fine though I commonly add a touch of contrast in Photoshop). The great zooming range and general image quality negate any contrast problems for what I do. I'd recommend this lens for general photographers who don't like to change lenses but who want to shoot both wide and narrow-angle photos."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tamron 28-300mm F/3.5-6.3 AF XR Di LD For Nikon AF-D","review":"Strengths: This lens gives a very clear picture at 300 even when enlarged. The Macro is outstanding as well.Weaknesses: The focus ring has a very cheap feel to it if you are use to the Nikon quality.Summary: I am using this lens on my Nikon D80 for all of you who are wondering if it will work on the D80. I was very skeptical that this lens would be such good quality. For the price it is a great value and you will not be disappointed. My wait and see is how it will hold up, but Tamron seems to put a six year warranty behind it so it should last. If you are looking for the Nikon quality lenses this is not for you as you will feel the quality difference in the focus ring. However, if you can pay over $1000 for the Nikon you won't be looking at this anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it!","review":"I love these Wrebbit 3D puzzles and it's too bad that they've all been discontinued.

The wireless devices could connect to the Access Point, but they could not access the internet, due to what looked like a DNS service failure. The LAN features worked perfectly.My original Access Point is a DI-624 and that is my reference for a comparison. The wireless range on the DSL-G604T is better; although the connection speed is slower. There are many more advanced setup features on the DSL-G604T that I do not require; although I like the inclusion of the ADSL modem.If the wireless portion had worked, then my overall satisfaction would have been much better.

It has all of the elements of a standard fantasy story (a prophesy to be fulfilled, a villain with a secret past, a hero that ignores his destiny and then embraces it). However, instead of being formulaic, Clement-Davies uses these elements to build strong characters, powerful action sequences, and evocative settings that will linger with the reader. The vigorous writing makes it easy for readers to imagine themselves in the world that the author has created.This book would make a wonderful introduction to the fantasy field for a first-time reader of the genre. However, even long-time fantasy readers will find enjoyment reading this auspicious debut from Clement-Davies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Choking on \\"for\\"","review":"If you're picky about writing style or easily annoyed by authors' writing tics, you might want to read a chapter of this in the bookstore before you buy it. For you might get as annoyed as I did, and think you wasted your money if you buy this book.

Then you should read Fire Bringer.It all starts out when a fawn is born with an oak-leaf fawn mark on his forehead. This is the first sign of the Prophecy, an ancient legend about a deer who would end the wars between deer. His name is Rannoch and he's out to protect deer from Sgorr, a brutal lord among deer. Rannoch goes on a quest to find his inner self and find out more about the mysterious Prophecy. What will he discover about Sgorr and the Prophecy? You'll have to read Fire Bringer to find out.This book is very exciting the whole way through. Even though it's long, you won't want to stop reading it.

At first, Fire Bringer is confusing, but once you get into the book, it will be hard to break away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big B 10's review","review":"At first i thought this book was going to be corny as heck.

It's slow at first but after the first few pages it was the exact opposite. You might need to learn about deer first because there are some weird words like tines or something and there is no glossary.It is about deer and a prophecy and that's all I'll tell you because I might give something awayP.S.

I would recommend that if you enjoyed David Clement-Davies book, you should find Pierce's series and compare. The first book \\"Birth of the Firebringer\\" came out around 1987 if I am not mistaken. All the books have been reprinted since. While Clement-Davies Fire Bringer is an interesting read, you begin to look at it with suspicion after reading Pierce. \\"Fire Bringer\\" is still worth reading, especially if you like stories about deer, as I do.The Firebringer Trilogy (Birth of the Firebringer, Dark Moon, The Son of Summit Stars)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fire Bringer: No Burning Legacy","review":"Fire Bringer, written for children ages 9 to 12 will, most likely, be read by adults. The text is far too elaborate for a nine-year old (few will ever finish) and I give it two stars in that category. However, fantasy-loving adults may want to rate the book higher, with a 3 or 4. Fire Bringer has the right formula in a pantheon of strange and familiar beings, a hero with characterist honor and bravery and a dangerous quest. There is even the obligatory map.However, Clement-Davies could have improved the text and held the attention of readers of all ages by writing in the active tense. The book is agonizing to read in its past tense presentation. A change to the active would have made the book read faster and with a better sense of action. Fire Bringer's flame is diminished by its poor use of grammar. Only honest imagination spares the book from total burn-out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Possibly the best book i have ever read","review":"At the beginning the book may seem a little \\"weird\\" but as the story gets more and more dense you find yourself unable to leave the book.

I just didn't like this one. (there is a smaller plastic version that is just right for me) Hence, I can't recommend it for everyone. It arrives flat and you have to pull the tines apart, but they are strong and thick, so you won't break one.

This cd provides great arrangments, mainly by Dennis DiBlasio, and extend from funk, chant, latin, to hardcore bebop. The excitement picks up heavily on Coconut Champagne, one of my new favorite latin songs of all time. The song comes hard with an extremely exciting bari sax solo and an amazing drum solo by the always impressive greg bissonette. lush life provides a very maynard outlook on a slow and beautiful ballad. south 21st shuffle provides a nice little bluesy tune. the highlight of the entire cd for me is bebop buffet, with an variety of bebop songs put into one. the trombone solos provide some of the best sounding 'bones you might ever hear. and finally, the cd gives maynard and dennis a chance to sing on a hilarious, yet absolutely fun version of sunny side of the street. its too bad he didnt hit that one note on the song though. all in all, you should buy this albulm."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maynard Ferguson - Live in San Francisco","review":"I got this CD because the tape I had this album on had worn out!

The disco/studio recordings he made after Chameleon were just commercialized junk. I remember buying the albums as they came out and found myself being very disappointed. This Live from San Fran album reminds me of the great bands he had in the 1970's. This is probably one of the last recordings when Maynard used 2 bones and 3 saxophones. It was a joy to hear an MF \\"full-sized\\" band, again. Maynard's performance is strong. For some reason, this album reminds me of MF Horn 3."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great For Any MF FAN!!!!","review":"In my opinion, this is the best live recording of MF ever! It took place in the early 80's, right when Maynard was coming out of the disco series. All of the songs on this album are beautifully recorded and performed by Maynard and his best.Dennis DiBlasio plays his great Bari Sax on this like non other album that I have ever heard. COCONUT CHAMPAIGN is one of his greatest. BeBOP BUFFET has great sections of the most popular bebop songs of our time, including: A Night in Tunisia, Take the A Train, and Salt Peanuts. Denis also does an amazing scat part in this song.GANESHA is a great funk song from when Maynard was in India.Maynard does one of the best but weirdest versions of SUNNY SIDE OF THE STREET.Finally, LUSH LIFE is the coolest balad of Maynard's. It's get's really weird, really fast. He, of course, brings it back to baladness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Live From San Francisco","review":"This album has is all.

A familiar premise, but Dr. Mann touches on the emotional needs that often drive people to counter-productive actions. There is an emphasis on intervention and counseling that would apply more to HR staff than the average manager. There is risk in encouraging the avarage manager to try these techniques, especially when the case histories often describe manager/employee relationships that have \\"codependent\\" characteristics.

It reminds me of the IT guys I used to work with. Rather than just give a straight answer, they couch everything in a wordy overly descriptive soliloquy in order to seem important and smart. Because, of course, if you got any actual information out of them, they would lose a tiny bit of their power (or hit points). Seriously, the PMI took a relatively straightforward discipline such as Project Management and analyzed and 'decompressed' it until it seems deep and heavy - in order to appear more impressive and legitimate. Well, if all of these corporate giants buy into it, we have no choice but to learn it and live it.

This is the book for it (though now there is newer edition). Still undecided if I will pursue PMP, as it is a big time commitment, expensive to test, and also license renewal not cheap. Also not necessarily a benefit to my career or salary.The book seems more appropriate to a project manager in the electronics/software/industrial field, as many of the topics seem almost theoretical from my background in civil engineering. Studying for the PMP would require memorizing allot of this dribble from what I can tell, without necessarily making me a better engineer.So, I would not recommend this book unless you need to do the PMP. If you are in the civil field, as there are better assets out there, which you could use as reference in planning a project. Not this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't live with it - can't live without it!","review":"PMI has amassed, as they state in the title, quite a body of knowledge about project management. However, in the process they have built up their own stilted vocabulary which is only partly understandable, without considerable study, to others in project management. It is even less comprehensible on its own to those with a business education or to the public. This is a poor choice to learn about project management. It might be of some use in learning the PMI vocabulary in order to communicate with the rapidly growing segment of project management professionals who use it to communicate in a common language; however, there are much easier books that fulfill that objective. It is utterly necessary, but not sufficent, if pursuing PMP certification."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reading this book is slow and tedious","review":"I don't mean any insult to the PMI, but reading this book is slow and tedious.

Having some organized body to professionally certify project managers is a good idea. However, this book flat out stinks. It's incredibly wordy and makes simply concepts way too complex. That seems to be a major flaw with the entire PMI model. They are trying to make project management a science. It's not.That being said, the certification process is worth your time. I did learn a lot. Just don't become a \\"PMI Junkie\\". Let me explain. Many of the things PMI teaches are a bit silly and don't really apply to real life situations. There are some out there that just take what PMI says as the complete truth without questioning anything or seeing how the teachings relate to the workplace.

However, this latest version of the PMBOK(R) has moved from being a guide covering a wide variety of practices (reflecting the wide variety of projects and management processes) to a narrow one which is apparently required only to pass the PMI's PMP exam. In that regard it is essential as the exam is based on the book.It is not essential and is hardly a \\"bible\\" for any purpose other than passing the exam and with an absence of footnotes or bibliography it makes a poor guide to the real world of project management. I'm disappointed in the way a useful resource has been converted into something more appropriate for a cult or multi-level marketing association.PMI, bring back a bibliography, bring back alternative points of view, show some evidence about the efficacy of the procedures you have published.

The motor is very weak and turns the blades slowly. The build quality, shave and feel of this shaver is very much like one of those little travel shavers that runs on AA batteries. In fact I have one of those that gives a much better shave than this Norelco. This Norelco also will leave you with a face full of nicks and cuts. Avoid this shaver."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great razor","review":"We got this for our son-in-law as a Christmas gift and he said it was his favorite gift and just loves it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor shave, low battery life","review":"This is my second Norelco shaver. The first was purchased for about the same price about 12 years ago and worked well for its lifetime (it still works, but not well). The new Norelco 7110 is a big step down from that old model. It takes me a long time to shave (which means I mostly go around looking unshaven), requiring many passes over the same area, and the battery charge does not last more than one shave. By the time I've cleaned my face, the red \\"low\\" battery indicator is blinking. Also, and this is probably the worst change with respect to the older model, when the shaver is plugged in, it still runs off battery, meaning that if the battery is dead you can't shave for an hour even if it's plugged in! So a year after buying it, I'm in the market for a new shaver."},{"rating":"2","title":"Philips Norelco 7110X Cordless - its just OKAY","review":"This is my first time using a electronic shaver. 7110 is well priced(I paid less than 35$).Still cannot get a clean shave like a Gilette, But I like the fact that we can clean it under the tap with hot water.... Trimmer works good ....Like the grip...But I still prefer a clean Razor shave.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Value","review":"I have had the razor a couple of weeks and like it so far. It cuts closer that the electrics I have had before (albeit not as close as a blade). I was also surprised at how quiet it is. For the price I paid for it, I am very satisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great and inexpensive replacement shaver!","review":"I bought this as a replacement for my *old* Norelco. The 7110 is so quiet you sometimes can't even hear it, gentle on the skin (even right away, which some reviews have said was not the case), and easy to clean. The fact that you can rinse the heads and other parts without worrying about damaging the mechanism is a big time saver! All in all, for the money (a fraction of what I paid for the last Norelco I had), this is a great buy. There are more expensive Philips Norelco shavers out there, but unless they're going to brew you some coffee while still giving you the same great shave, I can't see spending the money...UNLESS 20-25 minutes of battery time isn't enough for you. The charger cord is unobtrusive, and easy to bring with, so it never bothers me that I only get 3-4 uses before it needs to be charged. The battery time is the only reason whatsoever this thing doesn't get 5 out of 5!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Philips Norelco 7110X Cordless, Rechargeable Shaving System","review":"This shaver has performed well for me, so far.

It provides a very good shave for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"works great ONLY for 3 weeks","review":"Well, I bought it to replace a Remington shaver which I had for 18 months and was leaving red marks on my neck (it needed new blades which were almost same price as a new shaver).Anyway, I got a \\"Philips Norelco 7110X\\" and it worked great and quite for first 3 weeks then started to be not so comfortable and today after only one month it shaves as bad as my older shaver was doing after one year!!

Requires multiple passovers and often pricks a few hairs in the process. Battery life is not very good as well.

I took out the heads and placed it in my 4 year old shaver and its been great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Seriously Defective Shaver","review":"I bought this shaver four years at my local Target and, after a few months, I stopped using this shaver. For one thing, this shaver creates an uncomfortable and prickly shave. It just hurts the skin. Another major pain is recharging the shaver. It can takes several hours to recharge the Philips Norelco 7110X Shaver but after twenty minutes of shaving the charge starts flicking a red light which means \\"low.\\" It's inefficient, uncomfortable, and takes several hours to recharge. The Philips Norelco 7110 is a seriously defective Shaver. I've had much better results and more comfortable shaving with the generic razors I find at my local Dollar Tree than this way overpriced electric razor."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for (even in a razor)","review":"If you like plugging in your shaver constantly, this is the device for you. I purchased this a little while ago and have been using it for about 2 months. It looks nice, but really only lasts about 10-15 min of shaving before you get the red flashing \\"charge me\\" indicator. Even when it is fully charged, it doesn't seem that powerful. I find myself going over an area over and over again and then just getting a regular razor to get the job done.Pros:Easy to turn on and off, simply press a button.Looks good and when it works, it does a decent job.Cons:Lasts only 10-15 min max before you have to plug it in overnight to charge.Does do as good of job as I thought it would actually shaving.Recommendation:Save you money and buy a better shaver. If if you can't afford something nicer, a bag of disposable razors will do a better job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Norelco (I've owned) in 30 years","review":"I've been using Norelcos since I started shaving and this is by far the worst one I've ever owned. My first two lasted the first 20 years and over the last 10 years I've probably had 3 or 4. Quality definitely going downhill. It seems that long-term users in general are fed up with the latest Norelcos and haven't decide what to replace it with yet.

After charging the battery, before first use, for the required 8 hours, and an 8 hour recharging every second/third day since then, I cannot get a shave for up to the indicated 25 minutes of shave time. The \\"low\\" battery indicator ALWAYS comes on the second or third time I shave. I am going to keep trying but I think the total shave time is certainly less than the 25 minutes indicated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Battery doesn't keep charge","review":"I am very disappointed with my new Philips Norelco 7110x. Its battery is too small and requires frequent charging. According to Philips customer service, the battery can hold a maximum charge of 25 minutes. If it takes 5 minutes to shave....a person would need to recharge every 5 days. This is way too frequent and a hassle. My older Philips shaver required recharging every 3-4 weeks! NOT every 5 days. I'm very very disappointed with this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor AC Charging; Excellent With Optional 12 Volt Charger","review":"RAZOR CANNOT BE POWERED BY CORD. Battery must be charged in order for razor to operate. Cord is stiff, and not a spring. Batteries never fully charged with the AC charger included.

But this model is hardly useable with its AC charger.However, it is excellent when used with the 12 volt charger, available separately."},{"rating":"1","title":"This shaver is cheap but has a very weak power.","review":"This shaver is cheap but has a very weak power.

Instead of buying new blades, I decided the 'new' shave system might be worth the difference. I went from a good shaver that lasts 4-5 months per charge to a good shaver that lasts a week to 10 days per charge. It did shave any better than the old one I had.I don't know yet if this is indicative of all new Norelco shavers or just this model, but I would have returned it if I could have. I would not recommend this model."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sucks","review":"I bought this product because I was only able to wet shave once a week without getting a lot of bleeding or irritation.

Shaving the neck is a hassle, and you must pass it over it many times. I would not recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Facial Use Only!","review":"First off, you shouldn't be shaving anything but your face with this razor. Norelco's older models seem to be heavier and have more powerful motors; this thing is more like those old electric lawnmowers that couldn't cut grass more than 1/2\\" high. It gives a middling shave on face and neck, but it certainly can't handle the forest around the Great Oak Tree, if you know what I mean. It also won't do armpits or backs or legs very well.I'd go with an older model that is heavier and seems to have a more powerful motor. You'll need it to clearcut your axillary forest."},{"rating":"1","title":"No such model?","review":"I spoke to Norelco on what this model might be and they stated emphatically, that there is no such model as the 7110XL. Strange."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great shaver!","review":"I gave this shaver to my son. He was using my husband's shaver, which is an older model Norelco. I thought he should have his own Norelco because they had to run to two different bathrooms to get it. My husband has always owned Norelco shavers. He still has his first one from the 60's. My own Dad also owned only Norelco shavers. They always give great shaves and the Norelco tradition continues through my own family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well for me, 4 years later","review":"It's been over 4 years since I bought this razor and it still works great. I bother to shave about three times a week, so I can't attest to daily usage, but for a simple model electric razor it is sufficient. It is a handy feature to be able to flush out the razor under the tap and just let it dry during the day. If this one broke I'd buy another."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre at best","review":"I've owned other Norelco shavers and this one might be my last; The cons outweigh the pros. Given the price, I expect a better performer. I'm searching for a new razor instead of buying replacement blades.Pros:1. Lightweight (see con #1)2. Rinsable bladesCons1. Wall wort makes it cumbersome to travel with, and you'll have to because...2. Battery life seems much shorter than advertised, which is a problem because...3. The shave isn't very close so you'll spend more time shaving.Your morning routine deserves better."},{"rating":"1","title":"For good performance, look elsewhere...","review":"After 10 years, my trusty old Norelco died. Thinking all electric razors were the same, I replaced it with the cheapest model in the store- I've learned my lesson. Positives: holds a charge, eventually gives you a close shave, and easy to clean. Negative (dealbreaker for me): it consistently takes at least 3 to 5 passes (if not more) to get most of the hairs, and even then, there are usually some stragglers. My old razor spoiled me- it generally took only one pass. With the 7110x, you can go over a giant hair over and over, and it'll miss it every time and then randomly catch it on the 5th pass. If you're on a tight budget & can get a good deal on it, and if you don't get frustrated by spending a lot of time shaving the same areas over and over, then this will work for you. Personally, I now realize that all razors are not created equal, and I'll soon be replacing this with a more expensive model that doesn't take 10 minutes per shave."},{"rating":"1","title":"Butcher!","review":"I tried and tried to use this product.

I must have gotten a rotten apple because I only get maybe, at the most, 5 minutes of shave time before the red light comes on. I charge the battery for much longer than the stated 8 hours and it still won't hold the charge for long. Just tried Norelco's online \\"live\\" customer support to find out how to return for service/replacement and the agents are 1) not very knowledgeable, and 2) unable to stay connected with me for more than a couple minutes. So far, a waste of 25 bucks, but at least it was only 25 bucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor shave quality and slow going","review":"This is the third Norelco shaver I've owned. The first two gave an excellent, close, even shave and the charge lasted several weeks. On my last vacation I forgot the charging cord and it turned on in my suitcase so I ended up having to buy a new one, and this was the only one I could find. On the positive side the unit is light, holds a charge for a reasonably long time and is easy to clean. Unfortunately it does a poor job as a razor. It leaves a lot of long stray whiskers (especially under my nose) that I have to go back over from multiple directions to remove and this causes it to take much longer to shave and ends up irritating my skin. I'm finally getting rid of this piece of junk today and I'm going to buy a different electric razor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Comprop","review":"This item is well made and fits a Honda 50 well.

This mouse has been to 11 states, been connected to 20+ computers, been used on dozens and dozens of different surfaces, and has worked nearly flawlessly on every one.The only downside of getting attached to a mouse like this one is that once you've really gotten used to it, you tend not to like anything else anymore. :-P I'm not even sure where this mouse came from to be honest but I've turned it down against several other very advanced and expensive \\"gaming mice.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Steve McQueen?

The 4th movement sounds good, but no more better than Bernstein's. Bernstein 4 - The 4th movement sounded very exciting, compared to Ormandy's.

If you don't mind awful recording technology and a horrible recording hall (a hotel ballroom, I believe), then you might like this CD. The pieces are of course, superb, and the performances are not horrible. The sound quality just kills this CD, though. It's really horrific - scratchy, noisy, with horrible presence and a mix that is far, far too bright. I literally had to turn the treble all the way down on my stereo. My advice: get the Chicago Symphony version of Pines and Fountains (with Reiner - and get their Pictures at an Exhibition while you're at it) and the Cincinnati Symphony version of Roman Festivals (with Lopez-Cobos). Those are really excellent albums, with both excellent playing and excellent recording."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spoiler Alert","review":"Other than the different commentary track the only difference in the special edition is that after Myron wakes up the footage is in Black and White , as in \\" I do believe we are back from OZ\\" as the director intended.Apparrently the studio insisted all the new footage be in color for the theatrical release"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Campy Desecration of Cinema","review":"Mae West came out of retirement for THIS? \\"Myra Breckinridge\\" (1970) has something to offend everyone - particularly classic film aficionados.

Football hero Austin tries everything he knows to feel better, including hooking up with the beautiful Heather, but he can't shake the nothingness he feels, and it nearly destroys him. I was especially impressed by the book's refusal to bow to typical bibliotherapy answers; Austin doesn't consult a professional or even tell his best friend how he's feeling. Most teens wouldn't, either. DAMAGE tells it like it is, and in so doing, gives readers a way to understand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow! This was a very good book. It had a good structure","review":"It was about a 18-year old boy named Austin Reid that was the star of the football team. He loves this girl named Heather who is supposedly the best looking girl in Texas to the boys at her school and her and Austin hook up. At the beginning they had a very good relationship. Then something happened to the relationship that will change their own future.The part I liked was the way he was a good football player, had friends, and kind of related to real life. I also like how sometimes him and Heather really liked each other and in other times they hated each other. I liked that it wasn't a love story like it sounded. The thing I didn't like about it was how they went from not even knowing eachother to making out. I think it would have been a better book if they would have built up to their relationship.That was about the only thing I didn't like. Other than that it was a great book and I didn't want to put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"A great book that tells the reality of how even a normal popular guy or girl can suffer from depression. It gives you a great feel for the character Austin and how he is feeling throughout the book. Kept me reading from start to end and was hard to put down. Was a great book for a teenage male for it has the two best things in the world, girls and football. The book also gives a normal person a great feel for what a depressed person feels like and how life is for them. And finally the book has an awesome ending and doesn't tell how Austin fixes his problem with depression.

I was skeptical at first that this wouldn't be anything more than a highlight reel but I quickly found out that's not true. Planet B-Boy delves into the subculture of b-boying (breakdancing) and shows that it's not only a hobby, it's a lifestyle. It follows crews from all over the world who are brought together by the love of expression by means of \\"B-Boying\\" and ultimately to the \\"World Series\\" of B-boying, \\"The Battle of the Year\\" which is an International competition featuring the best dance crews in the world. It is absolutely amazing to see these people defy the laws of gravity and do the physically impossible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie. Great gift.","review":"I first saw Planet B-Boy in the theater when it came to L.A., on its first day. My son breakdances, it came out shortly after Step Up 2, and I thought it seemed like an indie film worth supporting. It was so much more. For people who are really into this, the heart of the dancers on the teams is completely inspiring. So are their moves. So is the worldwide influence of what started as streetdancing in the U.S. The archival footage is great as well.The physicality of the moves in this movie really is like being taken to school. The different flavors and styles of the teams provoke all kinds of choreography thoughts. The music is fantastic, and it all comes together. As soon as I knew it was out on DVD, I bought one copy for myself and one copy for a hiphop/rap/breakdancing fan at work. This movie has so much love of dance. If you have a heart for this kind of expression, you'll feel it too."},{"rating":"2","title":"I gotta get this!","review":"I heard this was really good.

As a 33 year old only child, I too identified with many of the comments and situations related by the interviewees. It was a relief to find out that not only were my responses to life 'normal' but they were shared by many others. Some of their comments were word for word statements of things I had myself said in the past.This book gives a very good insight into how only children respond and react to their envirnonment and how this may differ from those who were raised with siblings. While it may be lacking a little in practical information for parents and partners of only children, (although there are chapters dealing with this), it is nevertheless an excellent study of the experiences of only children and is highly recommended reading for any only child and those wanting to understand how they 'tick'."},{"rating":"2","title":"early wolk of pizzicato five","review":"produced by konishi yasuharu....cool coolsound..up dated jazz.....hard to find cd"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent illustrations (true DK quality); Large format","review":"The quality of the book is in keeping with other DK publications (the eyewitness guides, etc.).

It can bring in those small flowers and insects if used with a zoom lens not designed for macro work.

I had high hopes for these because of the positive reviews, but, unfortunately, they are the worst I've ever tried. To date, I've used 6 of them (in the \\"20-pak\\" I bought), and all six were very disappointing. After 40 minutes, they got mildly lukewarm and then they cooled down totally after 3 hours. They're worthless. I don't expect hand warmers to get so hot that they burn my skin, but I do expect them to radiate enough heat to warm up my frozen fingers. And they don't. (As an afterthought, I reread the most positive reviews to see why they had convinced me to buy this product and I realized that they are so inaccurate and sound so much like advertising copy that they were probably written by a company shill). I urge you to save your money and buy another product that works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome remixes","review":"Putting Echo Image first on this compilation only gives you a taste of what's to come.

Expanding on these already built-for-the-dancefloor tracks (anthem is the right word here; these tracks fill the fill in their non-remixed form), these mixes take you deeper into the sound; these selections can merge seamlessly with the other urban electronic works that fill today's eclectic dancefloor. I think the idea here is diversity. There's a world beyond the 1980's synth sound. The synthpop universe is expanding, encompassing elements of trance, break-beat and drum and bass.This CD is a worthy purchase for the fact that most tracks are an excellent reference point for exploring today's best synthpop acts. With top-notch acts like Iris, Wave In Head, Neuroactive and Echo Image there is almost no chance for error. All these artists have a golden touch and it shows here! Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheesiness not required...","review":"Contrary to popular belief, and the first reviewer, the modern synthpop scene doesn't need cheesiness. This collection not only showcases some of the best bands on the current scene, but also allows them to remix each others songs.This collection also has a bit of an international scene as bands are from the US, England, Germany and Scandanavia. I'm familiar with all the bands on here bar System 22, and that will have to be rectified shortly.Songs to be recommended in particular : Autumn Leaf - Merge, Emptiness Your Loneliness - Sweep, and Spellbound - Moulin Noir.No cheesiness here, if that's your bag then dig out an 80's compilation (and I have more than enough of those myself)."},{"rating":"2","title":"makes you sit up and take notice!","review":"I'm not normally into remixes or compilations, but I recently picked this album up and am very pleased with it. I was already a fan of several of the groups on the compilation and figured I'd get to try some new stuff too at a good price. I thought that the Moulin Noir, Neuropa, and Neuroactive remixes were great, and I really liked some of the stuff that I'd never heard before as well like Wave in Head and Kaj. Normally long remixes tend to get on my nerves a bit, but these didn't. Many of them made the songs more interesting and cooler while staying true to what made the songs cool in the first place (normally i think that remixes tend to make songs long and drawn out and take away a lot of what i thought was cool about the songs).I definitely recommend it, if you already know some or all of the groups, or if you're looking to expand with some great uptempo synthpop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring boring boring","review":"I bought this hoping to find some good, retro synthpop that would be equal to, or better than, the music that I loved in the 80's. It's hugely disappointing, utterly soulless, and mind bogglingly boring. Most of the tracks suffer from the same fate that kills most dance remixes- a mediocre song is stretched from a harmless 3 minutes into a monotonous, repetitive 6 minute bore, with no sense of timimg, structure or joy. Even a bad Depeche Mode or OMD album is more enjoyable than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"A VERY bad idea.","review":"The poblem with (and the glory of) synthpop is that it is, on the whole, extremely cheesy. In its \\"natural\\" form, that can be a very good thing. Just ask Human League, OMD, or even Soviet. Unfortunately, dance remixes of cheesy music run the risk of veering from guilty, ironic fun to just plain stupid. That is certainly the case here. These are quite simply some of the most predictable, rehashed, exhausted progressive trance tracks I've heard in a long time. Each and every song has had the \\"synth\\" and the \\"pop\\" surgically removed in favor of the big-floor crap they play when I go to get my hair cut. Fans of synthpop, 80s music, and electroclash beware: this stuff caters to the lowest common denominator. I want my [money] back."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Quite Good Idea Actually,","review":"It is no secret that synthpop is one of those genres that gets stuck into a corner- not rock enough to the alt crowd, not \\"adult\\" enough for the Norah Jones crowd. Plus the fact that most of the music is \\"machine\\" driven further forces synthpop bands into a corner.But by trying to invade a little acre of clubland synthpop has been able to stake out its own piece of the pie. Ok, enough with the metaphors. Here's the review-Gotta love the Moulin Noir \\"Spellbound\\" mix, exciting, new wave flavoured (with a \\"u\\") dance pop.\\"Vast\\" by New Clear Sky is a great song and the mix here just adds a cool ebm'ish feel. Same for Sweep, a great song that gets a harder edge.In fact really all of the mixes here are truly club ready. If that takes them out of traditional 80s style synthpop, so be it. At least it breaths fresh air into the brain-dead club music one hears so often at 1 a.m."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable, accessable synth-pop for the modern dance floor","review":"I enjoyed this collection of songs and appreciated the dance floor slant applied to the mixes. As a DJ, the hard thing about spinning most modern synth-pop is finding a good place to play it that doesn't interupt the flow of a strong set. Usually this means relegating new synth-pop tunes to an early or late playing when the crowd isn't really into the full swing yet or is too tired to appreciate something new. This collection of songs has made it possible to include the synth-poppy stuff in with the more dance floor accessable EBM and Industrial styles and I think it's a great synth-pop introduction for fans of those genres. Granted, it's not traditional synth-pop and leaves a lot of the \\"cheese\\" factor off the dance floor, but this collection definitely lives up to its billing as dance floor synth-pop for the uninitiated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Modern Synthpop meets the dancefloor","review":"I have frequently listened to this CD and I must say that If you are looking for the old synthpop from the beggining of the 80s this CD is not for you. The modern synthpop music is always evolving and getting different forms and as the tittle says \\"Synthpop Club Anthems\\" takes a club aprroach of the modern synthpop music. This CD is ready for the dancefloor!!!If you would like to get a taste of the modern synthpop in its original form listen to the original versions of the tracks. The Albums and singles of the bands are available here at Amazon (I suggest the single \\"Wonders of the World\\" from Neuroactive).This CD confirms that The ADifferentDrum american label is making a great job keeping the synthpop style alive thru all this years. ADD is bringing to us the real quality electronic pop dance music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good dancing fun!","review":"Ah, the old days. Days when we'd all put on our best faerie boots, make our hair REALLY BIG, and go out dancing all night.Does this album specifically remind me of those times? Well, no, because all of these bands are new. But it certainly reminds me of the spirit, of the fun we had figuring out which 12\\" mix of \\"Hit That Perfect Beat\\" was the best, and of the way I felt when I found something new.As for the specific songs on here, well, they're all quite good. My favorites, particularly, are \\"Vast\\" (New Clear Sky), \\"Until You Say You Are\\" (System22, and I must add that this is really the best mix of it available), and \\"SKYInverted\\" (Blue October).Now if you'll excuse me, I have to go wash the dishes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent synthpop/electronic compilation!","review":"The numerous various artist compilations that have been released on A Different Drum since 1996 are among the best compilations in the synthpop/electronic genre. Synthpop Club Anthems is, in my opinion, the best compilation the label has released to date. This is an excellent collection of remixes, representing some of the finest synthpop bands out there (Neuroactive, Echoing Green, Wave in Head, Iris, and System22 are personal favorites). There is not a weak track on here.

Since the classic bands like The Nine, Cosmicity, Neuroactive, The Echoing Green to the newcomers like Echo Image, Sweep,Merge, New Clear Sky, etc, we can see that the future of the synthpop music is brilliant.I know they have the 80's New Wave music influencies, but you can listen a lot of improvisated inspirations that show you a new kind of sound and mood of the synthpop music.Let's enjoy it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Collection!","review":"Overall, a solid collection of synthpop songs that fit nicely in the club music genre. I must disagree with the \\"one star rating\\". This is not cheesy music. It is of very high quality sound and composition...but obviously not for the masses. If it was, A Different Drum would be licensing some of the \\"Club Anthem Junk\\" that abounds at your local music store. Although I don't enjoy every track here (Mesh & System 22), and feel a better title would have suited this release (Club Anthem speaks of something completely different to me such as those repetitive-style dance mixes of old Whiteney Houston and Bonnie Tyler songs that show up on \\"Thunderpuss\\" & \\"Club 69\\" compilations), I highly recommend it. Wave In Head, Echo Image, Sweep, Moulin Noir are worth the price of entry alone.

Standard cushions did nothing, and a gel cushion burst open and ruined a chair seat. When I was looking at a similar foam mattress, I found this thing, and it truly allows me to sit still for an hour or even two,in comfort, and I can sit in my chair for as much as 4 hours at a time, in increasing discomfort. I can even go to volley ball games and sit in the bleachers. Its not that it is so great, its that everything else is so useless.Worth every penny. I have been using it for almost 4 years now. Still looks good, though the vinyl on the bottom seems to be receiving some visible wear, where it is folded over the bottom of hard chair surfaces.The top surface is completely unaffected by years of use, in spite of my weight. Even wooden chairs do not have that good a record."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty and unique Sajen pendant....","review":"I had been looking at carved face pendant for a while when I came across this one. I just get it a couple days ago and I am pleased with it. The face is so beautifully carved and has the most serene expression. The overall size is about an inch from the tube shaped bail to the bottom edge. Dainty but unique. It is solidly set in sterling silver, and even though it is a smaller piece it has some weight to it. It comes with a great versatile snake chain, but you could change it to many other styles since the bail is so large. I love Sajen's jewelry and hope that Amazon brings in more of their jewelry!

As I began reading the series over a decade ago, it was so helpful to have a guide to flip back to when I came across something I did not remember or understand. My only recommendation is that you not read this until you have read the first 4 books - there is too much info and it will ruin the surprises.That being said, it is definitely worth re-reading the books, if only to recapture the magic that is The Dark Tower, and this book becomes indispensable when doing that.

I mean, the last 3 books were written as if Stephen King threw in whatever ridiculous thought popped into his mind, so maybe we do need this to explain what the hell he was thinking! One reviewer wrote in his review that this book is NEEDED, not something that you just want, so I guess I may be on the right track after all. Now that I look closer, I see that this lofty Concordance was published in 2003, which means that it only focuses on the 1st 4 books. Ah, the good old days, when the Dark Tower series seemed so good and before King's creativity was knocked out of his head when he was hit by a van. It's true, you know - just compare the 1st four books to the last three and you'll se what I mean!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A complete waste of time","review":"This book gave me absolutely no insight into the Dark Tower mystery nor was it helpful in understanding what the truth is about why Roland hangs around with drug addicts, crippled schizophrenics, vampire nurses, and riddle speaking monorails.I wish and pray that someday all these secrets will be answered for me, but unfortunately this book does nothing of the sort!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Audio Edition Needed.","review":"I have not read the book but I have read all of the reviews.

I have a feeling it will meet all goals - will fit a toothbrush/toothpaste, a myriad of travel-sized bottles and a washcloth. Dries quickly. I like the divided compartments.This might be good to use as a dorm shower caddy if there is a protected place to hang while drying. To give a rough idea of size, I fit 5-6 regular-sized shampoo bottles in this with a little bit of extra room to slide toothpaste, toothbrush, and some little extras."},{"rating":"2","title":"good bathroom organizer","review":"Perfect for all my shower stuff.

The mesh body keeps everything breathable and dries quickly. Soft handle makes this caddy easy to carry around. When not in use, it folds completely down with a small tie-back to hold in place.

To someone who hasn't seen the original mirrors, these look totally normal, and they look totally normal to me now (it took a few days). They are convex and they give me a wider field of view, which is great, because now I can see all the way behind me to right where my vision would pick up a car next to me. I feel much safer now, which makes riding more enjoyable, all for a very small investment (much better pricing than the same mirrors sold by others).

MacIntyre brought not only the characters to life with flowing descriptions and actions, but also the town itself. While the town was not on the front line, it was near enough to it to see the horrors of war. The mystery of who killed Robert Digby is answered in the end, but it is the middle that is most satisfying, details of his love affair, and the ability of British soldiers to blend into rural France.

One wonders whether she was aware of what was to come. As for this recording, I can say that (to my ears of course) Lucia Popp is the only soprano who could do justice to Strauss's Four Last Songs (and I've listened to Janowitz, Fleming, Kanawa, Auger, Schwarzkopf, and other more acclaimed recordings). Her rich yet clear timbre fits these songs like a glove. Her voice is both beautifully unique and uniquely beautiful. Michael Tilson Thomas's conducting is also a great asset -- it's good to see someone interpreting Strauss without any post-modern sentimentality (or \\"cheesiness\\" if you will) that ruins so many interpretations of the composer's music. The other songs on the disc are performed quite well (though without the timbre and musicality of Popp). The Op. 68 Lieder are gems in their own right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Original Recordings","review":"Although this is the original Temperance Seven, the recordings are not the original ones which made the group famous.

In this book Greidanus gives the preacher what is essentially a handbook on how to handle the various biblical genres. I feel the book is more suited to be used as a reference rather than a book you would read through and let sit. Although at times, the book felt repetitive and seemed to be a collection of parts rather than a fluid text, the book remains both insightful and useful to the modern preacher. There were numerous times where Greinadus' insights opened up biblical passages I had previously scanned over.Overall this work will prove to be useful to biblical preachers everywhere and even the established student of the Bible should take something new away from it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Be Rich","review":"This is a wonderful, well written book on how to make the necessary changes in your life to \\"Be Rich\\"!

I've listened to several, and I keep coming back to this old-but-timeless gem, which, every time I hear it, takes me back to attending a performance with Kurt Masur and the Leipzig Gewandhaus orchestra, when the 2nd movement of Symphony 9 took my breath away, that awesome introduction with the cellos and basses. What a pity Schubert died so young!This disc would be great for any collection - someone new to classical will become a Schubert fan for keeps, and for someone who already has a recording of symphonies 8 and 9, find more room on the shelf for this one, since it \\"cleaned up\\" beautifully in the remastering and sounds as fresh as paint."},{"rating":"2","title":"El Supremo","review":"These are the versions that initially won me over to these symphonies.

I first heard the First Movement of the Unfinished Symphony when I played it in my high school band. I've been in love with it ever since.I enjoy reading these reviews, but I'm not as concerned about the nuances of the sound or the style of the conductors or the other issues being discussed here. This is what I do know: I paid for the 8th Symphony and got a CD with an abridged First Movement. There is nothing about this on the CD packaging or the web page. Maybe it doesn't matter and I'm overreacting - the quality of the music is very good and the price is low - but I would prefer to know in advance if any work is abridged."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This is an excellent CD.

Here as in his other works he begins with a straightforward concern -- in this case, spiritual fatherhood in Evagrius' writings. He then procedes to explore the writings of Evagrius, which he has obviously contemplated for some time. As the study progresses, he teases out the importance of direction in spiritual life and describes the goal of Christian 'gnosis'. This last bit is particularly worth attention, since somehow the peculiar habit has spread of thinking of 'gnosis' in terms of repressed heresies, Oriental exotica and the like. But of course 'gnosis' was of interest to all sorts of people in the ancient world and it is the signal merit of this gracious little book that it reasserts the claim on 'gnosis' of mainstream Christianity, in Evagrius' time and in ours."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty cool and interesting; may or may not actually be true.","review":"I actually read this book a long time ago and just recently bought a copy for a friend.I found the stories interesting and thought it gave an interesting look into the world of soldiers for hire.

We used it one time and it worked fairly well. The only issue was that it would blow around with just a slight breeze. This was partially my fault due to the fact that we were using it on a pool deck and didn't have an area to anchor the stakes into the ground. I knew this may be an issue but still purchased the screen. However, my real issue revolved around the second time I took the movie screen out of the box and it failed to fully inflate. We still have not been able to get it to work and I am going to return this product. I am going to purchase a fixed screen that is not inflatable and I would recommend the same for anyone else looking for a movie screen. * Vantage Resort Realty * www.VantageOceanCity.com"},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective construction","review":"Same experience as the other reviewer. I bought the mirrored cabinet for my remodel to give it a high-end, finished look. Everything was fine until the front mirror started to slip off the frame.

Thin strips of double-sided tape and a few dabs of glue are all the hold the mirror in place. Since they only offer a one-year warranty (gee, I wonder why) I had to fix it myself. A bottle of gorilla glue and some clamps seemed to have done the trick. Let's see if that holds. In the meantime, I am very dissappointed with the quality of the workmanship. Unfortunately, in this case, spending more did not result in getting a better product.

If you haven't used inheritance before (VB6 doesn't have it), you may find yourself saying \\"I understand what I can do and how to do it.

The shaver is also easy to clean using either wet or dry methods.The only complaint I have about the shaver is that no traveling case/pouch holder comes with it to hold the cord,shaver and cleaning brush. Just make sure you keep your old case holder from your previously owned shaver(s). Only time will tell on how this model will hold up. My 4 previous Norelcos have averaged around 5-6 years each."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still a Norelco","review":"As expected, the new 7180XL razor delivers a close and comfortable electric shave, even though it runs much slower than earlier models.

About 1 month later, I was tapping the razor on the sink to shake out the shavings and the battery (I assume) was knocked out of position. The shaver stopped working. They sent a new one. About 1 month later, the shaver just stopped working for no known reason. They sent a new one. The new one has worked 6+ months. This week, it just stopped working.Up until now, I have had nothing but great experiences with Norelco. I'm sure if I asked for a new razor, they'd give me one. I'm just tired of having them break.

It's true that you won't get as close a shave as you would with the standard cream and razor method, but the time you save (takes me around 3 minutes to get a GOOD shave) and irritation that will become nearly nilled makes this a great buy.

I have had it about 2 yrs. as compared to the others I have owned and all of the others have lasted longer. I went to buy replacement heads and it was over $31 dollars.

Shredders are messy beasts, and the wheels on this one make it easier to wheel it out of the way to clean up around it. It's no larger than others I've used and fits neatly beside my desk. Good controls, good documentation. So far I've filled three 33-gallon trash bags with shredded documents that I've been dragging around for years, and the shredder hasn't shown any signs of strain. Buy the extra oil (12 oz) and use it to refill the tiny oil container that comes with the shredder; the tiny oil container is easier to use on the shredder than the larger container.One objection: It STINKS when it arrives. Had to close off the room and open the windows. Stink went away, mostly, after a few uses. No longer a problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Induction motor makes the difference here, folks.","review":"In the world of electric motors, the induction motor design is excellent for reliability and power (but not for size and weight).

But her book was not of great interest to a reader who was aware of Blount's peculiar nature and interest in art. It is difficult to understand how Blount or his friends, seemed completly oblivious of politics as Carter has laid out. Unless she is making the case that Blount was the perfect mole - at all times on guard against exposure. But I don't think she is trying to make that case.Carter gives us a blur of names, quotes, and a failure to find mention of expected comments in corresspondence such as the passing of Blount's father. It may be Carter's intention to show Blount's world as an extremely focused life which was hardly influenced by outside events; such as the end of World War One and the rise of Communism. I suspect Carter is trying to explain Blount as a Good Boy Who Does Bad Things."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a man to know . . .","review":"The book is well-written, but Blunt and his circle are very\\"precious\\" in their interests and relationships.

So, if you have to get a digital-analog coverter box, I'd advise getting a digital antenna as well, if you are now using rabbit ears.

For starters, this unit doesn't need to be plugged in to an AC outlet, which is a definite plus.It worked with all channels that we could at least pick up on the old antenna, and did so without snow in the picture, no black and white channels, and increased the signal strength of the ATSC broadcasts in our area.I recommend placing this antenna as high as you can in the room, and if you know the direction of your station, align it.

I could pick up a few of the DC channels and a few of the Baltimore channels, but needed to do lots of fine tuning in order to change the channel. So I bought this Philips HD antenna. With the Philips connected to the Digital-to-Analog conveter, I got NO reception of any channels. I don't think I could ever even get above 5% (at least 20 - 30% seems to be required for even a stuttering HD picture). I returned the Philips, and got a powered Terk instead, which works great (80%+ on some channels).Unless you're in a perfect location for HD reception, I can't recommend this product at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best HDTV antenna for UHF","review":"I have never written a review on any product. This product works so good for so cheap it compelled me to do so. First off I tried 2 other antennas before ordering this cheap little antenna. I could not get a consistent single with either antenna. My signal meter on the TV would read up and down from 60-70 % until I bought this antenna and then a consistent 80-90 % just like that. It is best to make sure it is pointed in the correct position but after that you are home free. So this little antenna not amplified gave me a consistent 20 % better signal then any other antenna I've tried. Location Austin, Tx.

It works great providing you point it the right direction. Once I had it pointed perfectly, I get all stations without further adjustment. And I never realized that many TV station had digital \\"sub stations\\" until now. For example, my local PBS station (channel 8) has a total of 4 channels (8.1, 8.2, 8.3, and 8.4), each with different programming. Some of the other channels do similarly.

He appears to be using the same formula for creating his lyrics and the tracks all sound similar and like something from previous albums all at the same time.

He is for sure a living wonder and it's amazing that he just keeps on going writing great songs.As always with Babyface and he's productions, it is music for any kind of mood.

Babyface has still got it. He can still sing his head off, he can still tear up an acoustic guitar, and he can still make seductive love songs. Period. This album is very contemporary, and I think that it is an album that can appeal to everyone. True, teens probably won't go and buy the new Babyface album, but it is contemporary enough to fit into today's market with the likes of R&B crooners Brian McKnight and the late Luther Vandross (via DANCE WITH MY FATHER, a very successful album). My favorite tracks are \\"Tonight It's Going Down\\", \\"Grown & Sexy\\", \\"Mad, Sexy, Cool\\", \\"Can't Stop Now\\", \\"Goin' Outta Business\\", \\"Sorry For The Stupid Things\\", and \\"God Must Love You\\".Overall, the album is pretty consistent up until the end where the tracks straddle the line between ok tracks and filler material.

I have heard just about everthing he has produced, including the unreleased music. After reading some of the reviews, it is obvious to me that some of the listeners would prefer to have Babyface write songs from the 80's and 90's. We must understand that R&B has changed and it is refreshing to see that he has adapted quite nicely. This is Babyface's best CD from beginning to end. It's not often that you find a CD that you can play all the way through and enjoy every song. Some of the songs have more of a sexual content than in previous releases, but I guess that explains the Album Title \\"Grown & Sexy\\".

Now ok, I have to admit, I've never been an avid Babyface fan, so I really can't judge some of you that have been there from day one and are able to compare this and that; however, I think Babyface deserves much more credit. Come on the man is Grown and Sexy, no doubt. Coming from a 19 year-old, I think it's safe to say that this album can appeal to my generation as well. My friends I recently had our own listening party, and while I have been called the \\"Ol' Head\\" of the bunch, my friends are another story! Needless to say, in the end, everyone was hooked!

He continues to write the most romantic songs. This album is quite a tear jerker, in both positive and negative aspects. One song, he dedicates to the mother of his child and it brings tears to my eyes every time I listen to it. Then there are the songs in which he tells it like it is about men (about why they are, and do the things they do). But nonetheless it is a very emotional album.

If you were ever looking for the perfect break up song, \\"Goin' Outta Business\\" has to be it. \\"Drama, Love & 'Lationships\\" is a roadmap on dealing with the ups and downs of a relationship.For those having problems coming up with words to apologize, just play \\"Sorry for the Stupid Things\\" to your mate and they shouldn't have any problems forgiving you.

I will probably only buy B+W in the future.A personal opinion: If you are like me and won't use it much, consider which cross star would best meet your needs (4x, 6x, or 8x).

A gun fighter and a semi-nun, supposedly half brother and sister. He loves her very much from the beginning it seems, but not in a brotherly way. She is confused about how she feels, not sure if its sisterly love or a love a woman feels for a man. It is really funny, not to give some of the story away but I thought the part when he's undressing her to put her to bed and isn't sure if he should take off everthing or not, it goes from there to her waking up naked and thinking the maid must have done it, anyway she soon finds out how it really was and gets furious and losses her religion to curses she throws at Jake. This was my first book of Catherines' but I do believe I'm hooked. Can't wait to start my collection of the rest. I recommend this book, it will have you crying, laughing out loud and in love with both the characters. I truly enjoyed it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read","review":"Depite being written in the eighties, this is still a very good book. It had humor, action, and of course, romance. Jake was a strong hero. He became an outlaw after his sister and her family were needlessly killed. And Tori was a very interesting heroine for him. Not only was she a nun, but also his half sister. There were a lot of memorable scenes in this book. I especially like the way they were married. The novel has a lot of twists and turns and always keeps you wondering what's going to happen next. I wish there was a sequel with their children."},{"rating":"2","title":"May be a bore hazard.","review":"When I first read this book I was bored after the first hundred or so pages.

But this just repeats whatever is in MSDN. It should include explainations to things which are not trivial, after all, this is why anyone buys a book for. If we try to convince that its alternative to MSDN, we anyway need MSDN because many of explanations were not detailed enough to be understood.Its a good book to start with and if you are in a hurry to learn in a short span, its a good option.

I didn't notice anything when compare to my old $33 dvd. I don't understand any review made on this item. The image is not even close to hd 780p, so why is this DVD called upconverter HD 1080p? The upconvertion might be because it has a HDMI output, but nothing else. The images displayed are comparable to any other dvd player. I'm going to keep it anyway because it is very flat and it fits my cabinet. But if you are looking to upconvert your old dvd collection to HD 1080p , forget it. The only way to watch HD 1080p is with the blueray dvd or the HD dvd.In other hand, I believe that if you have a high-end HDTV they come with internal upconverters that won't let you notice any difference when comparing this product to any other dvd.

Also, if you want to be able to get other remotes to work with this product, they do not have their codes with larger manufactures so they can be incorporated.

I hooked it up via HDMI to a 1080p source. The upconversion is clean and depending on the source material can be nearly HD.Operationally, the DV-981HD is very straightforward. The remote is nothing special either way. It is an amazingly slim and sleek unit.Haven't tried DVD-Audio or SACD, but it's nice to have in the unlikely chance either of those formats ever recovers.This is the best price/performance DVD player until we wait for the HD-DVD and Blue Ray idiots to agree on a standard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad for price, but there are better upconverting DVD players","review":"Oppo makes a good product for the price, however if you are willing to spend more money, you will see definite improvement with a higher end DVD player.For example, the Toshiba HD-XA2 HD-DVD player upconverts standard DVDs a lot better than the Oppo, plus it plays HD-DVDs.

In fact, the Toshiba is cheaper considering you get 8 HD-DVDs from Amazon and Toshiba when ordering any Toshiba HD player. You do the math. Oppo is overpriced and overrated. \\"Plays as well as players costing 2X or 3X,\\" is outdated and misleading.

Of course 1080p from this player can't compare to blu-ray or hd-dvd. But for under $200 price with such high quality, it's unbeatable. I had to settle with a refurbished one, because the wait for new ones was too long for me. It carries a year warranty same as a new one anyway. So far I've been happy with it. The only two complaints that I have, are the dvd tray and the batteries' cap on the remote. They are little bit flimsy. The batteries' cap on my remote already broke when I tried to change to batteries. That's why I only gave it 4.5 star...Other than that this OPPO DV-981hd is the way to go for those who like watching movies in near high def quality but can't wait for the settlement between blu-ray and hd-dvd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pinnacle of upconverting DVD players, excellent pro reviews","review":"Excellently tested to do very well in detailed tests like on Audioholics dot com.

However, like some other reviewers noted, after about 2 years the unit failed. The light on the power button changed from blue to purple. A little Google-fu indicates that the purple light indicates a failed power supply. It must be fairly common in this model. The player was long out of warranty, but I called OPPO anyway to see what a repair might cost. They said, no problem, send it back and we'll fix it for no cost. They did and it's back like new. I hope the repaired power supply lasts longer than 2 years, though. I like this player also because it's easy to convert into a region free player (with menu commands you can find with Google). Kudos to OPPO for the excellent support for their hardware even though it was long out of warranty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Up convertind DVD player","review":"I have a big collection of DVD titles and wanted to enjoy them even in HDTV. Though HDTV usually have upconversion, they are not the best as they are intended for HD inputs. That's where a high quality upconvertor DVD player is in dire need. I googled for this and read multiple reviews of OPPO players and decided to buy one. It met the expectation and exceeded it as well.One of the complaints I have in this globalised era is that most of the electonics products sold in USA serve only the USA system - NTSC, 110V.This OPPO player works at 220V and supports PAL.

This player consist the best tecnology of this world: Faraudja DCDi interlacer chip, DivX / Xvid playback and upconverion. It doesn't even have component output because this player has one purpose only: provide DVD upconversion for people with HDTV. I recommend to set your HDMI input to pixel-to-pixel mode (if it's avalible on your TV) and I guarantee you will love the picture this player produces.I'm not gonna go into technical detail, as I can't add anything new to reviews that done before me.

However, every magazine review I read consistently picked the Oppo products as the best out there. Likewise, I could find no negative reviews by any owner. So, I took the plunge, bought the dV981, and have nothing but positive remarks about it. When I play standard DVD's on either it or my 1 year old Sony DVD/VHS combo unit on my 65\\" Mitsubishi HD 1080p DLP, there is no comparison.

The video image was routed to my Panasonic 42\\" plasma. The set-up protocol was very easy and the instruction manual clear. After running several of my favorite DVD's I was astonished by the brilliance, clarity, definition and impact that this machine produced both visually and sonically.

Bluray out of the box was horrible converting standard DVDs even after firmware upgrades. Viewing HD dvds on Oppo and Samsung looked the same. Oppo needed minor video tweaking. Drawback of Oppo is the remote control was very cheezy. But i am now comfortable with remote. Tray looks flimsy but is not. Opening tray sometimes takes two presses. Also, saving resume on DVD you need to eject DVD. But after reviewing the Bluray player and seeing what it didn't have I am very happy with Oppo and payed $300 less than Bluray player. I am able to view standard dvds in better quality than the Samsung. Since most of my favorite movies are not HD yet I think I made the right choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Meets Expectations (which were high)","review":"Up-converting DVD players are becoming the norm, problem is, well, they suck. I had a top quality 480P player that died after 5 years, so I replaced it with a $100 Sony 1080p Up-converting DVD, what a piece of crap. So I hit the web and after many hours of reading about up-converting and product reviews, the Oppo stood out. The Oppo is rated in the top 5 best DVD players on just about any site that has a list, it is rated better then units costing 4x as much, and it is rated as up-converting standard DVD's better then HD, BlueRay or PS3 units (note, this is for up-converting standard DVD's only).I've been using the unit for about a month now and it outputs a great picture. I'm very happy although I can't say that the picture looks all that much better then my old top quality 480P player, but for the price I think it would be hard to find better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oppo is Wow!","review":"We've got a Mitsubishi 1080p 52\\" that's fantastic with an HD cable feed but really was a bit dissappointing with our DVD's. Read some reviews on upconverting players with HDMI and decided to give the Oppo a shot - at $229 it didn't seem like much risk. Plugged it in using the HDMI (one cable is really sweet) and turned it on, and wow! Right off the bat the whole family could see the difference. We had Nemo in and even though this was just a quick test, we couldn't take our eyes off the screen. Plugged in the first Harry Potter and watched the opening part where Dumbledore comes down the street - it's a particular sceen I've used in the past to check detail quality. Again, what a difference! Don't understand the couple of reviews here dissing this unit; it's one of the few products I've purchased in awhile that made me go \\"wow\\"!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Study Companion","review":"The title is a smoke screen to purchase an item that is not needed should you have the Commentary itself.

A doll that doesn't look like a chicken hooker!","review":"I bought this doll after looking for presents for my niece on the internet. I hated the Bratz dolls because I think that they look like teenage hooker chickens, and really don't seem to do anything but party and shop. Kids see enough people do that kind of stuff in their lives. I also saw toys that pooped (just what her mother needed), toys that required a $200 product to go with it, etc. I finally found these wholesome dolls who have values put to them."},{"rating":"1","title":"really, really not worth the money","review":"I had a very hard time enjoying this book. I felt like there was little to no character development, a meandering plot, and a completely unsatisfying ending. I haven't struggled so hard to get through a book in a long time, and the only reason I didn't just give up on it was because it was the selection for my book club. It was 240 pages before anything interesting happened, and then even that plot line was poorly followed through. I am sorry, but there was almost nothing in this book that spoke to me. I am glad I got a used copy and spent only seven dollars, but even that felt like too much."},{"rating":"2","title":"In-depth insight into three lives","review":"The character development is fascinating. I felt that I grew to know these 3 daughters.

I had been a fan of the music but it wasn't until I saw these tapes that I realized just how amazing these musicians were (well, I did know about Bruford...). If you never got the chance to see them live then put this collection on your MUST OWN list. You'll never listen to King Crimson the same way again once you've seen Levin conduct a one man symphony with the Chapman Stick, marveled as Belew conducts audio surgery on the amp feedback with his Roland guitar synth, or grinned a mile wide watching Fripp practically fall off his stool as he contorts his way through the likes of Sartori in Tangier. Heck, I'd pay the price just to see one of these songs. Two whole concerts? That's a bargain and a half. If you are somebody who appreciates musicians at the cutting edge of their craft, then you can't help but be transfixed by this collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"...I like it!\\"","review":"Since I was introduced to the album Discipline, I have been a drooling King Crimson fan, albeit one who has never been able to see them perform. And while I have enjoyed the various permutations of the band, the 80s line up has always been my favorite. This disc is the first chance I have had to actually see them play, and I'm still catching my breath. Being a drummer, I especially enjoy seeing Bill Bruford play his mutant sets (each concert features a different mutation) and I am amazed at how gracefully he plays some pretty difficult parts. Tony Levin is stunning; Adrien Belew is...well, a musical analogy to Andy Worhol; while Robert Fripp seems to be a kind of post-modern Bach with his absurdly complicated musical arangements and his devotion to artistic innovation. These two concerts feature King Crimson at one of their peaks of genius."},{"rating":"2","title":"great performance by great musicians","review":"There's no spoofing the complexity of performing the kind of music presented here in a live venue. This is simply brilliant."},{"rating":"1","title":"where'd that title come from?","review":"i'm going out on a somewhat snobbish limb here to say that i doubt many crimson fans know much about jack kerouac and neal cassidy and what the HELL do they have to do with this sort of music? man, EVERYbody knows that jack dug bop and had no use whatsoever for the sixties. i gave it two stars cuz that's my general reaction to about 80% of this band's output - i admire them, respect them, had a great afternoon laughing with fripp one day though he wouldn't remember. but i don't care all that much for them"},{"rating":"2","title":"Four Men in Search of Perfection","review":"King Crimson. The name either conjures up an image of intense prog pain or horrific, jagged pleasure. Purchase this DVD (excellent quality, by the way) if you are interested in four musicians that can rock (in an intelligent style) harder than anything permissable by imagination. Wacky lyrics? Yes. Adrian Belew jumping behind the drums? Yes. Mad prof Robert Fripp extrapolating guitar figures into the netherlands? Yes. Bill Bruford, super percussionist, getting experimental? Yes. And what of Tony Levin on the Chapman Stick? It all has to be seen to be believed.

It is a small format, a bit larger than a paperback dictionary, but the book contains an amazing amount of information, and most illustrations are in color. If you want coverage of famous vehicles, like the Sherman tank, or the T-34, or the M1 Abrams, there are better specialty publications. But for obscure vehicles, this book is excellent. It helps decipher the myriad of new tank designs now coming out of China and the states that once made up the Soviet Union. It also gives coverage of hard to find historical subjects like Polish, French, and Italian armor in 1939-40. Think of it as an ilustrated tank dictionary."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Read","review":"Mr. Fincher captures the essence of New Orleans.

I've read quite a few texts on the subject, by Elder, Tharp, Link, Weinstein, and so on (which are must-reads, by the way), and so this particular text served to complement and enhance the knowledge and skills that I already posessed.Pring doesn't provide any magic answers here -- and you shouldn't expect any. He simply discusses topics that any aspiring investor/speculator/trader should be intimately familiar with. If you feel you already know everything there is to know about price and volume patterns, trend lines, support/resistance, basic western-style formations, etc..., then this book probably isn't for you.

The animation is good, the controls are intuitive and responsive, and the amount of extras is welcome. Load times are not bad either.My only complaint is that I find it very difficult to run the ball at the higher difficulty levels. A 14-10 game that ends with 200 passing yards and 10 rushing yards for both teams is not very realistic. If you play on the easier levels the stats even out but you'll easily spank the CPU opponent. I'm hoping that I just need more time with the game to run the ball more effectively.Overall, if you want to play football on the go, I recommend this game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good Game","review":"Overall this is a pretty good game. Good features and pretty good graphics(you can only make them so good for a PSP). There are only two downsides to this game. One, there is no Superstar mode where you create a player and work with him to get better. Two, it is not very easy to run the ball but it is pretty easy to advance the ball by passing and the offensive lines on all of the teams are terrible as well. You have a maximum of about 3 seconds until there's a blitz or one of the linemen get through. Overall a pretty good game though. I would reccomend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good..a few minor issues","review":"Nice fluid game play and (as usually with madden) the controls are intuitive. The AI seems smarter than in the past and does a better job playing to the situation and/or counteracting what you are doing. The graphics are good for the psp screen. I don't think I want any more field clutter simply because of how small the screen is.There are two issues I have had with the game so far:1) When the offense is backed up on there own 2-3 yard line the camera can't go back any further so as soon as you snap the ball the QB runs out of view...frustrating for both sides.2) One glitch I had. I threw a ball to my receiver in the end zone. He caught it, dropped it (while in the end zone) and the other team recovered. It was ruled a fumble. Maybe I'm wrong but if he had possession enough to fumble the td should have been awarded.So over all I give this one a passing grade. Load times are a little on the long side."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better than I thought it would be on PSP","review":"I already owned this game for wii, and decided that I'd give it a try on PSP. After reading reviews, it appeared that the 08 version was the was the best one to try. I was a little skeptical because I figured that it would be difficult to play on the small PSP screen. Boy was I wrong! This game is a lot of fun. Graphics are pretty good and the only complaint is that the wideouts on either side are off-screen and it's hard to tell if they're covered. Also, this game has alot more features than the wii version.Let's just say that since I got this game for my PSP, the wii version hasn't been out of it's case."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Game","review":"This game has its own fantasy league which is cool.

The version I owned is the Messenger - Miami version. I can't comment on the other styles of this bag.My wife bought this Targus Messenger Miami bag for me at a local store as a gift for a new job I had started in downtown Chicago. Around the same time I bought several pairs of new slacks to look professional. I walk from the Metra station to my office about six blocks every day. After about four months of doing that I noticed that my slacks were getting worn out around the hip area. That is the exact place the bag rests while I walk. The back side of the bag has a mesh pocket that acts as sandpaper. Just about ruined $200 worth of slacks. I immediately stopped using this and switched to a backpack style bag.No bag that rest on your hip should be made out of a rough material so this thing is junk.

I'm still a fan of that style but this bag is trash. The shoulder strap is uncomfortable and not removable. So first thing I did was cut it off and attach my old strap. The flap is not very well secured, while holding the bag by the handle your laptop is exposed to dust and the weather. Targus should have used Velcro instead of the plastic buckle. (hmmmm I just thought of my next modification >_>)The bottom of the laptop compartment does not have any rigid padding; just very soft and thin padding that will not protect your 17\\" notebook if you happen drop it or sit it down with out precaution on a hard surface.The over all color is nice, the yellow lettering is a little tacky but does not take away from the over all aesthetics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love The Case, Great Value - A couple of Things to Know","review":"First off, this case (Targus Miami) is exactly what I expected, maybe even a little better.

This means that rain can run in a little on the ends. The flap should be a little longer and have a \\"turn down\\" on the edge. This is my biggest beef.Case will not stand up by itself.

I recommend a heavy duty UV light source for finding sources of urine to go along with this product (not the little hand held tube ones commonly available at pet stores or sold with pet odor solutions). I purchased one also on Amazon: Streamlight Twin-Task 3C 9 Inch UV Flashlight, Black #51010.

This time I purchased Urine Off because I saw several people online had recommended it.

To me, this is a miracle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Might work for some... didn't work for us.","review":"Purchased two gallons of Urine Off, my wife's cats started to mark their territory after we brought our newborn home. The smell of cat urine is awful, and it just seems to linger. First, I never would have expected to need two gallons of this stuff... so, buy plenty. It goes fast! I really wish it would have worked for us, but it didn't. When cat pee gets into the carpet and the padding underneath, I'm not sure what if anything will do the job. We ended up having to replace a section of the carpet and use Kilz primer on the subfloor to lock in / block out any smell that may have made it to the flooring. We also found that a local vet carried a similar product for a little cheaper.

Replacing the carpet is not an option (I'm in a rental) and I'm at a loss as to what to do next.Also, I had a bit of trouble with the vendor I bought this from (Entirely Pets) so if you're going to try this product, choose a different vendor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Urine Off","review":"Seems to work for a time but then the urine odor is right back.

First of all, it does not get rid of the smell of urine. Second, it leaves behind the smell of a urine soaked old lady's house who is using perfume to disguise the smell of her own filth. Third, it is damn near impossible to get rid of the smell of the Urine Off.Here's a tip - use plain, old fashioned white vinegar if your cat or dog pees on the carpet. Just spray it on, let it dry, clean the area the next day with some soapy water. Repeat if necessary. The vinegar neutralises the urine - works every time. I sincerely regret ever using Urine Off; should have just stuck to the vinegar.PS - the only reason I have given it a star is because it wouldn't let me not.

Clean the area, treat it, cover it with plastic so the \\"enzymes\\" can work. COMPLETE FAILURE! I think the whole industry devoted to pet smell removal products is a scam.

Unfortunately, my cat urinated on the spot again. So, I did the procedure again, using more product and letting it \\"work\\" for an even longer period. I finished the process yesterday, and my cat hasn't gone there again, but the area still has an odor when the light hits it.

But things aren't as simple as arresting the occasional drunk. There's the traveling revivalist in the cell arrested for attempted murder who taunts Samuel whenever he's in the office. Then there's the double murder in the bank vault set up to look like a robbery gone wrong. And, to make matters worse, a gang of confederates has wandered into town. While they aren't causing any trouble, the townsfolk blame them for everything bad happening in town and are mad at Samuel because he's not taking any action. His hands are tied, however, because of lack of evidence.Sigmund Brouwer has written another great book. Samuel Keaton's world is enhanced by the introduction of Doc and Jake. The mystery is very engaging and the writing style is relaxed, inviting the reader to sit back and enjoy.

The essays contain little to no humor or insight- they are just lengthy, boring opinions on various subjects. Imagine if you can a duller, less-relavant Andy Rooney. If I wanted to read some loser's uninspired musings, I would get on the internet and start reading weblogs. I hereby declare this book Unreadable."},{"rating":"2","title":"very stimulating, stirring, challenging reading","review":"I enjoyed this collection of essays very much. Some of the essasy were quite dense, and made me feel a bit inadequate, but I will read them over and take them as a challenge to me, not elititism. Even if a bit of what Franzen writes is self-congratulatory, that seems human and understandable to me--but I don't think he is writing to pat himself on the back. I really enjoyed his essay on Prisons--reading it felt to me like watching a Michael Moore Documentary--because you see the issue from many different perspectives and from a very human (vs abstract) stand point--and you are not given answers, but left to \\"work with\\" the ambiguity. I also was very much stirred by his essays on his father and on the Oprah taping. I definitely feel this collection is worth reading...I think most people can take something from it, even if, like me, they are nowhere near as well-read as Franzen."},{"rating":"2","title":"different short stories about Franzen","review":"you get more insight into the eccentricity of Mr Franzen and his experiences before and after writing The Corrections. the essays are provacative and insightful. i especially enjoyed the one where he went back home to make a taping for Oprah book club segment and we all know what happened with that.

I suppose some of it has to do with the theme the collection's title suggests, but not (so far as I could see) all of it: The history of the tobacco industry; the nature of cities; mail inefficiencies in Chicago. I'm afraid I missed the connection.At its best, the collection described why people read and write--and those parts were enjoyable, and seemed filled with insight, the way thoughts often do when they coincide with your own point of view.I feel slightly cheated by having bought a book whose title promised more than its contents delivered."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album","review":"I'm a big fan of Cary Cooper and Tom Prasada Rao...I loved this album.

He wrote a very basic linear algebra text book for beginners and yet made his explanations so unclear that the book ends up being hard to read. The topics are the very basics of linear algebra: no canonical forms, no infinite dimensional spaces, the underlying field is always R or C, and everything is done in terms of matrices. The explanations of the concepts that are covered could use some coherence and a dash of order.I wouldn't recommend this book for anyone. It's pretty much garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another garbage book","review":"This text has to be among the worst math books I have ever encountered. The content in the chapters is very vauge and I'd hazard to guess makes sense only to those who already know linear algebra. This book may perhaps be a good refresher book, but as a beginning text it fails miserably.

It's nice because it covers a lot of topics, but it has one weakness: the explanations are very poorly written, and from a student's perspective, they are very difficult to understand. All explanations of the various subjects are accurate, but they seem to be written from a viewpoint which seems to be geared towards not students but those who have already understood the material. Most of my friends taking the same course also felt that this textbook was extremely lacking. Please, if you're a professor, do your students a favour and choose a different algebra textbook than this one!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"First mathematics book I've actually disliked","review":"This is by far the worst math book I've ever used. The subject is not at all difficult, but the book does nothing to help students understand the subject.

Do not use this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible","review":"Wow. I have never come across such a horrible book. I'm using this as a text for an undergrad linear algebra course and I'm completely appalled at the quality.

If you have this book as your text for a class, all I can say is I feel your pain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bottom line: poorly written","review":"Th explanations are inadequate. They skip steps. Some elements are added into the chapters that are considered optional. Who ever heard of an optional chapter in their textbook!? I, for one, never heard of such a thing! The problems in the back are not very good usefull and are often repetative in some places and lacking in other. The proofs that the book spends much time with are also poorly explained. The author should know that to the new student, nothing is obvious, nothing is known. There is not more to say than: its a bad book.p.s. I couldn't bring myself to any book only one star."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great linear algebra book","review":"My department recently adopted this book for our regular undergraduate linear algebra course upon the recommendation of a colleague of mine and myself. I am currently teaching from it and am delighted by it.The book is concisely written, with just the right amount of detail to help the student understand the concepts but without sweeping any tricky details under the rug. The topics are arranged in the right order to avoid unnecessary repetition.

Given the contributing authors (including Dave Barry, Douglas Adams, Anne Lamott, and, of course, Tim Cahill) one would expect this collection to have you rolling in the aisles. But it simply doesn't work. The snippets may have fit very well in their original publications, but the misadventures in _Not So Funny_ are just not surprising or amusing enough as stand-alones.I read this book while on an extremely long flight to South Africa.

That version featured Handel's original Royal Fireworks score for winds and brass only. This CD, recorded in 1986, utilizes the later version which includes strings. Compared to Malgoire's '74 effort, this version lacks power, passion and depth. It is uneven and the ensemble runs through it as though they had been force-fed a strong physic. The Water Music is pedestrian but serviceable; several pieces included on the '74 version are also missing from this one. If, like me, you are looking to replace your old '74 vinyl Malgoire \\"Water Music/Fireworks\\" with this one....keep looking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get a different recording!!","review":"This is aweful. I borrowed this CD from a friend. Absolutely the worst recording of the Water music suites and Fireworks I've ever heard. The orchestra has sloppy ensemble and is out of tune. An all around bland and weak interpretation, too. Sounds like an amatuer band and the recording quality is not very good either. If you want a period instrument recording of this music, there are plenty of other good ones available. Trevor Pinnock is excellent, so is Norrington, Gardiner, and Tafelmusik. Take your pick, but avoid this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why doesn't Sony release the earlier recordings?","review":"I'd just like to endorse the comments of \\"quidditchqueen\\" regarding the early '70s analog recordings by Malgoire of these seminal Handel works. The later \\"DDD\\" recordings, available on the CD featured here, are serviceable but nothing special. I have never found another recording of \\"Music for the Royal Fireworks\\" that matches the energy and ecstasy of the c.1974 recording by Malgoire. Perhaps Handel didn't care for the \\"no strings\\" arrangement of the Fireworks music, but I doubt if he ever heard a performance with the fire of Malgoire's. And the period instruments, including the wonderfully raucous horns (it hardly matters that they're slightly off-pitch at times -- this ain't Mozart), are heard to their best advantage. I am less taken with either recording of the \\"Water Music,\\" but here too the earlier performance is the better one.

I haven't had the best experience with this watch...However, once I put a battery in it, it works well and the numbers are nice and big and it's pretty user friendly to figure out which buttons control/set which features."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy!!!!!","review":"Beware! I bought this for the specific reason that it was a digital tuner. I wanted to use this at the gym where they broadcast their TV audio on specific stations. Imagine my disappointment when I tried to use it the first time AND YOU CANNOT SELECT THE FREQUENCY. The only thing this radio allows is for it to \\"scan\\" and \\"lock in\\" on a station. The reception was beyond terrible. Avoid at all costs!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible, cheap, not worth the price!","review":"This was given to me as a Christmas gift, and I would never wish something so cheap on anyone. It's quality is terrible, it only picks up some radio stations, even following the instructions, 5 different adults couldn't get the thing to change the time or even set the alarm. It's very quiet and eats battery power. Don't waste your money!! Something from the dollar store is better than this. I threw mine away cause it wasn't worth the hassle of replacing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Answering the Call","review":"Whistle While You Work speaks to what I hear daily from friends and colleagues, i.e., work without passion drains energy from life and nibbles away at the soul. This book takes a straightforward approach to how you can be personally responsible for discovering what work will suit you so well that work/energy/passion meld into one. Leider and Shapiro make the ultimate dream of \\"good work\\" seem possible, attainable and sustainable. The calling card exercise works so don't pass it up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Repetitive information about \\"calling\\"-- stopped halfway through","review":"I always read books even if they're not that great, but this was so repetitive and used so many examples that illustrated so little that I got so bored and stopped. I didn't learn much of anything from the book; I was hoping to learn to get the most out a job and, in a way, \\"whistle while I work.\\" But the 1st half I read just repeated information about how an inner desire will always call you to something greater (i.e., another job) until you respond. I hope most people already know that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Out Of Date","review":"The one I have is from 1997. Concepts haven't changed no, but it is really annoying to read some of the numbers they toss out. Like a 700 pair limit electrophoresis, not on today's machines...

They look cool and get lots of comments. For that they get a few stars. The problem is, after about 3 months, one of them lost its ability to keep its height. I'd sit on it (185 lbs), and 2 minutes later my chin is resting on the bar. A few months more go buy, and a second one goes bad. Also, theres a plastic ring underneith the foot of the stool, which wore off quickly as the stools are slid around on some textured tile. I'm disappointed because I'd like something that lasts, and looks good at the same time."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Demise","review":"This is a great book on, not only the demise of the small Texas cotton farmer, but, the death of a way of life lived by hundreds of thousands of people all across the South. The arrival of the Great Depression followed by the implementation of the socialist policies of the New Deal spelled the end of an agrarian lifestyle that had been a part of the backbone of the American way of life for over two centuries. I reccomend this book to anyone who loves American history. Particularly American agricultural history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outdated, unrealistic info, a few good activity ideas","review":"I bought this book looking for more easy activity ideas for subbing. I was quite dissappointed. There were only a few pages at the end devoted to activities. The remainder of the book consisted of general sub info, maybe of some worth to someone who is looking to get into the field, with no experience. I've only been subbing a few months and none of this info was helpful. The author conveyed the false sense that all you need to have a good day is a cheery attitude and a \\"bag of tricks.\\" That may work in some classrooms, but not in many I've experienced. In 1983, when the book was published, classrooms were significantly different. Also, the salaries she quotes, after admitting she only polled a few schools to get an \\"average,\\" were extremely outdated. I make twice the pay she quoted to be on the \\"high\\" end, and I am being paid low for a sub in my area. I will be returning this book promptly."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Book On Lion Training Would Have Helped Better","review":"I read this book before I spent one horrible, frustrating year substitute teaching.

The musicans are top notch, the arrangments are solid and the sound is superb as well. Well, Steve Hoffmann was involved in mastering this CD and that always helps.What I miss are more familiar tunes and a rythmn guitar. Granted, perhaps Field was trying not to 'copy' Basie too much. But the CD is a tribute to Basie and even w/o the guitar, the resemblence to Basie (helped by Nestico's arrangements) cannot be overheard. Gregg certainly ranks up there is one of the top jazz drummers today - probably equaled only by Clayton Cameron and Butch Miles (currently with Basie).A fun CD if you're a big band fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painfully Dull","review":"The book is it is not well written and is slow to develop - so despite it's small size it seemed to take forever to read.

I can't compare it to their other CD's, but as a part-time fan it is great... has most of the songs I love to hear."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Collection","review":"I like this collection a lot because all the hits are here. The packaging is superb: exhaustive liner notes, pictures, and detailed discography. This collection is much better than \\"The Best Of War And More\\" vol. 1 & 2. If you want just 2 CDs of War, aviod those 2 volumes and get this anthology. The flaw is some of the songs were truncated, but it still sounds good to me.

I've purchased other budget brands of rechargeable before (i.e. Ziekos and Targus), and even though those brands don't hold a charge for as long as a normal battery, these Digital Concepts batteries are horrible. I have repeatedly tried to charge them, and they lose their charge within a day. They are pretty much worthless. It hasn't even been two weeks and I'm already looking for new ones, because these won't hold a charge long enough for me to even use them. I guess you get what you pay for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Horses by Gail Gibbons","review":"Horsesby Gail GibbonsReview by AmandaHorses is a great book for kids because it teaches people about horses. This book teaches people about horse life and the stages that they go through. This book gives many facts and uses many detailed pictures to help understand. It tells about horses like how they domesticated and who were their closest ancestors. They also show the proper care for horses. This story is only one of many books by Gail Gibbons."},{"rating":"2","title":"Horses!","review":"Starting with the ancient Eohippus, Horses! shows the history of and long relationship between people and horses. This book is packed with anatomy, life cycle, and general information. There are numerous labeled illustrations and many breeds are featured.

I can't remember ever reading another fictionalized oral history and the idea is such a great one! If you've ever read any showbiz biographies, especially from the Golden Age of Hollywood, you will love this book. True, there are plenty of similarities to the Dean & Jerry team, but there are tons of in-jokes stolen from the lives of Milton Berle, Groucho Marx, and other luminaries. It really did remind me of Christopher Guest's ...documentary movies; the details are believable, but then this slight sense of----insanity slips in. The famous female star whose food [indulging] veers dangerously close to cannibalism...oh, I don't want to spoil it. Just read this book if you're into showbiz stories. You will NOT regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than you might think","review":"If you save 5 stars for Mingus Ah-Um and Charles Mingus Presents Charles Mingus, then this must rate just below those standouts. With the words \\"Jazz Fusion\\" in the title, and the fact that the Lp originally contained two tracks only (side A/side B), I put off getting this record--sounded like aimless jamming or pretentious overreaching. Well, I was wrong. It is simply enjoyable, and its a shame that others may be scared away by an awkward title and a lack of description about the work's various movements. Like an Ellington suite (say the Far East), there are distinct movements, none inaccessable. There are wonderful touches of exotica, including percussion touches from the tropics, and a few wildlife sounds thrown in at the beginning for good measure. All in all, I like this more than I like some of the better-known earlier Mingus records, though not more than the Columbia or Candid recordings, which are for me the tops."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well made RG6 cable","review":"I bought this cable for a rooftop antenna.

Davy Jones -- if you are reading this -- you are still awesome."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better off dead!","review":"Listening to the music now after all of these years really shows that the Monkees had no original talent when they were first grouped together. The only one with real talent was Micky Dolenz. All of his songs had a better vocal arrangement and harmonies than the other singers. Davey Jones, well, he should have stuck to the tamborine. I have all the original releases on vinyl. You can easily save yourself money and just download these songs using Kazaa.

Pulled up these reviews, and about 2 months later, tried once more, and fm page 1. Still no joy. Author seemed to have at least 3 possibly great stories...but I never got the connections, if any. Some time you get the bear, and sometimes he gets you. Caveat Emptor."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best and beautiful","review":"Because of the subtle and pearly touch to the piano playing, this CD is the finest recording that I've heard of these Satie pieces (and I've heard various versions of these pieces recorded by other pianists who mess up the rhythm and expression of the pieces). At first what pulled me in was the album cover, when I was at a music store, but I was never the same after hearing this music that takes you to somewhere distant and beautiful- it blew me away! I took to learning how to play some of these pieces on piano, the Gymnopedies and Gnossiennes are not too hard to learn. This CD also turned my mother on to classical music, and she didn't even like this kind of music before. If Amazon doesn't carry it in stock, you can buy it off iclassics.com"},{"rating":"2","title":"Really cool","review":"If you're looking at this item you probably already know what these songs sound like so the choice is about the interpretation. And it's funny how different people will play things like this and how little variations here and there can make a difference. Maybe it's because this was my first introduction to Satie but now that I've listened to other versions these really sound the best. The sound quality and interpretation are superb.If you are not familiar with Satie and have never heard these tunes then you are in for a treat. First, upon playing the first song on the CD you're going to say \\"Ah, I've heard that before!\\" I did. This is all very relaxing music that I really like. Next I'm going to get a songbook and try to play some of them myself. I highly recommend them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy, breezy, done.","review":"Very satisfied with this product.

The graphics, sounds and overall game are exactly as I remember them, definitely not a bad remake. BUT...the joystick, or how it's connected to the software is really aweful. About 1 out of 5 times you press the joystick a certain direction, the game simply doesn't respond. A ghost is coming, so you turn the other way...but Pac-Man just continues to run right into him. It was really maddening, so much so that after spending 10 minutes trying to figure out what I was doing wrong, I realized it's just not made well. I think this is a cute \\"retro\\" gag gift, but not really made for anyone who really wants to play the game or hopes to get beyond level one, due to a poorly engineered controller."},{"rating":"2","title":"Memory lane","review":"Wow, this game is great!

It did take me some time to warm up to the other pac man games, but I love them now. As for the reg. pac man, it did take me some getting used to the sound effects, as I was used to the ones from Atari 2600.It's fun, you can take it anywhere that you'll cross a tv you can plug it in.My son loves to play it, too.As for the other pac man games, besides the regular pac man, there are already pre-set high scores from other players.I highly recommend this game."},{"rating":"2","title":"ABBA Were Balladeers, Too... and First-Rate! (4.5 stars)","review":"Yes, ABBA is not only \\"Waterloo\\", \\"Mamma Mia\\", or \\"Take a Chance on Me\\". Don't get me wrong, I like these songs, but ABBA's true artistry was even better expressed in slower numbers. Really, if I had to choose one ABBA CD to take with me to a desert island, it would be this one.There are some of my ABBA top favourites ever, including \\"Chiquitita\\", \\"I Have a Dream\\", \\"Andante Andante\\", \\"Our Last Summer\\" and \\"My Love, My Life\\". From the chartbreakers, \\"The Name of the Game\\" is flawless.Interestingly, \\"Love Stories\\" does not include the biggest ABBA hit, the ubiquitous \\"Dancing Queen\\", for obvious reasons. The collection can easily do without it, though. Apart from the lyrics, the booklet contains excellent liner notes by John Tobler, who is not afraid to compare ABBA with the Beatles. Neither am I.Some call ABBA a 'guilty pleasure'. Why it should be 'guilty' is beyond me. This is good music in the first place. A great compilation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wish I could give it even more stars","review":"This dvd is amazing! By far the best dvd out there on the gypsy jazz style of music pioneered by Django Reinhardt. Most of the best modern players are on this dvd like Bireli Lagrene, Angelo Debarre, Dorado Schmitt, and Stochelo Rosenberg among many others. The great violinist, Florin Niculescu is also on here. Martin Weiss (violin) should also be mentioned. His performance on Dinah was a highlight for me. Bireli especially has some scorching solos on this dvd. He is always melodic and tasteful. If you are even a little bit interested in Gypsy Swing, then I would buy this along with any Django album you can find and the Bireli Lagrene \\"Gypsy Project\\" cd's. This dvd has almost all of the great standards on here including minor swing, sweet georgia brown, when day is done, dinah, dark eyes, djangology, cocquette, blues clair, i'll see you in my dreams, nuages, there will never be another you, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"S'wonderful","review":"This is a gem, an invaluable resource to beginner and experienced student of this style.

It was shot well with great audio quality; it's a pro production all the way. The highlight of the video, for me, is Bireli's introduction to \\"When Day Is Done\\". He's got the Django intro down, but he adds some freakish, pyrotechnical offerings of his own that will leave your jaw dropping. Just how does he do those machine-gun harmonics? If there is a guitar player anywhere on the planet that is more capable than him, I wish somebody would point him out. Did I mention that my wife loves this video? I could see this video being played at a party gathering and all the guests digging it. It's great stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"passionate","review":"This is what happens when a collective of some of today's not only talented, but passionate musicians gather together to make a recording. Regrdless of tempo or dynamic, the Fellowship manage to cohesively bring each piece together with great intensity and feeling. All the tunes move along with the utmost sense of urgency, but never rushing,each song moves forward and flows perfectly. Led by Brian Blade's masterful drumming( not to mention guitar/singing ability ) and musicianship, this band is one of the few on the current scene who has discovered its collective voice, one which speaks of music with a deeper meaning and spirit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good compositions.","review":"Very good compositions with an ideal mixture of improvisation and precise timing.If you like prog rock or jazz, buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money","review":"I have no idea what the author was trying to do here--other than jump on the HB nostalgia bandwagon that began rolling several decades ago when Leslie MacFarlaine wrote his fine book about being the ghostwriter for the HB series (\\"Ghost of the Hardy Boys\\"). But I could not get through the first ten pages of \\"House on the Point.\\" Big deal. The Hardys get a little older. They now dig cars and hot music. Who cares. The original texts are what they are. Take 'em or leave 'em. They do NOT need to be improved, enlightened, brought \\"up to date\\" (their old-fashioned charm was what I liked most about them), deconstructed or corrected.

An inexpensive exercise ball, fitness band, and small hand weights are recommended but not required, and all pregnant women should consult their physicians before embarking on an exercise program - but if the physician OKs it, then Fit & Healthy Prenatal Workouts is definitely one of the best workout options available!

This isn't mentioned on the Amazon description. You don't find this out until you go to do the workout.-A partner is used in the video - not practical. They say you can use a door frame or bedpost but I don't have those near my dvd player.-It is only for the first 2 trimesters. No workouts given for the 3rd trimester.-Not enough leg workout.-Time is deceptive. If you do the warm-up, workout, and cool down it takes you more than 15 minutes.What I liked:-Good upper body workout (if you have all the tools)."},{"rating":"1","title":"deceptive and awkward","review":"The description of this video is deceptive. The workouts are tailored month-by-month. The first workout is for women in the first month of pregnancy, the second for the second month, and on through month six. So if you're already in your sixth month, like I am, this video isn't very useful.A lot of equipment is required: light weights, bands, and a workout ball. Since I only have weights, I had to improvise for the exercises with the bands and workout ball.Gabrielle awkwardly follows the directions of her trainer. It doesn't seem like the two planned the workouts very well. Gabrielle appears to not to know what's coming next.While Gabrielle looks gorgeous, she doesn't smile and she seems nervous and uncomfortable in front of the camera.The workouts are very short, and I didn't feel like I accomplished much in the 20 minutes. It was awkward to follow, not very fun, challenging, or satisfying. I guess if you're looking for a quick workout, it'll do. But I'm pretty disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"i wish i would have known that you would have to have a partner to help you with all the changes of equipment. if i had known that i would'nt have bought the dvd"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not alone!","review":"The trainer in this video helps Gabrielle with everything. While you are at home with no one to help. He also tells you after you get on the ground you might need to stabilize the ball? He holds the chair for Gabrielle and hands her everything, holds the ball stable for her. This is not a do it yourself at home video. Also why not just put a warm up and cool down at the beginning and end of every month? It was a waste of time and money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very basic and boring","review":"Though this DVD offers great tips on technique I broke more of a sweat going upstairs to the bonus-room to work out.

Just felt disappointed and not impressed at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"I bought this when I was almost 6 months pregnant, not realizing that it only gives workouts for the first and second trimester. Mostly my fault because I should've known I can't workout too much towards the end... but I really didn't like that for all the workouts, you need different equipment. You need weights, a stretch band, and an exercise ball. Make sure you have all the equipment before you start. Basically, I have no use for this DVD now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good inspiration","review":"The exercises were great. Unfortunately the exercises only went through the second trimester.

Normal earbuds tend to fall out of my ears constantly so I absolutely love the rubbery, flexible over-the-ear clips that keep these buds right in place. The clips don't even interfere with my glasses.Now, don't get me wrong, if you're looking for audiophile sound from a cheap pair of earbuds like these, you're kidding yourself. These are amazingly low priced and ideal for gym workouts, using with cheap flash-based mp3 players, and just general active use. They also don't block out sounds completely so they're convenient for using in situations where you need to be aware of things going on around you while listening to music.As for durability, I picked up a couple pairs and after years of wear and tear under all sorts of indoor and outdoor circumstances both pairs still work great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barely worth the price (and I got them for free)","review":"Okay, I have to admit -- I really have nothing to gripe about. I got a set of these for free with my Rio MP3 player. As you'd expect of the \\"standard equipment\\" that you get for free, they're junk. The sound is tolerable, but they're incredibly flimsy and no amount of squashing, stretching, twisting, or other manipulation could get them to stay in my ears if I was doing anything more active than sitting at my computer. You can simulate this effect by buying some Twizzlers at the store, wrapping them around your ears, and seeing how well they stay put. The soft rubber of these earpieces is very close to the same consistency.But really, would you expect anything more from a pair of $4 headphones? Probably not. The one thing I would recommend them for, based on their price, would be wearing them in situations where you want a cheap but usable pair, if you were concerned about them getting damaged or lost."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't fit","review":"I love the design and light-weight feel of these earbuds. I can't even tell that I'm wearing them.Unfortunately, the buds themselves are too large for my ear canals. Instead of going in my ear, they just rest on against my ear canal. So, I'm not getting the full effect of the bass and volume. Since I've always worn earbuds and never had this problem before, I think it's a design flaw.I'd only recommend these to people who don't listen to loud music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Work!!!","review":"This book is a good introduction to your chosen walk in Christ.

We have, admittedly had a hilarious set of mis-matched, bent, ugly silverware for years.... he wanted us to have one, nice, matching set. These were ok until about the 2nd or third time they went through the dishwasher. They ALL have rust spots all over them, both black and red rust, just hideous... I think I will probably need to get my tetanus booster just to keep using these! They are not high quality; they are made in China... so who knows what sort of chemical or alloy they use instead of stainless steel. Very disappointing. Also, they are very heavy and awkward. They don't lie flat together in the drawer because of the pyramid shaped handle. I would not buy these again.

I highly recommend this film despite this, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smashing","review":"If you are fan of the tough crime movies with some twists and comedy like \\"Snatch\\" and \\"Formula 51\\" you will probably enjoy it. Without saying to much, you have a guy is selling drugs to make money and get out of the business as quickly as possible. He doesn't see himself as a real drug dealer since he believes cocaine acceptable to society and he is just providing a product they want. Add to that the fact his boss doesn't want him getting out of the business and will take any steps to see that doesn't happen and you begin to see the dilemna. Of course there are a couple friends that help him out, but there is always the question of who you can trust, and a lesson to learn about how ladies can cause you problems you don't expect. I recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic.","review":"Great movie. Extremely satisfied with my purchase. Daniel Craig is an absolutely fantastic actor. If you like British crime movies, this is a must buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nearly flawless","review":"I can't understand the negative customer reviews of this film. After watching the deleted scenes it was apparent that the plot and characterizations were lean as could be. And as a fast study of the London mob it had flair, pacing, and surprises throughout. The acting was superbly believable, with a menace of tension, because Brits were cast and because of the sharp directing of Matthew Vaughn. It does help to have the English subtitles on or you'll miss developments, what with the pace and thick accents of some characters, which add to the color. I've seen the movie three times in the last nine years; the third time was the best - I picked up a dozen details I missed before. I was sorry to see the movie end. The interviews with Vaugn and Craig are well worth seeing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thick English Accents","review":"Do not buy this movie. It was made by the Britains and they used all English actors who all speak with thick british/Cockney Engish accents. I couldn't understand a word of what they said. Not only the accents, but the words they use in Britain that we are unfamiliar with in the USA. I had to have subtitles throughout the entire movie. Additionally, it was made with a budget of only 4 million pounds. Not a very good movie or story and impossible to understand because of the accents."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't miss this movie.","review":"I don't know how popular this movie is but it's a definite must watch if you're into any kind of crime movies.

I was waiting for the nice table and cake party, but all in the movie these men do is walk around serious and look at each other. They smoke and talk funny, and sometimes sit at a table and drink drinks. They need ballons and hats!!! The movie made me feel like small because I was always looking from under a table or behind a napkin on the floor and even through the cigigrates smokes (maybe that's why they all die in the end; remember, smoking hurts you!!) Even when they sit in nice club with girls there was no cake. I think this movie is tricky that way, because you think cake, party, and nice talkings, you have no talkings, just sad music and people who are mad and hurt. Maybe the movie is a lesson on why cake is important. Eat cake!!!! (Three more stars if even one slice, but only two today!!!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sour Cake","review":"I challenge anyone to explain the storyline of this movie. At half way thru this so called thriller, I ejected the dvd and it went directly to my rummage pile (aka eBay). Trying to follow the plot of this movie is like trying to cross a busy street blind folded. Entirely to many names/characters to remember let alone who's who. The dialog is hard to understand when spoken. As you totally start to loose what the movie is about you find yourself rewinding to try to gain the plot. I bought this movie because of the write up (hype) and because it stared Daniel Craig. With Craig in the main role, a 2010 release, I figured I had a winner. Couldn't have been be more wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch \\"Carlito's Way\\" instead","review":"This movie is a bad ripoff of \\"Carlito's Way.\\"Watch that instead.

Only problem were the British accents. They were heavier that I usually here in British flicke."},{"rating":"2","title":"No way out","review":"Commendable, very commendable. Great action, great character development and fantastic lead. I've been a fan of Mr. Brosnan since \\"The Long Good Friday\\" but Daniel Craig is sure to be an outstanding Bond as well.We've all seen the movies where the gangster is trying to get out. Sometimes he does, after tribulations (e.g., Sexy Beast), but most of the time he doesn't. And when he doesn't it's for the same reason. Any person involved in the drug trade, no matter how scrupulous, honest and hard-working, like Craig's \\"XXXX,\\" has to deal with the freaks, psychos and stoolies up and down the drug supply chain. Layer Cake exemplifies this problem as well as the \\"Carlito's Way\\" problem of overlooking that one crucial detail because of a love interest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Let's Have Another Slice","review":"Layer Cake is one of the best guy films of all time. However it accomplishes this without being stupid and is almost completely without action. What it does have is a great script and a sophisticated plot. The entire cast is great but Daniel Craig really becomes a star in this one. He shows off a talent similar to Harrison Ford where he is just easy to identify with and to root for. The film also has a terrific dark sense of humor. In my opinion this type of film makes a better gangster flick than something like \\"Pulp Fiction\\" because it is impressive when a film like this can follow a sophisitcated storyline and doesn't rely on gimmics like ultraviolence or showing the movie out of sequence. I really can't say enough about this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Modern Masterpiece","review":"Matthew Vaughn has put together what might be the coolest film in years. Each scene is beautifully done: the sets/locations, cinematography, script, and the acting never seem disjointed; they all complement one another. The only word I can think of to describe the film is 'tight'. No word or shot is wasted; nothing is half-hearted.The entire ensemble is terrific (and entirely believable in their roles), but I would single out Daniel Craig and Michael Gambon in particular for turning in what are easily my favorite performances from each. If you are fans of either, you will like this movie.The film's plot is a bit complicated, but that just means that it repays (and justifies!) rewatching.Finally, for better or worse, the film ends in a very different place than the book. Happily (for fans of the book), there are some deleted/alternate endings on the DVD which more closely approximate the book's ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very English and Dated","review":"Part of the problem I did not enjoy the video is that the language includes British slang that I just dont't get.

But this is also a plot-driven film about a newly born drug king who accumulates what he wants -- and then wants out. O, but easier said than done. I'm finding it difficult to pick out parts that are especially well done -- almost everything is a spoiler! Let me just say this is not an ordinary crime story. Though there are groups fighting for exclusive rights to drug distribution, the emphasis is on the main character and his intelligent scheming as he plans his climb up the ladder. He is a businessman. His blood is cold. He does not lose his cool. There is great story-telling in this movie. And there's a twisty ending. Tom Hardy and other up and comers of the time are in this in small parts as well. You won't be disappointed with this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"EPIC","review":"D. Craigs best film pre-Bond.

The premise, that for many women pregnancy is tentative for the first trimester because of fear of miscarriage and for the second trimester because of fear of negative results from the amnio really fits my experience. I was hoping this book would provide some validation and reassurance. It didn't.

It really does roll very nicely on my laminate floors, with no worries of scratching. This is my first child and first highchair and I couldn't be happier with my purchase. The design of this chair makes cleaning great and it does wipe down very nicely. I do like the smaller tray because I think it will be great to teach my son that he can't spread food everywhere. The white pad does seem like it could stain with some foods(it hasn't yet), so I thought that I might buy the orange pad too. Which would look good with the frosty blue color of the chair. I had read a few reviews that it might not fit bigger babies and have not had any troubles with my 8 month old big baby boy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great investment - we love it!","review":"This highchair is awesome. I say that pretty much only because of it's ease of cleaning. The tray can be quickly rinsed off in the sink and it comes with an extra insert if you want to throw one in the dishwasher. The seat is also easily cleaned with a wet towel since it's hard plastic and the padding is not cloth. The tray is very easy to install and remove and can be done with one hand once you get a feel for it.The pneumatic feature is neat, but it doesn't adjust enough to get overly excited about. It moves maybe 6-8 inches. The whole thing is also easy to move around since it has wheels but with the brake applied is very difficult to move. It's very stable as well. The one complaint I have is the safety belts being hard to clean. They are removable however so that makes it a little easier."},{"rating":"2","title":"good design","review":"Very functional high chair. It's worth the money, easy to install, easy to clean, easy to move around and keep still. And very stylish, too. We recommend this to modern parents who are looking for both functionality and style.

I highly recommend this product!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work as designed!!","review":"This chair would get a 5 star rating for design and use (both aesthetically, and mechanically). However, even after receiving a new pneumatic lift from Boon, the chair still will NOT lift up without my holding down the \\"orange button\\", and pulling up with both hands.And now, after only 3 months or so, the wheels from the bottom are popping off (I use my high chair on carpet). Before finding an actual wheel, I had found small metal balls on my carpet; and was clueless as to where they were coming from. Now I realize that they where ball bearings from the wheels.The quality and functionally of this chair makes me give it one star. It simply doesn't work. Next on my list is getting it fixed, or getting my money back. It pains me to write this review, because Boon is one of the few companies I normally buy products blindly from."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointed","review":"When I received this chair I was so disappointed. The reviews said the tray was small however I did not realize it would be so small that I could not fit a small bowl and a sippy cup on it. The plates I purchased for my son did not fit on it at all. The lift did not work well. I had to really push it hard for it to go down and pull for it to come up. the brake does not work if you have hard wood floors.

However, the pedestal design means that the chair has a super-high center of gravity and the chair moves when he does. Add the poor brake mechanism, and our baby (9months) slams himself into the back of the chair, or side to side, rythmically \\"walking\\" the chair across the room, and making lots of noise. Because this is more fun for him than eating, mealtime has become a chore.He's doing it right now. A chair with four solid legs will not move around like this one. I just took him out of the chair and threw the chair out the back door.Unless your baby doesn't move a muscle while eating, DO NOT buy this chair at any price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy This High Chair!","review":"I am a design junkie and bought this chair because it is one of the few out there that actually looks good in my contemporary kitchen. However, I have owned the high chair for less than a year and two of the wheels under the base have broken off. And they are broken in a way that cannot be repaired. We have not by any means abused this chair--it has only been rolled about 6ft at a time and only by an adult. With two of the wheels broken off, the chair won't roll at all without scratching my floor. And it is lopsided, wobbling back and forth on the base when my 14-month old sits in it. Furthermore, I think it is harder to clean than some of these reviews suggest. The white foam seat cushion stains with spaghetti sauce and the stains don't come out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brake wheel came off","review":"We have had this for about 6 months now. We love the looks and the fact that it is easy to clean. However, everything else seems to be a problem. The break does not work well on hardwood floors. I called up Boon customer service and they were of no help. Last week, the brake wheel came off. Also, I feel there is not enough room between my child and the tray. There are two different settings for locking the tray in place, however, even on the farthest setting, the tray pushes against her tummy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic High Chair","review":"Absolutely love this highchair!

I did not want a high chair that was big and bulky. This chair is sleek and simple. So easy to clean. The tray is a piece of cake to remove and I absolutely love the fact that the chair is on wheels. The hydraulic lift makes it easy to fit any table height. The light color is perfect and works with any decor. I have zero complaints about this purchase and would recommend it to all new parents."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cleaner alternative to fabric high chairs","review":"I bought this high chair after much research, and after owning a Baby Trend model.Pros: Easy to clean, much more sanitary, cool looking design, comes with two snap-on tray liners.Cons: Brakes don't work very well, tray is too small, shoulder straps are too easy to get out of, snap-in \\"buckle\\" falls right where tray rests against baby's belly, main tray is not dishwasher safe, tray liners do not cover entire tray (so you have to wash it every time anyway).Neutral: Though the pneumatic lift is a cool idea, as a mother who doesn't adjust the height of her high chair, I found it kind of silly and useless.Even though it appears from my review that the \\"cons\\" outweigh the \\"pros\\", I still give this chair 4 out of 5 stars simply because of how clean you can get it! You can take even the straps off and throw them in the washer.

Adams divides his book into four major sections (Geography; History; Legends, Literature and Art; and Gazetteer); this last mentioned section is by far the longest (almost half the book) and contains a listing with description of just about every named natural and human associated feature found in the Catskills. Anyone actually visiting the area will find this section very useful and informative.Within the other sections Adams discusses railroads, modern highways, early exploration, famous hotels, famous people, and the art and literature of the region. He relates quite a few legends in full. There are also lots of photos (current and historical).

I was using this for an ipod connection to my RCF ART sound system in my room, as well as allowing friends to borrow it if they needed to DJ on XLR speakers but didnt have XLR outs. It had some heavy use, but it should have lasted longer then this. A good idea would be to make the 3.5mm connection swappable, in case the cable breaks at the end like mine did.This works ok, but has static when disconnecting from one source to another like any 3.5 connection will. Turn down your speakers if you are using it to account for bumps and crackles. Also the plug is a bit loose, and I had to use electrical tape to secure it.

I am used to learning by starting with a basic program and implementing more and more features of the api step by step. In this I can ensure I have mastered the basic concepts before moving on. Unfortunetly this book does not use this technic. Although it starts with the basics and progresses, it does not have working examples of just the basic implementation. Therefore if you are confused by a particular section that does not have much practical code, then you are at a loss and will not be able to move on through the book since subsequent sections will be building upon the one that you may have stumbled on. Code snippets are just not enough for me to grasps the subject.

It is not a book on the basics, but for understanding the \\"whys\\" of COM, I haven't found one better. The only complaints I have about the book are:1) Although the book is pretty clear throughout, I still got lost on the monikor section. More real-world examples would help.2) Some small spelling errors in the code tripped me up in a couple of sections.3) I don't mind C++, but COM is supposed to be language-neutral, and it would've been great to see even more examples in VB, Java, etc.For any COM programmer, this should be one on the bookshelves.Jason"},{"rating":"1","title":"Think Twice","review":"This is not a book for learning COM.

As a VB5/6 and Delphi developer, after about seventy-five pages I realized that this book was a waste of my time. I recommend that the author look to books like Design Patterns to understand how to present topics in a more language-independent way. This might be a good book for C++ developers, but anyone else seeking a thorough understanding of COM (without suffering through an excruciating history of the C++ shortcomings that led to the development of COM in the first place) should look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"You will need a PhD in COMology to understand","review":"WOW!!!

Much to my dismay i found that the vast majority of examples are in VB.NET .If you're looking for a book about ASP.NET and C# STEER CLEAR of this one ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrox books downgraded from Strong Buy to Caution / Sell","review":"DON'T BUY THIS BOOK if this is the first book you are reading on ASP.NET.Even otherwise the book is very poorly organized. From now on i have decided i cannot buy a WROX book just by its reputation. There is a saying - \\"Once bitten twice shy\\". I have experienced this twice. Professional ASP XML was also very disjointed, the same thing was repeated by different authors in different chapters and was poorly organized. Wrox is definitely churning out books without any thought to quality. There is an exception. Professional SQL Server 2000 is excellent.Final advice - Skim through all chapters in a bookstore before buying. Wrox has lost its glory."},{"rating":"1","title":"Out of date","review":"Sadly to say, even though this is a newly released book, with the release of .NET beta 2, this book is already woefully out of date. The examples in the book and downloaded from the WROX simply do not work at all. So much has changed with the Beta 2 release of .NET that literally every example I have worked with does not work. This is not to say that a month ago or more, this book was a great value -- it probably was. But, today, I have found that this book is not usable. In fact, if you're learning coding syntax from this book, you'll be very surprised as to how much has already changed. Save your money and sanity and wait. After all, there's no reason to learn syntax that is no longer used."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great offering from WROX on ASP.NET!","review":"This one is a great offering from WROX on ASP.NET!It covers different ASP.net flavours,Garbage collection, web services, caching, datasets, windows services, threading (and thread pooling) and much more...The book also covers the .NET Common Language Runtime (or CLR for short) which provides a level of encapsulation between the developer and the operating system, thereby making writing Windows programs simpler.So the developer will no longer have to worry about low-level details such as memory management, pointer management, language differences, and other common annoyances.If you are an EXPERIENCED ASP Developer,currently developing with ASP 3.0, and are considering the implications of the .NET Framework, then this book is FOR YOU .It is aimed at experienced ASP developers who are working at the leading edge, rather than the casual ASP developer or beginner.You will also need Windows 2000 environment to test and run ASP.Net"},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely not Beta 2 -- Disappionting.","review":"As is, most examples do not work without major tweaking -- even the most simplest of examples. Many samples do not work in Beta 2 as .NET Beta 2 does not even recognize the syntax, let alone compile. Anyone who buys and reads through this book will immediately see this. Even the simple action of building a web method has changed from Beta 1 to Beta 2 and you will get an error when trying to compile.For coders out there, in the standard WROX method, you are fed the samples in the book one line at a time without having the beginning and ending sections (i.e., not the entire code)...making it impossible to type the code manually and being able run it. WROX does offer the samples as download, but once again, the samples do not work.I personally would wait until more ASP.NET books come out on the market. Many are scheduled soon. That way, you can be sure of examples that work. Very disappointed for such an expensive book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Reference","review":"Most of the .NET stuff to come out so far has been either a lot of fluff, or just redistribution of existing MSDN articles (with the exception of Introducing Microsoft .NET).Professional ASP.NET takes off where Programming Active Server Pages+ left off. This book is over 1000 pages of details for everything .NET.No, there isn't a C# section, but if you want to know about the GAC, how the CLR works, security, caching, and even the ASP.NET syntax, this is a great book.You'll find that this servers more than just an introduction. I use it as a reference book now for topics that I didn't get into on the first read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The first and the best","review":"This is a great book that not only introduces ASP.NET, but the main .NET framework classes and is updated to Beta 2 status. Almost all examples are in VB.NET. I would have liked to see more in C# as this seems to be the way that Microsoft is pushing. I would have given 5 stars for C# sample code."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully Shot","review":"The biggest strength of \\"After Roberto\\" is the lighting and composition within the frame; the look of the film a nice medium between the Noir and Italian Neorealistic styles. Using a great contrast of colors from bold reds to pastel greens, the filmmakers never failed in framing their subjects or utilizing their beautiful shooting-locations in an interesting fashion.While the use of novice actors was somewhat apparent, I didn't think it detracted from the style; a lot of early Italian Neorealist films employed the same technique. In fact, I felt the acting style fit the tone of the material appropriately."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"Leonard Rose is an incredible cellist, and this album really showcases his amazing talent!

The switch is attached to the metal body by a threaded plastic flange. Each of these has just snapped off in my hand when turning the light on. The first one was after 6 months of daily use in an optometry office. It was replaced under the warranty. The replacement did the same thing at about 9 months. I liked the light enough to buy another one, but alas 13 months later it met the same fate and is past the one year warranty.

I knew it was expensive but it was a gift so it was nice to have. It's a bit heavy in the pocket, but it has a sleek stylish design. The light is a halogen bulb that I think finds the right medium between a regular bulb and the very bright LED light. I was fine with the product until I dropped it from a distance of 2 feet on the floor and it ceased to work. I temporarily placed the bulb of my friend's Welch allyn pocket light on my penlight and it worked again. First, the bulb broke from a drop of 2 feet! Come on! Second when I looked for replacement bulbs they are $25! That is 4x the price of complete pen lights.

I had the pen fall out of my pants pocket while I was seated in a chair just a few feet off the ground & it stopped working. There wasn't any cosmetic damage and it landed on the side (barrel). I replaced the halogen lamp ($17!) and it worked again until the exact same thing happened again a week or so later.You can argue that being dropped out of a pocket isn't \\"every day use\\", but it's going to happen every once in a while. A premium product made to live in pockets should be able to survive a short fall without becoming unusable IMO... cosmetic damage is fine but the bulb breaks and it becomes useless.

Most of the music on this live CD wouldn't be out of place on a Quiet Storm type jazz radio station and, sure, that doesn't make it bad - just not what I'd hoped for. When he does try to show passion McLaughlin ends up playing scales - very fast scales certainly - but scales nevertheless.

This is the ticket.\\"Heartaches & Harmonies\\" is fully comprehensive; it chronologically lists the songs from 1951 to 1990, and thankfully includes much of the duo's latter output, most of which is on par with anything they did in the classic 50's period.Any re-recording/remastering that's been done has been polished to a tee (thank you Rhino records! Kings of the box set!), and they've done a great job of condensing the Everly's considerable discography.No self-respecting fan of rock and roll should be without this box set; it's been lovingly crafted using the brothers as springboards to their own material, offering tidbits of information as to how the songs were inspired (and even a little bit of trivia)."},{"rating":"1","title":"DL Swivel Tongue Jack 3400","review":"When I bought the boat new in Sept. of 2006 the DL Swivel Tongue Jack 3400 came with it.

There are numerous recordings of the piano concerti, many of them (Collard, Licad, etc) very very good. I still think Entremont has them beat in these two. The Zukerman rendition of the Introduction and Rondo is top notch, as is the Rose interpretation of the cello concerto. The sonics, (while not 2012 standards) are fine for anyone except obsessive audiophiles.So what's at risk?

The one I normally use is in storage so I bought this one this year. First of all, it doesn't even saw through the pumpkin when you push the button. It just, stops. I literally had to manually saw the pattern which completely goes against buying this product in the first place. Also, the poker doesn't attach to the device like other carvers so you nearly kill your hand manually poking the pattern on. Again, against why you'd buy this product.

It wouldn't have taken more than a few cents more to make this product useful.

My cat is only allowed indoors and loves cat grass. After following the instructions to a tee, I waited the 4 - 6 days as instructed to wait for the grass. When I went back to check on growth, I saw one or two shoots coming out and a green fuzz all over the soil. Also, in the window that I had placed the planter to grow, was an influx of flying insects that were not there prior to the introduction of the planter. The only way those insects could have appeared exactly at the window where the planter was, is if they came from the planter itself. Needless to say, I threw away the grass and will have to look for other sources.

It was a meandering, plotless story, lacking utterly in the humor, romance, excitement, and pace of the first. The characters were as drab as the setting. The writing felt self-conscious; the dilemmas were tepid; worst of all, Michael totally lost his spark. He was not believable as a male -- or even as much of a person. Pretty much a sidekick dishrag.

First of all, Patrick's basic strategy is wrong. He admits it and gloats about it. What he doesn't tell you is that basic strategy is THE OPTIMAL way to play if you're not counting cards. Any deviations, such as the ones Patrick recommends, will cost you money. Second, he recommends that you play on hunches. This will also cost you money. If you are looking for good books on blackjack, look for books by Wong, Snyder, Uston, Carlson, Schlesinger, etc. Avoid all books by Patrick and you will do well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this book!","review":"The arrogance and gall of this man is unbelievable.

He admits to being incapable of using computers to determining how to play. Therefore, he starts with the general consensus (from competent analysts) on how to play then changes it with his own feelings (superstitions I guess).

This needs to be vastly improved to be effective, useful and widely used in sports. It is a good first step, but the vinyl used does not breathe. This also cost nothing to produce, and to sell a little bit of vinyl and padding for $30 is ripping off people that are desperate after they suffer a concussion.

With The Wishbones and Election, I became an even bigger fan. Now with Joe College, I'm convinced that Tom Perrotta is one of the funniest and most insightful writers around. For all of us middle-aging men who were too young to be babyboomers and too old to be a part of Generation X, Joe College's Danny perfectly captures the mindset of the unnamed generation. With sly humor and just enough introspection, Perrotta's Danny is the perfect protagonist of the Reagan years, caught between being Joe College and Joe Average.

Four head-crushed beercans for Tom Perotta, whose recreation of Yalie life ca. 1979-83 has the light touch of a Nick Hornsby novel. Running through the junior year of a Jersey-born English major, \\"Joe College\\" allows themes from (a) to peep through, with the blitheness of a first novel from the Warren Wilson School school. Pencil Dick shares a dorm suite, dates, studies, and on vacations fills in for his dad on the lunch wagon. The series of episodes are strung together with expertise.

The first half of the book brings you ever deeper in the life of Danny, a confused Yale Junior. He is conflicted by the discontinuity of his life in New Haven and that of his family and friends in New Jersey.While the events are interesting, the remainder of the book does not do much to show how Danny grows or matures. Several plot lines are tied up in the conclusion, but one is left with the feeling that the book was simply a list of things that happen to Danny and that there is no underlying theme."},{"rating":"2","title":"Town and Gown","review":"Danny is an introspective, intelligent kid from working class New Jersey going through his Junior year as an English major at Yale in the early eighties. He doesn't fit in at home in New Jersey but seems to fit in at Yale even though all his friends come from wealthy upper class families. The most interesting parts of the book take place back home in NJ with his parents, his friends or his summer fling with a local girl. He is a likable kid even though he doesn't always make the conventional right decision. He can be self centered but even those selfish decisions end up OK. Most of the book is the ordinary that most of us experience but the author does add in a few dramatic elements that speed things up without distracting too much from Joe College. All the characters are what you would expect in the real world - shades of grey versus black or white."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Great...","review":"I didn't DISLIKE this book but I found it to be airy...insubstantial.

The murder of an undercover cop in her apartment kicks things off, but it never goes anywhere that interesting. Might actually be better as a movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful,lame mystery","review":"Can anyone get a book published today? This book gives proof that this is so.

This was a time in which social critics and \\"self-help\\" authors were beginning to take over some of the authority formerly held by the church on moral issues, and Hogarth was in the vanguard of those attempting to illustrate how personal liberty if unchecked by good behavior could descend into licentiousness and ruin. Among other interesting topics covered are Hogarth's feelings about the British class system (having risen from modest origins through an apprenticeship as a silver engraver to fame and fortune as an artist and printmaker), his sympathy for the lower classes, and his antipathy to the artistic establishment which overvalued trite and derivative Continental art on religious and mythological themes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Work Out Music: Not","review":"I found this to be \\"jumpy\\" and inconsistent, with a really poor beat.

A few months ago I opened a can of the Venison & Green Pea canned food and found a piece of flexible plastic cooked into their food.

I was given a replacement can as well as coupons and an apology for the incident. I continued to feed them the canned Vension & Green Pea, but lo and behold, a few months later and we're experiencing the same thing! This time there was a big piece of green plastic in the canned food. I will be notifying the manufacturer again and sending the can back to them as before (hopefully they can test to see exactly what happened), and I will no longer be using this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Counterfeit? Or lousy quality control?","review":"I also have had inconsistent results with this product. In addition, the labels on the cans aren't always the same--one indeed looks completely fraudulent. Another is dimmer and the contents were a slick, pasty substance that looked cheap and SIGNIFICANTLY different from cans that have more legitimate looking labels (they look brighter, crisper as if done on a proper printer, not some fly-by-night).So either they get their stuff from different suppliers with haphazard quality control in some cases or, as with SO many other products from drugs to DVDs, someone is canning some [...]crap and passing it off as Natural Balance.

It was very helpful for me in learning about what goes on behind the scenes when scripts run on a web server, how environment variables work, etc. If you want a clearer understanding of how scripts actually work, get this book.

Not saying that the first half was any good, either - the program sources themselves were riddled with continuity errors. Variable names changed from one reference to another in the same program. The author also took very little time to make sure the reader understood what was going on; too often he would cite code 'snippets' that did exactly what they were supposed to do, but then didn't tell you how to fit them together to actually make them WORK.

It was very discouraging to spend the time working on programs only to discover that the system will not accept the program specifications.

There is not a single thing in this book that fans don't already know, and Joyce Luck's Melissa biography (which was also unauthorized, though I hear Melissa and her management liked the book) at least had some new, previously unpublished info and photos in it. Plus Nickson's book is just riddled with errors (for example, it says John Shanks was with the band during the Never Enough tour, which is totally false). One good thing about Nickson is that he at least doesn't have a problem with Melissa's lesbianism.

I was facinated to read about the desperate children who's lives depended on the social workers. This book put us into the perspective of the social workers and gave us insight into what was involved with the job. Marc Parent does an excellent job of avoiding blame at the perpetrator and makes the reader empathize with every story in the book.

He also tells how it is a good fight though and how the kids need the help. Every case Marc tells about really keeps your attention and the outcome can be shocking. You really start to feel for all of the children that are abused in one way or another.

In these cases he tells of situations were he is able to find the killer of a child, to stopping a boy from killing his infant brother over the phone. Not all of his cases were a success though. Parent also tells of cases of that he was not sure he should have taken a child or not being able to find the rappist of an eight year old girl, and ultimatly letting a baby die when he could have saved him.

The book tells about some cases Parent was involved with when he worked in New York at a children services place. The stories are troubling because they are things that should not happen to children but do. The author goes into detail about each case and what infuences him and his colleagues decisions. The book shows the reader that there are children with some major problems and they need help. Parent goes on to say that the service workers are doing what they can but more people needed. When someone tries to help, the person should realize that they do not need to try and fix the world all at once, but to help one individual at a time. The book is very well written and will keep the reader's attention."},{"rating":"2","title":"Someone Please Save These Children","review":"The book \\"Turning Stones\\" was so emotional, I don't know where to begin. There was so much sadness reading about the defenseless children, so much anger reading about the violence, and so much respect for the caseworkers trying to stop it all. My first reaction to the book was sadness for the children who have to endure the pain of not having the love and support they need from their parent(s). I can't even begin to imagine how hard it would be to grow up not having enough to eat, or not being able to play outside. It is no wonder we have so much violence in schools today; these children are growing up with violence all around them. And yet, we can't put all the blame on the parent(s). The way the stories are told, it makes most of the parents seem like hardworking people who are trying to do the best by their children, but don't have the ability to do so. Something needs to be done to help these children from the lives they are forced into."},{"rating":"2","title":"Turning Stones Review","review":"This book is very realistic. It puts in perspective what social workers really go through on a daliy basis and the life-saving decisions that they make. Some of the cases that are in the book involve abuse situations, parents who have gone crazy, and parents who are alcholics or drug addicts.

Every once and a while there is a section of dialogue that may be a bit confusing, but those are few and far between. The descriptions of the most disturbing things imaginable make the book come to life and as a reader I was able to place myself in his shoes and see what he saw. This book is definitely no bedtime story and is not for the easily offended, but for anyone else, I highly recommend this book. -A.P."},{"rating":"2","title":"Turning your perspectives on life.","review":"In this book Marc Parent finds a way to relate to all people through the use of humor and emotions. He makes you feel emotion and allows you to understand what each case is about. He also lets you decide for yourself the case and the actions that are needed, before he actually tells you the outcome. Parent makes you understand the way all of the people feel and shows how hard it would be to sustain a job in child welfare. By using great dialoge throughout the book you get to know what his thought processes were when he was reviewing the cases. A book that will captivate you and make you want to read on. It also helps you understand the life of this social worker and possibly the behind closed door areas of Child Welfare.JR"},{"rating":"2","title":"Turning Stones","review":"Marc Parent's uniquely descriptive writing style made this book very interesting. Parent created many vivid images that really grab your attention, to the point where you can't put the book down.Parent writes about his experiences during his four year employment at Emergency Children's Services. His descriptions of these experiences are very powerful, and they make you realize how big the problem of child abuse is. Parent colorfully describes the difficulty of working these cases, which many times include removal of children from their parents.

That purpose is to give an example of how one person can change the world if he puts his mind to the task and is willing to sacrifice maybe everything to that purpose. His tireless defense of the children of the night in NYC is something that everyone should strive to be, even if they can only save one. Parent's style of writing might be hard to follow, but the thoughts follow logically and it feels just how I would use totally unrelated events to lead into my main point. His emotional involvement in the lives of \\"his\\" children is evident by the first chapter, and this book will make you feel that same emotional attachment. Very hard to put down."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book that is depressing but also very hard to put down.","review":"Turning Stones by Marc Parent is by far one of the best books I've ever read. I think I learned a lot from reading it, and it definitely open my eyes to a dark, grim aspect of childhood that I never experienced. One of the book's best qualitites is the way Marc uses description in telling his stories. Sometimes I felt like I were there. I also found some parts to be humorous. I enjoyed the open window to Marc's mind as he would often write his thoughts in italics. On the other hand, the book is full of unhappy endings and I often felt frustrated because things turn out the way they shouldn't. I strongly recommend that anyone read this book. It will open one's eyes to the vicious things some children must live with, yet in some way you feel better after you've finished the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Turning Stones","review":"Marc Parent's book titled Turning Stones is more less a story of his profesion and how he got it. He starts the book by telling about his childhood in Wisconsin and how it compares to the lives of children in New York. His charachters become real. The drama in this book is like nothing I have ever read before. The bad thing about it is, it is real. He also gives the book life by adding quotes as if it is actually happening as you are reading it. The stories are powerfull and compell you to keep turning the pages. Some of these stories are not just about children in danger but of thier parents as well. This is a book that everyone can relate to. Whether it is moving from a small town to a big city or an abusive husband and of course, children that need help.

Parent does a good job of putting you in the story and making you feel as if you were really there. This was a very good book, and it reached me in, a way I never expected.

With a strong personality and a warm heart he tells of his \\"days and nights\\" at ECS protecting children from what could potentially be a horrible life. This book explains everything that social workers must go through to do their job and do it right. He is a wonderful author who draws in his readers by his writing that captures the mind and heart when reading of all the lives he has potentially saved. This book was a real eye opener to me. I had no idea how difficult and exaushting, emotionally, mentally, and physcially a social workers job could be. I give abundant praise to those who do this work becuase in the end they make a big differnce to a lot of little people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review of Turning Stones by Marc Parent","review":"I found this book to be appealing yet horrifying at the same time. I really liked the description and how he gave you a mental picture of almost everything: places, people background, etc. Yet I found the cases he talked about to be very disturbing. Although the kind of cases he used were probably the best because it gets the reader involved even more. It really gets to you emotionally. This book is very good to read and will keep you in suspense waiting to finish the page so you can move on to the next."},{"rating":"2","title":"Required reading for educators?","review":"\\"Turning Stones\\" was not only a page turner it was educational and informative.

Before reading the book I thought of human services as people who break up families for little or no reason at all. Marc Parent has shown that the DHS workers do not want to pull these children out. He shows that some situations are bad enough to require the removal of children. I would not have ever dreamed that these situations that these kids have to face is real. Be aware that at times this book is graphic when depicting the cases that Marc faces. Remember that these cases are real and for that reason I have gained much more respect for social workers."},{"rating":"2","title":"You never will be able to put it down.","review":"Turning Stones will open your eyes to the real world through the accounts of a social worker from wisconsin.

Marc Parent is a very good writer and paints a vivide picture when telling a story. He is very down to earth and tells it how it is. He gives the reader a taste of the emotion he felt during each one of his cases. Marc Parent is by far one of the best writers i have encountered because of the way he made this topic interesting. The only downfall to this book would be how long it is. I feel that it gets repetitive and a couple of the stories could be left out. Other than that this is a great book.

Marc Parent tells his story while he works on the streets of New York City trying to make a difference in the lives of the people he meets. He has to decide whether or not parents are capable of caring for their children. The stories in this book are unsettling at best. They make you wonder what the people in this world are truly capable of. This is a book that people should read because it not only lets us know what some parents are doing, it also lets us into the life of the caseworker. Most people don't know exactly what caseworkers do, this book tells us how they do their jobs and the kinds of situations that they are put into everyday. It is a book that is both wonderful and disturbing. It should definitely be read by all.J.G."},{"rating":"2","title":"I hope to turn stones","review":"I read this book before I started working with children at risk and this book created so many feelings of confusion and questions in my inner soul. Why do parents treat their children like this? What can we do to help parents STOP abusing and neglecting their children? Are people capable of changing and becoming good parents? Nobody knows the answers, but everyone knows that what human services agencies are doing now is NOT creating change. How many children have to die before changes, that make a difference, are made?

The children, the parents, the pain of their situations all wear us down. After twenty-five years in child protective services I am content to push papers ... I thought! Anyone who has ever left a child in the home and that child suffered re-injury or death, needs to know that they are not alone.The reasons we do this critical work cannot get lost in political arguments about the imperfections of \\"the system\\" or conservative rhetoric about the sanctity of family life and the intrusiveness of governmemt.

Whey protein is a processed substance = NOT PALEO. Brown Rice is a rice = a grain = NOT PALEO. Sugar alcohols are a processed subtance and a variation on sugar and therefore...you guessed it...NOT PALEO. There might be varitations of the paleo diet that allow dairy but the dairy should be raw unpasturised, unhomogenised milk from grass fed cows, butter from the same source or cream from the same source and only if your not lacto intollerent.These bars are not paleo but are trying to take advantage of people who are trying to live a clean lifestyle. If you need these bars your not eating paleo.

But, there are sugar alcohols which anyone who knows anything about paleo knows that they metabolize in your liver the EXACT same way that High Fructose Corn Syrup does. 3rd: The proteins in this bar are derived from two main sources: Whey Protein Isolate and Rice Protein Concentrate. So, we have a Paleo bar with the proteins derived from Dairy and Grain- the two biggest no no's of the paleo diet. I am quite disappointed in this product.

It is working fine so far.Initially it looked bulky, but after fixing it in the port, it looked ok. I fix it in the port adjacent to the hand brake in my Toyota Corolla. Fixing in this port prevents the hand brake to be lifted & put on, which is a blessing a disguise. When I turn off the car, I put on the hand brake. Thus I remember to remove the inverter before putting on the hand brake (power inverters should ideally be removed from the port when the engine is not running).I have charged my cell phone, headset & PDA using this device.

Getting it to work right was a little difficult, but I eventually succeeded. What worked for me was to put the transmitter on the front part of the fork, not the rear. For some reason, I got no signal at all if the transmitter was mounted to the rear of the fork, but it worked fine in front. It seemed finicky to me, but at least I got it to work.This spring, I replaced all the batteries - in the transmitter and the head unit. Then I went on a ride. It worked fine for 20 minutes, then the display went to 0.0 mph. Then it came on. Then it went off. I replaced the batteries again (checked them with a voltmeter first to make sure they were good) and same thing. Very erratic. I contacted Cateye Tech support (email only these days - even the phone # tells you to email them) and got no response. Twice.I'd like a little more reliable unit.

It also tracks trip distance & total trip distance, as well as time. There are different memory settings that you can use to track all of this information.

It was easy to install, a snap to get going, and it does everything advertised.The problem is that Cateye has paired this great computer with a really poorly designed clip that attaches to your bike's handlebar. After only a week of riding with it, the little tab that releases the computer body broke off. It is a small tab that is connected to the rest of the holder with only 2 tiny slivers of plastic. After a ride I punched it down and it popped off. The result is that the next time I went riding the computer flew off somewhere out there. Fix the holder and it would be great."},{"rating":"2","title":"manual start/stop feature a plus","review":"The manual start/stop is the most important feature to me. It's the only way to save all my data at the end of a ride while I'm still on the bike cooling down. Most computers are exclusively auto start/stop, other than the bottom end generic ones that only have manual start/stop or the very expensive ones that have both auto and manual. The only con I have is it could be a little brighter display."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great with two minor complaints","review":"This is my third cycle computer, and there's quite a bit I like about it; first, it looks cool and is relatively compact. It has every feature I would want, and so far doesn't seem to interfere with my chest-mounted heart rate monitor. This is easily the best fork-mounted wireless sensor available (compared to Sigma and Blackburn), as it's small and solid. It's relatively easy to use, the backlight feature is helpful at dusk.Now the complaints: The instructions are the worst I have ever seen on any product I have ever purchased. Cateye should be ashamed of themselves, and if you decided not to purchase this for this reason alone, I wouldn't blame you. also, the plastic tie system for adhering the computer to the stem or handlebars is cheap, and doesn't cinch tightly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flamenco meets Cuba","review":"Excellent dual DVDs.

Released a month after the TV series ended, \\"The Birds, The Bees & The Monkees\\" (1968) marked the beginning of the band's commercial decline. Happily, the \\"Head\\" soundtrack recaptured the Monkee spirit one last time."},{"rating":"2","title":"YOU LOVE MONKKES?...YOU'LL LOVE THIS!","review":"Here's a run down of the original Birds, Bees & Monkees LP (4/22/68).01. Dream World - a good opener, w/ it's harpsichord & Broadway rock overtones.02. Auntie's Municipal Court - this song would be one of the Byrd's best.03. We Were Made For Each Other - a production that fell from the heavens.04. Tapioca Tundra - wouldn't the Stones have killed for something this strong?05. Daydream Believer - simply a CLASSIC!06. Writing Wrongs - Powerful and haunting. It sounds like early Deep Purple.07. I'll Be Back Upon My Feet - It's kind of a Motown hoedown nugget.08. The Poster - Mr. Kite gone \\"pop\\" catchy.09. P.O. Box 9847 - Boyce & Hart go groovy.10. Magnolia Simms - a great roaring 20's ditty...but even better in MONO!11. Valleri - by the sound of this rocker, Valleri must have looked really fine!12.

Following the terrific \\"Pisces, Aquarius, Capricorn & Jones\\" album, the Monkees turned in their weakest effort to date. The group would never again collaborate like on \\"Headquarters\\" and what you have here is basically each Monkee with his own cast of backup musicians churning out stagnant, unengaging music. The only salvation is Mike Nesmith, whose \\"Tapioca Tundra\\", \\"Auntie's Municipal Court\\" and \\"Writing Wrongs\\" showed his continued musical growth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very . . . interesting . . .","review":"They weren't kidding when they said this album was eclectic. Several of the songs, particularly Nez's, are very unusual, and they're good for a laugh, especially \\"Magnolia Simms.\\" But it is a good album, don't get me wrong. There are some very beautiful songs here, particularly Davy's \\"We Were Made for Each Other,\\" \\"Daydream Believer\\" (my all-time fave song!), and the rockin' \\"Valleri,\\" heard here in a fade-out version, different than the one heard on the Monkees' TV show eppie \\"The Monkees Blow Their Minds.\\" Micky has some good songs too: \\"I'll Be Back Upon My Feet\\" and \\"P.O. Box 9847.\\" Peter's \\"Lady's Baby\\" sounds better here; the baby sounds make it more realistic! \\"Alvin\\" and \\"Zor and Zam\\" are very goofy and silly songs. All in all, another winner!

Simply original 12 track album, STEREO MIX. Nothing else. No bonus tracks. Considering MONO mixes are mostly superior, the 3CD box of this album is actually a must have. For a new fan, I suppose this is ok. Yet the older RHINO CD release had great bonus material, as well as a nice multiple foldout booklet w pictures and essay. I'm sorry I opened it, was hoping for a new booklet. i'll just give it to a youngster to blow their little minds. (This review is of the new 2012 Rhino 'Flashback' series release. Exact same front and back cover of original CD, but no bonus tracks)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak","review":"This was a weak album -- a disappointing follow-up to the superior 'Pisces' LP, and the end of the Monkees' artistic winning streak. There are several very weak Davy songs on this record (including some he co-wrote himself like 'Dream World' and 'The Poster'). These drag down the rest of the record, but there is plenty of blame to go around. Pretentious tracks like 'Zor and Zam' and 'P.O. Box 9847' ultimately don't have anything new to say. The two very good tracks, 'Daydream Believer' and 'Valleri' were actually recorded previously to this album's sessions, and seem to be included here to bolster a bad product -- it helps, but not enough. Although 'Auntie's Municipal Court' is decent, the sole original gem here is Mike's 'Tapioca Tundra' -- a weird, but very good Latin-influenced rock song. The bonus tracks are nothing special."},{"rating":"1","title":"garbage","review":"two good songs: daydream believer, aunties municipal court. one song done better elsewhere: valleri. all the rest is either pathetic outtakes from their first albums which deserved to be left in the can, or \\"artistic expressions\\" like the unlistenable writing wrongs. i enjoy listening to the monkees, but really all you need is a 60 minute tape, taking great care to eliminate anything with davy jones unlistenable croak as a lead \\"vocal\\" (notable exceptions: the two above). sorry monkee fans: this album proves that these guys shouldve stuck to acting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bubblegum and Psychedelic","review":"An uneven mix of the group's bubblegum pop and psychedelic musings. I've always felt that \\"Daydream Believer\\" was a classic, mainly because of its theme of young married life. \\"I'll Be Back Upon My Feet\\" is a sly story about a guy who can't make a committment beyond a one night stand, while \\"Valleri\\" is pure pop froth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two hit singles and a load of filler.","review":"Probably the weakest album the Monkees realeased as a foursome. Adding the previously realeased hit singles \\"Valerie\\" and \\"Daydream Believer\\" gave this album some credibility, but after these two songs the quality of songs hits rock bottom. Mike sabotaged this album with some of his worst efforts ever to be recorded, and Peter is not even featured as a writer or singer.

This novel is bloody awful, but I gave it an extra star for the Sapphic sistahs in the third \\"movement.\\" Much coffee is consumed hereabouts, sometimes at the Cambridge Starbucks.

I agree the father isn't a well-developed character, but such sadism does exist. Maybe as a Nina-like character (an editor who loves carriage houses), I could relate more than most.

The power of their live show can be felt on some of these songs but others lack energy. There are only 2 songs from the first album and 1 from the second, while 4 songs come from Citadel (3rd release). By this time the band started to abandon some of the musical adventurism for a more \\"pop\\" sound, probably the result of bad advise from record execs.

I called Sony and they said I would have to mail it back so they could check it out. I asked if there was a local place to bring it and they said no, you just have to mail back (at my expense). I am just going to return it to the place I purchased it and look for another sturdier model Very disappointed.

I don't like that shuffle-repeat mode isn't randomized; it shuffles then replays in the same order. You have to open the CD lid and close it again then re-select shuffle-repeat to reshuffle in a different order.The deal-breaker, though, is that the CD player stopped working -- twice. I've gone through two of these radios in three years; in both cases the CD player quit working after about 18 months. The player simply won't read the disk. From looking at reviews of other Sony products, this is a brand-wide issue.

Despite some negative reviews on the sound quality, I took a chance for 60 bucks. The sound quality is better than expected and better than my old Sony box. This player can hit decent volume without distorting. The Megabass feature does make a difference, adding some bottom and definition to bass guitar and bass drum tracks. It should just be called \\"Bass\\" though as there is nothing \\"Mega\\" about it. I guess some reviewers were expecting the bass of an 80's ghetto blaster and were disappointed. I have not tried the radio nor the tape feature to give any opinion on those, but as a portable CD player, this Sony boom box sounds fine and is great for the price. The remote control is a terrific plus."},{"rating":"1","title":"Arrived broken/ poorly packaged","review":"The cd player arrived broken, with a dent in front.

The bass boost, however, doesn't seem to make much difference. Radio reception is good, in fact better than expected, and the automatic stops for cassette tapes prevent wrecking the clutch if you're ever distracted at the end of the tape.

Now it will not play any cd's. Now that we have broken the sleep time routine, my baby will not fall asleep and I am extremely frustrated. The item should not stop working after 5 months. I purchased this item due to the good reviews. I spoke to Sony today and they said I would have to pay $31 for a replacement unit. I paid $77 total at amazon and should not be asked to pay another $31 for a unit that should still be working. I posted a complaint at sonysyle.com which is all that I can do.

Since we still have a few audio cassette tapes we like to listen to, this unit seemed like a good combination audio player for us. However, on both units the PLAY buttons have broken. I can now see how poorly and cheaply designed these button are made.Called Sony on the phone...here is their best offer. They want me to ship both units to them, at my cost of course. While they will include the buttons at no charge (approx $2.00 each) the labor to replace them will run about $77.00 per unit! Interesting the labor charge alone is about the same cost as a new unit!

I paid nearly $100 CAN ($80 USD) for this including shipping. I bought it because I thought when a product has the name sony, is expensive and is highly rated it has to be good. However, I don't think it is a good product even if you get it for half that price.Bottom line is I would have spend my money on something else if I knew how bad the sound was.

So sad I bought multiple bottles, don't know what to do with them."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed.....again!","review":"I'm a really big fan of Ani Dr Franco. She's an awesome musician and obviously a great live performer. So I keep wanting a dvd of her in a live performance. I bought \\"Render\\" first and now \\"Trust\\" and unfortunately got the same thing both times. I got \\"ART\\"...instead of art. Trust (like Render before it) is much less a real performance tape than some kind of self-indulgent excercise by someone (Danny Clinch and Ani I guess) in \\"filmmaking\\". Trust might be a little better that Render in this regard..but not much. After one viewing I'm now like the other reviewer of Trust who just listens to the music playing without watching. It's too frustrating to watch because what I really want to see is Ani Di Franco singing and playing the guitar...not politics...not \\"ART\\"...and not \\"CINEMA\\". Ani, Please try again and just PLAY!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the best...","review":"I am a die hard Ani fan, the woman is like a light to my life and I learn so much from her music... I often watch the DVD and feel connected to her, but I want more of a connection. I find that music DVD's often provide a way for the fan to connect on a new level with the artist, hear them speak or see what they look like when they wake up, etc. So, it was nice to see the background of an Ani concert... but I have to say I've seen better concerts. In the end, it was worth it and I love this woman, but it could have been done better."},{"rating":"1","title":"And then there were two....","review":"\\"Changes\\" is only for the serious Monkee fans. It's sad that the band ended up as just the two doing vocals tracks to what Davy has since called a \\"Jeff Berry solo album.\\" (The album was produced by Jeff Berry.) In fact Davy only sings on four of the origional tracks, and one, \\"Peculiar,\\" is not new, just a leftover from the Boyce/Hart vault. I can remember many of these tracks from the CBS Saturday morning reruns of the TV show when new songs replaced some of the old classics. But these songs are not The Monkees. The three new songs added when Rhino released Changes on CD are worth a listen, and I wonder why they were not on the album when it was first released in 1970. The era ends here with a wimper, but it could have been worse. What if Davy or Micky left and the other wanted to continue? Hey hey, I'm the Monkee!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A tatty end for the monkees","review":"This was the Monkees final LP, (before the reunions that is). Most of the tracks have an assembly line feel which is really depressing. The exceptions are the following: Midnight Train - one of Dolenz' best, it sounds totally different to the rest of this sorry album. It predates most of the songs on Changes and would have been far more at home on the The Monkees Present, it was recorded at the sessions for that LP. The rest of the LP fails to rise above a mediocre level, not a good look! Two disillusioned artists on automatic pilot."},{"rating":"1","title":"It isn't worth it","review":"Thought about buying this album to see if it's as bad as you hear it is? Well, it is. Trust me. Most of the album is nothing but bland '60s pop with only Davy and Micky. Both sides of the single released with this album (\\"Oh My My\\" and \\"I Love You Better\\") are pretty manageable, \\"99 Pounds\\" is a nice change of pace (actually rocks out). But all of the rest of the songs sound the same. I'd give this album one star, but it was recorded against the Monkees' will. They were only fulfilling their contract to Colgems after Mike and Peter left. They hated this album as much as everyone else who'll listen to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A sad end","review":"Oh, this is bleak. The end (for a while) of the Monkees is hard to listen to, despite a few standout tracks. A little bit of Micky solo, a little bit of Davy solo, and some cold, uninspired production and performances. Even the cover art is depressing. The bonus tracks are better material than the original LP tracks. Recommended even so to Monkees completists, but not to listen to very often."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dismal Demise","review":"This album sucked when it was first released.

Here is the proof."},{"rating":"1","title":"Monkee Finale","review":"Mike Nesmith's 1970 exit didn't stop Micky Dolenz and Davy Jones from fulfilling their Monkees contract. The result was \\"Changes,\\" a mediocre pop-rock effort with few bright spots. However, it's not the \\"cardboard tombstone\\" some critics have claimed. \\"Oh My My\\" (the album's only single) is a terrific rocker sung with gusto by Dolenz, who also rises to the occasion on \\"Midnight Train\\" and \\"I Love You Better.\\" Jones' ballads remain as schmaltzy as ever, but he delivers a lively \\"99 Pounds.\\" Though a half-hearted finale, \\"Changes\\" is easier to take than Micky, Davy and Peter's disastrous \\"Pool It!\\" reunion in 1987."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounds just about the way you'd expect it to...","review":"A sad, dreary little album...the end of an era. There are three standout tracks, however: the opener(and the only single from \\"Changes\\"), 'Oh My My', which is a brilliant, shuffling downbeat rocker with some nice lead guitar and a heartfelt, soulful vocal by Micky; Davy's '99 Pounds', a punky barnstormer of a song; and 'Midnight Train', a rollicking country-bluegrass number with another Micky vocal. Apart from these tracks the album is a pretty grim affair, but still interesting for hardcore Monkees fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Underrated","review":"This is a very underrated album. I understand that Peter and Mike are missing but give it a chance- great songwriting-great singing- and great instrumentation. Actually, it's one of my favorites next to Pisces."},{"rating":"1","title":"Monkees go out with a whimper","review":"You have to feel sorry for Micky and Davy that they had nothing better to in 1970 than put out a Monkees album. Especially since the two remaining Monkees were arguably the least talented musically. The album does have it's moment's, notably \\"99 Pounds\\" which is a mid-tempo rocker and \\"Midnight Train\\" which appeared previously on the television show. There is nothing particularly bad about the rest of the songs here, but it's no \\"Abbey Road\\" in terms of swan songs. It surprises me that Micky or Davy didnt release a subsequent solo album billed as \\"The Monkee\\", but I suppose it was a contractual thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"This is one God-awful CD. And that is exactly why I bought this when it was first re-issued. I had to have this just to see if it was as bad as everyone said it was. And believe me, it IS bad.

It was obvious this CD was for a contract fullfillment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad mastering screw up","review":"Eagerly anticipated this disc coming in the mail. Got it, played it, can't believe my ears. The track Acapulco Sun has a loud squeal in it from 2:15 to 2:25. This is a definite tape squeal. At first it sounded like the tape needed baking, but the speed doesn't change, so I'm more inclined to think it's a tape that has lost it's lubricant. Too bad the last of the original Monkees albums gets such shoddy treatment on CD that even the mastering engineer didn't stop this release from going out with this horrible sounding mistake in it!Changes (Remastered + Bonus Tracks)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish it were not so large and were of higher quality.","review":"The inset picture is nice.

The first two I thought were great. This one let me down because nowhere in any of her 100 suggestions was anything metioned about GOD. I cannot imagine a person who is trying to grow in her spirituality not looking to God. At one point she even mentions \\"rethinking your beliefs\\" - I took it to mean that if you DO worship God/Jesus to re-think that and start looking to the \\"universe\\" for your guidance. That, along with her suggestions to see a psychic, just left me uncomfortable. I am on a personal journey to simplify and cut out the things that don't matter and the same time grow in my understanding and relationship with Jesus. It did not occur to me that this would be completely left out.I am not totalling dissing the book, though. There are suggestions that I did find interesting/helpful. You just need to be willing to skip over certain things."},{"rating":"2","title":"lots of good ideas","review":"After struggling with my life and purpose (so to speak) this book and the book Simplify your life have helped me redefine my life.

Well, I just purchased the soundrack and to my surprise, I really enjoy it.I mainly purchased it for the extra tracks, as I have most of the other tracks on the, \\"Listen to the Band,\\" box set.

I dig the SONGS and the SOUND COLLAGES are much better than bands like Oliver-Tremor Control, Animal Collective, newer, younger bands.Even the snippets of dialouge add to the concept of this album.

She told me that they had hired a Linux expert to re-edit the book and it would hopefully be available in time for my class the summer of 2001. It was ready in time and it worked very well for my class. BE AWARE that the ISBN number wasn't changed and the only indication that you have the revised version is the word UPDATED in a gold star in the upper right side of the text cover. Instructors can get a CD with solution files, Powerpoint slides, Test Manager, and an Electronic Instructors Manual. I would agree that perhaps less GUI content and more of the omitted topics noted in other reviews would make this a 5-star textbook."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Bad Book!","review":"I can't belive people can actually rate this book 5 stars. I'm not so sure they tried the exercises. There is so much mistake in the book, that it's rediculous.

The characters were complex and had depth to them, making them realistic. The book had developments and changes that made you want to read ahead.

This wasn't one of those mystery/thrillers that you could figure out the ending halfway through the book and finished reading it only to see if you were right.

The amusing anecdotes move the story along, and show the ironic conflicts between policy, politics, and principles. Mr. Reich's self-deprecating humor proves that politics is not all about power; some people actually listen to the little guy and stand for something. No one is safe from the former Labor Secretary's venom, including his dear friend Bill. Mr. Reich places blame where it is due, but in the end, the players may seem a bit too colorful, as if public policy is nothing more than fraternity brothers arguing over how to spend beer money.This one was hard to put down, but sometimes hard to believe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"I am a student of Robert Reich's at Brandeis Univeristy and have found him to be one of the most honest, kind, and insightful people I've met. Locked in the Cabinet is a well-crafted, honest, and humorous book by a brilliant man.I happen to hold Reich's views, but even students here at Brandeis who completely disagree with him still read his books and take his courses because they respect the intelligence behind his writing and teaching style, the candidness with which he sets his ideas forth, and the respect he shows for those who disagree with his ideas.

When reviewed they could not locate any of the witty and insightful comments Mr. Reich claims to have made.

This memoir was more enjoyable than most. It wasn't dry or bogged down with excuses or rationalizations. He did take his work seriously & was sincere about what he was trying to accomplish. He doesn't take himself too seriously & the self-deprecating humor works. He doesn't bog the reader down with dry economic theories of which he has a few. He has saved those for other books he has wriiten, (I presume). He lets you in on some of the policy-making of the Clinton administration during the first term. The object was not only to get the president's ear but to be the last one to get it. Stuff that we are not normally privy to.

Liberal to the bone, Robert Reich, the finest Secretary of Labor this country's had, tells the lows and highs of 4 years in the Clinton's cabinet (first term). He respects the republicans; but he let's them have it too. From lobying in Congress to trying to get into the White House without his ID. Just funny. What a fantastic inside look.

Its aerodymanic design allows it to fly quite high with a C6-5 engine. You may need binoculars to follow it, as it will go quite to the limits of your vision.

It won't go as high, but you won't have the rocket end up in a tree limb, or drifting out of sight.My son loves the unique design of this rocket. It looks \\"cool\\".

Until I picked this up, I had nothing by him as a leader. This is really good stuff, and the title complies with all applicable truth-in-labelling laws. Hamilton plays clarinet and tenor on this, and (unlike many Ellington sideman projects) it has no Ellington compositions on it. The songs are mostly swinging, catchy originals, with a few standards. Particularly outstanding is his solo on \\"Dancing on the Ceiling.\\"Personnel: Hamilton, Clark Terry, Britt Woodman, Tommy Flanagan, Wendell Marshall, Mel Lewis, Earl Williams"},{"rating":"1","title":"Heat cable, not so hot!","review":"I am not pleased with this product.

It's obvious that the Monkees were just filling time when they made this one. The material is the weakest they ever used.

The only reason to buy this is for the bonus tracks."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a bad record.","review":"I'm a huge fan of the Monkees and have been since their 1986 reunion. However, this record is simply not very good. Largely put together with a bunch of leftover tunes from earlier sessions, this one comes across like a bad mix.Unfortunately, the songwriting aces used so effectively on the group's outstanding albums--the first four--seemed to have thrown them some pretty bad songs. Mike Nesmith's tunes are the only thing truly worth having on here."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Monkees not on film","review":"The first monkees album after the Head film.

To review by busternc about this not being natural: the ingredient is not hydrogenated oil as you suggest (which is bad for you, producing trans fat and potential health issues), but hydrolyzed soy oil. This is not the same at all, simply a break down of protein into baser amino acids, making it easier for your body to digest. Not a bad thing, actually. Check over your chemistry :). This product is also gluten free. Pricing here is a little better than at my local market, where it's approx $3 for a pack of two.

This book did not explain enough and just quickly glossed over or assumed that you knew the info already. Definitely not written for students, but for professors already gifted in algebra!! Needless to say, I struggled through this whole course. I had to buy three other algebra books just to understand what this textbook left out. I would not recommend this textbook at all!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly disappointed","review":"This text is a pathetic excuse for educational material.

I am, however, able to learn things on my own fairly well. This book makes that nearly impossible though. This book gives very few examples, and the few that they do give rarely give any clues to what needs to be done to solve the equations. It also fails to really teach anything. It's by no means for a student that is going to be going through an online course where they won't be interfacing with an instructor. I would not have enrolled into the course for online schooling if I had know this books was going to be this terrible.

It is geared to two audiences: those who are uneasy with the emphasis on a vindictive God who demands atonement, and those who suffer and search for meaning and ways of dealing with their pain. Topics include the life and vision of Jesus, Jesus' death and its interpretation, and responding to the mystery of suffering. Each chapter is followed by suggestions for prayer, reflection, and discussion. Fr. Overberg's latest work is suitable for individuals or small groups."},{"rating":"2","title":"top of their genre","review":"i cant agree with the other reviewer here.this one sounds great to me!!! its a great introduction to the elevators bringing togethor songs from the 'psychedelic sounds','easter everywhere' and 'bull of the woods'.the only thing that lets this band down is the laughable production but when you\`ve got songs like 'slip inside this house' and 'youre gonna miss me' its excuseable. this ones for us 'heads' and anyone who\`s interested in 60\`s psychedelic garage music its an absolute must.one of the best this genre had to offer.also check out the seeds and the pretty things 'get the picture?'"},{"rating":"1","title":"ack!","review":"Never, ever, ever buy a 13th Floor Elevators compilation that leaves off \\"Dust\\"!

The book is full of practical information and is an easy read. I read it in a few hours. And then started making plans to go there and visit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Callling all TROLLS !!","review":"A wonderful guide to the do's and don'ts of visiting Mackinac Island. Not only does it tell all of the \\"fudgies\\" out there about the great spots on the island, it all trains you how not to look like a dork while visiting - or looking like the traditional tourist. You'll really enjoy this book and its easy-to-read (almost elementary) style.

Sometimes, they are the fence around a farm and all her animals go inside. Sometimes we just stack them as high as we can and have fun knocking them down.The bricks are surprisingly durable considering they are made of cardboard.

It had me bursting out loud with laughter.I highly recommend this book to everyone, but especially to anyone that's ever played an RPG with pencils, paper and dice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice change","review":"Written in the perspective of a goblin was a nice change for me. As an experienced dungeons and dragons player, the story became very nostalgic and fun.I would have to say that the book was very entertaining. Whenever Jig the goblin was faced with a decision, the author always added what a real goblin would of done, which became funny on most parts. Jig, however, didn't seem like an ordinary goblin since he had a lot more common sense than any other goblin. Much more to the point of being a chief rather than the runt of the tribe.I was especially pleased with the ending. I think anyone reading this would definately enjoy the story since it in itself is a short read (approx. 350 pages)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Satire with Substance","review":"This is a fine example of a D&D parody that stands as a story in its own right. Jig is an unlikely but appealing hero, and I truly enjoyed joining him and Smudge on their adventures. The action is crisp and entertaining. The characters are, if not quite believable, then thoroughly enjoyable and delightfully quirky. I intended to read this novel in bits and spurts of spare time, but I ended up sitting down and gobbling it by the chapterfull."},{"rating":"2","title":"FUN Read","review":"Every so often, you need something just plain fun mixed in with all those gigantic epic fantasies.

The writers didn't even make us feel good that something was accomplished!In the opening scene, one French resistance leader wanted to shoot her so the Germans would not capture her with all this \\"vital\\" personnel info.

The point for me was to get my 7 year old son to be interested enough in a book that he might pick it up on his own and read it. And it worked! This book is great for any budding reader who is also a Pokemon fan. It is more substantial than a real little kid's picture book, yet not too dense to be intimidating or tiresome. Each page has a cool pokemon picture and roughly 2-4 sentences per page. For my son - a book has to be \\"cool\\" enough to interest him to read it on his own, and this fit the bill."},{"rating":"2","title":"Double battery charge interval","review":"This excellent battery with double the charge capacity means longer use time between charges.

Author attempts to have something a different plot than usual which is refreshing. The twist at the end was heavily foreshadowed so you saw it coming but that wasn't that surprising in that it was clearly being setup to be the first of a series - which would be my one criticism. I dislike the trend in publishing now that authors are focused on trying to create entire series of books rather than just focusing on producing one really good work and then if secondary characters become developed enough to warrant their own story they write it at a later time.But that being said, this book is an easy light read and worth the download."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good","review":"There were a few times the book dragged on, but otherwise it was pretty good.

Nothing memorable though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Downloaded this book due to high rating but sorely disappointed. The chemistry was not there between the characters. The situation that they were in are not believable such as spending wedding night at a brothel with a child. Had to skip bunch just to get to ending just to see what happen at the end.

(4 3/4 stars)","review":"I LOVED THIS STORY. I thought that Gareth was unbearably adorable..so he was a little immature at times, but he was only 23 and I for one, was thoroughly charmed by him. I adored watching him with Juliet and especially his interactions with little Charlotte. I thought that Juliet was his perfect match , though Ill admit that at first it worried me that she had been involved with his brother,but my fears were soon laid to rest as I watched their love grow.

The author repeats about 90 times( ok, a mild exaggeration) how romantic the \\"hero\\"s eyes are. Really? I got it the first 5 times. By the way, What are romantic eyes? The author doesn't explain. Even now after I JUST finished the book I can't think of a single memorable moment in the whole book. I didn't care that she was leaving him. I didn't care that he got hurt. I didn't care about the LONG dream that the \\"Hero\\" had. I didn't even care about the baby in the story! It was a book full of nothing. I have no desire to ever read another book by this author.

End of story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unrealistic","review":"I guess I am going to annoy all of you 5 star critics but I thought that the whole plot was unrealistic especially for those times.

The older brother I guess was the only saving grace of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"Although the plot could offer interesting implications, the author failed to fulfill it with believable characters.

On the other hand, the male protagonist, Gareth, struggles to face the responsibility of a new family and decides to redeem his reputation and earn the money to support his family by...fighting on a ring. And even more incredibly, his wise wife and the stern Duke proudly support him in this decision. Like this could be a serious way to sustain a family, given the historical context and noble origin of Gareth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wild one","review":"Very good story we all have a wild side sometime but I don't think anyone could have grown up as fast as qareth"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great characters","review":"I loved this book.

You could picture everything easily with no gaps. Definitely recommend this book, the entire series, and the author!

He overcame his childish and resentful nature and became the hero he was meant to be. Although, his childish antics was funny and romantic. For example Gareth painting a statue horse's balls royal purple or the way he proposed to Juliet while laying on a tree branch feet away from the floor.This was my first book with this author and as first book goes it did not disappoint. Although, I thought it would not be too captivating since it was free. But I must say j couldn't put the story down. Loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Blocking Classic","review":"Coach Hand has produced a truly great football book based on a simple theme -- equipping your offensive line with a few sets of rules and calls that will allow them to block any defensive front.Hand outlines both a few sets of basic rules and a number of specific calls that will deal with any front. Some calls involve the whole offensive line or half the line, while others are special two-man calls to deal with an unanticipated situation at the point of attack.Hand goes into so much detail that he acknowledges that very few coaches will ever attempt to install all the rules he provides. The \\"Radar\\" concept's greatest strength, however, lies in its modularity -- you can pick and choose which calls you want to install, and further refine the process for individual opponents.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"from the cradle","review":"This magnificent cd recruits some of the killer vocal tunes that Lee Perry made during the Black Ark Era, giving an introduction to his later dub works with these songs.

As I read the book it seemed that Anrea already knew our organization....our strengths, limitations, fears, phobias and conceits. She anticipated our questions and the key issues we were wrestling with and gave us excellent answers and examples of solutions. All practical stuff (not academic mumbo jumbo)we used on a day to day basis. Using Andrea's guidance we surpassed our capital campaign goal. That is why I came back to write this review."},{"rating":"2","title":"Capital Campaign","review":"The author has done a very good job of laying out all the procedures and policies that are necessary in conducting an effective capital campaign. Each chapter has a specific focus and for those who have not been through a campaign previously or for those who wish to brush up on their skills this piece is an effective and helpful one. There are many good options to it - including the CD that has all the forms that can be modified for particular situations. It is a helpful and insightful tool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Capital Campaigns: Strategies that Work","review":"This book is extremely helpful and has very valuable information.

I liked that the author delved through the basics, and then showed the pros and cons of each approach (SPs, DMO, ActiveX). He also documented Microsoft's replication system procedures much better than they ever could, and explained some of the caveats that they conveniently leave out.Probably not a book you would read straight through in a single evening, but if you are involved with replication, this is the one book I think you need to have by your side."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"I purchased 4 of these cordless impacts every single one started smoking or burned out after 1 week of use.

I like to go slowly with this capper because if you go to far you will crack the neck of your bottle. I guess this is fairly obvious, but just take my advice. I've probably capped nearly a hundred bottles of water kefir by this point and chipped or cracked about 5 or 6, which is very frustrating, especially when glass bottles are hard to come by."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Civil War Buff MUST!","review":"While Mr. Bates' writing style (long, long sentences) can be a little hard to follow at times, his research and attention to detail are second to none. After finishing this book, the reader will undoubtly question their high school history teacher. Mr. Bates leaves little doubt that Booth did not die in a fiery barn. Not only does Bates interview the alleged Booth, but many who both knew Booth and served with him in the military. After reading Bates' interview and seeing the pictures of Booth, they were convinced. I was convinced. You will be convinced."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the read!","review":"Bates has one incredible imagination. He recounts stuff as \\"fact\\" when the facts are just the opposite. Yes, conspiracy theorists have grabbed onto this myth for the past 100+ years. The grammar is horrible and the facts are just plain wrong. Unless you are looking for the conspiracy theory - leave this book alone. Not worth the read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely an incredible book! Worth every penny!!!!!","review":"When I saw a this book reviewed many years ago,(in the 60's) I was very skeptical of its theories, but once I saw the movie: THE LINCOLN CONSPIRACYin 1977, It all of the sudden made so much sense, and I have been a cospiracy believer ever since! It's a bit pricy, but once you get into the first chapter, you'll wonder why you ever believed a liar like Edwin M. Stanton and any fool who thinks John Wilkes Booth 1. Acted alone and 2. was killed at Garrette's farm. I'm seriously considering getting another copy to seal up and keep if this one ever gets damaged or wears out --- it's THAT good!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Conspiracy Theory!","review":"I am absolutely enthralled by this theory. I heard about it on unsolved mysteries (where they mentioned this book), and, after reading it, I am so sure that this is what really happened. I mean, the evidence both in this book and from other sources just keeps piling up! I don't know how history leaders and teachers around the world can deny this compelling theory. Not only does the evidence convince me, it just makes more sense that it would happen this way, you know?"},{"rating":"1","title":"This seems to b a straight copy of a book published in 1900","review":"This book appears to be little more than a dressed up copy (republication) of the original book of the same name published in 1900 by Globe Bible Publishing Co. in Philadelphi, PA. I happen to be lucky enough to actually own one of the originals. The original is cloth bound book with the same photo as on the paperback embossed on the front and is 511 pages and has 62 photos & drawings. I have mostly just read the intro and looked at the photos. The intro is by Richard Spillane (editor of the Galveston Tribune) who escaped the island to tell the world of the disaster and plea for help. I lived in the Clear Lake area for 26 years and I recognize a lot of the area he describes. I tried reading the book several times but it is rather fragile and has a lot of melodrama.One thing the book really shows is the different perspective of that time (especially in regard to race) and the shear carnage and damage of the storm. The photos are amazing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"The writing is so simplistic, the characters are so cartoonish and there are so many inaccuracies that reading this book becomes a dissapointment. It almost feel like it had been written by 15 year old!!! The real story of the Galveston hurricane is so rich and powerful that it makes one wonder how come this author couldn't come up with something better than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Outstanding, Electrifying, Uplifting Performance","review":"Vanessa-Mae's performance at the Royal Albert Hall was one of the best concerts that I have seen in a long time. With a blend of both Classical and contemporary compositions, Vanessa-Mae's performance can satisfy music lovers of any persuasion. Full of passion, this video is a must-see for anyone who loves the sound of the violin, regardless of genre.Also, for those of you (like myself) who might never get an opportunity to see Vanessa-Mae live, this is the next best thing. The sound and picture quality of the VHS tape was great, although I believe that the performance can be even better on DVD. I can only hope that good fortune can make my wish come true."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not well written and hard to read","review":"The very least I would expect from the author of this, his twentieth book (the previous 19 being all fiction) is an understanding of grammar and punctuation - something which is sadly lacking in this work.As a general rule, we do not start sentences with \\"And\\" or \\"But\\" and, although occasionally acceptable, there are too many instances here. Just as a capital letter commences any new sentence, so a capital letter is the first to appear after a colon - but not in this work. Furthermore, I found too many instances of digression when try to make a simple point.All of which is off-putting for the serious reader.In short, this book is hard to review because it is most difficult to read and if it can't be read - then there really is no point in it being reviewed in the first place.Poor showing - especially after all that research.NM"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wonderful Lectures on Mythology","review":"Too bad the casettes had tape hiss and poor quality audio.Not sure if this was in the source.But the videotapes i saw of these lectures did not have this problem.They don't have to go bananas with noise reduction but a little clean up through a digital software that are dime a dozen nowadays would have fixed the problem or at least dampened it down a bit.Like if the original sound reels were processed by Noise Reduction through a dolby workstation.Which i know Highbridge has used to remaster stuff before, just not this time.Not sure if these problems are on the CD version as well as the CD version is out of print and no longer available except at absurd prices."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tee Hee...Hahahaaaa...Guffaw","review":"If you want to forget your problems and just enter funny land...then read this book.

I had no idea what kind of prejudice and sexism existed in the service, but this book shined a bright light on how hard it is to be black, female, and in uniform as well as showing how even a good relationship with a good man can be stressed to the breaking point because of baggage and past issues.

I especially liked reading about somewhere different that the big city, island and other regular places of romance novels.

It's nice to be able to communicate --- even if it is just a word or phrase at that age! She was & continues to be a very easy going child.

Then I bought a Garmin Nuvi350, but it was so bad I had to return it (I didn't use the C520 before I tried the Garmin, so I was only really comparing it to the older C310x). After that, I decided to look for the C520, seeing it has an upgraded version of the interface of the C310x.Here's why I stick with Mio's older C series even now:- A lot more options, compared with other brands, for tweaking to make it work the way I want it to (could even be overwhelming for some users, but I like it a lot)- Animation of the map is the fastest and with highest refresh rate I've seen so far of portable GPSes. This is a BIG HUGE plus while on the road.- Split screen view, which I've been used to on the C310x (though it had less functionality on the C310x), is immensely useful. If you've never had one with it, you won't know why it's so useful!- POI search is extremely fast, unlike Garmin."},{"rating":"1","title":"MS Outlook Sync Problems","review":"I spent two hours with MIO Tech Support figuring out why the MIO C520 was importing the address from my Outlook incorrectly. Finally, the Tech specialist told me that I have uncovered a known bug and the MIO is working on it. If it was a known bug, why did they keep me on the phone for two hours? I wonder how many of the professional reviewers (CNET etc) actually tried importing their contacts. The C520 is close to a year old, how much more time do they need to correct a fundamental bug which affects their marketing and sales pitch directly. If you want to use your Outlook with your GPS, stay away from this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"love it!!!","review":"I love the fact that I have a split screen of the map and of the itinerary. The delay for re-routing is less compared to the other GPS I have bought. My only complaint would be that I cant change the type of view while Im driving, which I understand is for my safety, but that also means that my passneger is not allowed to change anything either until i come to a complete stop and that wastes a lot of time. other than that, I love this product and recommend it to all my friends"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Product UNTIL I UPGRADED THE MAPS","review":"This was an OK unit until I updated the map and firmware from a disk I purchased from MIO. First of all I was very surprised to find the 'Update' on the disk has 2007 maps on it even thought we are in 2009. Not 1 road changed in this software that I have seen yet.The other major problem that started happening is the unit now reboots whenever it feels like it. I have spoken 3 times with customer service and all I get is \\"Send it in for $80 to have it fixed\\". So I am supposed to pay for their bad programming..I don't think so. The last two calls I made I was told they are forwarding my request to management. Well they told me that 3 weeks ago, and I never got a returned call.If I were you I would stay away from MIO until they can get better customer service.

I would give this product 5 stars, except for 2 things. The maps are woefully outdated(almost 2 years old). That has proven to be a big problem. That, combined with the fact that support is a 3rd party call center in India(probably also taking calls for the veg-0-matic) having absolutly no clue on when a map update would happen, makes this a 2 star product in my opinion. At least with Garmin and the others you know they are going to come out with updates."},{"rating":"2","title":"Trial in Dallas TX","review":"For most part this product performed as expected.

The website is terrible. I can't find map updates. Email to customer service for location goes unanswered. The manual gives good detail about using the features except the basic gps. Only 2 \\"favorites\\" are allowed. The manual explains how to change the name and/or address of the favorites, and the instructions are wrong.

My advice to any of you is to NOT PURCHASE a Mio GPS. Look for a company that has actual customer service. I've had my Mio for two years and it has cost me more to update it than the original purchase price. Product support at Mio is non-existent...buyer beware.You have to send them the GPS unit at your expense plus $60 for a C series update. Outrageous! There's nobody in charge!

Unfortunately some of the controls are hard to find, but once you spend some time with the manual and poke around a bit it's OK.I found that setting the route control to \\"economy\\" helped a great deal around my complicated neighborhood.The newer TeleAtlas seem to be better than the previous. The huge number of POIs is great, and was a big selling point for me.The only thing I could ask for was a simpler interface for user adjustments. Deleting a route, sound level and other obvious controls should be at the uppermost level.

Initially, i was very skeptical as i had not really heard of MIO before, but am very impressed with the performance, response/start-up time, and feature packed unit. This unit has one of the best features for the price (text-to-voice, mp3, bluetooth, SD Card slot, etc.), and can head-on compete with the \\"big 2\\" value for money. I gave it 4 stars because of the 2.5 pin jack, (instead of the standard 3.5 pin jack available for most mp3/GPS devices) and the Bluetooth connectivity (that works fine) but needs to be paired everytime you switch-off or diconnect.

Instead of keeping me on 59 Frwy for 17 miles straight, it was routing me off and on this freeway and around downtown unnecessarily. On one stretch it kept asking me to take the ramp to get on 59N while I was already on it. Maybe it thought the old (2+ years) construction detours were still there. I returned this (C City with 15% restock penalty) and got a Garmin Nuvi 350 which worked perfect on the same routes.Other features on C520 were superb - good user interface, clear large display with a lot of useful information, clear voice instructions. But it failed in its primary function to provide accurate navigation."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't expect good customer service","review":"I was using this device and its working perfect.

I have been waiting for more than 6 days, called customer support and was told to wait till the site is fixed. So the GPS is now like a brick with limited functionality.

I've seen some turn red in the face and bellow cries of blasphemy, and I've seen others stand and defend it. I would count myself among the latter. Xamba is an astute book and Soares' viewpoint seems to be that Rio is so complicated even Sherlock Holmes couldn't figure it out. Holmes is a true fish-out-of-water here, fighting the indignities of intestinal para sites, the distractions of a beautiful dancer, and the complicated mess that was Victorian Brazil. What must shock Sherlockians is that their icon fails to bring the killer to earth- but then, that killer is none other than that other Victorian icon, Jack the Ripper himself.

Sherlock Holmes has been torn to shreds in this book where he portrays a blubbering lovesick idiot. And Watson's character was rather moronic too. Parts of this book read like a tedious textbook and others like a trashy romance novel. The humor was dull and old. If you're a dedicated Sherlockian, you'd best avoid this book.

The author (and I use this word generously) has trouble hiding ancient jokes told in high school as literature. He also tries to hide out-right plagarism (the scene when Holmes visits a canibal in the mental hospital is identical to the scene in which Hannibal Lector is visited in Silence of the Lambs). The killer turns out to be Jack the Ripper. Gee, how many other Sherlock spin-offs have a Jack the ripper Killer (see, for instance, the movie Murder by Decree).

The writing is high-schoolish and lazy, and decidedly not due to the exercise of translation from the Brazilian original. Anecdotes that have been told previously were thrown into this story line, including a second-rate joke about a snake recalled as an episode in Holmes life. The situations are unconnected, clues to the mystery appear from implausible events, and Holmes uses none of his abilities in this work, except perhaps to draw attention to a first book by Soares that would otherwise be cast aside, as it should be.

However, the first time I used it, it developed myriad cracks throughout the finish even though I followed the instructions and filled it with hot water from the tap before putting boiling water in it. Since then, the cracks have gotten worse. It did not effect my ability to make tea, though, so I went on using it even after a small piece fell out of the handle. It still seemed sound.

A totally different sound","review":"I was kinda disappointed when I heard this record the first time. I bought it because I liked \\"be on go\\" (1st track) which is an awesome ambient track. but the other tracks are...well too funky, there are a lot of strange sounds instead of an interesting hook line and plenty of ethnic samples - now they sound like what the name of the band implies :-). Well it's not absolutely horrible, but totally different in comparison with their previous album \\"Alien Protein\\". So if you are looking for the old Etnica sound, go buy the new Pleiadians album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Short, but well worth the money","review":"There really isn't a whole lot to say about this single, considering it's only two tracks long. \\"Wings Of A Butterfly/Rip Out The Wings Of A Butterfly\\" is of course the title track. Though it's probably the weakest track on Dark Light, it's still a pretty cool song.The other song however is much better. \\"Poison Heart,\\" which was originally a song by The Ramones, is the reason I spent the money to have this. Even as far as HIM covers go, this is very good. It's not as good as (Don't Fear) The Reaper, which was off thier first album Greatest Love Songs Vol. 666, but it's right up there.Even though it's only got two tracks, I say buy it. Both of them are very good, and as of now, the only place to get both of these on a CD together is the Japanese version of Dark Light. Though I'd wait until the \\"Killing Loneliness\\" singles come out. One of those may offer Poison Heart, along with some other songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hardly believe that china has stolen the nuclear secret","review":"There is no strong evidence to proof that china has stolen the nuclear secret.

Don't even get me started on having to pull out the miniscule pins to change the chime patterns. This is a terrible product. For those for whom it worked, I consider you guys lucky people.

Maybe because we had never seen it before and have been spoiled by truly inspirational tales such as Independence Day, and excellent acting and writing found in the X-Files.

The writing, the acting, the plot--you know all those elements that make a movie? Not one of those was done well enough in this movie to leave me and my family with a single memorable line to quote afterward.While we watched, we got to a point where, if one more human blundered things with one more stupid, senseless act, we were going to start siding with the aliens.But nothing is completely useless; it can always serve as a bad example.

This was a TV SHOW, not a movie, and should NOT be presented in letterboxed format. I compared the picture with my old VHS copy taped from TV, and sure enough they simply cropped off the top and bottom of the image in order to give us this INCOMPLETE picture. I don't know who they think they're trying to fool by letterboxing it, but don't think that they are giving you more of the picture than was seen on the TV screen--you are getting LESS!

Warner Bros, apparently with Kenneth Johnson's blessing, have \\"matted\\" (i.e. covered up part of the top and bottom of the picture) to make this fit widescreen TVs.Johnson claims he shot the first mini-series with a theatrical aspect ratio in mind (which doesn't explain why \\"The Final Battle\\" was also matted), but that's not the point: it was shot primarily for TV and therefore, should've been presented in its original 4:3 ratio."},{"rating":"2","title":"have patience,Final Battle fans","review":"For those of you that are V fans,take heart.I hear those people who own the original series on DVD asking for the follow up.Well,your requests are about to be answered.Official sources have recently announced that V:The Final Battle will be out on DVD by the fall.So prepare."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aliens Conquer the 1980s","review":"Nostalgia aside, \\"V\\" is still surprisingly good. Set aside the dated fashions and styles. And fast-foward through the more excrutiating bits of 1980s melodrama (especially any scenes involving children and teenagers).Set aside those things and it holds up surprisingly well as a suspense story in the \\"alien invasion\\" sub-genera.

When it arrived in the mail I wondered how they managed to get a 5 part series of around 10 hours (if I remember rightly) on one disc. Now I know - just include half of it.I originally saw this on TV in England in the early 1980's where it was shown as a 5 day series of 2-3 hours per night. There was no distinction between this movie and \\"The Final Battle\\". Come on guys, release the other half!!!Apart from missing the second half, especially the lizard-baby, the movie was excellent, however."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Parents Love It!","review":"So I bought this series for my parents for Christmas since they do not have satellite or cable.

Then they brought out V: The Final Battle.Then they came out with a TV series called V.The problem is that what you could do with a mini series was harder and more expensive to do with a WEEKLY TV Series.Therefore, main characters were written off in unexplained plots.NBC moved the series around so much that when the TV Series Finale came about a lot of NBC affiliates didn't even air it.V: The Original MiniSeries A+V: The Final Battle A+++V: The TV Series C+"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Real Classic","review":"For sci fi fans this is a treasure. V is 20 years old, and special effects have certainly advanced. However, the direction is great, the only bad actors are the female villains (and they're terrible - and why British?) and the only clunker in the story and characterization is a one-dimensional teenage girl who gets herself knocked up by a lizard (and just exactly how? did the writers not know how lizards do it? she certainly would have noticed.) This is not a bad average for TV sci-fi. It is certainly better than the garbage that various networks are producing now.V was produced with a conscious effort to comment on colaboration and resistence, and on how we are afffected by the media. The script is good enough to be serious.

I remembered V very fondly from my youth, and was a bit dismayed to discover how seemingly incomplete this first mini-series was. When viewed with the now-available \\"V - The Final Battle\\" it's quite a satisfying ride. I would highly recommend buying \\"V\\" with \\"V - The Final Battle\\" and watching them as one. If you just buy this one, you'll be left wanting more.Soon to be available? V - The Complete Series. A worthy continuation of the TV epic.

But please tell me, because I am confused, how is a movie that that was filmed in the 1.33:1 ratio get released as a widescreen ratio?This is physically impossible. And the only thing I see that they did was chop off the original top and bottom of the movie frames, and make it appear as though it is widecreen. And with this, we lose some of the original production frame. To me this is stupid. I love and only buy widesreen format films unless the original movie was filmed in the 1.33:1 ratio. And the reason for this is because I want all of the original frame that was filmed by the film maker weither it is 1.33:1 or 2.35:1, etc.To me this is definitely a deal breaker to chop off some of the original frame to make it look as though it was a widescreen.

Upon first listening to this album, I found it to be ok, not great, but ok. But being a die hard fan, I kept coming back to it, and it grew on me. I came to quite enjoy both cd's, especially the \\"Light\\" cd, with its standout, sensational songs \\"Our Father\\" and \\"Sunset\\".

There are few stringed instruments involved in this CD. I am not a fan Balearic dance rhythms and synth pop sound.However, if you liked \\"Songs of Distant Earth\\", then you may enjoy this CD. My only caveat to that statement is that I liked \\"Songs of Distant Earth\\" as a companion to the novel of the same name by Arthur C Clarke.

Understand, Mike Oldfield has delighted me for more than 35 years with awesome innovation in styles and inspired virtuosity in performance. This last album contains none of either. I, too, am sad to see the passing of a musical genius into mediocrity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Oldfield album...very sad","review":"Simply stated, this uninspired, cheap and altogether underproduced release is the last thing I'd expect from Mike Oldfield. The first CD, Light, bathes in self-parody. The only thing that it has in common with the gorgeous Songs of Distant Earth is the similar theme that pop up suddenly out of the cheap new-agey wallpaper making you think \\"Have I heard this before?.. Last time I liked it.\\" Shade, on the other hand, is an awful attempt to stray into the trance/club territory (and a poor one!).It's a big disappointment for me. I think I'll give Mike another chance (due to his superb works in the past), but it's a very slim one, that's for sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"below standard","review":"As a long time Oldfield fan, I must say that I'm very disappointed by this effort. I've heard all these sounds before. Tres Lunas was bad, heavily recycling sounds from the Songs of the Distant Earth, but he had that game as an excuse.

The chemistry between these two leaps off the pages.The storyline is made all the more compelling with the colorful secondary characters including the second-chance romance between Alex's cousin Gillian and her former beau Tom, now a police officer.Part suspense, part romance and part comedy, this one has something for everyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"well done","review":"I really enjoy Nancy Warren's work.

Her work is sexy and fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stereotypes","review":"I was ready to devour Warren's novel, Drive Me Crazy, but the characters were stereotypes and the writing was just so-so and soured quickly. How many times to I have to read about Duncan looking like a man who spent time in the sun? Sheesh. Also, Warren may have wished to do some research on librarians before writing about them. Librarians must have a master's degree to do their work. It is not beneath Alex to take the job. Many are young, hip, and even like to wear leather. She's portrayed as a tightly wound spring just waiting to be unsprung, but she just seems brittle. Also, Goosebumps would not likely be shelved in Dewey Decimal order.

It is enough that I use it, which is more than I can say about anything else I have tried. It sticks to the chair, and has no drift. I hardly know it is there, which can be good and bad.I noted that the picture shows a back rest. This is not included.

This one, I'm returning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seat too hard","review":"After having this item on my Amazon wish list for over 2 years I was thrilled to unwrap it on Christmas morning. After trying it out, however, I was sorely disappointed. I expected to have a soft memory foam like the pad I use on my bed but instead had a seat cusion that was hard and even worse than the worn out chair I was wanting to improve !!! What made me more upset was the fact we cannot return it unless it's not what we ordered or not as described. My opinion and the description are completely different things, but it never mentioned SOFTNESS w hich is what I wanted so I guess I am stuck with it.

The threads on the knob don't even match the threads used on the body of the unit. There's no way that this knob could ever be used with the product. The manufacturer simply threw a switch in the package that they knew would never work for the customer.At first, I thought maybe the place that sold me the unit had taken the correct knob so I ordered another from another vendor and it arrived in the same state!As consumers we have to let manufacturers and vendors know that blatant bad practices and companies that have no regard for their customers are simply not acceptable in this day and age.I will say though, that aside from the bad knob, the unit does perform well and as advertised.

It really seems pitched at young readers rather than adults, and not only due to its teenage hero. It is not particularly uuplifting fare for kids, however, as there are many nasty people here, many disappointments, and nothing much profound to pique a grownup's interest. The adventures are rather fantastical, yet there is nothing of ethereal fantasy in this gritty story by an author who is usually among the better SF authors.If you DO like this, note that Time Warner has once again printed a book on excreble paper. I bought the first pb issue and two years later the pages are already yellowed. Does no one save their favorite books anymore, or to read to the grandkids someday, or is TW simply contemptuous of its customers?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Formula, predictable, tired...","review":"Definitely the weakest of all of Greg Bear's books. Not up to his usual standards of originality or depth. It'd be a good book for Jr. High kids interested in dinosaurs, and it'd make a great 'really bad B-movie'. But generally, you can feel free to skip this work."},{"rating":"1","title":"I couldn't believe dinosaurs could be so boring!","review":"I don't know about the Lost World that Bear refers to, but this is certainly a lost opportunity! To get to the 60 pages or so of reasonably exciting (if predictable) material, the reader is condemned to plough through a couple of hundred pages of less-than-riveting scene setting. Furthermore, in setting the story in 1947 Bear demands that the reader should suspend disbelief to an uncomfortable degree, in order to accept this alternative 20th century history. The purists won't like this either, as Bear populates his story with a bestiary of various fantastic hybrid creatures that don't exist in any fossil record. This book is clearly a belated attempt to jump onto the Jurassic Park bandwagon, and whilst JP did get a bit silly in places, I think most readers would find it a vastly more credible and enjoyable read than Dinosaur Summer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Captivating premise, dragged out plot!","review":"Greg Bears new book is a test! A test of one's patience, intelligence and SF devotion. The first half reads like a poorly written travel log and than the plot takes a very predictable turn with a less than satisfying ending. The illustrations make you feel as though you're reading a childrens book! And does anyone really care about the political \\"subplot\\"?If you must read this book,Here is some advice: 1.Read \\"book\\" 1, Chapters 1-4, chapter 5: Just page 79. 2. Skip to Chapter 12 and Then read the rest of the book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One of Greb Bear's worst books","review":"This book is one of Greg Bear's worst. You could rip the pages of the first half of the book out and you would not miss a thing.There is virtually no interesting action until 3/4 of the way through the book.All through the read I kept thinking this book is nothing more than an idea for a screenplay. I think Greg didn't spend much time on it, figuring he'd get it made into a movie and he'd have to rewrite it anyway.Even the dinoaction at the end is weak. It will leave you completely unstatisfied. Especially if you like Greg's other works as much as I do.Get this book from the library if you must read it. There won't be any wait for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow to start, never got going","review":"This book reads like either, A) an early effort written before a good author learns pacing and plot development, or B) a movie or television treatment flushed out to book length.We know the answer isn't A, since this book was published, and presumably written, years after Bear wrote memorable series like Eon and Forge of God. If the answer is B, well then, it's going to be a pretty darn slow moving movie.Bear gets points for showing us interesting dinosaur behavior and for incorporating real people and famous fictional characters into the story line. But the story never takes off and soars.Rating: If you are a dinosaur fiction nut: 3 starsIf not, 2 stars.If you are looking for more quality fiction from the author of Eon and Forge of God, keep looking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unrealistic setting, wooden characters.","review":"How many carnivorous dinosaurs can there be without a few herbivores to eat now and then?

This author has done a fine job here and has nailed small town life and responses very well. Especially in the area as a retrospective of an adult looking back at how they were treated as a child and that is also where it went a little overboard from my point of view in a few parts. This maybe a touchy area for the author herself as the pain that is transmitted is very real and as they say you write about what you know the best--yourself. Very well done as far as keeping you guessing in several areas as to who did it, then and now, definitely a beautiful description of small town east coast life past and now.

McAllister's uncanny eye and eerily dead-on ear for these characters, not to mention a definite trace of affection, create a world so real and immediate it feels like you're living it rather than reading about it.

It shows the group running the gamut of their band-book; Hammond organ driven soul-jazz, slow blues, and energetic R&B and Soul work-outs. The musicianship is quite notable, especially the sax section, and both Zoot and Paul Williams turn in great vocal performances.

Returned it ASAP!","review":"I enjoyed the \\"2002 Ways to Be Romantic\\" book and thought this would be at least as good. What a disappointment! I'd be embarrassed to suggest these ideas for a date, and if someone suggested them to me, I'd be running the other way! Go to the stockyard? Please! Gregory J.P. Godek has much better ideas..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything you can think of","review":"This has everything from corny to realistic to romantic. A great book for keeping a relationship fresh."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of time. Full of redundancy and bad taste.","review":"Despite the fact I rarely EVER give 1 star ratings on books, I feel like this book deserves every bit of such a pitiful rating. 2002 Things to Do on a Date is FILLED with repetitiveness and redundancy. I'd say there is only about 100 or less things to do. To give an example. Two ideas are \\"Go hiking on cliffs.\\" and a little later there is something like \\"Go on an hike together.\\" The ideas are pitiful and can be HIGHLY inappropriate for dates. I've been on many incredible dates and feel that if I took my dates on the ideas within this book I'd quickly loose any potential for a 2nd date. Perhaps 3 or 4 ideas are good ideas, the rest is trash...absolute, definite trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"HaHaHaHa!!!! David Cross I love you!!!!!!!!","review":"so i bought this after watching David \\"Mr.Show\\" Cross' comedy special on hbo, and his rant that made fun of this insepid book. \\"so yeah, i picked up this book 2002 things to do on a date. its for people, you know, who don't know how to date. because sometimes you forget to open your eyes, dress yourself, or speak english\\".so how bad is it? you should get it and judge for youself. such things as \\"pray together\\". that's a great ice breaker on a first date. \\"watch mtv and play along with a kazoo\\", or \\"have a picnic under the stars and watch for halley's comet\\". because after all, it only comes around every 76 years.yeah so this book was made for the socially inept and boring. don't take it seriously at all. i'd be amazed if people actually did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, Great ideas","review":"I found, and still find, 2002 Things to Do on a Date an excellent resource for planning a date. Granted, these may not be some ideas you would want to do for a first, second, or even a third date, but after a while pizza, movies, and putt-putt get old. Many of the ideas in the book cannot and will not fill an entire evening, but they can at least give some ideas to a poor couple stuck in a rut. These ideas are great for a couple who likes spending time together doing cheap, fun adventures that aren't the same old, same old. I find this book great for a long-term dating (or even married) relationship. It's ideas can reduce a sense of staleness that can easily happen in any sort of relationship. Some of the things are a little off-the-wall, but that's what makes them interresting, fun, exciting, and refreshing. Dates can be anything, and this book gives you 2002 excellent examples of anything."},{"rating":"2","title":"great sword","review":"just got this and must say the sword is perfectly balanced, light and well built the handle is tightly woven nice grip and the decorative box is nice to keep only weird thing was a wet sheen of oily pesto looking goo that came right off and may be the manufacturers oil application to protect blade came right off and nice shine to blade overall a great buy for handmade carbon steel even the tsuba is solid steel not cheap stuff compare price of hanwei, shinwa, cold steel and u see why musashi rocks"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute but not worth the money.","review":"Looks great for the first week but mine faded rapidly from the sun; sticker went from bright pink to a nasty yellow color in less than a month! I removed it from my car, not worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good","review":"I used to be a huge fan of Diana Palmer until all of her books started sounding the same. Maybe she should stop putting out so many and go for quality and different scenarios than quantity.That said, this is one of her books I still have and reread occassionally. Hunter is a half-breed indian who thinks that Jennifer is too much a \\"cover girl\\". She is in fact a top geologist whose looks have actually hindered her. She is in a male dominated field, working with Hunter (a chief of security) trying to uncover an ore that rebel countries are also looking to find and sparks fly. I recommend this DP work. Both of these characters were briefly mentioned in \\"His Girl Friday\\" or \\"Hoodwinked\\". I can't remember which."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Read","review":"I have read Ms. Palmer's books since high-school (early '80's) and lately her offerings have not been quite up to par with her older stories. So it was such a wonderful treat to have come across this book in the library (for $0.50). \\"Hunter\\" is worth the read and wish to have some more of the \\"old\\" Diana Palmer in the current offerings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Album with Classic Songs by Accordion Greats","review":"A must have collection for accordion afficionados everywhere. Jo Ann Castle's \\"Bumble Boogie\\" stands out in the how does she do that file. My other favorites were Dick Contino's \\"Lady of Spain\\" (no accordion album would be complete without this song) and Martin DeLugg's \\"So What's New\\", a martini lounge favorite. I would like to have seen \\"Tico Tico\\" on the album and no Weird Al stuff, but will have to wait till next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre.","review":"A few of the tracks are OK. Most sound like recordings made from old records. I wouldn't have bought it had I heard it first."},{"rating":"1","title":"HA!","review":"Thurman, eh?I saw these guys in London supporting These Animal Men. Rumour had it that they had been a grunge act a year earlier, and (post-blur) bought themselves Ben Shermans and lept wholeheartedly on the bandwagon.The accents are appalling, mock-ney nonsense, the lyrics are cliche ridden drivel, and the riffs have all been nicked.That said, they are endearingly bad, hence the 2 stars. But take it from me, you'd have to be from another country to find them even remotely credible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works exactly as described","review":"Great price on this item as compared to picking one up at radio shack for $6/each. This worked exactly as it is supposed to. Allows you to convert from BNC to RCA without re-terminating any cable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Being cool in the pool!","review":"Ok, so my mom bought these for me for my 13th birthday and I love them! Now when I'm in my grandparent's pool I can swim faster than my cousins! I'm really happy that my mom bought these for me because I have already had so much fun with them so far this summer. I can't imagine my summer without them. I only wish they had more colors in these so my sisters can have them too and that way we don't mix them up cause these are mine!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Coleman pmp3000","review":"These are guaranteed to bring you grief. Their failure rate is nearly 100% in my experience. Save yourself the pain and find an alternative."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"I bought this inverter over 3 yrs ago.It has been sitting in my garage ever since.This unit pulls the battery power fast and couldn't power anything, not even the TV set!The 80w inverter works better for small appliances."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gundam Wing Forever","review":"Being something of an anime fan, I have a relatively large collection of imported compact discs. Gundam Wing Operation three is my absolute favorite (rivaled only by the soundtrack for Maken X). My only genuine complaint about the album is that it does not contain the series main title theme, and only a \\"TV-size\\" version of \\"Rhythm Emotion\\" (as presented in the episode preceeding \\"Trowa's Return to the Battlefield) I was really hoping it would be the version that is presented in \\"Sanck Kingdom Destroyed\\", complete with the trippy vocoder vocals in the beginning. But in spite of that, this is still one of the most fabulous collections of classical/pop/techno hybrid music ever created."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Book","review":"This is a very well writen book that both informs and entertains. I am a Walt Whitman fan so it was naturaly intersting to me, but even a non-fan would love this insitful work. I say it is a must have for all serious Whitman fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some old favorites here ... but not enough","review":"The Carl Stalling Project volumes 1 and 2 from Warner Brothers make this Hanna-Barbera collection pretty wimpy by comparison. I was expecting a lot more from this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Tree After Christmas Sale","review":"We purchased this tree in January 08 and I have to say the price was substantially reduced. We just opened the box in November 08 and everything was intact. The tree comes in three separate whole pieces and we assembled it in minutes. The set up was so easy. You will have to bend and shape the branches a bit. But after a little work it looks like a real one. We are very happy with this Christmas tree.One more thing, our tree also includes (not mentioned in the description above) lots of tiny pine cones distributed through out the tree. We love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"My son read it the day before he played Pebble -- and loved it!","review":"I gave this to my son to read before he played Pebble Beach a couple of weeks ago. While playing, the caddies talked to him about stories of the famous and infamous reported in the book. It made the experience even more fabulous. He gave the book -- and the Pebble experience -- rave reviews."},{"rating":"2","title":"Destroying the Lost Cause myths","review":"William C. Davis, famous and rather prolific Civil War historians, faces the myths that constitute the Lost Cause doctrine and destroys a lot of them.The book is a collection of articles published previously on several reviews: they analize the relationships between Jefferson Davis and his generals, the forgotten fronts of war (South Carolina, Trans-Mississippi), and -last but not least- the southern attempts to find explanations to the defeat.The second half of the book is the better. The chapters devoted to the \\"forgotten fronts\\" are pheraphs too short and generic.However a very intriguing book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Bull","review":"Mr. Davis, like most so-called historiens is full of, well you know what!.....Like most of his kind he says that the South was fighting for slavery. This is one of the biggest lies in the nations history. He trys to tell us that over 90% of the men who were in the Confederate army did not own slaves, and this is true, but he does not say the these 90% of the Southern people saw slavery as worng, and that it hurt their livelyhoods. So trying to say that these men fought for slavery is like saying that Mr. Davis and 10 of his friends would give up their lives, their family, everything they own, so that Bill Gates could remain rich. Mr. Davis sould have called this piece of junk \\"THE CONTINUEING LIE ABOUT THE CONFEDERACY!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"The only reason it gets 1 * is because it was written.","review":"THE SOUTH WAS NOT FIGHTING FOR THE CONTINUATION OF SLAVERY. THAT'S ABOUT ONE OF THE WORST LIES I'VE EVER HEARD. THE ONLY THINGS THAT TOP IT ARE THAT LINCOLN THOUGHT SLAVES WERE OF EQUAL STATUS TO FREEDMEN, (HE WANTED TO SHIP THEM OFF TO LIBERIA)AND THAT BILL CLINTON DIDN'T SLEEP WITH MONICA. THE WAR WAS ABOUT A DIFFERENCE IN ECONOMIC AND GOVERNMENT WAYS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insight into the past","review":"The book is full of fascinating detail, though at times it reads like a doctoral dissertation.Wish it had gone beyond 1881."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haunting, Scary, Funny, Beautiful","review":"Robyn Hitchcock saved me from oblivion in the early 1980s, shortly after David Bowie had sold out to stadium pop. What can you say about an artist who is like a cross between Bob Dylan and The Gormenghast Trilogy? The first thing that stands out in any Hitchcock excursion is the quirky sense of humor, best seen here in the hilarious Freudian barbershop \\"Uncorrected Personality Traits.\\" But the underside of a dark sense of humor is just plain dark: \\"Sometimes I Wish I Was a Pretty Girl\\" and \\"Sounds Great When You're Dead\\" have an edge and desperation so intense and authentic as to border on the frightening. But there is sweetness and sadness here as well, as in \\"Autumn Is Your Last Chance\\" and the instrumentals that bookend the album. This is one of finest pieces of solo work by an utterly unique artist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Burnt out hippy?","review":"Understated and quiet, this partly melancholy, partly wacky disc has some great moments. As with much of Robyn Hitchcocks earlier work, cynicism and bitterness feature strongly in the lyrics, but in this case to good effect. It's an acoustic album mostly featuring multi-layered guitars and vocals, and with backing vocals by the great Captain Sensible, guitarist of the Damned and one-time Robyn Hitchcock collaborator.Dreamlike, bizarre and impressionistic, this is an unusual disc but as with all Robyn Hitchcock, well worth investigating."},{"rating":"1","title":"identity crisis?","review":"Wow, i liked this stuff the first time i heard it, when it was Syd Barrett's. Who is this cheap ten cent knock off? and who on earth gave this moron a record deal. This guy has no real motivation to be writing this stuff...he is merely taking Barrett's words AND VOICE, changing them slightly and putting his name on it. Its musical plagerism and you guys praise him like hes innovative! Hes a cheap knock off of Barrett and he knows it himself, he even claimed to be the second coming of Syd Barrett. Hey Robyn i love Syd Barrett too, but i respect him enough not to be a carbon copy of him. Instead try to take his example and make your OWN unique sound. I highly discourage the purchase of this man's music, because it is hardly his own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice album from Robyn","review":"Robyn Hitchcock / I often dream of trains (Rhino version): Not all the songs here are great but enough are to make this an important release. This one is thoroughly enjoyable and it seeps into the soul. Not a classic, but well worth hearing and owning.
