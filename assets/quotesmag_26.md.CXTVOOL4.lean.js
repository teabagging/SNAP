What was up with Eve? Where did she even come from? And, Andie cheated on Pacey? I couldn't believe it! But, all was redeemed in the next few episodes when you could sense that the triangle was beginning to form (Dawson/Joey/Pacey). It was great to watch the characters of Joey and Pacey fall in love with each other, after being friends for most of their young lives, and they had no idea what was forming between them. This is when it became clear that Dawson was her past and her future is with someone else. I was really disappointed in how the character of Andie was portrayed this season. I mean, she cheated on Pacey, she cheated on her SAT's and other than that she was really on the backburner. Not very interesting!! All in all, a very great season!"},{"rating":"1","title":"worthless","review":"I must say I am stunned how many positive reviews this dvd got after the music changes were released. There is a reason this dvd is only $32. If your smart you will save your money and get 7th heaven this sept. 14th, but hey, if you want to buy a cheap, remixed, no extras, low quality (23 episodes on 4 discs) DVD, be my guest. I guess there are a lot more 14 year olds out there than I thought."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dawson's Creek is boring but............","review":"I just started watchin Dawson's creek and just finished Season 3 and it is a very boring show. It lags and the storylines r not even interesting. This season is probably good because of the whole Joey/Pacey love affair but before this season it is BBBBOOOORRRRIIIINNNNGGGG. Jen fall in loves wid Henry Parker played by a hottie actor name Michael Pitt. He chases Jen throughout the season and finally Jen falls for him in a very sweet way and den wrote him off. The writers on the show didn't do a good job !! I'm acutally very disappointed dis show sucks. Michael Pitt is HOT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"music changes","review":"Are there going to be music changes in is dvd? I can't find any info. A lot of fans want to know before we buy this dvd?

Why are they right? There's a really easy answer: out of all six seasons of the show, this one tells the most complete and satisfying story, start to finish. From the first episode where Pacey consoles Joey on the dock, to the last where....just watch and see! This season of DC got it's act together like no other. Forget the negative nitpicks others have cited (Eve was a quickly removed mistake) and just enjoy some great acting and memorable episodes from a wonderful ensemble cast. Two key highlight hours include the amusingly foretelling 'Four To Tango' and the emotionally rewarding 'Stolen Kisses'."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Season Ever!!","review":"I start to watch DC when it first air, at first I was Dawson and Joey fan, but after watching season three I was all rooting for Joey and Pacey, their onscreen chemistry are just fantastic, their relationship are very well written and it played out so beautiful. Joshua Jackson and Katie Holmes did a fantastic job portraying Pacey and Joey relationship, furthur more they the the best couple on tv. I have all the episodes on tape and seen each episodes for so many time , I am so excited that it coming out on DVD, I just can't wait. If you are a fan of Joey and Pacey this is the season that you must have."},{"rating":"1","title":"thanks for the warning","review":"I love season 3 so much and it is just really terrible to think that some of the key senes will have some crappy music in the background ruining it.

I wouln't mind paying the extra money at all as long as it is the same show with good picture quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Bad DVD Set","review":"Ok I think Season 3 is one of the best seasons the show had. I was so disappointment to hear that the theme song has changed( and for the worst too) And you maybe thinking so what its just a theme song, welll once you hear it, it will change the whole mood of the show. really. So I sold my season 3 on ebay and now recording off of TBS and will burn them to DVD to watch the Original broadcast as it should be. Hmm I wonder if the will change other themes like I dream of Jeannie or Brady Bunch...it wont be the same... save you money..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Third season","review":"The third season of DAWSON'S CREEK was pretty good. It gets better, and near the end it is near perfect. The season was off to a weak start because of a character named Eve, who got involved with Dawson for a few episodes. Andie returns from rehab, to Pacey's delight, until he finds out that she cheated on him. Jack attempted to come to terms with his sexuality, and repairing the relationship with his dad. He fell for Ethan, only to get his heart broken. Dawson and Joey seemed to be on different pages throughout the whole season. First she wanted him back, but he wasn't interested, then he wanted her back, but she wasn't sure if she wanted Pacey or him. The buildup to Pacey and Joey was really good, and made for good drama. Jen fell for a quarterback, and had a rocky relationship with him. There were a lot of great episodes in this season, especially in the last half of the season."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of The biggest disappointments in DVD history!","review":"Oh creative changes...You Executive producers, ruined the greatest Dawson's Creek season by changing the theme songs, and the meaningful and important songs to most of the meaningful scenes!! As a fan of Dawson's creek..I would like my money back!! Executive producers know nothing about how the music made the drama unfold..The NEW music is CRAP!!! in fact I'm going to tell people not to purchase this DVD, and just go and find the original VHS cassettes somewhere else on the internet.. The last episode is kinda meaningless now because of the music... good job jackasses!If it weren't for a great season like this , I wouldn't have gave it 2 stars..Thank you executive producers for ruining a great season and great romance..DJ Mane 1"},{"rating":"1","title":"WHY WHY WHY","review":"Okay, I was willing to overlook the music changes this time around, because I really enjoyed this show, and I grew up with this school. For better or for worse, Dawson's Creek will always remain in the back of my brain. Season 3 has alwasy been my favorite, but when i heard that they music changes where so drastic that the theme song is being replaced, I had to put my foot down!!!Columbia why would you do this, or better yet, how could you? Don't you know that fans would rather have a MSRP of $80 or so for an additional disc (to lower compression) and to make ***MOST*** of the song???I can't in good conscience recamend a DVD with the WRONG THEME SONG... Two stars is because I could never give DAwson a 1."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dawson's Creek: Third Season","review":"Season 3 is where I absolutely start to love the show!! The chemistry between Joey and Pacey is unmistakeable!!! Joey and Dawson were never meant to stay together because Dawson was Joey's first love, and first loves aren't meant to last, the experience teaches you. But Pacey is perfect!! He's a gentleman, and he does everything in his power to help Joey and show her how much he cares, Dawson never did anything but wine!!! But any rate, season 3 is a wonderful season!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enough About The Music Already!","review":"I must admit I'm new to Dawson's Creek, but I've fallen in love with it on DVD. The constant belly-aching about the changed theme song and other replaced music is getting old. Would you really rather that this series never see the light of day? Just rejoice that you have the series to watch. The new theme song is just fine as well as all the replaced music. Get over it! This series is the bargain of the century. Great price. Great Show. Great Fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who cares about the Music Replacement!","review":"Who really cares that \\"I Don't Want to Wait\\" is not at the beginning of each episode, in fact, I am kinda happy that it isn't. Who actually wants to hear that song every 45 minutes? It got annoying while watching the 1st season's DVD. A change is nice. Don't let that keep you from buying this DVD set.Everyone needs to keep buying these DVDs, cuz as long as the demand is there, they will keep producing the seasons on DVDs. I don't know about you, but I would love to have ALL of the seasons on DVD. So keep buying these DVDs please."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great season","review":"Season 3/4 are my favorites of DC. And I'll buy the fourth one when it comes out.Even with the music changes it's still great. The music changes durring the episodes are not even very noticable. However the first time I popped in the season 3 DVD and heard that horrible theme song I laughed my butt off. It's such a horrible theme song, lol. If Paul Stupin wanted to change the theme, he definitely should have picked something else.I do really like the interactive map of capeside on the first disc. That was pretty cool.No matter what, it's still a great show, and this is one of the best seasons, so it's worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stop letting the studio kick you in the teeth!","review":"Come on people, they didn't just replace the original music in the episodes (which was bad enough). THEY REPLACED THE THEME SONG! And some of you are saying, \\"Oh well. Just be happy we have it on DVD.\\"This is unacceptable. Don't buy this set! Teach the studio a lesson, and let them know that replacing the theme song just to save a few bucks will not be tolerated. And just how much is being spent on these sets, anyway? They're cramming 4 and 5 episodes on one disc (which degrades the picture quality), they're replacing nearly all of the original songs, and now they've changed the theme song. They're destroying the heart and soul of the series with each successive release. What's in store for season 4? I guess it doesn't really matter, because if it's as poor as this release, I refuse to purchase it."},{"rating":"2","title":".","review":"I've always watched Dawson's Creek, but it would always be the background noise while I read a magazine. And then season three came on and I put down that magazine and started paying attention. It made me wonder if maybe the previous seasons were as magical too. They were, but not in the same manner as this one.I severely hope that season 6 doesn't depend on season 5 selling well or else we're all going to be in trouble."},{"rating":"2","title":"Weak start but gets better as it goes along.","review":"Dawson's Creek - The Complete Third Season is another good season but not the best. The first handful of episodes of this season are boring and completely strange with the introduction of the character Eve. After that the show starts to pick up speed with the whole Pacey/Joey/Dawson love triangle. I never liked Joey and Pacey as a couple but some of the romantic scenes that they have together are pretty explosive. Buy this if you were a fan of the series. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"URGENT: Music Replacement that will change everything","review":"(...) Paula Cole's \\"I Don't Want to Wait,\\" the theme song to all seasons of the show has been replaced!

I bought it with the knowledge I had of the first two sesons and figured it'd be good. Boy was I wrong! It really dropped in to the ridiculous category in this season. I got the chance to see the rest of the seasons (4,5&6) and they were just as bad.

First Andie cheats on Pacey then Pacey can't love Andie anymore but he then goes off having this pathetic casual sex pact with Jen but then goes off mooning over Joey Potter. Why I hated it was because of the fact that people made a huge deal of Pacey and Joey and their great chemistry. They have the MOST OVERRATED RELATIONSHIP ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strange","review":"Felt like Iles was trying to break into a different style -heavy on philosophy - felt like it got bogged down too much in this area, interesting premise but felt like it was work to get to the end of book - unlike many of his others. Hope he takes the machines out and goes back to a more personal touch in next work."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was Bad, REALLY BAD","review":"It's not too often that I buy a book and fail to read it. I forced myself about 1/4 of the way through, then gave up. It was tedious & very lack-luster. Before I tossed it into the trash, I skimmed through parts at the end, and the ending itself. I don't want to present any spoilers here, but let's just say, I read enough at the beginning to realize that the ending was very lame indeed. This book was really bad. I would not recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Desert Adventure","review":"A good thriller and science fiction novel. Will guarantee to spoil your boredom, like mine waiting for five hours in the airport lounge.The plot mixes exciting actions along with the main protagonist's epileptic/seizure problems. Judging Greg Iles previously written and other other novels, I guess he has a medical training background, like Michael Crichton did. As most of thriller novels, eventually the doomsday has been thwarted, in the last few moments. Another predictable ending...Though a quite well-written book, it is not among the best. I give four stars for this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"exciting","review":"i read 3/4 of this book and then decided to check amazon for customer reviews. I am enjoying this book tremendously. it takes place in areas in which i have lived or visited; raleigh, nags head, knoxville, chapel hill and durham. I have traveled on the roads, ferries and waters . The plot is exciting. after seeing so many reviews stating that this is not Iles best, and since this is the first of his books I have read, can't wait to read the rest. so i must return to this book right now. i am indeed obsessed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not my usual genre, but I liked it","review":"My sister just finished reading this book and left it at my house for me to read. Otherwise, I wouldn't have selected this book.It took me a little while to get into the story but then I was hooked. I think I might look for another Greg Iles book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"First attracted to this book as a Christian, (title grabbed me) I was greatly surpised when I learned of the high-tech geeky subject matter as well, since I'm a geeky type.Here's the thing, the editing of the story. The storyline, though interesting enough, dragged in some spots. Word economy is a big thing for me. I practice it everyday as a technical writer. Word economy can be practiced in fiction writing as well, and arguably must be.With the internet alive and well, readers today have the attention span of gnats. Writers must pull their audience in tightly and hold them to the end, or the book gets put aside.Sure, I saw things I'd seen before in other novels, but the spin here was different enough to keep it interesting. I loved all the characters, but some could have been sacrificed for economy.Iles is a terrific writer, and I'll read more of his work."},{"rating":"1","title":"not as good as his other books","review":"This one just isn't as good as the rest. Iles is a great storyteller but this is not his best work."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book made me wish I had brain cancer","review":"How bad can literature be? Just read this book and you'll find out. I can not believe that readers are giving this book positive reviews. This book is as thoughtless as it is superficial. A super computer is built, then it launches nuclear weapons on everything and everyone. Why? Because humanity is so bad it's not worth saving; boy, how ORIGINAL! The only reason this book is getting good reviews is because it's an easy read. The author dupes the less astute reader into thinking this story is good by writing a text that moves so fast one barely has time to think. Either that, or, the book was written with short text and small words because the author knew he was WASTING OUR TIME!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This Book Was Terrible!","review":"This book was so poor, I am not even going to waste my time on a full review. The short of it is that the novel is sci-fi-ish, about a super computer that has mapped the human brain and can \\"think\\" on its own. The team behind the creation of the supercomputer, called Trinity, splinter; each man wanting to use it to their own plan. The main character, David, tries to get outside help and is marked for death himself.Then, the novel splits off onto this weird tangent where David begins seeing life through the eyes of Jesus Christ. The novel goes straight downhill from their.This book was just bizarre and I would not recommend it to anyone. Stay far away."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was a Greg Iles book?","review":"I have always loved all the Greg Iles books I've read, but this one is pure dreck. It is sci-fi, new age, and anti-Biblical. What a waste of my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"entertaining, but pales next to COLOSSUS","review":"This was a fast read. The final showdown was, however, eerily similar to that in \\"Colossus: The Forbin Project,\\" a 1970's movie which occasionally airs on cable. That movie, based on a novel by Dennis Feltham Jones, is a TRUE CLASSIC in this genre. This recent novel was less satisfying."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T FOLLOW THIS PATH","review":"Greg Iles is one of my favorite authors of the past ten years, and while I admire his desire to \\"branch out\\" into another territory, I think he lost his compass on this one. What really hurts this book is it's just not entertaining. I for one am tired of the recent books including \\"DaVinci Code\\" and \\"Angels and Demons\\" that just have to question God as most Christians have come to know Him. Iles steps into this territory with metaphysical bullcrap and peoples it with cookie cutter characters and a slow pace, with unbelievable sequences such as the detonation of nuclear weapons. Iles intents may have been good, but what's that old saying...\\"the road to hell is paved with good intentions.\\" Stick to Iles previous novels---they are superb.NOT RECOMMENDED."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!","review":"I have been a fan of Greg Iles work for several years now and have enjoyed all his previous books to varying degrees. I was looking forward to this latest effort THE FOOTPRINTS OF GOD. However, I was destined to be disappointed! I found the story ridiculous and extremely boring. If you are new to Greg Iles, read one of his earlier books such as THE QUIET GAME instead of this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Muddled","review":"I am an avid reader of Greg Isles books but this novel was disappointing. I found the plot muddled and the characters flat. This was not up the normal standards of this very good author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another bad author","review":"There must be 40 \\"My God\\"s spoken in this book. Characters are one-dimensional and similar and exposition so obvious that this might as well be a blueprint for bad writing.

And if it gains consciousness, then, well, My God.\\" Etc Etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great book","review":"For a long time, I have been looking for a book that captured me with its first pages and made me not want to put it down. I thought perhaps I had lost the ability to experience that. I have read books that I enjoyed but none of them elicited that feeling.I purchased \\"The Footprints of God\\" and \\"True Evil\\" by Greg Iles hoping they would be good books but not expecting too much. I have been pleasantly surprised. Not only do I enjoy his writing style but the way he presents the story captured me from the first pages. I never wanted to put this book down and when I did (out of necessity), I couldn't wait to get back. Thank you Greg Iles for helping me rediscover that. I can't wait to read \\"True Evil.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"very entertaining","review":"Great summer read! I finished it in a day - quick, but lots of fun. More interesting if you have some background in science (particularly physics) and religion (particularly Protestant Christianity) but great book anyway.

I wouldn't call it a literary classic by any means, but if you're looking for an entertaining and thought-provoking adventure, read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could not put it down!","review":"Normally, I have a hard time \\"getting into\\" books, but this one grabbed me from the start, and I found that I just had to know what happens next! Greg Iles really did his homework."},{"rating":"1","title":"Audio: 14 People Can't Be Wrong....","review":"I have to agree with the other 14 people on Amazon that this book is bad. I really like Greg Iles audios, but this one was a lemon that I am glad I only paid a dollar for. It is Iles attempt at science fiction and it is Wargames meets the Terminator, on Judgment Day. It was abridged, and maybe I was missing something. If it had been unabridged, I may have quit halfway through; six hours was too long. There was too much religion replacing or explaining science."},{"rating":"2","title":"Footprints of God","review":"Stunning. Radical. This is a book that I won't loan so that I can read it again and again. Greg Iles is an author of infinite scope and talent. He ranks with Clancy, Patterson, and others who write intricate details flowered in imagery that captures readers imagination and brings them into the story as a participant. There is an explanation of \\"God\\" within this story that is mind blowing. I've read it again and again until it has become an experience rather than just a conceptualization.This is one of those books that while you are reading and the telephone rings or someone knocks on the door, irritation assaults whoever is interrupting.I've read every other book that Mr. Iles has written and they are also engaging however this continues to be my favorite.I am graced to name Mr. Iles as one of my favored authors."},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty good","review":"i would say the last 100 pages were the best part of the book, however that doesnt mean the rest of the book was bad, it just means the last 100 pages were that good. though i didnt think the ending was great, i didnt think it was horrible either. it was just a different perspective that i thought of.some parts of the book were predictable, other parts were just far fetched, but i would definately read this book again in the future if just for those last 100 pages.another thing, i measure books by if when im reading it, i cant wait to find out what happens, this is one of those types of books for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Greg Iles worst book!!!","review":"Greg Iles is one of the best thrill writers in the business, your in for a action-packed ride reading his books, and he's one of my favorite authors. I've picked this book up several times, but never purchased it, and found it at my local used book store. So I thought let's give it a try. Even though reading the back-jacket, nothing about it was appealing. This is just a dud, it's nothing like the action packed books that Iles normally writes, and just never got going for me. I just gave up on it after reading the first 70 pages. It's uncharacteristic of his books, very boring, just seems to bumble along, and go no where. Read any of his other books. Mortal Fear, Turning Angel, Blood Memory, captures him at his absolute best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where was the plot?","review":"I kept waiting for a plot to determine this was a mystery. You always knew what was happening so no suspense there. It just seemed like a written Hollywood chase scene to try and kill a couple of the characters. The idea of the super computer taken over by a human brain was very weak in my estimation. Probably wouldn't even have finished the book if a friend hadn't told me it was the best book he had ever read. Difference of tastes, I guess.

Divemaster gets drunk there. Divemaster gets laid. Divemaster makes fun of fat people.That's pretty much it. This collection of anecdotal stories has little if any point, and goes nowhere. Rather than the travelogue of interesting dive locales it claims to be, Rapture Of The Deep is little more than the kind of macho posturing you can find in any bar near any decent dive operator, but less interesting.You won't find idea for dive trips, and you won't find useful insights about diving or divers. If you feel you must read this, at least buy one of the used copies, as I guarantee they've never been read more than once."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's The Deal?","review":"I ordered a copy of 'Rapture' excited to read some dive stories. What I read about was drinking and more drinking. This book is more about alcohol comsumption and pot smoking than it is about diving. I was disappointed by the book. Don't you be fooled if you really are looking toread about diving adventure. On ther other hand, if you are looking for drinking and diving...this is your book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rapture of the Sheep","review":"I have been a diver for 45 years. This book isn't informative at all on the diving side and is marginally entertaining from the land-based side. Did Zinsley self-publish to get this into print? Admittedly, there are only a few good books about scuba diving. This isn't one of them. About drinking, debauch and a totally dissipated life style, perhaps I could up the rating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly enjoyable read","review":"If you are one of those people tired of the 9-5 and beyond office grind, and dream of doing something more exotic with your life, this book will make you green with envy. Zinsley's book captures the spirit of diving, travel, and in particular Asian island life, though he delves into the Caribbean and Australia as well. He covers what it is like to live the bohemian life of a dive instructor in some of Asia's most famous diving and sun locales. Like listening to a buddy with really good stories, Zinsley's book is a funny and enjoyable read. I would especially recommend it to people keen on travel, diving, or anyone who merely wishes to do so."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Young Man and The Sea","review":"I read this book and passed it on to a friend and she passed it on again and now it has been passed out of my circle. I was hoping to get it back! It is a good quick read, and hard to put down. The prose is contemporary, muscular and salty. It sings of the both the beauty, rapture and humor in these many far flung settings, and the gritty realities and occasional real dangers this man experienced. Zinsley's portraits do concentrate more on the culture(and his partaking of those offerings)and a bit of the history of these places, than a pure guide book to the undersea marvels that he sketches out. It can be read either way, which is the reason I think I won't be seeing my copy again. After hundreds of dives, I think he properly put emphasis topside, where strange situations make for good stories. Still, I have been into serious adventure sports for 25 years, but never felt inspired to investigate scuba diving until I read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adventure travel at its best","review":"This hilarious account of a scuba instructor's world travels is compacted into short stories that bounce you from Bali to Bermuda and a smathering of countries in between. Zinsley walks you through the trials of being an instructor in several third world countries and outlines the late night antics after the dives. Tribal rituals of different countries keep you reading, and depictions of oddball students will have you rolling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be fooled, these are junk.","review":"I was shocked that that the 4 satellite speakers are dummies and are just for looks. I opened mine up wondering why there was no music or movement coming from those satellite speakers and found they are just cosmetic with no wiring. The base broke with several days. I didn't even bother returning these as they went straight into the trash. I and had bought 2 of these!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool inventive factor","review":"Owned a set for over 2 years now. One day saw this unit here on Amazon with a poor rating on it. The guy got it damaged in delivery, got his money back - no big deal. But nothing is menioned about the sound of this set. I love it. It is definitely a great attempt to improve on the sound quality and design of your conventional PC speakers. Built-in top drivers are larger and are delivering a deeper sound on the bass end. Combined with the good treble from front twitters it sounds very impressive. In addition - it was a smart idea to position a cpl drivers facing upwards. This really fills the room with sound. It is not just beaming it in your face but rather covers the whole room. Good design, good sound. I am a fan of iceTECH now."},{"rating":"1","title":"DOA","review":"Dead on Arrival. Base was broken and no replacement policy. I just got my money back and purchased a set of LogiTech speakers instead. They cost me a bit more, but they work and sound great."},{"rating":"1","title":"THick as sludge","review":"This was a terrible product and the price just low enough to make it not worth the hassle of returning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Trek","review":"This episode is certainly worth owning. To me, it embodies everything that was great about Patrick Stewart's classically influenced TNG acting chops, and the quality and sensibilities that made/make Star Trek so great. In fact, it is this sort of writing that makes science fiction thick and rich with potential. It's about imagination, but imagination within the realm of possibility. How many other worlds are out there now? How many have come and gone before us? This episode explores those very ideas and does it with class, style and panache. I can't explain this episode. Well, I could, but I can't do it justice, just watch. Watch with an open mind and an open heart, and I guarantee you'll come away a bit more sensitive towards the universe around you. You may also notice a haunting tug each time you look at a distant star."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the top 5 episodes!","review":"The script for this episode is fantastic!! It wraps you up and carries you along in a wonderous tail of life and the love of it. Great stuff!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not An Inner Light Fan","review":"I love Star Trek:TNG. And I know that many fans love this episode. But I'd rather visit the dentist than spend another 40 minutes watching The Inner Light. I am amazed that this episode is so popular. It may be great acting, and great dialog, and a great story (I don't think so) but it's too depressing to watch, IMHO. It also has almost nothing to do with space exploration which is what draws me to Star Trek. Give me Yesterday's Enterprise or Tapestry or All Good Things, but The Inner Light is not on my wish list."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scrumptious","review":"Exotic locales and glistening nude female bodies make this a must-own DVD. Debbie, Angel, Sung Hi, Lana, Michele, Doreen, Shellani, Ashley and Shana in no particular order, give what I believe to be the best \\"performances\\" on the disc, while Amy, Sarah, Scottie and Kristin deliver great, but not stellar segments. They are all at least a tiny bit ditzy, some considerably more so than others, but who is really listening to the commentary? The male actor on the disc occasionally gets in the way, especially during the Shana Hiatt segment but can generally be easily ignored. The quality of pacing and length of the segments is a matter of personal opinion but the quality of the content cannot be denied.This being my first Playboy video purchase, I cannot find much to complain about, including the price. This was basically from the relatively early stages of DVD technology, so its special features are minimal. The girls themselves are pretty special features in their own right."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can I give it 6 stars?","review":"Okay, I'll cut to the chase:I know one of the girls in this video. I knew her for years before she made this video.Seeing her in this is a dream come true for me.I can't explain it any more simply than that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Resistance of the Heart","review":"An account of the protest wages by the Protestant spouses of German Jews. Because of the tumultuous emotions of my surviving relatives, so much of this history was never discussed in my home. Now I know that the reason for my grandfather's survival was the protest in which my grandmother participated. This book created a starting point to open discussion with my mother on this part of her life. I found the book so powerful that I am purchasing another as a gift."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic DVD, far better than any book on this subject","review":"Fantastic Guitar Building DVD. There's nothing like this out there... You can read as many books as you like on guitar making but there is nothing better than actually seeing someone do it. Great product, great price.Most reviews on this site are from people that haven't watched the actual dvd and have made presumptions based on youtube previews!!! The dvd is great. The Truss rod can infact be fitted either way (bi-directional) and it IS explained in the dvd why you would want to fit it that way (a fact that is only apparent to the buyers of this film!)I can't believe some reviewers on here actually would prefer the film to be more of a gruelling three and a half hour experience!

Then we were forced to RELIVE the scenes by review. I HATE THAT!!! The story had a lot going for it! I liked the passion between Maggie and Max. It really kept me guessing to see how the ending might be tied together. I didn't want to put the book down... but then I had to MAKE myself pick it up again to finish it. For a first story... I say not bad, but I expect better for the next."},{"rating":"2","title":"great pinkies!","review":"These pens for the price are fantastic! As usual Pentel R.S.V.P. pens don't fail, the ink always flows and you use the pen up to the last drop. It would have been nice if the ink would have been a rose color, otherwise these pens are a bargain."},{"rating":"2","title":"best pen ever!","review":"I cannot live without these pens. They stopped selling them near me and I have been going crazy trying to find them. There has never been a pen so easy to write with. I will not let anyone borrow them :) I am so glad I can buy them here. i was a fraid they were goign to stop making them. I don't know what I would do. I plan to buy about 100 of them just in case :) Being a writer, it's hard to find a pen that you love and i love this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"I hate ball point pens, too, but this one's different","review":"This is a great pen-inexpensive and it doesn't \\"blot\\" ink, like every other $#@! ball point pen I've used. Note that you can get a fine or medium tip-I prefer the medium tip, my wife prefers the fine tip-why not get them both? I like these pens as much as I do fine-quality felt-tip pens."},{"rating":"1","title":"Among the worst ballpoint pens I've used","review":"I respectfully disagree with the other reviewers as my experience with this ballpoint pen has been awful. While mine says it's a medium, it is certainly not a 1.0 line. Mine is more a fine medium point. The blue ink is smudgy, the ball is scratchy and frequently blobs ink on the paper. It never starts writing without first exercising the point. Upon first using it there is an annoying movement at the tip that clicks it into the section. Generally when I begin using a ballpoint, I use it to the end, but with a quarter of the ink left in this pen, I'm throwing it out; enough is enough. While it is possible I simply got a bad one, I strongly recommend you do not buy this pen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pens....they do a letter good!","review":"This pen flows perfectly from the tip creating a beautiful steady line, a wonderful compliment to my wavering penmanship. This is a perfect size for my fingers to grasp with a textured rubber finger pad to help comfort as you put pen to paper.Whether writing short note cards, lengthy correspondence, or just doodling idly while on the phone this pen will showcase your written thoughts and feelings. So pick up this pen and write!girldiver:)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy Customer","review":"Product received quickly, packaged appropriately, with no issues. Will do business with this vendor again.

They are cheap, but last forever.They are lightweight, fit well in my hand and I love the rubber pad for comfort. I was always go for this pen when I have a bit of writing so I finally got rid of all my odd and end pens and replaced with these."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for customizing","review":"I bought these pens to give out as favors at a party. I found another commenter who had dimensions for making custom inserts. I made a pattern in the size specified, printed off and cut them out, then you just unscrew the back end, wrap the insert tightly around the ink, and push back into the pen body. I usually had to pull the back end off again and use the end of a paper clip to push the insert all the way into the pen. Very easy to do, and my guests were all very impressed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Bag, Even Better Customer Service","review":"My 8-year-old daughter received this bag for Christmas and it was one of her favorite gifts. It is a durable, good-sized bag for a child. We did have a minor issue with one of the markers not drying completely. I e-mailed Alex's customer service, and received a very prompt and helpful response. The issue has been resolved successfully and I would highly recommend this product. Based on the other reviews I have seen, I beleive the problem we experienced with the marker was simply a fluke - but because of the prompt and courteous response from the company, I will not hesitate to buy more Alex products in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just....

I've been all over local stores and the web looking for e-Grip refills and can't find them in local retail stores at all. On the web, all I can find is 2 refills for prices ranging from $2 to $3.75 and THEN the suppliers want shipping charges from $7.95 to $12.95. This, for a couple of plastic refills that weigh less than an ounce. I'd call these accursed refills about the most poorly provided product support I've ever seen for any office supply."},{"rating":"2","title":"Indecent Proposal - Softcore Version","review":"Soft core version of \\"Indecent Proposal.\\" The story starts out slow, but once it moves, a lot of actions immediately emerge. Kira Reed, my favorite and Janine Lindenmalder make a good pair in this, yet another excellent title released by EROS. A title not to be missed if you want story and real actions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fine to watch once","review":"This was a technically well-made film about the kind of people who only appear in these kinds of films - in other words it bears little resemblance to reality. The acting is actually not bad, although Janine will never win any award for her acting ability. Kira Reed, is indeed very hot and personally she was the best part of the film for me. Janine is usually steamy, but she was a rather minor character, although her attempted seduction of Kira was very nice. Their ultimate consummation was very tame which was disappointing. Janine and her female one night stand in the bathroom was erotic, but hardly new nor as hot as she has been in the past. All in all this was a film I enjoyed to watch once, but it does not bear watching repeatedly. Still, it has high production values."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"The book was said to be new but instead I got a crusty disgusting book.

Rarely do my children and I become SO excited about a book as we did with this series and this book in particular. Oakley's illustrations are endlessly entertaining and we see something new each time we read this book. The picture wherein Sampson, the church cat, pretends to get rid of the mice is too funny for words. We stay up too late at night after reading this book at bedtime because we spend the next half hour talking about our favorite parts. Children and adults will enjoy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"From Someone Who Knew Nothing of Rugby","review":"I have to admit, right off the bat, that I knew very little to nothing about rugby before buying this game. That's half the reason I bought it, really. I can't stand not knowing how to play a sport.So I bought the game, knowing nothing about the sport, and I'm pleasantly surprised. The introduction to the game is fairly good. Being as I'm entirely a beginner, I made use of the Rugby 101, and within a few hours I understood the game. I'm sure I don't have everything down yet, but it's quite easy for a newcomer to the sport to play and enjoy this game.The engine runs well, and the graphics are superb. Another great sports game from EA Sports."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun for the rugby fan...","review":"This game was a lot of fun for me, a rugby fan, but does not live up to the EA games I have grown to love.

Their articles were at least 75% shorter than the ones offered on Wikipedia, it offered no scholarly citations, no organization, few pictures, and fewer articles in general.I'm not here promoting Wikipedia, but I was just wanted perhaps a more credible source of information. Instead, I only found that there was just so little information on this product it's not even worth the comparison.

Publishers should really check out what they are printing before it goes to print, where are the editors??? This is not the route you want to go, if you want to learn ASL. Order Signing Naturally, with the videos, and the handshapes dictionary. When you have that figured out, go to the ABC coursebook. What a waste of paper this book is, and it is a real shame that people are looking at it, memorizing it, thinking it is going to get them somewhere.

Lee does not try to do too much with this book. It's not too taxing on the brain, uses simple and easy-to-follow notation, and has a helpful appendix of common statistical distributions. I like the emphasis on conjugate priors, which are the mathematically most tractable Bayesian models that are often not treated fully in other texts. (Someone still needs to write the definitive text on conjugate Bayesian models.)The book is limited in scope, a strength if you're just getting started on this topic, but will frustrate once you get into this stuff. There are plenty of other good books that go beyond the basics once you're ready."},{"rating":"2","title":"good intermediate text","review":"Although only the second edition is listed, I have read only the first 1989 edition and my review is for that edition. Lee wrote this book with the goal of teaching an introductory course in Bayesian statistics to his students at York University. He wanted a text that was more mathematical and deatiled than Lindley (1965) but not quite at the level of Box and Tiao.This text achieves that goal. It was published at the time when MCMC methods were only starting to be appreciated. So the wider use of general prior distributions and hierarchical models does not yet enter into this book. I would assume that the second edition published in 1997 was written to remedy this shortcoming but I have not seen if it does.But for the time it was a good intermediate text."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugly","review":"This is the ugliest Barbie doll.

The major difference is in the charts & chartlets - the Bauhaus guide is all color charts that look like real charts - the Zydler guide is all B&W hand drawn sketches that are extremely hard to read - virtually useless.

For me it is a beautiful language and even though I don't know what the words mean (unless I follow from the album insert) the Gaelic songs are often my favorites. This 2 disc set, as the name implies, is completely in Gaelic and many of the songs are so beautiful you almost want to cry. This is by far my favorite album and it is played constantly.

The banter is, of course, quite clever. Seth Green really cracks me up.

I like the way the author takes a trader's perspective. However the are errors that will mislead a novice who wants to use the statistical thought process. Most notably, on page 58, he states \\"One character of standard deviations is that they are additive\\" which is fundamentally incorrect. In his example, a one standard deviation (\\"sd\\") of 3 from a mean of 7.5 would give a range of $7.5 +/- $6 for two standard deviations ( a 95% probability). This is incorrect. The 3 sd needs to be squared, doubled then square rooted again to arrive at a two standard deviation of 4.24 (not 6). Therefore, the stock will range from 11.74 to 3.25 with 95% certainty NOT 15.5 to 1.5, as inferred by the author.Please be careful as I have found others.Frank."},{"rating":"1","title":"A heavy hammer with which to hit large nails","review":"The thick green book is a reference for options professionals.

There is definetely a huge learning curve when it comes to option trading, but I think there are better, more practical ways to learn how to trade them. This book should only be used merely as a reference guide to terminology and various strategies. If you want to learn options, do a course like Optionetics.

It also has kept us from wasting a lot of bread. We (house of 3) were going through almost 3 loaves a week just for toast, sandwiches and french toast. But now that we can slice them evenly we go through 1 and a half loaves.I only gave it 4 stars because 1. I cant used my electric knife. The blades get caught due to them being too short. 2. The plastic guide prongs bend easily so I know someday (hopefully not soon) they will break off when slicing manually.They need to make something for you to hold on to while slicing. 3.There are deep knife markings on the bottom already. I try not to think that we may have eaten some plastic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Nice Item","review":"This bread slicer is quite good. It has a slicing guide and also a storage container part to it. It cleans easily and was cleverly designed to accomodate bread machine sized Loaves. I have found though, that if I bake the largest size loaf, the loaf will be an inch or so to tall for it so after I slice a few slices I am able to put loaf on its side and then store it in the container."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bealls Department Stores are worthless","review":"I ordered this item to arrive by the 29th July. Today is the 5th August and the only reason I queried this was because Amazon kindly brought it to my attention. It says in stock, but I have just received an e-mail, from Bealls telling me they do not have the item and my order was cancelled on the 30th.They never bothered to contact me or anything and the item is still showing as 'in stock'.I would not do business with a company that places NO value on customer service."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does exactly what it promises but got REALLY expensive","review":"Keeps my bread machine loaves fresh for a good long time, which saves me time and money as I don't have to bake so often. I like being able to see at a glance how much bread I have left. I don't need a slicing guide so I removed it. Easy to wash out, and it doesn't take much counter space. For the price you really can't go wrong.Revised my review. What happened to the price? I paid a fraction of what it's being sold for now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes decent keeper, but guide is marginal","review":"If you are looking for more of a bread cutting knife guide, don't buy this product. But otherwise, the plastic case keeps the bread adaquately."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bread Keeper","review":"The item arrived with a severe break in it. It would have cost me more to return it in shipping charges than it was to purchase the item. I just ended up throwing it away. The box was not dented in anyway so the the seller really would not have known it was broken unless they had opened the box so I'm not faulting the seller.The transaction was very fast and easy. I would purchase from the seller again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inherently Flawed","review":"The bread slicer guide is cheap but useful. The bread keeper operates on the principle that the bread needs air and this provides airholes at each end. After putting a freshly baked loaf of raisin bread in the keeper at bedtime and revisiting it again in the morning, the keeper had tiny gnat-like flies who were drawn to the loaf inside the keeper and had easy access via the airholes. Assuming the sweet raisins were the reason this happened I tried a plain white loaf the next day with exactly the same results."},{"rating":"2","title":"good product","review":"I was looking for a convenient way to keep bread fresh and this is really great. Rather than use it the \\"long\\" way on the counter, I keep it so that I lift the top up and off. I use the slicer constantly and it's a big help, but I do wish it were a little less flimsy. I'm always slicing into the plastic at the bottom of the bread. I wonder how long it will last. But then again, I haven't found anything else like it or better to buy and it wasn't very expensive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"After seeing all the great reviews for this item, I figured this would be the one for me. How wrong I was!!! I find the guide to be pretty flimsy, especially for sturdier breads like rye and whole wheat. After six months of use, there are knife marks scratching the bottom, and it's almost impossible to clean. I'm going to look for a wood bread guide, as that is what I'm used too. The bread keeper is not functional at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Progressive Internationalclearly fresh bread keeper","review":"The bread keeper does help slice bread evenly, but it is rather flimsy and if not careful it may break easily while holding the bread with your free hand when slicing. The part that is flimsly are the tynes(slicing separaters)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bread Keeper/Slicer","review":"Finally - This is the 3rd bread slicer that I have purchased and have finally found the best one yet !!It is nice to not only be able to slice freshly baked bread, but to be able to store it as well.I would recommend this item to all who consider buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good holder, but plastic shreds off","review":"I chose this product because of its dual functionality as a bread box and slicer. The bread box works great. It fits our homemade 1.5-lb loaves fine and just barely fits a 2-lb loaf. The holes are also just the right size to allow the breath to breath without drying out.The slicing 'rungs' are a different story. I have a sharp bread knife and was hoping the rungs would help me learn to cut straight. Well, the knife slices of small shreds of plastic from the sides and cuts into the bottom. The plastic almost always ends up on the bread."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply convenient -- long life with added care","review":"This is a simple plastic product -- that with care -- can last for years. To preserve the plastic and to prevent it from being cut when you slice down to the bottom of the bread, purchase a small cutting board for the bread to sit on -- while it is in this bread keeper. This keeper is really handy -- and when you use a sharp bread-cutting knife -- cutting home-made bread is no longer a chore. I recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"needs a better guide","review":"The holes in the sides of the keeper provide ventilation but the holes are so large that flies can (and do!) get inside the container. UGH!The cutting guide is flimsy and hard to use. Theoretically this product is great but in practice it is less than good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Progressive Clear bread slicer/keeper","review":"The hole on the end plate allows the bread to be squeezed out thus causing non-uniformed slices. The little holes on the box cause air to dry up bread also. Not very happy with the product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Friend to Your Bread Machine","review":"Debated on the purchase of this item; thought it might just be something else to take up counter space or end up in the closet, top shelf. Glad we purchased it; great friend to our bread machine.

The container is attractive but larger that I expected."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"I had been searching for a bread holder and slicer for a long time. I make all my own bread and used to just put it on a plate with seran-wrap. This method took up too much counter space. The Progresive International Clearly Fresh Bread Keeper is awesome. It adjusts to the size of your bread. It also allows you to slice your bread perfectly straight. Wonderful product. Glad I found it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not a good complement","review":"Steams up and keep it wet. So the issue is soggy bread or mold. Can put in cold bread and should be okay"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful bread box!","review":"We live in a very humid environment and no matter what bread box I bought, my bread was always getting moldy too soon - not any more! The air-tightness of this bread box, along with the cutting guide, has solved my problem, so I give a \\"two thumbs-up\\" to this product - thanks, Amazon!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"I bought this product to assist in slicing homemade bread evenly. The slicing guide is less than desireable. Since it is made out of plastic, it didn't take long to scar its surface while slicing the bread. I also found it not to be very sturdy, and was afraid I'd break it while slicing the bread. Also, you can only slice about 5 slices of bread before you have to remove the slices, and then move the whole loaf forward and start over. Improvements might be to create a base where the knife can slice through the bread and not the base and create a slicer guide that allows the user to slice an entire loaf at one time. I used this product about three times and abandoned its use. The breadkeeper is gathering dust. I keep bread in the refrigerator in a bread bag."},{"rating":"2","title":"my husband's favorite","review":"My husband always requests some of this when he's in the desert, so I thought it would be a treat to go ahead and order him some now that he's home.

The best part about this book is that the author relates to mothers throughout the entire book, and understands that not all moms can stay at home or afford to go to the gym everyday. I feel like it was written just for me! I work full-time outside the home and have a 20-month old son, but I think I can easily follow the meal plans and exercises in this book, it just takes a little planning. All of the meal plans include recipes, which take minimal preparation and cooking...and they seem like meals I would actually enjoy eating! I think my husband will actually approve of most of these recipes, as well. I felt very motivated after finishing this book and it made me realize that I am just like every other mom out there who is struggling to lose that baby weight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get your body back and lose weight while breastfeeding","review":"It has great information, but not what I was looking for.

That is really too bad, because this album is exceptional. Recorded at Grieghallen Studio by Pytten (Also famous for Emperor's \\"In the Nightside Eclipse\\", and the first few Burzum albums to name a few), this piece of work has that freezing nordic atmosphere comparable to early Emperor and Darkthrone using no keyboards at all. The riffs are extremely melodic but crusty at the same time, and the vocals are absolutely grim, plus some clean tone in the first track. One of the more interesting songs is the instrumental in the middle of the album, which is just brilliant if you ask me. This is definitely true Norwegian Blackmetal at its best, don't overlook this release or the next one either which I hear is upcoming!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent \\\\m/","review":"Awesome unpolished, brutal, no holds barred Black Metal.

The cynicism differs depending on your stage of training and career. Read it more than once, each time it will have a different meaning"},{"rating":"1","title":"powerful, but dilute","review":"I agree with the reader from Chicago. This is a wrenching story of disillusionment and personal transformation, and a shocking look at post-graduate medical education. I found the author's inability to write easier to stomach, however, than his frequent bewildering digressions. I suggest just skipping the longer paragraphs all together- the one-liners hold most of the story's punch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Even if it is true this book is very poorly written.","review":"I am sure most doctors and nurses can testify to the contents of this book but it was so poorly written that I couldn't even finish it. It's full of ackward prose and unintelligible gibberish. It's very hard to find the real story because Shem's incompetency as a writer is very profound."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the greatest Medical humor books of all time!","review":"I read this when it was first published in 1978 and still, thirty-four years later remember scenes from the book. That's how great it is. To this day I can't enter a hospital without thinking \\"Gomer\\"! I read it while I was in Law School and it was nice to feel some shared pain with other students in a different profession, doing their best but still getting it wrong. The book was well-written, light, fun but with a deeper thread on just how hard our budding Medical professionals work to get where they end up.I have a son now in Medical School, so of course I had to buy a copy from Amazon for him last year. He enjoyed it too, along with \\"THE ANATOMY OF DECEPTION\\" by Lawrence Goldstone, a Medical Mystery."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gritty but real","review":"Please pardon such a brief review, just adding emphasis to what some of the other 5-star reviewers have contributed.The best summation I have heard of internship was told to me by one of my chief residents while I was a scrub/peon/intern:\\"When you are an intern, LIFE IS HELL.\\"Tip of my hat to Dr. Shem."},{"rating":"2","title":"House of God","review":"Great book, highly recommend it.

The books tries to hard to be humouristic and lacks the real cynicism and sarcasm that comes after a decade working in medicine."},{"rating":"1","title":"A lot of work for the good parts","review":"I bought this book because I had heard many mixed reviews about it from people in the medical profession. I myself have found that there are a few nuggets of insightful commentary hidden amongst the sexist, racist, mindless, lewd and all together poorly written drivel which makes up most of the book. This being said, the book can be pretty funny at times, and might be worth a read for a laugh or two if you can stand all the pointlessly captalized words."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Cynical","review":"As a second year medical student, I had been told by many people that this was the book to read.

I am on page 200 and simply can read no more! It is SO REPETITIVE and I am still waiting for the storyline to develop halfway through! It is killing me to not finish this book, but I think in the end it will be more painful to try to get through the next 200 pages. It is so bad, I think I will literally trash it so that I never have to be reminded of the time I wasted trying to read it..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic - for a reason","review":"I'd heard about this book for years.But how good could it really be?Answer - it's fabulously good.This is a brilliant book about a young doctor's reaction to starting out in the medical profession treating patients.Clearly he chose the wrong line of work (and quickly switched to psychiatry.)I only wondered if all interns react as he did or whether its just the ones who shouldn't have been there in the first place and had to find out the hard way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good blatently and captureing book.","review":"This book starts with a young doctor reminising about his experience as an intern at a busy hospital in the city. He leaves nothing out and skillfully incorporates his own style of language and phrases. He has these rules of the house of God which are even listed at the end of the book which are really priceless. The unhindered honesty is another great aspect. The book takes place in the 70's and the social genre is not left out. He honestly and accuratly includes his sexual lust and sexual escapades with many a nurse at the hospital. Also, about the dogma of ethics and morality of the doctor's, he shows them to be human and concerned from a very layman point of view. Some things here can be sickly humorous but nontheless interesting to read. An excellent book for the unshockable and interested reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"LAUGH WITH DOCTORS - EVEN IF YOU ARE A PATIENT","review":"Do you remember how you laugh when you saw M.A.S.H.? Prepare yourself to laugh more now. Samuel Shem, a psychiatrist, describes with no shame or censure, what's going on among young doctors in a busy hospital. You are going to cry and laugh with every single human feeling (of either doctors and patients): fear of death, faith and unfaith, love, shame, frustration, sex, arrogance, despair, power, everithing!As a physician, I saw myself in many of the situations described in this book.Maybe your not a doctor but you were, are or will be (someday) a patient!

Disgusting!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not well-written, unnecessarily alarming","review":"This book came out in the wake of similar titles like MASH and Catch-22, and describes life as an intern at a hospital in the 1970s. I read it in 1997, and it made me very sad about the state of medicine in this country.Fortunately, reading some of the some of the location descriptions in the book, it dawned on me that the hospital in the book is Beth Israel in Boston, where I grew up.I mentioned the book and my realization to my mother, who said that back in the 1960s and 70s, Beth Israel had the reputation of being more or less a butcher shop, a good place to go if you wanted to wind up dead nice and fast, vastly different from their current positive reputation."},{"rating":"1","title":"debased and disgusting","review":"I must say hat I had much higher hopes for the book. I enjoy reading medical based literature, since I am in medicine myself. I did all I could to get myself through the first chapter, luckily it was short. The baseness of the book was disgusting. How anyone could write of having a sexual orgy during a code, in full light of everyone in the room was beyond me. If any institution was to have anything of the sort going on I would mandate and petition for its immediate closure. The title of the book only makes the issue worse. I would recommend the book for burning, or cleaning up bird droppings, but not much more."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD IMPRESSION OF MEDICINE","review":"As a resident, This book clearly gives a wrong account of the lifes/thoughts of most residents/intrens.Very little of the screaming sexuality/irreverence is true especially in this day and age.Patients health are not taken this lightly and profesionalism is key and indeed emphasized.We now know why there was so many successful lawsuits in the 70's and 80's.However I am not surprised knowing the Author is a Psychiatrist and not in the aspect of medicine most people will ever get to see/experience.Psychiatrists tend to think a little bit off the curve.VERY FEW OF THE STORIES, SCENARIOS AND STATEMENTS AS TRUE OR EVEN POSSIBLE IN THIS DAY AND AGE.RECOMMENDATION: Not recommended reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it!!","review":"An awful book, I am sorry I wasted my money on this ... macho ... book.

I enjoyed it, yet thought \\"this can't be real\\". It was too dark, too hilarious to be real. After discussing it with clinical interns and professors who were MDs, I learned how true-to-life it was. I still thought it was funny, sad, and heartwrenching at times but I no longer thought of it as untrue. So, I switched my major to Economics instead. A must read for everyone working in health care or using health care (basically everyone). I would also suggest the movie \\"Article 99\\" which seems to be based on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Catharsis for the disenchanted.","review":"As a second-year medical student, this book read more like a horror story than like a \\"classic novel of life and death in an American hospital.\\" Filled with the cynicism and free thinking that was supposed to embody the 70's, the author's mainstay over-the-top-shocker style of writing immediately becomes dry and lifeless before the reader ever notices how poorly the characters are developed. The book could better be interpreted as an emotional outlet for someone who became disenchanted with medical training, lost their way and exercised defense mechanisms that harmed both colleagues and patients.However, the author does bring to light important issues such as how medicine is taught/learned, the sometimes grim realities behind that training and the importance of outside support vs. internal defense mechanisms in maintaining perspective on a challenging course."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good bit of sarcasm and reality","review":"House of God is a nicely written book - it is a quick read thanks to its fluency. Events happen so fast in the life of the portrayed intern that they simply fly by, which Shem carries across to the reader by not clearly distinguishing them by paragraphs or chapters. This might perhaps not be suitable to all readers. The sarcasm and reality mix quite well and if you are not a doctor yourself, you think twice before entering a hospital next time. The only character I truly didn't enjoy was Berry, the girlfriend of the main protagonist, and her neverending Freudian anecdotes. But this might derive from the fact that I am coming from the psychological side of this profession, who outdated Freud some time ago.Who liked this book might also enjoy \\"The Year of the Intern\\" by Robin Cook, which is quite different from his nowadays trash novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not brilliantly written","review":"but it has a real ring of the ugly truth, heartbreaking and hysterically funny as it is. I read this book when my boyfriend (now husband) was in medical school and he swore that it is all true (with the exeception of the sex...so either 1) times have changed; 2) the author exaggerated; 3) he's protecting me). I would recommend this to anyone with a loved one in the medical profession--just to see where some of the frustration and cynicism comes from."},{"rating":"2","title":"Humor, the best medicine.","review":"An excellent satire, especially for those who work in the medical field.

Despite a promising story line Bertrice Small managed to make this book almost unreadable. A good third of the book was simple explication of Georgian society that read as if she'd lifted it directly from a history book. She obviously researched the book, unfortunately the research didn't stop her from having the heroine call her father 'Pa' of all things, not to mention a host of other simple, yet distracting mistakes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland, boring","review":"Bertrice Small usually dishes up thrilling, exciting erotica but unfortunately this book is none of the above. Although well-researched, the couple isn't that interesting and the subplot with the French Revolution seemed more like filler than a genuine attempt at writing real adventure, and the scenes of rape/sexual abuse of prisoners was a major turnoff. Brutality stuff simply doesn't belong in a romance novel. Can't recommend this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Dud.","review":"I've always been a big fan of this author but I was terribly dissapointed by this book. It read as if someone had just taken a course on how to write a historical romance and was filling in the blanks.

That is the best thing I can say about this book. There was really no plot. They both were looking for spouses and they got married nothing got in the way nothing intesting there. She was a spoiled brat and he seemed decent enough except for the fact that he thought her bold behavior \\"unduchess like\\" but he still rarely if ever did anything to stop it. And when she would step over the line in front of other people he didn't once call her on it which was uncharacteristic of the opinions he had of her behavior. Later elements where thrown into the story that seemed to just be there to add some pages and by the end I cared less about the characters than I did at the beginning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the time","review":"I absolutely LOVE Bertrice Small, but I was very disappointed by this book. The characters were so shallow that it was difficult to keep anyone but the main characters straight! There was no real adventure (unlike Sky O'Malley and family) and the French \\"escape\\" seemed thrown in to prolong the story. The feeling of undying love between Allegra and the Duke never conveyed itself in the reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I agree with the other reviewers and was quite disappointed with this book. I am a fan of Ms. Small so I was looking forward to reading it. It had my attention for the first couple of chapters and then I got bored. The more I read it, the more frustrated I was in the hopes to finish it. But in all honesty, I didn't.I hope her next book will be better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely NOT her best","review":"I am a huge fan of Bertrice Small, but this is a pale imitation of her usual work. The relationship between Alegra and Quinton lacks spark, and there was no real plot to speak of. O.K., so they meet, marry for convenience, she refurbishes his estate, he comes to see her as his true love, and she finally admits she loves him. The rescue of a friend's French relatives from the Reign of Terror was just thrown in -- no big deal. There was definitely no mystery, intrigue, villain, exotic locale, etc. to spice this up. I miss the O'Malleys,the Leslies and the Wyndhams! Not a total bad read, but not for true fans of her novels. Better luck next time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Typically Bertrice","review":"This is a typical Bertrice Small adventure. It lacks the adventure that many of her previous books have had, but it was a book that could not be put down. Filled with her romantic exploits."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forget this one","review":"Just a little rant here--if Ms. Small wants to write about the 18th c., she should do a little research. This novel is so full of mistakes that I wondered why she bothered. Readers shouldn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at all up to snuff!","review":"I simply can't believe that this book was written by Bertrice Small. It seems unfathomable. The characters are shallow and superfical as is the plot. There is no depth to this book at all. Basically it is a repetion of saying, \\"the bluest blood in England marries the richest girl in England\\" over and over and over! So stupid. I love many of Small's novels, but this insipid dribble is not one of them. Stay far, far away. Read Sky O'Malley, or The Kadin or pretty much any other book for the real Small."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, tedious and a waste of money.","review":"The one time I splurge on the trade paperback, I get the worst book I have ever read by Bertrice Small. The plot is lackluster, contains no love triangle or conflict that we have come to expect from this author. Everyone starts out happy, then they get a little sad because bad things are happening to others, but they're fine. Then they're happy again. Big deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another good book by a great author!","review":"Even though the business of going to France was a little bit much I really did like the book. Ms. Small is one of my favorite authors. As such, I have read all of her books. Of course, the Skye O'Malley series was the best, but this book was a fun read. After reading some of the reviews today, I'm glad I bought the book and read it prior to seeing what other people thought about the book. I don't see a movie based on a critic, and I don't read a book on that basis either. Way to go, Ms. Small. I look forward to the next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed about The Duchess","review":"I was very dissapointed with this book. It clearly had none of the exciting heroines of past books by Bertrice Small. Although I was happy to see the mention of the Kira Banking family, I thought that the main character Allegra didn't have any passion such as Jasmine Leslie or Skye O'Malley. It was sad that I had to return the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yes...boring","review":"Do you ever think a time will come when \\"romance\\" readers will realize that men (Quinton, in this too long story) just look silly falling in love with young girls who are as spoiled as Allegra was in this story? What exactly was so lovable about her? I read the book jacket and was already put off by Allegro telling Quinton never to love her. Geeze, that is just plain stupid. Sure, you can have my money, my body, have children, but love? Nope... Dumb if you ask me. Also, the whole French Revolution plot was just thrown in there to try to make it an interesting book. It failed."},{"rating":"1","title":"A MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT!","review":"I am a HUGE Bertrice Small fan but I have to say this is the most boring book I've ever read! I had to force myself to finish reading it, hoping something exciting would come up in the next chapter. Allegra is a spoiled brat who you just want to [hate]! Quinton should've used her money and dumped her! I was so disappointed and angry when I finished this book, I almost ended up burning it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This story could have been so much more.","review":"Well, I just finished The Duchess. (More like a 1 1/2 star). I kept thinking or wondering if in fact Bertrice Small wrote this story. Not at all like her other books which I have read about 90% of so far. The only way you could tell she wrote it was the long descriptions of what people ate. Heaven forbid people ate like that. Well, I put off reading this book because of the bad reviews but I bought it at a store for $1.00 and I must say that is about all it is worth if that. Needless to say it was disappointing for a Bertrice Small book but I got through it and glad to be done with it so I can move on. If you have to pay more than $1.00 for this book I would not recommend spending the money. It was not an awful book but it could have been so much more. I really wanted to slap the little s--t by the end of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"horribly boring and unbelievable","review":"Most of the book is SO boring, I kept skipping ahead but it never got better. There were a lot of uninteresting descriptions of food and other details of daily life. In the middle of the story the main characters go to France to rescue a relative, and they go undercover as lower class citizens but make no mention of speaking lower class french and the whole rescue goes too unbelievably smoothly. Also I found the use of the 'f' word a bit incongruous.The cover art is beautiful, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is Ms Small under contract?","review":"..that she keeps shelling out poor novels? Having read such marvelous works in the past (The Kadin, Skye O'Malley, etc.) I find myself continually disappointed in her current offerings. The Duchess is another failed attempt. It seems Ms. Small is running out of ideas for, as other reviewers suggest, the French Revolution seems tossed in for sake of lengthening the book. Bertie, get a fresh inspiration! Your readers are tired of the O'Malley clan and of spoiled little girls with too much money!The only saving grace is that our 'heroine' is not captured and sold into a harem, hence the 2 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"will the wolf survive","review":"I always buy from you all I get the best servive this cd i would say to all buy this cd a great page in the recordings of waylon it shows how this man kept up to what his fans would agreed is what make waylon the outlaw in contry music his music well live for ever"},{"rating":"1","title":"DISAPPOINTED","review":"I bought this CD for the one song and that's about all I got.

VERY FAST SHIPMENT!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally!","review":"Although the outside of the book may look like a generic TFH product (you know, 10pages of out of date breed info and 40 pages about Nylabones and pictures of various kinds of worms dogs can get) , the inside is a treasure trove of sound, intelligent, up-to-date and breed specific information for the new Papillon owner. Ms Wood's experience with, and love of, the breed shines through on every page. The fact that she has intimate, well researched and thoughtful historical information at hand, has trained 3 of her own Papillons to numerous titles and does therapy work with the breed adds tremendous authority to the work. She understands, and addresses, that Papillons are not a \\"cookie cutter\\" breed and that there is a variety of temperments, sizes and personalites in the breed.Finally! There is a reasonably priced, EXCELLENT source book for anyone interested in the breed...newcomer, or experienced owner alike. If I were a breeder, I'd give out copies of this book to every new owner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good quality.","review":"Looks nice in the picture and the price seems to be a deal, but, once received, it's not hard to see why the price is so low. The quality isn't really much better than rawhide - very thin and stiff. The dimensions given are external measurements so take about an inch to two inches off for internal. I also noticed a few minor flaws. When I tried to return the bag, amazon.com said I had to contact the seller. Made several attempts and couldn't get ahold of anyone and no one answered my emails. Shop around for better quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far, so good!","review":"I am generally pleased with this case. It is stylish and easy to carry. Getting it opened and closed quickly takes some practice and requires two hands, but it is \\"doable\\". The only thing missing is a couple of small, specifically shaped pockets in which to keep pens and business cards. There is a small zippered area in the middle of the case, but you end up throwing all your small items in there making it a little more cumbersome to retrieve them."},{"rating":"2","title":"YKK","review":"Sturdy and well made. I attend religious meetings very often and I have to constantly take out bible, note and articles from my briefcase during the meeting. This is my first Satchel-style briefcase and is very convenient. I also do not like the large briefcase so it works perfect for me. Few minor flaws - no pen holder or slot...no pocket for phone...which I see on many other briefcase. But these don't bother me.If you want something unique, convenience and look professional...I highly recomend this. This is also nice to fit mini-laptop. You can't find this type of item for this price. Looks good for man and woman...but seems little heavy for woman."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty, if you can get it open","review":"love the look and feel of this case but it has a key with it, which I am having trouble getting to unlock the case! Maybe I'm just stupid, but could anyone help me out?"},{"rating":"1","title":"dont buy","review":"I bought this to be a gift and ended up keeping it because it was not that nice. It was already ugly and a little rusted when i got it. It worked okay but the sponge tore apart within the first couple of weeks of light use. I probably wouldnt buy something like this again. The replacement sponges are expensive for being so worthless. The sponges probably dont last long because you have to repeatedly crush them to get the soap out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware!","review":"I haven't read ths book , but being a student of chiropractic, I've learned a little bit about the author..

I applied them with the glue given in the package and she seemed to tolerate them well for the first hour or so. I went to work that day, came home and found her poor little claws mangled and ripped to the quick from her spending the entire day ripping the soft paws off of her claws. I kept finding them all over the floor with ripped out fur stuck in them from the glue. I felt so horrible and will never use them again. If you're going to use Soft Paws, you might want to try it out with a less permanent glue first to make sure your cat won't injure itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I could rate this ZERO stars!","review":"Horrible! As another reviewer has stated, these nail tips work fine when first applied. After just a couple days of having them on, and the nail beginning to grow, my cat managed to catch his nail in the lace edging of my rather expensive bedding. 'Rags' couldn't free himself, nor could I extricate the nail ........ ended up having to cut the bedding. Just a few moments ago, it happened for a second time, only this time he wrapped his leg around one of the vertical supports to my brass bed and was hanging off the side by the caught nail! Again, had to cut the expensive bedding!Poor 'Rags' nail is so sore now from this last episode. Soft paws? They can keep them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL!","review":"These are horrible. Actually they're fine until their claws start growing out but the caps don't fall off. Mine wound up with his paw stuck in my couch when the cap pushed through the fabric and got stuck at the ridge between the cap and his grown out claw. It was an awful experience. He was stuck to the couch, freaking out, screaming, luckily I was home to CUT HIM FREE. So now I have another hole in my couch but this time it's the result of trying to help the cause. I returned the rest of the pack to Petsmart and told the people there to caution people against buying these. Definitely not worth the trouble."},{"rating":"1","title":"Soft paws are torture!!","review":"Horrible product!

I'm taking her to the vet to get them removed before she has another horrible episode. :("},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible.","review":"Gee, I can't decide what part of this experience has been better. Spending 2 hours putting these on (because trust me, your kitty will NOT sit still while you apply these) or watching them attempting (and in a couple cases, succeeding) to tear their claws out. Save your money. These are crap. I honestly think the cats would prefer declawing. At least it isn't as slow and painful as ripping their own claws out with their teeth.Did I mention my fingers are still covered in superglue?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissappointing","review":"Although the idea is great, practically - not so much. Since Dec, I have purchased 5 packages of Soft Claws for my kitten, yea... kitten. I have to replace at least one cover daily, which means when given 5 applicators, 5 divided into 30 days, leaves you short.I have had issues with some of the glue. I have returned 3 sets of glue, because it was rock hard, dried, and outdated. But I think that has more to do with Petco not shifting stock, or maybe it is becuase people are not buying them.Either way, between the glue and the soft claws not staying on, it has made the experience very frustrating. Time for a Pedi Paw!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Caught in everything!","review":"We did a lot of research before we got a cat. We decided on a Hairless cat that we got from a breeder. We are toilet training her and we were going to get her declawed but we thought this would be more humane. However now that she is finally big enough to put the kitten size on ( they are really big) She was foung wound up in the curtains tonight. I worry this problem will become worse as the nail bed grows more. Not sure if this will work for my kitty. May consider Declawing again."},{"rating":"1","title":"unhappy kitties","review":"Like many here, after hearing favorable reviews about Soft Paws, I just had to try them out on our 3 cats. They looked adorable and seemed to be a practical idea. Hubby and I applied them correctly. Two of our cats seemed to tolerate them well, while the youngest hated them from the start. I went to work and came home only to find all 3 of their claws mangled and torn to the quick. They were able to bite off all but a few of the Soft Paws. The cats were very unhappy - and hid when I came in the door (not like them at all!) I felt so bad for them, and will never use them again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Caps get caught all the time!","review":"I bought this product for my 3-month-old kitten. They were easy to apply (I glued them on while she was napping) and she didn't even notice they were there when she woke up. They were very effective for preventing scratching. HOWEVER, we have many rugs with looped carpeting and she gets her nail caps caught in the loops several times every day. I was only able to work her claw out two times.....the other 20+ times I have had to cut the yarn in the rug to get her out. Just a few minutes ago she got caught (for the second time in less than one minute) and she started rolling around and got her arm twisted behind her in a way that makes me wonder how she may have injured herself had I not been right there to help her. Now I worry every time I have to leave her alone because I'm afraid she will hurt herself. I can't get the caps off (I tried nail polish remover)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked for my 2 cats","review":"My 2 cats were destroying furniture and carpet. I got soft paws and they worked! No issues with them.both my cats will chew at them in the beginning but they didn't get any off and they got used to them by the second day!the applying process was quick.

Irritaing to cuticle","review":"I was really excited about these, but instructions are very poor. I extended his nail, placed cap on, then when they retracted it was a bit close to cuticle. It drove hime nuts, and he licked and bit at his claws for days, irritaing them and making them red and sore, I couldnt get anywhere near them, without him showing pain aggression. It was a nightmare!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great...IF they stayed on","review":"I bought these for my cat two days ago and we are on day three. I applied the Soft Claws to her front nails (4 to each foot) and held her the requisite five minutes to allow proper drying time. She ripped two off the first day, two the second day, and three today. It seems to me that if this product did its job then they would not be able to come off so easily. What a disappointment and waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for every cat. Lots of pain with mine.","review":"I've tried this product several times over the course of several years with different cats and have always had the same results. The glue is not effective for more than a few days and once the nails start to grow, the more active cats have problems getting caught in toys, furniture, linens, etc. Even the less active of my cats has caught a nail in the bedding where she slept. I found that the old fashioned nail trimming with regular human nail clippers was by far the most effective and painless way of keeping the nails at bay. It took less time, and one trip to the vet for guidance on how to properly trim nails for this to work. I suffer no pain from sharp claws, no furniture damage, and I have NEVER cut to far. I am always very careful when doing this as it is easy to cut too far and cause severe pain and bleeding in the nail. But overall, this \\"old-fashioned\\" method gave me the results I wanted, and the caps gave me grief and the cats pain and irritation."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing","review":"I don't know who this guy was or where he came from, but he is brillant. Who would think of mixing bagpipes with 70s Jimmy Smith/Larry Young style organ.Well, Harley did, and the results are phonomanal. Part of the hook here is that he is not using bagpipes the way you would normally hear them. Harley somehow makes these things take on a droney, middle eastern tone. He extends a few notes and draws them out, and so the pipes work as ambience.When I was a kid, my dad was in a pipe and drums band, and I was forced to listen to a lot of traditional bagpipes music.

Weird and varied just a real interesting listen.Rufus' bagpipe playing with the drone is just a real favorite of mine. I love the drone sound of bagpipes, sitars have that drone too, it just does it for me. I've read that Scottish professional bagpipe players criticised his style as not correct to the norm.

Although there's nothing wrong with Martha's contribution, the compositions leave a lot to be desired.For a sense of where Rabinovitch is coming from, take one part Kabalevsky, two parts Camille Saint-Saens, one part Hanon, and stir in a little Philip Glass. While they are well recorded and expertly performed, these compositions are of limited interest. Trying very hard to be pretty, Rabinovitch uses ostinato to excess, driving melodic fragments into the ground. There is some variety but no development of the musical ideas. The title piece is a twenty-five minute gloss on \\"Aquarium\\" from Carnival of the Animals, and the next draws heavily on \\"Persons with long ears\\" from the same source, again drawn out. Finding the other sources for these pieces isn't hard but that quickly becomes tiresome. It is about all I can think of to do with this music. I wish there were more to say."},{"rating":"2","title":"The World's Best Newspapers are in this Book.","review":"I bought this book because I wanted to see the world's best newspaper designs. What I got is more than expected. Now I know what makes best newspapers. It's a combination of a lot of things. There are lessons to be learnt although the book is not a manual. Newspaper designers, editors, photographers and art directors better work together hand in hand to produce the highest quality newspaper or else....

Both of them are about the same in writing comfort, and the OEM ink cartridges are fine. The PhD refill are metal and more expensive, vs. the Dr. Grip refills are plastic and less expensive. The problem with the PhD pens is that the black rubber (synthetic?) grip disintegrates over time. It also seems to absorb the oils from your skin and develops an oily film. It feels a little gross using an \\"old\\" pen. On the other hand, the Dr. Grips have a white silicone grip that feels like new even after many years."},{"rating":"1","title":"great pen/poor service","review":"I know its just a pen, but its a great deal if you like what they give you.I have several of these pens and they write great, thats why I ordered it on line for a good price.The feel of the pen is comfortable...I did not recieve the correct order and I can't seem to get what I ordered.I like the pen and just want what I ordered!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't last","review":"Yes, this is a fine pen.

The bureaucracy I'm in has been largely computerized since 2000, but it used to be quite common for me to write all day long. Spending the extra money on these PhDs proved an excellent investment. They greatly eased the pain in my hands and fingers and made me more content at work.

The burgundy and black is stylish and classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"I wanted to treat myself to a nice pen but didn't want to spend an extravagant amount of money on it. So after reading the good reviews on the Paper Mate PhD, I decided to buy it.I've been using it for a couple of days now and I just don't like this pen's writing ability. The \\"Lubriglide\\" system doesn't glide at all. The pen skips a lot and the ink comes out looking a dull grey rather than a sharp black. And when I write, the ballpoint clatters against the edge where it emerges from the pen, giving me this constant rattling sound. Opening the pen and re-seating the ink cartridge within the barrel hasn't helped, so I'm under the impression that either the hole at the end of the barrel is too wide or the cartridge is too narrow.On the positive side, it's a nice looking pen and is very comfortable to write with. The ergonomic grip is soft, but not so soft as to make the pen difficult to control. I just wish the mechanics of ink delivery were better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elegant case, and tough too.","review":"I wanted a case for my iPod mini that would protect it when I threw it in my computer bag.

The book is constructed well, and doesn't seem like it's going to fall apart with heavy use. Nearly all of the word entries have examples of usage from Cicero, Virgil, Horace, etc., which has come in handy once or twice.The only thing I've found lacking from this dictionary is that some of the more \\"colorful\\" language that crops up from time to time, notably in Catullus 16, 41, and 57, has been left out.

It's the first dictionary I've ever owned, but some useful features I've found are: it gives the basic meaning of the word, then lists literal and figurative/transferred meanings; it quotes Latin to help give the meaning of words; it has tabs on the side indicating where letters are located in the book, making it faster to find words; for compound words, it lists the component words e.g. comes -itis c. (cum/eo) and also, if the word came from Greek, the Greek word it came from; it also indicates short and long vowels.The only downside is that it's not for beginners. It assumes you have complete knowledge of grammar, as there are no grammar tables, and also assumes you have some understanding of the vocab, e.g. it doesn't list irregular verb parts."},{"rating":"2","title":"good info to have.","review":"Cassell's Latin Dictionary; a must for students.

A writer whose subjects range from science and philosophy to Renaissance art and everyday life, he writes beautiful, funny, and extremely smart poetry. Try \\"How I Got in the Business\\" for a hilarious narrative that parallels the poetry biz with raising and producing olive oil for a mafia family. This poem is the author's second Georgic (his first was \\"A Georgic for Doug Crane,\\" which told in equally funny detail how to raise, press, and bottle grapes). In both, the laughter gives way to reflection, and ultimately, beauty by the end. It's Bradley's signature gesture--the sudden turn from irreverence to lyric grace. Here, he pulls the trick off again and again: in shorter poems, like \\"A Poet in the Kitchen\\" and \\"My Poem Meets Tamerlane,\\" as well as in the gorgeous sonnet sequence on the turn of the seasons, \\"A Year in New England.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"The bible through a poet's eyes interesting for everyone","review":"Irene Zimmerman's third book of poetry, \\"Woman Un-Bent\\" is outstanding reading for all.

The clamp on transmitter did not seem to generate enough signal strength for the receiver to find the proper cord. The receiver seemed to give many erroneous detections and that is not helpful at all. If I were to trip the breaker for the wrong server those computer users would be down and no one would be happy.

While I agree that solo diving has somewhat of a taboo status, I would think that anyone who buys this book does not need convincing that solo diving is viable. And while I agree that redundant air systems are important, there are other techniques (such as lift bags and double first stages) that I hoped would be touched on.

This meant that the cook could harvest all of the juice, plus the tasty bits, instead of, as with this product, having to strain the sauce first (for the bits) and then sacrifice some of the sauce (a small amount to be sure), lest the fat start to flow through the spout as well. This product is really just a step away from spoon and ice cube, and not a big step, considering that it's not a complete solution. If the cooks's purpose were to collect the fat--e.g., chicken schmalz--free from juices, it would present the same problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing and pretentious","review":"As an experienced knitter (35 years+) this book should be just right for me but I was very disappointed. The graphics and print are very hard to read. Schematics are very tiny. I'm not interested in a life philosophy of knitting, but in cables. Yarns are mainly Canadian so lack of more information on yarns needed and gauge is critical and lacking.Gauge is given over the cable pattern instead. If I knit anything here, I would have to redesign each one first. Why knit the scarf in two halves? No explanation given. One sweater uses I-cord at the bottom but no advice on how to knit without those i-cords. Best projects are for little kids. Not recommended.

Then I'd have to look at the sizes to figure out who the pattern was for, they didn't say anything so gauche (and useful) as \\"child's\\", or \\"men's\\" sweater. But still I kept looking, and discovered the final sin-they list the numeric size of the the yarn used, and the grams of the type of yarn used, but don't bother to add the meters.

Parker is a book of poetry about the first seasons of the television show, \\"Xena: Warrior Princess.\\" The poems here focus, as the show did in its early years, on the multi-layered, complex relationship between the lead characters. But you don't need to have ever seen those shows to understand this book. Parker's verse is always accessible - inhabited by three-dimensional people whose emotional lives we not only understand but care about. Her imagery is strong and her wit is subtle.Writing poetry about cultural work in another medium places Parker's book in the tradition of \\"Pictures from Brueghel,\\" William Carlos Williams' Pulitzer Prize-winning book from the early sixties."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so Hot","review":"I am currently using this book in a class on XML.

I just couldn't relate to the British version, probably because I didn't grow up there. The British version (original one) is probably just as good for them as the American version is for me.Paid $47.99 for Series 1, $42.99 for Series 2, & shipping was free.

I finally screamed at it and said no more of this trash talk.I'd love to watch an edited version and find out what happens. I will never understand why movie producers feel the need to make language so bad. If it was occ use I could have blocked it out but it is constant. So if language bothers you this is not a movie for you.Update 7-2010 I may watch it again.

A stick or a stone?\\" And so the game begins. Would you rather be an elbow or a knee, mouse or elephant, rain or snow, snake or crocodile, alone or together? Some of the answers seem to be obvious, as we see a balding, eyeglass wearing, paper reading grown-up come out of the hat, compared to a skateboard riding kid. But it's clear from the start that there are no right or wrong answers. Just thoughtful, clever fun. William Steig's minimal text, floating in dialogue bubbles, sets the stage. But it's Harry Bliss' bold, bright, and expressive artwork that steals the show with its humorous detail. Perfect for preschoolers, Which Would You Rather Be? is a simple and entertaining picture book that will get those creative juices flowing. This is just the beginning; the game is sure to continue long after the book is closed."},{"rating":"2","title":"instant hit... nice idea","review":"my twins liked this book straight away. at 2 and a half they picked up on the theme and started making up \\"which would you rather be\\" questions of their own.

Such is the case with this cocktail shaker. It's beautiful in form but weak in function. The style is great but it is messy to use. At least one ounce of a drink will go up into the cap while shaking. If it does not settle back into the container, it runs down the sides and all over your hands, counter, floor etc. when you take the cap off. Pouring from the shaker is equally as messy due to the bad arrangement of the holes in the strainer. I was really disappointed and sent mine back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definately not impressed.","review":"This shaker is not of the quality I expected. It is very thin metal and neither top fits correctly. Due to the poor fit of the smaller of the two tops, it is sometimes necessary to hold it on while shaking. I find this setup clumsy.The large top fits a bit too tight and I could hardly even get it off. All in all I would not recommend this shaker. Even if your just concerned with having something that looks good on the bar. The shape is very sleek and cool but I feel that the metal causes it to simply look cheap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Charming!","review":"This beautiful book is funny and heart-warming!

It has fake (body parts), fake (male-female-interactions), fake acting, and a fake story. Nobody in this movie is interesting. Most of the women, including Maria Ford, spend most of the movie with expressions on their faces as if they had just bitten into a rotten lemon. To top it off, the movie opens with enough closeups of Maria Ford in the shower that you can tell she's been \\"surgically augmented,\\" and things go downhill from there. This movie wasn't even worth watching as a diversion while treadmill-walking.If game-playing ... turns you on, get the original.

When I opened this box there was only 2 slivers of foam within the entire box. Needless to say the headboard had 3 crushed corners. My daughter was so excited to get a new bed that I felt it wasn't worth the extra effort to exchange because I would probably end up with the same ragged corners because the packing is so poor. I am desperately trying to ignore the ugly cracks on the headboard.

Very poorly packaged and Amazon was unwilling to work with the manufacturer to replace the hardware on my behalf. After it arrived, was unboxed (box looked like it had been opened before and was ripped in several places), hauled up a flight of steps--- they expected me to pack it back up and ship it back to them just to get a bag of bolts. Right. First bad experience I have ever had with Amazon.

It's a wonder she hasn't really injured herself. I have padding on the sides and at the foot of the bed. If I could possibly afford a new one with better design, this one would get tossed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor entry into the werewolf category","review":"I was very very disappointed by this installment for many reasons. The special effects were good, not overdone. However.... the plot was actually a good one, they just lost it somehow.The actual connection to the original howling I cannot see, except that it was based on the second book in the series and they didn't really explain in the movie how they were connected. Maybe just the title?The original Howling had the tension, acting, scant but effective special effects, great plot, a sense of paranoia and a sense of a horrible discovery along with some really good acting. The only good acting in this one is the mother. Part played well.There wasn't the sense of tension here, just a rolling ball of a plot. They could have easily played on the fact that 'they are all around us', but they didn't.Not recommended at all. The original is still the best, skip all the other howling movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful !","review":"I usually rent a movie before purchasing but I bought this movie soley because I remember how much I liked the werewolves in the original. I figured with todays fx capabilities it would be even better, boy was I wrong. I wish I hadn't purchased it, I didn't even finish watching it. I wanted cool looking special fx on my 50 inch HDTV and if the story was good then that would be a bonus. What I got was a halfassed Twilight knockoff with shamefull low budget effects, what little fx there was. The acting wasn't that bad but when a werewolf attacks someone you expect to see the wolf and you simply did not. After they cut away a few times its like WTF. The whole thing was a ripoff. Thank god it was only about 8 bucks. Some people may like it but I suggest a red box rental for a buck and a half."},{"rating":"1","title":"The howling reborn","review":"Not an epic failure, but boring. I expected a 2011 movie to be worthy of watching, this movie was not worthy of my time. It had good special effects compare to B movies. However there were times when you could see how cheap it was. In example when school was burning, the fire looked so bad. The werewolf costume looked so cheap actually, especially the legs. When 2 werewolves collapsed, you could well see that there is no life captured in those costumes. There was either one of actors present or none at all. Not until the next scene. I don't think there is really any point in writing more about the movie itself, it was so boring to watch. Not an epic failure, but it's bad. I would NOT consider it to be another Howling movie. Yes, howling is notorious for a few good and most bad movies mixed together in one huge sequel/collection. But why this movie? It's out of place. There is nothing about rebirth and nothing about howling at all. Could give it another name."},{"rating":"1","title":"SUCKS","review":"I'll keep this short and sweet this movie is BAD.

I would've given it a two or three based on the merits of the sound financial background the author possessed, but it was so awful a piece of fiction I couldn't do it.The dialogue was awful, as was the plot. The characters were shallow and boring, especially his main characters. But worst of all was its conclusion. For example, you learn on the last page of the book that the killer wasn't really a woman, or a man, I forget because I was rushing to the bathroom to gag.A truly awful book.

I mounted two of these into the board at the back wall of the closet, which provides me about 20 inches of closet bar on which to hang my clothes. As a previous review mentions, these are very sturdy as a product, but if you don't mount them to something equally sturdy, the weight of your clothes will tear them off your wall. The adjustable aspect is nice, but note in the picture that if you want the product to hang straight down, the notched end sticks up above the circular mounting plate--if you, like me, have to mount them to a narrow board built into the closet and that board is topped by a shelf, you won't have enough room to use this feature and will have to install them so they remain in the deployed position. Not a fault of the product, just something I didn't consider before buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Great!","review":"Love this thing! Very simple to install.

I prefer historical fiction (Jeff Shaara) or fantasy (George R.R. Martin). This book left me very unsatisfied. The protagonist is flawed to the point of being unlikeable. The ending felt like a weak cop-out. I chose this book to read because I was travelling and needed a \\"thin\\" book that was easy to carry. Reading Harry Potter with my 8 year old was more rewarding than 'The Monsters of Gramercy Park'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this book","review":"The \\"About the Author\\" section explains that Dave's cat, Taffy, writes his code. He should have let the cat write the book as well. The book ventures beyond beginner level often and quickly. The code is often broken up into seperate sections, usually in a logical order, too often not. There are also too many obvious errors in the code examples, even rediculous things like opening one header size and closing with a different one. If you are going to have people pay for a product, take the time to check it. Over all, the book does a good job at explaining most concepts of ASP but is confusing when trying to learn the specifics, which is rather important in writing code."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inconsistent","review":"Well this book starts of great. The first 3 chapters are very nice and straight forward to follow. After that though, the book jumps around ALOT, and is very hard to follow. Lots of liitle details are left out in order to save pages. The examples in the book are downloadable off the Internet don't always work. This book needs to be written clearer and more detailed. I was very very frustrated with the book and strongly not recommend the book to other readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for first-time programmers","review":"Though this book bills itself as providing \\"essential skills for first-time programmers,\\" a look at Module 2 should convince you otherwise. As the author explains, ASP is a technology and not a programming language, so to use active server pages you'll have to become familiar with a scripting language such as VBScript or JScript. But Module 2 will stop you dead in your beginner's tracks, when under the heading \\"VBScript Basics,\\" the author declares in the third paragraph, \\"Variables can be declared anywhere within code, simply by using the Dim statement. However, it is wise to use the Option Explicit statement (<% Option Explicit Dim var1, var 2 %>) at the beginning of your code, because it forbids the use of variable names that have not been explicitly dimensioned.\\" Good luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starts great, quickly becomes confusing","review":"My first impressions of this book were favorable. I quickly changed my mind. I found that the book said that it was for a beginner but did not deliver. I found that I needed to research much of the VB script and other aspects of the book in order to understand it. I got tired of it and returned the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"For those who want to get to the point","review":"I find this book to be great help for someone who has programmed (like me) in another language who needs a quick start. I don't recommend this book for those that need hand holding, a \\"newbie\\" to programming, or want to finish the book in a day.

Often times I refer to this book for pointers."},{"rating":"1","title":"This guys is a beginner as a book writer","review":"This book has wonderful information, however, when the author lays out an example in the book it is not labled nor is it at all complete.

Did I already say that? We bought it so that we can take Briggs and Angus, our two Maltese, along on our bike ride/rollerblades to the Pier - and we also got the Stroller Kit for taking them other places that we may not be able to take them otherwise. It was so easy to assemble, and they jumped right in. They love riding in it!! Briggs, who is 15, sleeps comfortably and Angus looks out the window. There is plenty of room for both of them. My fiance loves pulling them on his bike, attaching and detaching it is simple and the hitch is barely noticable on the bike when the trailer is not attached. Converting from a trailer to a stroller is so easy, as is folding it up to transport it. It fits in the back of my MINI, no problem.

I bought it with the intentions of taking my CATS for bike rides when I hit the trails. I started out by just taking them around the sub-division in order to get them used to it. I didn't want any mishaps (i.e. them clawing their way out of the trailer) once I got on the bike trail. Needless to say, we've only made it to the subdivision. Weather got cold and stuff came up. I'm hoping I can get to the trails this year. It's super easy to assemble and probably takes a total of 5 minutes, if not less. Pretty cool! It's great quality, and I haven't detected any awful or strong odors of plastic. I attempted to take my miniature dachshund for a ride in it, and she cried the entire time. Strange! I thought she would've loved it more than the cats. Bottom-line: awesome product, great quality, looking to invest in the stroller kit. Love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Babs Loves It!","review":"Quick echo of what everyone else has said: This trailer is very easy to 'assemble' and, more importantly if space is an issue, it is very easy to 'disassemble' and collapse for storage.My 1 complaint is how noisy the wheels are. When you are riding you will hear wacky, cartoon-like rattling. It is sort of annoying.But, if you asked me if you should buy it I would say yes.Also, for the Gentlemen in the audience, having a dog trailer helps with the cyclist ladies.

I wasn't sure if they would like the ride until the second time we rode and they both jumped into the trailor excitedly! I haven't noticed any wheel noise, I did put extra padding on the floor of the trailor for their comfort. My neighbor put everything together for me in minutes. It is very easy to attach to the bike.

Super fast to put together when I read the directions, am a woman in my 50s. So excited when it arrived, put it together in a few minutes and used it right away. My puppy is scared of everything at first, but she did really well. I put toys in it for her to get out and acted like it was a fun thing. Then we went for a short walk first before taking a short trip around the neighborhood. Came home and packed some water and leash and such, went for a couple of miles and walked at the park and back home. Kept praising her and she did well, only when she saw squirrels, but the short leash inside holds her save. Even left it open the first time towards me,she was so cute.

I'm surprised the company would send a product that an animal would ride in that had such a strong plastic odor."},{"rating":"2","title":"You will love this","review":"I bought this to take my two small dogs biking with me.

( My first impression of the pneumatic tires is that they looked and felt cheap.) We took our sheltie on two rides, each about 30 miles long.Toward the end of the second ride, a tire popped. Upon examination, I found that the tread rubber was completely worn through, with threads showing everywhere on both tires! I am contacting the seller for restitution. The cloth part of the trailer is reasonably constructed. Our dog whined for 3 miles, then settled down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great way to bring your pet with you on a ride.","review":"I absolutely love this product. Now I can ride my bike without leaving my Shih Tzu at home. He jumped right in before I had the chance to tempt him with a treat. I think it's best to start any dog out with a few short runs to get them used to the movement and confinement etc. The first time he protested because he wanted to get out and run with us instead of riding, but he soon got the idea. I have found it helpful to walk him first so he gets his activity out of the way before I put him in. Now I ride around the neighborhood at night when it is cooler and he is fine with it. It seems to be well made and sturdy but still easy to mount on the bike. I recently purchased another bike attachment so when my husband is with me, he can pull him though it isn't difficult at all and I am in my fifties and had leg surgery less than a year ago.I would definitely recommend to a friend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product!","review":"My wife and I have 2 kids, I mean dogs, a 13 lb Poodle-Shih-Tzu mix and a 18 pound Shih-Tzu, and wanted some way to take them with us when we go for a bike ride. At one time I had a basket mounted on my bike that I was able to carry one of them in, but they had a tendency to want to jump out at the sight of another dog. That plus the fact that I looked fruity, riding around like Dorothy and Toto in Kansas, so I saw this on Amazon and ordered it. It works great, although the dogs would rather be on our laps. They took to it fairly quickly, but it may have been a bit hot for them in the sun. This was the medium trailer and the two of them fit in pretty well, maybe a bit cozy but they seemed okay with it. This trailer was well built, towed easily and is easy to set up and take down.

The only downside to this video is that it only shows 4 videos of Kiss when they still wore make-up but the other songs more than well make up for that. This video takes you backstage and the members talk about life on the road and in the studio. And there is a great scene with a real powerful type woman, if you have seen the scene, you know what I'm talking about. The only other bad part is it leaves out a great song: Rock 'N' Roll All Nite which in my opinion is one of their best if not their best songs.

The kit can repair older stoves (with metal pump cap) or newer ones (with plastic cap), but comes configured for the newer stoves. To convert it for older stoves, you have to remove a spring clip beneath the rubber plunger. This allows you to slide the parts off the shaft and replace the plastic cap with a metal one and coil spring (included). Removal of the spring clip requires a good pair of needle-nosed pliers and some care to avoid damage to the plunger. Once the clip is off, re-assembly is simple. A new spring clip is included in the kit, which is good, because you'll probably bend the original one beyond reuse.

Like any great songwriter he has a great band. ken, murray and philip are great. The old 97's are one of the most consistent bands around, if you like one cd youll probably like them all.This is definetly worth picking up.

Dr. Resnikoff's model promotes flexibility and balance in the use of medication and therapy: His model demonstrates how crucial it is for the therapist to observe and listen to client(s) initially, and as therapy proceeds.

Please note that the packaging that this car comes in states that it is a detailed scale model for adult collectors. When I received my 5 Series BMW, one of the mirrors had fallen off. Also, the sun roof had a spot on it that could not be removed. I was not happy at all with the quality of the car. After contacting and informing the model car company about my concerns, they stated that I could return the car by paying for my own shipping, or of course receive a refund less the cost of shipping and a 15% re-stocking fee. The next day, however, I called again and I was told that I would be reimbursed for shipping costs after returning the model, and they apologized for sending me an unsatisfactory model.

The author of the review stated that this work of non-fiction reads much like fiction, and I concur. Most of the book is well-written and engaging, though it leaves the contemporary reader scratching his head in wonderment that these events happened less than a century ago. Ultimately, there are no heroes in this book, however. It still seems incredible to me that there was virtually no discussion of race or ancestry, either within the Jones family or with Kip Rhinelander. Rhinelander really comes off as quite the cad. He appears to have genuinely loved Alice Jones (as she did in return), but he was so spineless in being \\"forced\\" into pursuing an annulment of his marriage. It is also sad that Alice never remarried or had children. Both her life and Rhinelander's appear to have been largely wasted. That is the real tragedy of the tale."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helpful","review":"This book is an extremely helpful tool for all who would like to know more about MRI, I'm just an A-level physicist and it proved a fountain of knowledge, though it does tend to deal with the maths (I'm English) by ignoring it (though I hate maths as much as any normal person).

The author's personal story, as well as the stories of others are included. What I really like is the analogy that the author uses with garbage and a garbage bag. Garbage after a while really begins to stink. If you carry the garbage of sexual abuse around too long it will really start to stink. As the abuse goes on more garbage is added and the worse the smell gets. The process of getting rid of the garbage is healing from the abuse through therapy or other means."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jars","review":"I am going to use these cute little jars to hold my bulk spices, they will look so cute sitting out on the shelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Impressive","review":"A friend in Canada recommended this film to me and I thoroughly enjoyed it. It's a pretty unique movie that doesn't follow any set Hollywood formula and it delivers plenty of drama. I loved the relationship between Cassandra and Lucas and how they're torn between their families in the tradition of Romeo and Juliet. But I just can't pin down what makes this movie work because it's unlike any other love story I have seen before. I had read about the director, Anne-Sophie Dutoit, in an L.A.

She will acquire more maturity and poise as a filmmaker as she grows older, but this first film is very impressive indeed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who is giving these positive reviews?","review":"This movie is terrible! I can't believe it has so many positive reviews---considering the reviewers all either a)share the same last name as the teenager who wrote/directed/starred in this movie and 2)live in or around Los Angeles, CA....it seems like these are people Anne-Sophie knows who are inflating the positive ratings on purpose to sell this movie. This movie was written/directed/starred in by a 16 year old girl. In all ways this movie looks and feels like a bad teenage novella. The acting is terrible, the movie is boring, it is a low budget high school project. I have no idea who backed the funding for this movie, probably the girl's own family. If you are dying to see this movie I suggest you rent it first.

When Caillou's father empties the potty into the toilet, the accompanying illustration shows Caillou standing outside the bathroom door, looking embarrassed. Why?

It's just a gimmick to have a computer in the vicinity of the 2 sex-starved main characters when the action heats up. The characters are completely interchangeable, uninteresting, and one dimensional. He could be the plumber and she a dog-walker, it just doesn't matter. In each case, he's unbelieveably handsome and well hung, and she's drop-dead gorgeous and built like a brick outhouse. Somehow they've managed to keep their hands off each other for some length of time, but by the time we meet them, the dam has burst. There's nothing left for them to do but get naked and get nasty. Lather, rinse, repeat, ad nauseam. Ms. McCarthy is very thorough in her descriptions of two people in the heat of passion. She gets 2 stars for that. The rest is filler.

However, if you're looking for quality writing, characters with more than one dimension, and a storyline that is interesting and exciting, then you will hate this book.

The exercises say to start with a shape as shown in the picture and then \\"tweak\\" the shape until it looks like the other picture shown. I don't see how that can be called instructional. Unfortunately, how to get from one to the other is a complete mystery. I unsuccessfully spent several hours just trying to get anything accomplished with this book.

I bought the Hoffritz model a few weeks ago an would recommend the upgrade for a few important features:1) the bowl -- the Hoffritz model has a built in bowl (large) that allows absolutely no slippage when you're working. This allows for zero danger with the blades, and no wrestling when it comes to stubborn vegetables.2) the bowl -- the bowl doubles as a storage for all the blades (there is a little rack as well) and parts. You pack it up and it takes up very modest space.3) the blades -- the Hoffritz blades are so sharp (they make knives) that you occasionally have to check to see if you're actually cutting anything.4) the body -- very well constucted. If all goes well, this will survive a busy kitchen for a long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mandoline Slicer","review":"I thought this product was going to be great because my parents had the \\"original Borner V-slicer\\" and it was awesome but I was totally disappointed when I received this.

I want to suggest that the company offer a blade shield of some sort so that others don't run into this same problem.

Even so, this item is a waste of money.Only two thicknesses for slices. Both too thick for potato chips.Inserts don't stay in place. Need to hold them in place with one hand while slicing with the other. If you don't the back end will pop up at the end of each stroke and your slices will be wedge shaped.Large julienne insert makes good french fries (if you hold it in place), but the vertical blades get bent too easily.Too small! A russet potato is a couple of inches too long to use without cutting off an inch or two. So if you like your fries long, forget it.Pay a few extra bucks and get something useful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plastic inserts come out while slicing","review":"I bought one of these, and I am returning it. It doesn't work very well at all, and the triangular plastic pieces used to set the width fall out while slicing.I bought a Benriner brand plastic slicer instead - it is the same idea as this, with a slightly higher price, and it works much much better. There is an extra-wide version that I paid the extra money for. Remember - always use the guard. Don't slice your fingers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Cheap","review":"I bought this same slicer but bought it elsewhere. Out of the box the blade was very dull.

For about the first three minutes I was impressed with how fast it cut and how sharp the blade was. Then I got to the celery and was going to town cutting away but I had to hold the celery straight up to get it cut the way I wanted it. I was not paying attention apparently because all of a sudden I saw blood. Lots of blood. I didn't feel a thing but I completely cut off the end of my thumb. I spent five hours in the emergency room before the doctor could get my wound cauterized, cleaned up, and bandaged.

They do play splendidly on this disc, and join Ensemble Akademia in some of the most striking music of Heinrich Schütz.Ensemble Akademia sings with precision and drama in several motets and in the central work, the Musicalische Exequien. Highlights include a vigorous reading of 'Saul, Saul was verfolgst du mich?' and moving introsepction in 'Selig sind die Toten' ( fitting counterpart to the Exequien, in which this text features). The solo contributions are perfectly sung; Hans Jörg Mammel is eloquent in 'Mit dem Amphion zwar', but Phillipe Roche's singing of 'Fili mi Absalon' is exemplary and puts Richard Wistreich and His Majesty's Sagbutts and Cornetts to shame.The Exequien is less satisfactory on the whole; Phillipe Herreweghe and La Chapelle Royale are possibly more colourless in this work, but their sense of the monumental nature of this piece is more satisfying."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is not a keepsake book.","review":"If you are looking for a keepsake book, this is not it.

My garlic has only been out of the ground for two months. Perhaps it would work on store bought garlic which is typically very dry which makes the skin more brittle. The inside surface of the gadget is smooth. I think some may have some ridges which might help break the garlic skin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shockingly Useful","review":"I tried this at a friend's house and it was amazing. Much faster and easier than whacking the garlic clove with the side of your knife (well, at least for klutzes like me who have to stop and think a moment before they whack on anything that has a sharp edge...) We peeled several cloves without having to clean it. No problems. Afterwards the roller rinsed right out. I got one for myself as soon as I got home."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk Drawer Status","review":"This currently resides unused in my junk drawer. I initially bought it to ease the pain of peeling garlic when I make 40 Clove Garlic Chicken. After 5 or 6 cloves, it's a waste of time because you have to get the skins out and they seem to like it inside and won't just come out with a sharp rap on the counter. I have better results putting the cloves in a plastic container with a lid and shaking it vigorously or blanching the garlic and slipping the skins off. I'm glad others find it useful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so much","review":"This is a preliminary assessment. I will continue to work with it to see if I can make it work better but my first experience was pretty poor. The instructions say roll and press firmly until it cracks then the clove will come out peeled. Only about one or two in ten cloves worked on my first attempt. On the others, the skin wouldn't come off or the clove crushed. After a few crushed, the inside got slippery so it wouldn't work at all. I really wanted this to work. I like simple solutions. I will try again later."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Good For Me","review":"I wasn't sure how well this would work, but I have to say that I am very pleased with it. When I wanted peeled garlic without crushing the cloves I used to just roll them between my hands. It's effective, but after several cloves it could take a couple days for my hands to recover. While not perfect, for me this makes peeling garlic much easier and quicker."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes peeling garlic a breeze!!","review":"I hate, hate, hate peeling garlic.

The peeler is a bit too large in circumference and did a poor job when i tried it. The amount of rolling the clove took was excessive and it took longer than it would have had i just bashed it. That is probably the reason that professional chefs dont use a device like this and just go for the speed and simplicity of the knife bash. If you want to spend the day rolling cloves then buy this but i would not recommend it as a serious device and technique."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unnecessary and low productivity.","review":"It does the job of peeling garlic, though not always on the first try.It gets dirty fast because garlic peels sort of stick to the inside. It's very easy to clean, but then you lose the time savings which it was supposed to deliver. If you want to peel more than a couple of cloves, it's a big nuisance.And it's simply unnecessary. To peel garlic, put it down on the cutting board (or counter) and whack it with the flat side of any tool (I use whatever chef's knife or cleaver is sitting around, or even the bottom of a can). The peel will come right off."},{"rating":"1","title":"This item is a joke","review":"This item is a joke. It does not work very well.

Save your money"},{"rating":"2","title":"no more garlic skins on the floor","review":"This is really clever - put the garlic clove in the sleeve, roll it on your kitchen counter, and in a few seconds you have a nicely peeled garlic clove. The skin stays inside the sleeve, which you rinse under the faucet. Whacking garlic with a knife is all very well if you have servants to remove errant garlic skins that have gotten stuck on the floor. If you don't, then this sleeve is better - and in the long run it costs you practically nothing per clove."},{"rating":"1","title":"I never needed this!","review":"I agree with the below! Why it is on the \\"necessary kitchen gadgets lists\\" I do not know! It just sits collecting dust in my drawer, especially with its sticky material.

Rolling the little tube is very easy (just press down a bit as you're doing it) and is the right size for little hands.I use mine mostly when I'm making roasted garlic - shucking 5 garlic heads can take a lot of time, so I thought I'd give this a try. While it's fun to use, it takes a while to actually get the garlic skins off. Instead, I've been using it to 'crack' the skin off and then peel it off by hand which does save me some time. Roll once or twice then shuck. Otherwise, you do have to clean it out every two or three cloves, and if you use water then it takes forever to get going again - this is the reason why I'm only giving this four stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you love Garlic it's worth it...","review":"This may seem like a frivilous purchase but if you use a lot of fresh Garlic it's worth it.

Just cut the root end of a clove, put it in the roller, hold it between your palms and roll it a few times. Hey presto, out drops a peeled clove.

At least with games like AOK, there is strategy involved with balacing military units. One redeeming quality could have been the online play, but hardly anyone likes this game enough to play it online.It's just the same old RTS game with much less depth than a game like warcraft or age of empires.

Everytime, I surprisingly am alarmed with ink on hands and anything I have touched. And it's hard to wash off. I now suspect that the pens leak after being taken on a plane. Perhaps the change in pressure, even in the cabin, causes this. This is a weakness in the design that should be addressed. Others have commented on leaking also.

I realized that this book must be the British version. Having big Mama say \\"Good, that's very very good\\" as she comments on her handiwork was just NOT the same lazy drawl as \\"That's good, that's real good.\\" I realized there must be an American version, and found it -- \\"Big Momma makes the world.\\" Now I can have a copy I let the kids mess up to look at the pictures, and a copy I keep to read to them. Still, it was weird to discover there were two version of the same book, and no mention of it anywhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh my goddess! This book rocks!","review":"This book is WONDERFUL!

But Big Momma does it beautifully and so do Mothers everywhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"absolutely charming","review":"This book has gorgeous illustrations and a story that offers a unique, refreshing take on a traditional myth. There's nothing overbearing or preachy about it--it's basically true to the Biblical myth and also quite progressive in its portrayal of the creator, yet neither aspect is off-putting in any way.

In the process, Hope meets a new guy,Chris who isn't very interesting in my opinion, and \\"Darryl\\" still can't stop killing. It ended really sad, but I wish R.L. Stine had of written it that Hope went to a mental hospital or something like that. I mean he got the readers to love Hope in the first book and in this one make everything seem like her fault, although it really wasn't since she didn't know what she was doing. The issue of Muliple Personality Disorder, was obviously not researched very well by the author. If you want a more mature and more researched book about MPD I highly recommend \\"Tell Me Your Dreams\\" by Sidney Sheldon, it's kinda like this one but it's for more mature readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This shoe, althought very cute, is very painful.

It is an excellent work, but not for the beginner. A good foundation in Jung and Campbell will go a long way to helping to digest the concepts. Also, Joseph Campbell's contributions are pretty limited. If you are looking for pure Joe Campbell, this is going to disappoint.The detailed analysis of the symbols of the Waite Tarot opened new vistas that I had not seen before. While Roberts himself admits that the analysis is somewhat subjective and specualtive, he ties the material back to Jung and others with an adroit style, and there is little in the way of pure speculation.A good read for the advanced student of Jung and Campbell - not so good for the novice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maria Checa Saves These Video","review":"Overall these video is a total zero, but I would still buy it even after I had seen it.

The voice is a dark growl, but not an agressive one like say Cannibal Corpse, but its more of a sad, heartfelt wail. The guitars are slow, and everytime the sound comes out of the speakers, it gets dark, cold and gloomy. If you like anything from the Cure, to Candlemass, you will enjoy this album, but good luck trying to get this one or \\"Rain without End\\" its almost impossible.

What a waste of $1.00 plus shipping. The cover is the best feature of the book. The plot never really goes anywhere (okay, it is insipid), the Satanists aren't very scary, Uncle Ambrose's ghost is comical, and the incest angle must have been thrown in for shock value.

It should not be taken as a book about historical pre-Christian rune use, but seeks to adapt more recently invented techniques and ideas into a religious setting based on Germanic mythology.Seen in this light, the book is a useful reference of current popular rune usage. It will not appeal to the more re-creationist or academic rune students, but offers an abundance of examples of New-Age and ecclectic adaptations of the runes. Although it does go beyond the New-Age manuals by seeking to present these ideas in a \\"Northern Tradition\\" context, I would have liked to see more distinction made between modern and historical information.Although this book is firmly in the \\"speculative\\" category, it does present some historical background, and is a cut above the New-Age fluff that dominates the majority of esoteric rune manuals.SweynThe Rune Primer"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless","review":"The runes were an alphabet.

This book provided a very interesting look into the formation of the Hare Psychopathy Checklist, and information of the neurological aspects of the disease. However, Dr. Hare seemed to dramatize the disorder a little too much to make it a serious piece of literature. I found it helpful to look into journal articles on the subject for a more objective look. To be fair, the book did provide accurate information, but as I mentioned, it was just a little too dramatic for my taste."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read!","review":"Dr. Robert Hare opens to the layman the world of the psychopath without burying him in technical overload.

Approximately 75% of all psychopaths have a history of substance abuse (alcohol in particular) and failure to mention this fact would be nothing less than a glaring omission. A list of traits is presented, but I felt that substance abuse, a behavioural trait with a strong correlation, should have been elaborated on. The author does stress that a cluster of traits must be present (not just one or two) and wisely cautions that diagnosis should be done by a trained professional."},{"rating":"2","title":"Psychopaths in society","review":"Aside from personal harms that can result from psychopaths, this book gives a timely, and chilling, warning that all is not well in our highly politicized capitalistic society whose leaders may include a sprinkling of the (not yet criminalized) psychopaths. Regrettably, the author was skimpy on the formal guideline for isolating such largely incurable sociopathic persons. The fact that corporations have most of the attributes of psychopaths seems to dovetail alarmingly well with the recent Supreme Court decision granting personhood to corporations only deepens our predicament."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dr. Hare's Book: A Must Read","review":"A fascinating look at psychopathic behavior and its consequences, felt by its victims and society, but rarely felt by the psychopath.

I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely informative book on psychopaths.","review":"If you're debating which book to get in order to help you understand what defines a psychopath and why they act the way they do, definitely get this book.

He clearly presents what psychopathy is, how it is expressed and most importantly, how to identify it. It is an excellent learning book, dealing with a subject that I feel all empathetic people should know. It may at least save you a good deal of money and heartache and maybe even your life.Personally I suspect that the underlying trait that constitutes the fundamental component of psychopathy is present in 40 to 60% of the population, and in some populations even higher! Which is why you sometimes hear the expression, when describing some cruel treatment (such as the murder of the Jews by the Nazis): \\"It is human nature to be cruel\\", implying that being cruel is a choice that all people are capable of. Whereas I suspect that it is a basic genetic trait in many people but not all.This book enlightens and helps you understand the people around you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good beginner's guide","review":"This book is clearly written for laymen to understand. The concepts of psychopathy are superficially covered with little use of statistical data or academic reference. It does however paint a realistic and comprehensible picture of the psychopath at work. The only other flaw was Hare's incessant reference to his own work with the Checklist. It seems more like an advertisement than a necessity in the flow of the prose."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scary but a must read","review":"I read this book after reading the book \\"Columbine\\".

For starters, it is very well-written. Dr. Hare tells interesting stories about psychopaths rendering it easy to identify those psychopathic traits and behaviors that we encounter in people in our everyday lives. He also discusses how easily one can be conned by these personalities (professionals included), thereby mitigating any shame one may experience as the aftermath of having been exploited by one of these characters. Also, the author doesn't simply educate his readers regarding what behaviors to be look out for, but also includes a chapter on how to protect oneself from psychopaths. Finally, this book isn't simply anecdotal, Dr. Hare has based his findings on research but has been blessed with the gift of translating academic constructs into a highly readable and palatable book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing to learn here","review":"The author's experience in the prison system has given him a captive group to research. However the sampling is only of criminals, and so really tells us very little about functional cases. It makes you wonder how it is even possible that psychopaths can operate in society without disregard for the law. I am quite sure that there are more wild-type than there are those incarcerated that could adapt and pretend to have empathy for others. The author seems to promote this check list he came up with from his research, it is mentioned repeatedly. Hare does not actually share this magic check list. In the end Hare provides no hope for treatment and sits on the fence as to the causes for the condition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Superficial Literature","review":"\\"Without Conscience\\" by Robert D. Hare is disappointing.Despite the fact the rear cover makes reference to theauthor's life time achievement award in 2005 none of thesources cited for the book are more recent than 1994.While psychopaths are elusive, in 2009 one must suspectthat additional insights have been gained on the topic,especially if the author is as authoritative as publishersuggests.Additionally, all the conclusions and insightspresented are based on case studies and movies.This made the conclusions Hare drew feel decidedlyunscientificFor the above reasons, it is difficult for me to recommend\\"Without Conscience\\" as much more than a superficialpresentation by a well regarded scholar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor treatment of a fascinating topic","review":"Very interesting raw material, but poorly handled.

The ink flows out of these pens is a uniform way. The friction on the paper is low. All-in-all they write well. But they have one weakness. Whatever force you apply to the tip gets transferred to the end cap by way of the ink reservoir. The end cap screws onto the barrel with very fine threads. I think my first pin lasted about 5 minutes before the cap came off. With cap off, there is nothing to hold the tip against the paper. You cannot write with the cap missing. So, I glued the cap back on and glued the caps of the other pins in the box to their barrels. Now the pin writes with the force that I use.

There was adventure and romance, I'll admit. Peyton kept me reading, as I wanted to know the outcome of the novel.However, that was the only thing that kept me going. The characters were rather flat and convienient. Ben, for example, showed up when a big brother character was needed, but disappeared when he wasn't.Another difficulty I have with the book is Part One is told from Charlotte's (the main character) point of view, and Part Two is from a character outside of the group.

Charlotte flees from marriage to the boring man her family favors and goes mountain climbing with her brother and his free thinking friends. What happens next will be familiar to any reader of Peyton's novels - Charlotte falls in love with three very different men - and then has to work out which of them she really wants. This is an intriguing novel full of tidbits about Victorian society and the art of mountain climbing. Strongly reccomended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine reading for any young adult.","review":"Teen Charlotte knows little about the world outside her vicarage childhood, and her grandfather has arranged to have her marry a man who repels her - but she's rebelling, and searching for her freedom. Set in Victorian England, SNOWFALL reveals a girl's struggle for independence and her own life, and is fine reading for any young adult."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heartbreakingly satisfying","review":"KM Peyton has been one of my favorite writers since I first discovered A Pattern of Roses and then the Pennington books back in the '80s. She is incredibly adept at creating characters we want to be close to, and then placing them in a world so complete and so realistic that reading her work is like traveling. SNOWFALL, terribly ripped by the professional critics, is more of Peyton's magic at work. Charlotte and Milo, Mar and Kitty, all of them are very like people we know, or would very much like to know, and the details of their lives can be followed like those of dear friends. And Peyton is not shy about breaking a reader's heart. Don't pay attention to the critics who apparently were reading another book with the same title. Read it and weep."},{"rating":"2","title":"very well written","review":"After reading the first page of this book I predicted that the rest would be dull and boring, but after I finished the first chapter I was totally hooked. I loved the characters, especially Milo. I wanted Charolette to be with him so badly, when I finished the ending I was so heartbroken, I wanted to cry but the tears would not come. I was very depressed the next couple days, but I still don't regret reading Snowfall. It was wonderfuly written, a must read for those interested in the victorian era, and YA romances."},{"rating":"1","title":"BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!","review":"I couldn't wait to get this after reading the description. My son is just starting to talk and I thought the ba-ba-ball and other words they had in the description would be perfect to advance his communication skills. The dvd is nothing like the description. It spends way too much time on foreign languages and not enough time on baby's first sounds! Like the other reviewer said, your child won't learn anything from this...except sheer boredom! My son has no desire to watch it and he loves almost all the other Baby Einstein dvds. It really makes me wonder if they had a children's focus group watch this! Big disappointment to us, especially coming from Baby Einstein/Disney!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Enough English","review":"This DVD will not teach your child much. It has about 5-10 mins of each lang. listed on the dvd case. My daugther will watch the english part then she pays the rest no attention."},{"rating":"1","title":"big disappointment","review":"We did not like the fact that they introduced several different languages, and it did not keep our baby's attention as other baby einstein DVDs. Although there may be studies that show babies can learn different languages if introduced early, that was not our intention when buying the DVD. It seems to me this just could cause confusion."},{"rating":"1","title":"uggg! hate baby einstein","review":"I have given baby einstein several tries and these dvds are just not good. This is last one I am purhcasing. Like for this one again why is everything almost in every other language yet only a few things in english. I would like it if my 7 month old was exposed more to english first since he cant talk yet versus 10 other languages."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!","review":"Wherever I go I recommend Baby Einstein products, particularly basing myself on the Baby Mozart and Baby Beethoven DVDs. Seeing that these two had a fantastic effect on my daughter, I thought that Baby's First Sounds may be a good idea.How wrong!

He sometimes likes a DVD to entertain him and us.The video spends way too much time on foreign languages, and not enough English.

I heard a lot about Baby Einstein so I decided to give this a try.... ugh! It looks like this was made in someone's basement with a home video camera and a power point presentation. It talks in all different languages and in my mind, is just a little creepy to boot.Classic Sesame Street comes to mind when I remember what 'good' children's programming is like. I learned SO MUCH from that show and they did it in a way where parents wouldn't be insanely bored watching it with their kids. They used all different art forms and the puppeteering was the best there was to date. Very thought out show.THIS however, looks like it took 2 hours to put together. Total waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken","review":"I bought this video for my niece who lives in Hawaii, we live in Michigan.

Even though she's too old for an intro to talking, the shows are usually just fun to watch. Confidence in their product line made me buy this right off the shelf without reading any reviews. I've seen other Baby Einsteins (Meet the Orchestra & Baby Santa) poorly reviewed and held off only to find that they weren't bad after all. I personally think the only truly mediocre ones until now were Baby DaVinci and Baby Newton (which even Disney apologized for with Discovering Shapes). The true fans will spot too much reused old footage. The foreign language is confusing. Puppet bits go too long and it ruins the pacing which is what usually makes the videos so rewatchable. I apologized to my daughter and promised not to put it on again."},{"rating":"1","title":"HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT,DON'T BUY","review":"I was looking forward to this dvd for my son and daughter.

If you are going to do foreign languages, make sure to have a seperate track option. Keep english to english track, spanish to spanish, chinese to chinese track. Do not put them all together!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too confusing for little ones!!","review":"First off, you have to learn to walk before you can run. Same applies for kids in America; you have to learn ENGLISH before you learn Spanish, French, Italian, etc. This video devotes too much time to foreign languages.Also, they show different examples of fathers with their children but the word they teach the baby isn't the word you'd think:\\"Daddy\\" or \\"Father\\". Instead they say \\"Papa\\" in an Italian accent which sounds way too close to \\"Ba-ba\\" which is what many babies know as their bottles! I mean who really calls their fathers papa anyway?Save your money and pass this one up unless you want your toddler ambling around the house singing \\"Twinkle Twinkle Little Star\\" in French."},{"rating":"2","title":"Baby Loves This Video!","review":"I'm surprised at some of the negative reviews! Our baby enjoys this video very much. Hes just turning 7 months and he will sit up in bed and watch intently, smiling when the Bee comes on and other familiar scenes. He loves the \\"Bah- Bah -Bahhhh\\" sheep and when I sing \\"Do Rae Me\\" along with the flowers. I learned how to say hello and goodbye in several languages myself! It has lots of colors, shapes and sounds I think its a good beginning video but I guess people who hated the video expected their baby to become an overnight genius or something. From our experience,its colorful and engaging and perfect for a new baby."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I gave it 1 star for the images and NOT the first sounds sound... images are good but the DVD is NOT what you believe it to be. I took it out of the dvd several times thinking maybe I bought the wrong language...then i thought ..maybe i will change it to english settings...no luck so I sat it through and then they started speaking some english.I thought this dvd was teaching first sounds in english BUT this is not the case. I believe first sounds sound be the foundation to language and should be in 1 language, his native language.I love the baby einstein collection and so does my 8 month old BUT we differ on this dvd... he likes it cause he loves the characters and I like the characters too but I don't like the different language aspect.If you don't mind the 4 languages then it'll be a great buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Value","review":"I don't see the educational value in this product.

That would be much better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"We have a large collection of Baby Einstein DVD's and like most of them. This one, however, was a HUGE disappointment.- It barely focus on making sounds- It has too many languages -- confusing for adults, and most likely confusing for children as well- The lady speaking the Spanish words seems to have a lisp or something weird -- it's not even clear!- My kids that normally LOVE Baby Einstein DVD's were bored with this and paid no attention to itIt is NOT at all what it claims to be in its description. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have read the Amazon feedback","review":"I really wish I had read the negative feedback on Amazon before purchasing this.

This is the worst DVD I have purchased for her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Least Favorite Baby Einstein Video","review":"I have had excellent experiences with Baby Einstein DVDs but this one is disappointing. I usually cannot pull my daughter away from them however she refuses to watch this one.

It's apple and oranges. Sills is at her best as Cleopatra. But her voice is small and unimpressive. Sutherland is a titanic comparing to Sills' fishing boat in the voice department. Sutherland's Alcina is miraculous. Franco Zefferelli said Sutherland was the \\"phenomenal singer of out time...she was sensational\\". Sorry, Sills is great as Cleopatra, but Sutherland is superhuman as Alcina. Her voice is spectacular.Sutherland was called \\"La Stupenda\\" when she sang Alcina in Venice in 1960. They NEVER call a foreigner a great title like that. Only Callas. And with Callas, it didn't really become a complete part of her like Sutherland is with La Stupenda.Sutherland and Sills are both great coloratura. I prefer Sutherland because her voice is amazing, and Sill's voice is shrill. But the coloratura is equal.As for Callas, she is far inferior to both of these divas, and should be taken off the record store shelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ravishing tones and singing","review":"The magnitude of singing in this Alcina is second to none. The Joan Sutherland here is a young one. And we all know her what a phenomenal singer she was before Esclamonde(1974) destroyed her voice. Here, in 1960 something, it is the most glowing, sumptuous, just simply gorgeous soprano to ever come out of a person's mouth. It is as silvery and clear as it can be. And the squillo is in full force.Yep, it's all here, the amazing coloratura, the celebrated upper register to the full voice high E, and the awesome accuracy of pitch. No wonder they call her the \\"Voice of the Century\\".Freni is here, and she is lovely. I bet you've never heard her sound like that. She's no Sutherland. But she's definitely at least as good a lyric soprano as Price or Caballe.A greatly underrated recording. The music is glorious. In my opinion, it is as good as the other great Handel opera Julius Caesar. I hope I spelled it right. If you love Baroque, it doesn't get any better than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"beautiful","review":"A stellar cast heading by the supreme artist, Joan Sutherland. She had, indeed, the most beautiful soprano during her youth. With a supporting cast such as this, how can this Alcina lose? Of these great artists, next to Sutherland, Freni is the most lovely. All in all, fantastic singing of some of the most beautiful music that Handel ever wrote."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Written","review":"This is the first book I've read by Ms. Stone and I believe it will be my last. This book had many problems including the fact that there are about 6 stories going on in a 360 page book. With all those story lines you can't get to know any character well. Another problem was the amount of \\"thinking\\" that was put into the dialouge. The characters would say something and then in italic print there would be the thoughts of the charcter while they were talking. This is okay sometimes but this is carried on and on with all the characters through out the book. The main story of Gwen & Paige is a great idea, just poorly written and explored."},{"rating":"2","title":"You won't put this one down.","review":"On one horrible night, Claire Forrester loses her beloved husband and gives birth.

I'll certainly avoid all books by this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly constructed plot & characters","review":"This is the first of Katharine Stone's books that I have read & I certainly thought it would be my last. After finishing the book, I was amazed that this woman was a regular on the best-seller list. Thus, I was somewhat relieved to find that some of her longtime fans had a similar reaction to this book.Among other things, the book is poorly constructed, is too contrived, and has a very poorly developed plot. Also, I was a bit thrown with the detailed medical information that was interspersed with less than detailed dialogue. As other readers have said, it was very hard to feel as though you knew the characters. They all felt a bit like cardboard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I agree with all of the other reviews.

Years of being kept in my purse means it's outside has worn down quite a bit - the paint is rubbing off - but i think it's a badge of honor for a pen. Refills are easy to get. You can find them in any office supply store. It's one of those pens that demands better handwriting. People are more hesitant to steal it since it's a lot larger than most pens.

A rumination on AIDS, produced when he was rendered blind by the disease, the film consists of a soundtrack of Jarman's narration surrounded by a collage of music and sound effects; the screen itself is just the color blue, never changing during the running time of the film. Seen in a darkened theater, the blue screen almost staring at you, \\"Blue\\" is a very moving experience - you're really put in Jarman's shoes as he takes a journey through a terminal illness that has robbed the filmmaker of his sight. On home video, the impact of what some have criticised as a \\"gimmick\\" might be minimized, but \\"Blue\\" is a remarkable achievement worthy of checking out.

The aluminum moka pot is just a memory. :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Saving 5-8$ everyday!","review":"Very pleased with our Moka pot. Glad we sprung for the stainless steel. Perfect for ice lattes. Mine with soy, hubbys with normal milk. I begged my hubby for it for a long time telling him how useful it would be... Now he uses it more than me. The lid is a little cheap and was bent in shipping. Not a big deal however due to the fact it has nothing to do with making a good espresso! Great purchase and pleased with the product."},{"rating":"2","title":"great coffee maker","review":"Great coffee maker.I also have an Espresso machine, but I changed it because there are too many plastic parts in the machine (plastic and hot water - I don't want the chemicals leaching into my coffee) I like to use the Bialetti everyday. It gives you great coffee. I use strong espresso coffee beans for a great flavor. And it made from stainless steel much better than the aluminum once."},{"rating":"1","title":"venus stove top espesso","review":"Dont waste your time.

Bad espresso pot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap, period.","review":"If you're looking for a stainless steel moka pot, this is not the one. I had to return this product because it wouldn't produce a satisfiable amount of coffee. The seal between the top half and the bottom weren't aligned correctly which allowed steam pressure to leak out the sides.I've recently bought the Bialetti Musa (another stainless steel pot), and it works wonderfully."},{"rating":"2","title":"PLEASANTLY SURPRISED!","review":"This is a fine product -- easy to use, easy to clean, attractive, and works just as described. I would surely buy this again if I had the need for it. Just dandy. I rubbed a little oil into the round, rubber washer on the bottom of the top unit before using it, in order to keep the coffee dispenser from sticking to it. The oil also helps keep the washer supple so it won't crack and dry out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will barely make two 2oz cups!","review":"Ordered this with high hopes and opened it the minute we got it. Filled it with coffee, and lo and behold, will only make about 4 oz total of coffee. Tried a coarser grind and same result. Guess we'll have to stick with the Aeropress which is more reliable. Returning it right back to Amazon. Very disappointed.Updated on 1/29/2011: After this experience, I purchased the more highly rated 6 cup Aluminum version, and it works great. The 6 cup version uses about 30 grams of coffee to make (about) 12 oz, whereas the 4 cup version uses about 14 grams to make 8 oz. The higher coffee concentration seems to make a huge difference; I get flavor similar to the Aeropress (which uses about 45 g to make 8oz) while using less coffee; the Aeropress is still more convenient for making a sinlge 2 oz cup."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks nice but handle is fragile","review":"I bought this stovetop espresso maker because it has a nice look to it. It works well and makes good coffee but the handle is spot welded to the canister. You need to be really careful not to torque any part of the handle when screwing and unscrewing the canister from the base. I got about 2 months of use out of this before the handle broke off.This will probably sound like a complaint but it's just intended to provide information: The 4-cup stovetop espresso maker doesn't make as much espresso as I had hoped, meaning I needed to make 2 batches so there was enough for 2 people. After the handle broke off, I replaced it with aBialetti 6800 Moka Express 6-Cup Stovetop Espresso Maker. This unit is sturdier and makes about 4 shots of espresso - win/win!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than many","review":"I have been using moka pots for 10 years. This one has been one of the better I've used. Any that have broken have done so by human error. In this instance, the top fell from the counter and hit in just the right way to pop off the lid. There are no screws connecting them, so I can't fix it without welding it back on. Without the lid, it still can be used however, so I'll take my time finding a new one."},{"rating":"1","title":"made great coffe for a year and 3 months","review":"i've read other reviews that had trouble with this little coffee maker in terms of the handle falling off, the seal being bad or the lid faulty; mine was great from june 2010 until september 2011, everyday, one cup. in september, it began to leak from a difficult to diagnose area. the bottom had rotted out. i could put water in it and it would be fine, but under pressure everything would start hissing and spitting and i'd get less coffee than i should have.it has come to my attention that this item was made in india, not italy. it might work just fine for awhile, but i think ultimatley its just poorly made.AJpeace"},{"rating":"1","title":"This particular model BURNS EVERY CUP","review":"Pros:- 4 shots is plenty for one and still enough for two.- Stainless steel suggests less chance of health risks.Cons:- BURNS EVERYTHING!!I love this style of espresso maker, but this particular model sucks!After more than a dozen attempts - it has yet to produce a single palatable shot. I've tried everything -- fine grind, coarse grind, commercial grinds; tight pack, loose pack; high water, low water -- everything!!My record of perfect espresso generation had been impeccable - until this cursed thing arrived."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible product","review":"I bought this for my husband since he likes expresso coffee a lot. It sucks it drips all the time, and most of the coffee ends us in the bottom, and it does not taste that good. The only thing it has going for is that is small and sleek. Do not buy it if you want a good thing, buy the older version"},{"rating":"1","title":"poor manufacturing","review":"I purchased the six-cup Stainless Steel Bialetti Class stovetop moka maker. The top is slightly out-of-round and will not seal effectively when mated to the bottom so steam escapes at the interface point preventing the unit from generating enough pressure to pump the coffee through the interior normally. Using heavier gauge steel or better manufacturing tolerances would've prevented this. This may not be a problem with every unit; but, buyers should mate the unit in the store prior to purchase to ensure that the top and bottom mate and seal successfully."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I could give it 0 stars I would...","review":"This book is horrible.

Supposedly the information in this 2003 edition is up-to-date, but I was finding information that is 3 to 4 years out of date. Hotel price ranges in particular are outdated.In addition to the outdated information, a big failure of this guide book is the lack of photos. There are no photos inside to make a person interested in visiting the country. Photos showing the bustling markets, beautiful beaches, historical temples make a person want to see those places in person much more than the dry text descriptions.One positive thing about the guide is information on excursions to Angkor Wat in Cambodia.

All the work testing and familiarising with a certain developer could well be wasted when chemical compositions change due to economic forces. This book offers at least some insurance against this.

Although this book was written about the 1988 Presidential campaign, the descriptions of the various candidates actions and deceptions can be applied to every election since.

He also wrote the SI piece for Ripken's breaking of Gehrig's record"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"This book was highly acclaimed by TV commentators last week after the author died. They said if you love politics you must read this book. I am not finished reading it and I'm not sure I will or if I do I'll skim. It follows the candidates for the presidential election in 1988 and it goes into GREAT detail about Bush the 1st and Dole - their backgrounds from children, etc. Now I've come to Gary Hart, who I had pretty much forgotten and don't really want to review. So I guess I'd have to say this book is too dated and overly detailed to hold my interest"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, But Needed an Editor","review":"If you ever doubted the importance of editing, this book will convince you of its importance. Overall, this is a terrific book -- full of compelling details about flawed men (I especially enjoyed the chapters on Joe Biden and Michael Dukakis).However, after a while it becomes tiresome and the one-word, two-word sentences begin to grate. If one can get beyond this aspect of the work, which isn't hard to do given its inherentely interesting subject, then a reader will find an amazing political story."},{"rating":"2","title":"A true classic on presidential elections","review":"Ben Cramer follows the major candidates in their races to become president in 1988. He reproduces their speaking and thinking styles in such an incredible way that you will never be able to think of any of these people (Bob Dole, GHW Bush, Jesse Jackson) in quite the same way you did before.His intense focus on how the candidates act differently when in private than they do when they're out giving their stump speech makes for fascinating reading.

What It Takes exceeded that standard, and set a new one.In this reporting of the 1988 Presidential election, Richard Ben Cramer presents THE authoritative review and analysis of the candidates, the nominee, and the eventual president.This book is not for the faint of heart. At over 1000 pages, this book makes \\"Truman\\" seem like a Cliff's Notes review of a presidency.What the length does provide is ubelievable insight into what made the candidates tick, and why they were successful, or unsuccessful, in conveying their story and message to the American people.For those who want to know, this is the one book to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Required reading for anyone who votes","review":"This epic tale of the pursuit of the 1988 Presidential Nominations is the best book ever written about the unique breed of men who seek our highest office.Cramer focuses on George Bush and Bob Dole on the Republican side and Gary Hart, Joe Biden, Dick Gephardt and Michael Dukakis on the Democratic side. Instead of giving us a campaign diary or obsessing over the minutiae of the candidates strategies, he provides virtual biographies of each man & an intimate portrait of why each of them wants to be, and is in position to be, President of the United States.As one of the other reviewers said, if every American voter had read this book, Bob Dole would be President now, following the second Bush term.More's the pity..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insightful book","review":"Initially, I had a hard time getting past Cramer's run-on sentences.

Frequent flashbacks are a bit disconcerting in what amounts essentially to a joint biography of six significant late 20th century political figures and the business of politics. Cramer's literary device of writing through the imagined thoughts of the principals is compelling. I know Mike Dukakis and Cramer has him absolutely cold. The Bush and Dole portrayals also comport with what I have learned about them elsewhere. Ii't fair to assume then that Cramer also \\"gets\\" Hart and Gephardt and, still significantly, Joe Biden.

In the story Galloping Into Forty, author Kimberley Freeman describes riding on a beach at a full out, hell-bent-for-leather gallop. More than any other passage in the book, this one allowed me to understand the lure of horses--and want to go racing across the sand on a horse. Charlotte Mendel's Mucho Muchacho stands out as well, and if you want to understand why women are loco para caballos, I couldn't recommend this book more.Having little up close and personal experience with horses, I'd never really understood the power--or more accurately, sheer horsepower--they possess. But after reading this collection from dozens of authors and viewpoints, I've finally gotten a glimpse into the majesty and mystique of horses that attracts girls and women of all ages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Limp","review":"No real action here.

And how many times do we want to witness the lovemaking of the middle-aged anchorman and his train-of-thought adoration of his love?

The Vienna Philharmonic sounds great.Generally, Lorin Maazel is measured in his conducting, technically skilled in achieving his intent. George Solti strikes me as similar, in being measured and adroit, but Solti often shows more spark, sometimes too much so.I enjoyed Maazel's presentation of this Mahler 5 quite a lot. Much nuance, allowing the counterpunctal secondary themes to shine through alongside the primary. It is a good benchmark recording, and a recommended purchase.For comparative reference, my other M5 favorites include the sprightly-everything-revealed Boulez, cool-hand Gatti, the ever-colorful Bernstein on DG (quite the contrast to Gatti), and single-take Barshai (amazing live performance, but with too-frequent audience noise distraction). After that, Zinman, Abbado (Berlin or Chicago), Mehta, Solti (1991; 1971 sounds thin), Karajan, Sinopoli, Barenboim."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing recording!","review":"This is the second recording of Mahler 5 that I have heard; the first was a recording by Herbert von Karajan and the Berlin Philharmonic.

The book contains two stories: The first one takes place in Medieval Europe and tells the story of a crusade that begins after several ominous events spread through the villages.With his unique language Oz leads the reader through the crusade that soon becomes a horrifying descent into the darkest pits of human cruelty, primal fears and blind violence and torture unto the eventual tragic ending of the novella. The second story describes the small, uneventful life of a lonely old man and his fantasies - about the nurse in the outpatient clinic, about an Israeli military force to be sent back in time to take revenge from the Nazis etc. Reading this early book exposes the reader to Oz's virtuoso ability with words that can either pound like a sledgehammer or flutter on one's face like the wind from a butterfly's flight"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Torn Veil","review":"This book is one of the most inspiring books i have read in a long while.

It will change your attitude and prospective of God."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why don't we hear music this good on the radio?","review":"Quirky-passionate-intelligent, and very easy on the ears. Her voice carries you away in a manner I can only compare to Karen Carpenter or Joan Baez. Can't wait to see what is next. I would really like to see this woman perform live. I'll bet her passion comes through even more in person. Five stars!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lovely Ladies, Bad Scenes","review":"This is an older Playboy video, and while many of the women were beautiful, the whole thing screamed cheese. I agree with the other reviewer - it was often far too silly or corny to bring any heat. This one was a miss."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very sensual.","review":"Wife and I watched this video together. The actor/actress are very attractive, but very 80's in the way of body style. The love scenes were very short. Many scenes made us laugh, though it was supposed to be serious and not a comedy. Do not waste money on this video in hopes of making spark."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent Rollerball Pens","review":"These would get a five-star rating except that they are thin and hard to hold. The ink flows well, the color and thickness of the line is truly a good fine point. It is hard to see from a photo but they are really narrocw pens with no curve to help hold them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Pens!!!","review":"I love these pens!!! I'd given up finding anything like them and, in desperation, looked at the brand name on the pens and went to Amazon and got some. The silky smooth flow of the roller ball as it glides ink onto the page has to be experienced!!! Buy a packet of them for that reason alone. Never tried anything but black and probably never will.Don't let others confuse you. . .if you like a nearly magical pen. . .this is the one for you!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong item - picture deceptive!!!","review":"I received all black pens, not the different colors that were in the picture. I called the seller. They did not refund my money, but ordered something else for me. Said that product is no longer available. I never heard back from them nor did I receive the different colored pens. This is a bust!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Roots Music from Fort Worth, TX!","review":"Do you remember the band called \\"Hungry Chuck\\"? If you are fond of their music, which is titled as \\"Hungry Chuck\\" released by Bearsville, you are sure to love this album. Jim Colegrove is a leading member of this band, LOST COUNTRY, as well as a former member of Hungry Chuck, and shows his excellent ability in this album. R&B, Blues and Country are included here with joyous sound. It's worth while trying!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Traci Adell, and Kelly Gallagher","review":"If you like Traci Adell, and Kelly Gallagher then but this video. They are the 2 best playmates of the 90's (in my opinion)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed with writing quality","review":"I was disappointed with the writing quality, especially after reading all the positive reviews. The ink does not flow uniformly. The ink skips & leaves light spots.I will stick with the Zebra F-301 pens (black, fine). Their ink flows uniformly & their ballpoint glides much smoother on paper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Cheap Pen","review":"Like all of us, I have used many pens, but for a cheap pen, these are my favorite. I own a couple expensive pens, heavy pens for clients to use when signing something, but for everyday use, I love Pilot's Better Retractable.They write clearly, have a good light weight, don't feel as cheap as the rubber gripped or hollow thin plastic ones you find in a grocery store. They write cleanly and easily, and the different colors are sharp. My faovrite note-taking pen are the purple purple ones, although certainly these black ones see the most use in front of clients.I also tend to loose them, so I would love it if these were available on Amazon Prime. As it is, I've never purchased these pens on Amazon, only purchased them direct at a brick-and-mortar store. Please, purchase them here, and let us know if the seller lives up to the quality of the pen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Longtime favorite pen","review":"I type a lot. I write a lot. I'm one of those people who loved school supplies as a kid. This is my favorite pen. Nice writing, nice grip, click to retract the point. Seldom get blotty blots. I've had trouble finding these pens in the local office supply stores, but Amazon to the rescue! It's hard to complain about people who try my pens (and them walk away with them) because I understand the attraction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Ballpoint Pen Ever","review":"I've worked for two companies that submit official paper documents for projects awaiting FDA approval and in both places this exact pen is the writing tool of choice. This pen is extremely reliable and never dies early; writes a fine, smooth, and consistent line that's perfect for small spaces; the ink is waterproof; and is retractable so people won't lose the cap. Other gel ink-based roller ball pens like the Pilot G2 might provide thinner and darker line, but the Better Retractable Pen is the overall winner."},{"rating":"2","title":"The only pen I use...","review":"In my opinion the best pen for the money. I hope that Pilot doesn't decide to discontinue this line. I just wish that I could find them in stores instead of having to buy them online."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Stuff,! (Adults ONLY, Please!)","review":"Dirty Stories 2 is just what the the title implies: Dirty Stories. ...The stories are mostly humorous, and some of them are really hilarious; Among the funniest are Johnny Ryan's \\"A Day in the Life of Long-Dong Silver\\" and Ivan Brunetti's \\"10,000 Mile Long Schlong\\". Tasteless? Yeah. Funny? Yeah. There is also a pair of truly tasteless \\"Maakies\\" stories from Tony \\"Sock Monkey\\" Millionaire, and a couple of dead-on parodies of old-school Marvel Comics.

But their sizing guidelines are WAY off. It is very small in the bust and I cannot zip it closed because the bust area is too tight. If you buy this, definitely order one size bigger than what you think you need! I am always a size medium in almost every single top/dress I have worn in the past 5 years, and this dress, in the bust size, does not measure up to a standard \\"medium\\". The only medium it might fit is a 12-year old girl. Definitely not properly sized for adults."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally Bogus","review":"This is not an 8000+ word article on die design principles.

The second problem is that it deals too much with the mechanics of the language and fails to provide enough pronunciation, and Italian phases. I found the technical reading boring and difficult to conceptualize. The words are provided but not in any context where one can learn the language.The bottom line is that, unlike what the book promises, you will not be able to 'maximize your understanding of key Italian concepts and terms'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not great","review":"This is more of a supplement than a true Guide to learning Italian. A good dictionary is required to use this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy for downloan on a Kindle","review":"This looks like a good preliminary overview of Italian if the book was purchased in print. However, most of the translations are in a table format which is in an unreadable font on the Kindle. Even when the the Kindle's font is maximized, the tables cannot be read. Additionally, answer sheets are at the back of this book, and the electronic format makes it difficult to flip from the excercises to the answer sheet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great model for its price","review":"The model itself don\`t require glue or painting but is highly adviced.Construction was kinda complicated for a non grade 1/144 model that was a plus for me.cons:no clear part for sword and lack of extra accesories (again this is a non grade kit so is only natural)"},{"rating":"1","title":"not the best proincess superstara cd your can biuyt","review":"...the music is not really funny. its like one of those in jokes that i guess i had to be there. adn the hip hop big beat is very minimal and puches really good for the club speakers but thats not why i like price paul i like his funny catchy micky mouse beats. and pricess superstar is doing a sassy bahamadia imitation that she doesnt quite have the skills to pull off. it sounds really weird. you might do better buying another princess superstar reord lieke peasches or brassy. raise your glasses, make your passes"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality Playboy work, but....","review":"Playboy again sets the standard for outstanding screen work, photography, and model choreography. Except one or two pairs, they picked some really hot babes. The shower scene where the sisters do lots of soaping up and a little kissing...is quite hot...this was a good video, all in all, and worth the cash. But if you're into totally up-close, nothing-to-the-imagination girl-girl action, you won't find it here or in other Playboy vids."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tastes grrrreat!","review":"This shake has pretty much no flavor at all, which is a good thing since most health/diet shakes taste a lot like medicine, vitamins, or some funky version of bone-meal fertilizer. I like to mix this in the blender with Crystal Light and ice. It comes out thick and creamy. You can also include blueberries, apples, or bananas, depending on the flavors you prefer and the nutrients you want to consume. This shake is packed with vitamins, high in protein, and has virtually no carbohydrates. It's rather expensive, but worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite protein for smoothies","review":"I love the unsweetened protein- it doesn't have that distinctive artificial sweet flavor. I use it for my blueberry/spinach smoothies and add vanilla cream stevia- fabulous!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite","review":"I first tried this about 13 years ago, because of a health issue I needed supplemental easy to digest drink, and I used to mix it with rice milk. I finally found it again about 2 months ago. I have always liked the taste, both the chocolate and chocolate and peanut butter, and I now mix it with un-flavored soy milk. I also have a lot of digestive problems, including being lactose intolerant, and not being able to have other random ingredients, but this gives me no issues at all. As others have commented, it says it doesn't need a blender, but it does clump horribly and become practically undrinkable. I actually just bought a blender bottle, and it mixes it perfectly. I have one for lunch, it actually gives me more energy, and I have actually lost weight. Would definitely recommend!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Peanut butter spirutein","review":"Not all that great will not be buying this flavor again but will by the chocolate for sure once I am able to finish this can."},{"rating":"2","title":"SOY PROTEIN SHAKE","review":"I HAVE BEEN USING THIS FOR YEARS AND DECIDED TO TRY THE SUGAR FREE VARIETY THIS TIME. I MUCH PREFER THE REGULAR SWEETENED VERSION. I HAD TO ADD AGAVE SYRUP TO THE UNSWEETENED VERSION TO MAKE IT PALATABLE.

This video shows very little of it. Most of what is done, is glossed over, verbally. The back of the video reads that the process is shown from the removal of the body to the open-casket viewing. Not so. I was hoping to see the entire procedure from start to finish. I was disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK But I Know Of Better","review":"This is a must have video for any embalming collection,but it is not, by any means, the only video for your collection.

I knew this could not be the \\"whole story\\" and I was correct. While presented with style and \\"taste\\" and interesting fact about the history of the subject, it nevertheless glossed over the details of the procedure and left almost everything else to the imagination of the viewer. Anyone truly interested in the process would want to see it from \\"pickup of the deceased\\" to \\"disposal of the remains\\". This video left a big gap, infact \\"they\\" may as well have saved the time and money invested producing this \\"documentary??\\" Do it RIGHT, that is film it as it happens in real life and forget the sugar coating!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple and Perfect","review":"I tried the Bialetti Mukka Express before returning it for this, because I liked the idea of heating and foaming the milk in the same unit/step as making the espresso, but I really wasn't impressed with how that worked out in practice, so I returned it for this less expensive and lower-tech set-up. I'm SO glad I did, because this is simple, hassle-free, and produces a perfect cappuccino or latte every time. As someone who had never used a stove-top espresso maker before, I found this easy to use right out of the box. The milk-frother makes better foam than I ever anticipated (even with soy milk!), and the clean-up for both parts is a snap. I would recommend this set to anyone. Five big stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"So glad I found this alternative to an electric machine!","review":"I agree the other positive reviews on this product. It makes a delicious cup of coffee or espresso and the milk frother alone was worth the price of this set."},{"rating":"2","title":"simple extraction espresso","review":"This Bialetti espresso maker captures the basics in sturdy design & practical function. I am learning to listen for its espresso-steaming music that indicates the next cream topped elixir is ready to be served. I am fine tuning my ability to use this product. Am quite happy with the results. Believe it when it says to avoid using too finely ground coffee and packing it in. Leave some porosity for the steam to waft up through."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable cup of coffee.","review":"Simplicity is best. This little espresso maker simplifies coffee making and creates a rich cup of espresso. I am not a coffee connoisseur, but do enjoy a latte and cappuccino on occasion.

Now Serving Cappuccino at Home!","review":"This is a great Espresso pot & Cappuccinio cream maker. My parents always had one and now we can enjoy Cappuccino at home any time we want. You can also use the Cappuccinio cream maker to whip cream for other dishes or desserts. It's great - easy to make great espresso & whipped cream & to clean-up afterward!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Product That Exceeds Expectations!","review":"The Bialetti Cappuccino and Latte Set far exceeds my expectations. Weary of paying $3.00 and more for my daily cappuccino fix I scanned the internet for a machine that I could use at home. This set does exactly as it claims--makes wonderful espresso. I used 1% milk and with the device was able to get wonderful froth/foam with a few flicks of my wrist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Organic","review":"The weak link in this system is the operator. It can make *great* espresso and stiff frothed milk (even skim) but \\"timing is everything.\\" At first I enjoyed the process -- kinda like the Japanese Tea Ceremony. But when you just want a latte to open your eyes while you're mutitasking, getting ready for work, a more automatic system is much better for me. I can't fault the system for my weaknesses, and it is *much* better than the $30 throw-away Mr. Coffee chinese made machines. Overall I like it and haven't thought about replacing it. When I finally melt the aluminum parts or burn the teflon off the frother, I'll probably buy a capsule espresso system.If you're retired I'd give this 5 stars; if you're working, 3 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes excellent cappuccinos!","review":"Thanks to all the great product reviews, I thought I would try this out as a replacement to our awful filter machine. My husband and I LOVE IT!!! It's super easy now to make \\"real\\" cappuccinos and both pieces are easy to clean. My toddler also loves her little babycinos (just the frothed milk with some chocolate sprinkles) so that alone made it worth every cent. I highly recommend this set and will probably buy at least one as a Christmas gift."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome","review":"This set is great. Cappuccino comes out awesome (especially if you buy LavAzza) and the frother is great. Latte's come out better than any coffee shop! Very happy with my purchase! I would reccomend this for anyone coffee lover."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect!","review":"This is exactly what I wanted. It doesn't take long to heat the milk and make the espresso.

Make sure to completely dry all the parts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best latte!","review":"Outstanding product!

The original sleeves were clear plastic throughout, and did put small scratches on many of my CD's (all of which are still playable, though). I'm in the process of switching to Bubblesleeves, in which the centre part of the sleeve is a softer material with raised bumps, between which tiny dust specks fall so that they aren't scraping against the CD surface.

I am envious of Frederico Borromeo's camera work for the sites have a freshness about them which is very difficult to capture on film. A little more on the influences of Central Asia and Iran would have been liked in the introduction but this is minor compared to the detail found in the remainder of the book. Some sites are not marked on the map and so more detailed maps would help in a second edition.

I have loved both including this one. On to the next one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, Very Light","review":"Michael Farquhar has created another bathroom book for the history-loving set. This one, Treasury of Deception, is just what it's title implies and is broken down into categories and ranges from prison escapes to scientific frauds, from practical jokes to deadly hoaxes, such as the blood libel. It is a truly odd mixed bag and should be read over a long period in many small bites, although that may prove harder to do than anticipated and one may find oneself gobbling the whole thing down at once. The book is light at the right moments and more serious when required and, amazingly enough, never veers into the truly silly, which is a blessing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Terrific Read!","review":"I read Michael Farquhar's two other books, \\"A Treasury of Royal Scandals\\" and \\"A Treasury of Great American Scandals\\" and I loved them both. His latest book is even better than the first two. It presents many facets of deception through history in a most entertaining way. Each chapter is a different story of lies and trickery, all separated into ten thematic parts. My favorite was the hoodwinking of Hitler. Just brillant! I highly recommend this book to anyone with even the slightest interest in history or the human capacity to deceive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absorbing","review":"What I liked most about the book was the author's no nonsense style. The problem with many history books is the historian often takes a long winded way to explain facts. Michael gets straight to the point and only narrates details that are neccessary . Each story is only a few minutes long, so if you did not like one, there is another one to look forward to."},{"rating":"1","title":"WOW !! ALL THAT TALENT ON ONE CD","review":"so it's a shame I could only give it 2 stars. While I am familiar with most of these artists, and generally like their respective styles,I am amazed that this example is so poor. Speed doesn't mean quality, and most of these cuts simply sound messy. It's ok to show off, but a jumble of notes at top speed just falls flat. This CD reminds me of the Doc Watson/Bill Monroe collaboration that is pure fast with little accuracy. I really like Bull Harman's version of Arkansas Traveller, however. I have better, more listenable versions of the other choices. Eric Thompson's Forked Deer, and Panhandle Rag are much much better. Dan Crary and JP Cormier are blazingly fast, and a lot more coherent. Steve Kaufman usually sounds a lot better than here, as does Sutton and Nygaard. Flynn Cohen is great too. Sometimes \\"tired old traditional\\" isn't so bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Playboy's best DVD releases","review":"I consider this to be one of the best Playboy DVDs, especially since it contains an good long segment with a couple of my favorite ladies, Jacqueline Lovell (AKA Sara St. James) and Kona Carmack.This video structure is a bit different from the regular Playboy DVD/video release, as it has 7 or 8 video segments, each being 7 or 8 minutes long, in comparison to most Playboy videos having 10 to 12 segments, each being 4 or 5 mintues long.It is a bit older of a video as it originally came out in 1996, but it remains among my favorites, even in comparison to many of the newest releases.If you've seen every Playboy video but this one, it's a worthy addition to your collection.

I really prefer to use this over the pastry cutter when I make biscuits. Here's thought: A lot of my old recipes say to cut the shortening into the flour with a fork (not a pastry cutter) and I've found that difficult with a regular fork - could this be the tool to which they are referring? So, I've used it when making biscuits and cornbread, checking if boiled potatoes are done, and browning ground beef. I like it so much that I plan on getting a couple more to give away as hostess gifts when i visit out-of-state friends next month."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great all-around tool","review":"Good for blending dry ingredients, mixing, stirring, blending AND lifting.

We would definitely recommend this compact paper cutter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Made Iron","review":"We bought this iron because it seemed like a decent choice for the price. However, after having it three years (and using it very rarely), it began to break down and we now have to throw it away. The non-stick coating on the iron plate is unpeeling, which turns into little black balls on your clothes as you iron (not nice on a dress shirt). Also, when I press the steam button, rusty water comes out of the steam holes, staining the clothes. They must have used parts on the inside that rust over time.

Recommended age was 36-months to 8-years old. My niece was turning 3, and I thought it would be perfect. As soon as I opened the outer box, I noticed on the product packaging that the recommended age was 8+...BIG difference. If this product is rated for children over 8...why would it be published as recommended for children as young as 36-months old. Once I opened, I knew it had to be returned. It was really cute (smaller than appeared) but for a much older child. It cost me shipping, return shipping, and shipping on new (and more suitable gift), of course from Amazon. Just very unhappy that when ordering by the \\"Age\\" filter (2-4), that it doesn't actually work that way.

When you want to buy a tea set, first things you want to know (besides the look, which you can tell from the picture) are THE SIZE and if it's porcelain or plastic. These things are esential to know, as you won't buy the same thing for a toddler tea party and for a 8 year old tea party. Doesn't it seem ridiculous to gave a 8 year old a tea cup that fits a tablespoon of tea?So my review is mostly for the manufacturer: write properly the product description and if the product is great, you won't have one star ratings just because people didn't receive what they were expecting.

Fairly standard. Well, I entered the password and the system kept timing out. Not saying the password was incorrect, just a internet timeout. I tried using the CD that comes with the device...no go. VERY buggy software on that disk. I didn't even bother calling technical support, because if I DID get this onto my network and it got reset some how, I wouldn't want to have to go through the pain to get this up and running again.

Cyrille, as usual, is an acute listener and responds, anticipates and accompanies Bergman with uncanny imagination and drive. Borah Bergman -- perhaps the greatest , most under-recognized musician of the last 30 years. An incredibly powerful pianist, second only to Cecil Taylor, with a left hand that surpassed all. Here he sounds like 2 pianists at once; the wealth and density of contrapuntal, intertwining musical thought on a level no one (other than Taylor) has ever achieved. And as soulful as it gets -- an emotional openness as expansive as the open prairie. Genius musicianship, straight no chaser, no compromise. (As Bergman once described his approach, \\"It's comin' at ya and if you don't like it shove it up your azz.\\") Music for those who demand only the best and can handle (i.e., enjoy) it.

But I am very disappointed with this tuner from the same company. The microphone is insensitive. The display is very often ambiguous -- you can't tell whether the marks are drifting up or down. Just plain bad. After putting it away for two years, today I gave it another try -- same thing as two years ago. I'd sell it for a dollar. By the way, I suspect it's not a real strobe tuner. Here's why. With the good old mechanical wheel tuner, the octave bands drift relative to each other because any string has some degree of falseness. But the bands in this electronic version do not -- very suspicious. If you want a strobe tuner and don't need portability, get the mechanical-wheel version from the same company -- it's a gem in the world of tuners, and I have a good collection of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"These games are awesome","review":"all the games are just like the originals except for the video's added and final fantasy 2(actually 5) is alot harder than i remember from when i was a little kid.

Phew! I hope I got everything right. Amazingly the heroine is not in-bred, nor does she live in an overcrowded tenement or trailer. She is the daughter of a rich artist. Rarely have two males in a romance been treated with such contempt. Also it seemed the granny exerted a balefully malign influence in the lives of Daniel and Joss rather than a loving one. Mind you the vengeful Linden is a magnificent read. It all ends happily enough. Emotional and morbidly entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Charlotte Lamb's Best Novels","review":"I LOVE this novel.

My favourite is version number 3 which resembles to Blur whit its dark tone.

Doesn't have a lot of extra features, but it works and is exciting for my 9 year old. The only issue I have now is the built-in battery which doesn't seem to charge; it charged initially but not after it drained for the first time.

There is one design (for a steam engine) that can be built with hand tools, everything else needs machine tools.If machine-tooled steam engines is your thing, I'm sure this book is great.

If you intend to hang it on the wall, this is the food mill for you.If you plan to actually USE the food mill, don't buy this one. My biggest complaint is that the mill simply will not push the food through. Food circles and circles, and hardly any puree goes through the strainer. What does manage to go through is too big because both the holes on both plate inserts are too large. It simply does not work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well made but not fine enough","review":"This product is well made and works good but the grating is not fine enough for me.

The blade pushes the food around and around but not through bottom of the mill. I tried this with tomatoes and with RIPE American persimmons.

Each image is carefully chosen and tacked into place, and what rises is the edifice of a life. The metaphor is probably too static. Myles's prose is exhilarating even at its bleakest, it's full of breathless speed. There's plenty that is bleak here--a sad alcoholic father who dies before his daugher's eyes; an awful, floundering gang-rape; poverty, drugs, booze, ambition thwarted and bitterly fulfilled. It's the great American sadness, and it would be unbearable if Myles didn't write with such wit, elegance, and an utter lack of self-pity. The writer that comes to mind is Henry Miller, but a Henry Miller who didn't hate women."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"I bought the Skipdoctor because we have several DVDs that our Toshiba player has problems with.

It has removed all but the deepest scratches from atleast 20 CDs and DVDs. even the Pilates disk (after about 20 passes through the Diskdoctor) works now!Downers: The unit it self seems flimsy, and is some times tricky to get open.Uppers: It WORKS.FYI: The polishing liquid is just distilled water, as per the literature.

The only performer who distinguishes themself here is Elsa Lanchester as the eccentric artist. It may be sacrilege, but the remake of this film, \\"No Way Out\\" is far superior to the original.

Milland, solid as ever, anchors the action as the cornered protagonist, while portly Charles Laughton is superbly loathsome as the controlling, megalomaniac killer.

Ray Milland plays the clever editor slated to take the fall; the film flounders as Milland makes dumb mistake after dumb mistake: getting drunk with his boss' mistress, lying to his wife about his whereabouts and generally blundering about making things worse. The growing pile of evidence against him is meant to ratchet up the suspense, but the direction and script are both so poor that the story just seems preposterous and never picks up speed. Laughton's performance is adequate, Milland is a bit irritating. Elsa Lanchester has a supporting role as a kooky modern artist, and a young Henry Morgan (later known as Colonel Potter on TV's \\"MASH\\") plays a silent hired thug.

I am very pleased with the performance of Henckels product and would not have any problem recommending this to a friend.

I made multiple passes with each knife through the two slots on this sharpener.

As we don't have a lot of time to spend sharpening, our knives would tend to get dull - which was the reason I bought good knives in the first place.This thing gives like 90% of perfect edge results in less than a minute on touch up, and only a few minutes on truely dull knives - really works great for those who don't have a lot of time.

Henckels knifes.Was surprised - it's not so effective with Wusthof knives (if you have them), probably because of the difference in the edge angle and fixed position of sharpening rods.Nevertheless, it's very effective with Zwilling J.A. Henckels knifes. Just keep the knife a little inclined backward - you'll feel the right angle by the resistance of abrasive rods. And don't expect the one move action - it needs the higher pressure on the knife, which can damage the edge. 3-4 moves at light pressure by the steady hand and job is done. Don't forget to use the honing rod."},{"rating":"2","title":"Knives like new!","review":"Great product. Using the metal rod is not very efficient and hard to get really sharp.

Although I use one of my steels to maintain edges on my blades between sharpenings, knives still need a bit more than just a steel every now and then, and this seems to work well. It's compact enough that I can keep it handy on my primary prep area and does a credible job putting a useful edge on my chef's knives, slicers, butcher knives, etc., very quickly. No setup, no oiling of stones, good safety features. Like it. The edge it produces is useful. Not the sharpest, but sharp enough that a good steel will keep it useful for quite a while.

While I like both, I find the Henckel twin sharpener more convenient and easier to use than the chef's choice. Not only is there a significant cost difference but there's significant time saved using the Henckel. It takes less than a minute to pull the Henckel from the drawer and run a knife over its surface vs. five or so minutes to pull the Chef's Choice appliance from the cabinet, plug it in and then run the knife over its surface. The Henckel sharpener is an excellent choice for the cost and time conscience person."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome at honing / touching up an edge","review":"To get a really first rate edge, I use a Lansky system with the guide rods and different angles. However, that is a pain for a quick touch up because it requires clamping the blade down and setting up the rods. This Henckel's model is awesome for touching up an edge or honing as it is also called. I do not use it for re-setting an edge or sharpening. The difference...honing is that last step that gets it really sharp. Sharpening can be thought of as re-setting an edge that has been really dulled. The carbide wheels are really supposed to sharpen, but I don't get very good results. The ceramic wheels are simply the best way I know to get a good quick hone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product, did excellent work.","review":"Wow, I was stunned how well it worked.

Her voice shines in every track, and sound is so diverse and interesting mixing classical arias adapted into pop songs and AC type of pop songs.Filippa truly displays an incredible vocal range this time, showcasing 4 octaves. Filippa can belt high like Monica Naranjo or Patti Labelle, or sing in an operatic way like Sarah Brightman, as well as sing into the highest passages of a soprano leggera into whistle register like Mariah Carey does. Her voice is incredibly flexible.You MUST get this album. Her first album was a fine classy work, her second album a more subdued and soothing sound, but this one is pure exciment.Highlights for me were:Ave Mariah, Vincera per me, Una voce poco fa, Senza Mama, O terra addio, O quante volte, River, All I need."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Isn't it","review":"Why do I have the sneaking suspicion that all of the glowing reviews posted here were written by Ms. Giordano's producers and lackeys?

Although the scenes were a bit contrived no real complaints here. On the negative, the music for the video was disappointing and a general lack of real depth or substance to the plot of the video was also disappointing. The video spends a lot of time trying to impress you with how sexually active these women are and entirely missed other components of their life. These are wives, moms and career women.

While on recorded CDs they are amazing and have some great songs, when performed live, it lacks any cohesion. The vocals - from either singer, sound bad. The live mix is muddled too.The worst part for me, however, is the show. The song selection was lacking and it appears they performed before a crowd that was there to see someone else. The club, which may have 100 people at the show max, aren't into any of the songs and just appear to be waiting for some other band.The extras are lame as well. The biography of the band is nothing more than text - no video talking about the band's history.I own almost 100 metal DVDs and this is by-far the worst.

The Gertleys have brought dried flower arranging to a level that I've never seen anywhere in any other book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"There are two things wrong with this DVD. The first is that this program is a roast of a man who is known for his rants not bantor so the whole thing comes off flat because this is not the style of humor that Leary or his friends are known for. The funnies person turns out to be his priest. Second this is severely edited. There is an unedited version of Leary's rebutle in the special features and they cut all the good jokes from his rebutle out of the main program. One can only assume that the rest of the program suffered the same fate (as the jokes are not good and do not flow). Also, the editor even cut out pieces of jokes from Leary's rebutle. This means that some jokes were missing the middle and made little sence in the main program. If you like Dennis, go get his DVD with a classic \\"No Cure for Cancer\\" and enjoy what he is good at, not what Comedy Central put together for him."},{"rating":"1","title":"I couldn't have been more disappointed","review":"Spend your money on one of Leary's performances, not this painfully unfunny waste of 90 minutes. If you've ever watched a comedian struggle mightily to be funny and fail, you know the sort of discomfort I felt when watching these no-names flail on stage. It's telling that the only names of consequence--Stewart and Leary's cousin O'Brien--literally phoned it in. A typically awkward detail: the director cuts away to Keifer Sutherland reaction shots maybe a dozen times, like he's the President at the Lincoln Center Honors or something. It's utterly bizarre. Leary deserved better. I spent the whole time wishing I were watching him do standup--instead of watching him watch his inferiors. His brief closing remarks are amusing enough, but it's too little too late."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"After watching several of the other Comedy Central Roasts, it is easy to say that this one comes in dead last in all aspects. It's hard to describe how unfunny this one was, other than to say that it was a good idea for Comedy Central to add more comedians in later episodes. Basically, most of the people seemed to be there just to hang out and half-ass tease him. There was no energy from any of the roasters, the jokes were completely flat and pointless, the song was hard to hear and wasn't funny either, and the roastmaster himself made a few lame attempts at jokes but mainly just offered praise for everyone that came up to talk. A roast, this was not. Maybe casual banter peppered with a few meaningless and random personal stories. Thank God for Netflix because I didn't have to feel bad about stopping it before it was done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bambi and Thumper Could Have Handled This Roast","review":"This may be a keeper for the hard-core Denis Leary fans but for those of us who enjoy the Comedy Central roasts as a whole...to say that this was disappointing is a gross understatement. There were a few good jokes here and there but they were few and far between. Unlike the the typical CC dayus members, Greg Giraldo, Jeff Ross, Lisa Lampanelli, the roasters didn't really let Denis Leary \\"have it\\". Personally, I think it was because the majority are all still trying to make it in the film industry and feared that any derogatory remarks towards anyone in the room may have had repercussions down the road. Once again, that's just my opinion. Overall, I think Denis Leary not only deserved a much better roast...we all know he could handle it! What I wouldn't give to have \\"The Queen of Mean\\" (Lisa L.) up there for just two minutes..."},{"rating":"2","title":"I dont agree with the critics","review":"I have to say that this Roast was actually pretty good overall. Sure the comedians didn't rip into Leary as bad as I thought they should have. But they still did a good job and I found the Roast humorous. What I do believe saved the DVD was the Red Carpet moments, and Leary's full uncut rebuttal for the comedians on the stage. But those who buy this Roast be prepared for slow moments and a few good moments thrown together. As for comedy central not bad roast for their first roast they ever did as far as my knowledge goes of comedy central roasts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Denis Leary STOLE EVERYTHING from BILL HICKS","review":"This roast has some amusing moments, but no one had the balls to confront Denis about the fact that he lifted the majority of his act from Bill Hicks. His entire \\"angry smoking guy\\" shtick was lifted from Bill and Denis Leary should be ASHAMED OF HIMSELF. Besides, what kind of an ego does this guy have to PRODUCE a roast of himself? Do yourself a favor and don't buy this DVD. Go buy any of Bill Hicks' CDs from Amazon. They are all very good (except Philosophy, which is more of a disjointed greatest hits package) and they are all much better than Denis Leary will ever be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Old favorite","review":"So glad to find this!

In a well-written tale with programmer as protagonist,he manages to create a compelling story of tecnology's impacton society. Those who fear hackers should read this book ifonly to gain an insight into their possible motivation. The cry of\\"information wants to be free\\" is at the center of Brunner'svision of a society made fragile then liberated by computers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprising","review":"This is the most offensively bad book I have read in recent memory.I wanted to like it. I really did. Some of the fictional science themes hit points decades before their time and some of the asides did not revel in exacting pointlessness. However, the dialogue fails, almost taking pains to avoid any resemblance to actual human speech. Characters behave inconsistently. The science, even for the seventies, is very, painfully, soft. An undercurrent of pretentious political activism -- something akin to the inane mutterings of a burned out, hippie anarchist -- runs through most of the book, making for an unpleasant read.Considering the author's apparent notoriety and the book's apparent popularity, my incredibly negative experience really surprises me. As I am clearly in the minority, you can only trust my opinion so much, but please consider this. No book before or since came so close to convincing me that justification for the burning of books for their content exists."},{"rating":"1","title":"Prescient but dated","review":"Although I can certainly understand the appeal of this groudbreaking precambrian cyberpunk novel, the story and language are hopelessly dated to a modern reader.

The plot is so disjointed and utterly contrived, it seems to be the work of an 11 yr old. Throughout, Brunner tries to impart deep social truths which are mostly just half-baked, thoughtless whimsy. I knew I shouldn't have read the whole book - It really was a complete waste of my time."},{"rating":"2","title":"The book that turned me into a computer nerd","review":"There's not much to add to the reviews above...

It should be required reading for health care activists, professionals wishing to improve health care, and medical sociologists. I have been involved in the reform of standard medical care for childbearing women so that it becomes less medicalized, more woman-oriented and truly meets their needs, and understand far better why the system is so recalcitrant, not amenable to change.

Namely a firm grounding in the ability to do two dimensional layout.I cannot say that I fully agree that this has been a deficiency in recent education. But perhaps for some students it has. If so, you may want to turn to his book to cover this deficit. The book should not be hard, one hopes. 2d stuff is much simpler.

A variety of topics like these are covered in the first 150 pages, the next 160 or so goes into the various locations, with a sense of the area combined with acutal landmarks, their description, location, hours of operation. The books are jammed full of photographs of decent quality. A different approach than the Eyewitness guides, worth looking at both before you go."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to control the bikes","review":"Previously I played Moto GP on my Sanyo cell phone for Sprint, and although it was crude it was fun.

The hook is nice for hanging. The only thing that makes it not a 5-star product is a small lip between the strainer mesh and the metal rim.

Honestly, I'm not a fan of their music style.But as a drummer, I continually go back to this for reference and technique. Portnoy is amazing...hands down! And the video is well made. He breaks down a wide variety of specific licks, grooves and fills throughout the 2 disc set.I really like this because it gives me a fresh perspective on odd time signatures and fills. I'm used to playing either 4/4 or 6/4, most of the time, and this DVD brings a new challenge and a new dimension to my playing.Bottom Line: Highly recommended for any drummer who studies techniques of others, especially if you want to expand in odd time signatures."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak Entertainment and less Educational","review":"This DVD is okay if you just want to watch Mike Portnoy play the songs on the album, but it does not offer much more than an explanation of a few songs. I personally feel that Portony's playing is dynamically limited, and his bass drum chops are weak.For a great DVD for entertainment and great exercises to improve your chops, control and independence, I recommend Thomas Lang's Creative Control."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Cheesy","review":"Recreating a song composed by a classical music composer (such as Beethoven) into an electronica tune sounds like a good idea in almost every instance, but I have yet to really find an example of this that has really worked. The Orange Theme, which is also the main theme from the movie \\"A Clockwork Orange\\", is just not very good. Granted, the Solar Stone remix is good trance, with a great build, but the main synth line is just not that good. It really isn't that catchy, and is just plain cheesy.

The dual chopping blade feels nice in my hands and because it's a dual blade, the chopping time is reduced.

I haven't needed to sharpen the blades yet, but I think if I needed to I could unscrew one of the blades and sharpen it with my Presto electric knife sharpener.The cutting board is beautiful, very dense wood, and a pleasure to use. I give it a bit of food-grade mineral oil periodically to keep the wood healthy. Normally, unless I am chopping something that needs soap to wash, I just rinse it after I'm finished chopping something vegetable in nature and stand it on its side to drip dry.

You can read other reviews for this refill online and see that everyone else is having the same issues. I expect better from Cross and can't believe that they have so many problems with the blue gel refills.

These feel very heavy in comparison to plastic, but won't pick up odors or stain like plastic will. The hinged oval ring clip is convenient to open and close to remove the cup you need--a bit stiff at first but it loosened up nicely. (Much simpler to use than the type of circle loop, like on a keychain, that you see on most other sets.) Handles are strong and seem to be sturdily attached, although they could be a bit longer to balance out the weight of the cups themselves. The narrow scoop shape makes it easy to dip into a container of flour. The handles are marked with both cup and metric units, and in a nice detail, the one-cup size also has 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, and 1/8 marks etched inside. The pouring lips will come in handy for liquids. The other thing that sold me on this set is the 1/8-cup size, which not all sets include.

Polished metal, I mean, they're measuring cups, so no big whoop.BUT: My 1 cup sized cup says 1/2 cup on the handle! The actual 1/2 cup cup also says 1/2 cup. If the cups are all on the ring, then you probably won't think twice, but if you or someone using them doesn't do enough cooking to notice something's fishy, they may mistake the 1 cup size for 1/2 cup. The handles are the same size so my guess is that the wrong handle was attached at the factory; these are not single-piece construction."},{"rating":"2","title":"STAINLESS STEEL MEASURING CUPS","review":"I love these measuring cups.

I feel those are two of the most important things when looking at an atlas, being able to see the country and not have an inch cut out the middle, and have the map be as big as the page allows without distorting it.

All it required was some application, thought and tenacity. For instance, when presented with a series of apparently random pictures and given a choice from among four of which image should appear next, all it took was a few minutes of thought and avoidance of the temptation to become frustrated. I suddenly saw that the given figures were a person's right eye, a left foot, a right hand, a left ear.... so it didn't really take any sort of genius to determine that the next item would be a \\"right\\" something. Desire and persistence are the keys, every time.About the time I read this book, I met a guy who was extremely proud of being a Mensa member, and he too had solved everything in this Games book. But he was lazy as a red brick, and worked as a machinist on a graveyard shift. Right, Mensa."},{"rating":"2","title":"super good deal","review":"At the present cost of $3.29 including shipping, this is an amazingly good deal.The quality seems okay in terms of durability, but quite low quality in terms of cosmetics if you're looking closely at it -- tailoring, shape, alignment, etc. For example, the magnetic clasp is badly offset from the center. If you're not looking closely, it's fine.My original one that came with my new Motorola RAZR V3i in the store was that way too. This appears to be a very faithful copy of the original, if not the same production line. The clasp works fine offset. The ratcheting design of the belt attachment is great and keeps the sheath from easily spinning and dumping the phone while still allowing motion to accommodate sitting for example. Great design."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this if you plan on loading it into a PC","review":"I doubted the review below that mentioned how bad the dual-disc is. Shouldn't have.

Each one reinforces a concept that has been previously explained and challenges the reader to use the knowledge he/she has gained to answer the question appropriately. The answer section in the back does an excellent job of explaining why the answers are correct rather than just stating them.

Brown's sound is very much in the line of Jimmy Lyons and is no less strident than the latter's, but this trio performance is so intense that I found myself flying with Brown, Parker and drummer Jackson Krall, with my mind far beyond the texture of Brown's actual tone.This is not \\"easy\\" music, as anyone familiar with some of Brown's other outings can attest, but it is oh so captivating!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply Blue?","review":"What Happend with Mick's Simply Red,. cause this sounds more like Simply Blue.

You'll find yourself humming to his songs! I've played this CD many times and I never get bored of it. This is one of those albums that you wish will never end. Mick Hucknall is a great artist and his voice will grow on you. Be sure to check out his earlier album \\"Stars\\" because it is so darn good, and it has stayed in my CD carousel since I bought it. \\"Stars\\" and \\"Blue\\" will be your timeless classics, and you'll be simply-all-over-Mick Hucknall!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh!","review":"Mick, Baby,--yeah, you with the beautiful tenor, brilliant lyrics, and incredible tunes--What were you thinking?

On the other hand, \\"Angel\\", \\"Ghetto girl\\" and \\"Night nurse\\" are among the most unispired songs I've ever heard Mick sing. \\"Mellow my mind\\" is a good cover of a good song which I didn't fully enjoy with Neil Young.

Reading Don's book, I wonder if he was in the same Japan at all. He reveals little of the Japanese soul- just that he experienced friendly smiles from the locals. He caught a few colorful festivals. He ate local foods.I think the problem is, not really understanding Japanese, it is hard to really get deep into the culture. To learn what lies beneath the polite smiles- that is the essence of travel writing!Being a Gaijin (and in my case, an African Gaijin) will always draw attention from the locals, especially in the less touristed spots.

And after getting through the book, you feel like you have been sitting on a bike for hours too.

Referring to the East Sea as the \\"Sea of Japan\\" is one such example. This name is the result of Japanese imperial aggression and should be dropped in favor of more neutral language. Throughout the book, one only reads of the politeness of the Japanese. I doubt the countless women of Korea, China and the Philippines raped and kept as \\"comfort women\\" during Japanese occupation would agree with that assessment. No mention is given to the various cultural treasures Japan looted from her Asian neighbors.In Chapter 3, the author uses the word \\"cripple\\". As a differently-abled senior, still bearing wounds from the Japanese aggression, I find the term a little more than offensive.Thankfully, Japan is moving towards rapproachment with her neighbors.

My favorite song has to be \\"If It Makes You Happy\\" with Chrissy Hinds from The Pretenders, it doesn't get much better than that. Also, \\"Gold Dust Woman,\\" taken over by Stevie Nicks on vocals, is excellent. The audience applause and how she interacts with the audience is perfect. \\"All I Wanna Do\\" is great, so is \\"The Difficult Kind,\\" \\"There Goes The Neighborhood,\\" \\"Leaving Las Vegas,\\" \\"My Favorite Mistake,\\" and one of Sheryl's best, \\"Everday Is A Winding Road.\\" This CD is for sure one of the best CD's of all time and you gotta check it out.

No CD collection can possibly be without, \\"Sheryl Crow & Friends: Live In Central Park.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must for ANY Rock Fan","review":"Sheryl Crow has shown herself to be one of the finest singer-songwriters of rock today with this live album that she recorded during a concert in Central Park with an eclectic group of guest artists ranging from the Dixie Chicks to Keith Richards. Crow is at her best- she brings new energy to her set of FM favorites while complementing her guests extremely well. With a doubt the best songs on the album are \\"If It Makes You Happy\\" with Chrissie Hynde and the haunting performance of \\"Gold Dust Woman\\" with the one and only Stevie Nicks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass this one up","review":"Sheryl Crow is one of my favorite rock artists. That said, this is a poor album - poor sound quality with poor performances. I enjoyed watching the concert associated with this CD, but the CD doesn't have any spark - she is singing flat and the music is slow and plodding.If you want to hear Sheryl Crow live, go see her live."},{"rating":"2","title":"Live from New York...","review":"It's Sheryl Crow and friends. Some very impressive friends I might add. For the half of the disc it is Sheryl singing her own songs. \\"Everyday is a Winding Road\\" kicks off the big show. Right away I noticed her live renditions are different than the album versions, which is pretty cool. The freestyle at the end of \\"Leaving Las Vegas\\" is very original and \\"It Don't Hurt\\" gets an introduction I won't soon forget.The Dixie Chicks help Sheryl out on her \\"Strong Enough\\" and give it a little twang. Chrissie Hynde joins Sheryl for \\"If It Makes You Happy\\", which did not make me very happy. When Stevie Nicks hits the stage, Sheryl help HER on \\"Gold Dust Woman\\" and the crowd goes insane.I love this CD, but Eric Clapton and Keith Richards seemed less than enthused to be performing (-1 star). All in all not bad at all!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass this one us","review":"Sheryl Crow is one of my favorite rock artists.

I love Sheryl Crow and I've seen her in concert, but she was better than this. I know it's tiring doing live gigs, and artists want to spice it up by playing with the melodies, but it sounded too much like she was singing a higher melody when it was just too low to shout it, and lower one when it was just too high for her tired voice to reach. This is acceptable for the ump-teenth concert in a row on a tour - no doubt it wears you down. Besides, the fans have the added bonus of seeing you live. But please don't put it on a cd. These beautifully-crafted songs deserve better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great live album!","review":"I seen this on tv and I loved it so much I bought it on the day it came out! Sheryl is probably my fourth favorite singer. Stevie Nicks is my #1, Christine McVie is my #2, and Chrissie Hynde is my #3. Sheryl sounded great! I love almost every song.

I love music that has great lyrics, earnestly soulful vocals, edgy gutars. I'm not a fan of Nineties MTV-VH1 style pop lightweight junk. But Sheryl Crow ROCKS on this album. Listen to the way she warbles on A Change Would Do You Good. She takes one of her dullest hits and breathes incredible life into it. I don't know how to explain. I could have done without Clapton's White Room, but I guess she had to put her boyfriend on the cd. Stevie Nicks doesn't do much for me either. Crissy Hynde and The Dixie Chicks bring a lot to this recording. But ultimately it's Sheryl and her band that make this a \\"must have.\\" Sheryl could come to my party and sing There Goes the Neighborhood any time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"FLAT FLAT FLAT FLAT!","review":"In my opinion, this has to go down as one of the worst live performances ever released. I guess since all the famous guests showed, they had to go with it despite Crow's subpar performance. She starts off flat & hoarse, and never gets much better. When her first guests come out--the Dixie Chicks--I gotta say it's a pleasure to finally hear someone sing on key, no matter what the Amazon review says about a \\"leaden\\" vocal (and I don't even like the Dixie Chicks). I'm a Crow fan, but I'm sorry I wasted my money on this."},{"rating":"2","title":"No, she has not friends, she is part of THE FAMILY now!","review":"Excellent CD: powerful,constantly good and with a brillant classic-rock-blues atmosphere. Yes, she's part of the Clapton, Nicks, Richards FAMILY, part of the music we grow up with. Well done Sheryl! There are not 14 songs on this CD, there is only one 73 min. long brillant Rock Concerto! And I would like to suggest to \\"one star reviewers\\" - hey, there is a Ice-T and Coolio show next door, please give us a break!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rox The Neighbourhood","review":"Sheryl Crow has always been a live! artist, despite all her multigrammy winning albums; when she's on stage that's when you see her at her most engaging. This album, a veritable pot pourri of hits and collectible one-off performances with some v famous 'friends' (Dixie Chicks, Sarah McLachan, Eric Clapton, Chrissie Hynde, to name but a few) showcases not only the vitality of Sheryl's self-penned hits, but her ability to engage an emotive response from an audienmce while simultaneously rawking the house. Top trax include The Difficult Kind (shoulda been a single), It Don't Hurt, a fab duet with the Dixie Chicks (Strong Enough) and a great version of Eric Clapton's White Room. A great album if you want to hark back on all Sheryl's hits or if you really want to appreciate just how amazing the gal is, just like the 25'000 New York backing singers in the park testified."},{"rating":"2","title":"One word -- AWESOME!","review":"Well... The concert on TV was simply awesome. I just had to have a CD! The songs on this CD are so awesome!

Unimaginative, leaden schlock."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sheryl Live!","review":"To be honest with you I didn't give this live album much of a chance when it first came out, but all of the sudden I find myself listening to this album more and more of late, maybe it's because of her Grammy win for Female Rock Performance or maybe it's because I am waiting for her to bring something new, but with live versions of \\"If It Makes You Happy\\", \\"Strong Enough\\" not to mention \\"The Difficult Kind\\" and \\"There Goes The Neighborhood\\" which she got the Grammy for, it's clear to see why this live CD, is a winner although very underrated, I thought that her pairing with Shelby Lynne of the \\"The Difficult Kind\\" was a winner on the Grammy's. It's nice to see someone getting rewarded for good work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fails to come alive.","review":"As a long-time Sheryl Crow fan, I jumped on the chance to buy this live album. Although I really, really tried to like this CD, I couldn't stop being bored by it. \\"The Difficult Kind\\" is the only track that I fully enjoyed, with \\"Tombstone Blues\\" running a close second. The prospect of hearing Sheryl Crow sing with a handful of other awesome artists was intriguing, but their presence doesn't seem liven up this album enough. It fails to capture the energy of the original performance. While I am still a loyal fan, I regret purchasing \\"Sheryl Crow and Friends.\\" I feel that her studio albums are far superior."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun And Light-Hearted","review":"A good Live CD by Sheryl Crow and some very famous friends. Sheryl banters lightly with the crowd especially on Leaving Las Vegas and is in very strong voice. All the guests make fine contributions to this recording but to my ears, the duet with Eric Clapton on White Room takes the cake. You just have to love the ending guitar solo on that track. Keith Richards is in fine spirit on Happy as well as is Chrisie Hynde on If It Makes You Happy.Maybe this is recording will not go down in history as loaded with excellent instrumentation or unusual arrangements. However, this collection wins on spirit and enthusiasm. And with such a roster of musical legends, how can you really go wrong?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A graet compress of the history","review":"I am a teacher in Mexico and i use this book like a textbook.

Nevertheless I decided to give them a try (I'm done with pens that are too expensive, and yet don't like the super cheap ones either). At first I was inclined to agree, the pen writes smoothly, and holds well in my hand. But soon they showed their true colors (sneaky lot, they are). Some seemed to run out of ink (when they seemed full of it). Also after writing for some time (scribbling notes) they were a pain to hold. My biggest gripe, however, concerns the bottom screw-on cap of the pen. It tends to unscrew. Very often. So I find that the ink cartridge tends to separate and I have to look for it. Furthermore, if you take the top cap and place it on the bottom to hold it there while you write, you may find that the bottom cap gets stuck in the top cap. And now you have no bottom. A really annoying thing that's happened more than once. Not the pen for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for artists!","review":"I like fine detail drawing and have always loved this pen for the fine point.

The search was on for a good pen. I came across these Pilot pens and haven't looked at anything else since. In all these yrs. I never had a Pilot pen quit until it was completely empty.No smears, no blobs ever. They feel very comfortable in my hand.As all the rest of the people on here write they are getting hard to find.

Over the years, they kept on working and working. In the past, I found that other ball point pens would develop skips, or just seem to dry out and die long before the ink reservoir was drained. But not these Pilots. They just keep on writing fine. I don't know what they're doing different, but they make other brands look bad. Especially the one that has that famous 3 letter name that was once synonymous with ball point pens and razors.I think I will stock up on more Pilots, in the near future, and probably won't need to buy pens for another 20 years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Always good memory","review":"I've been upgrading Ram in computers for 10 years now and just recently made the switch to Mac, and Crucial has yet to let me down.

However, the pieces do not fit together tightly. This is a problem because the garlic spills up the sides and out the top. Also the press does not always fully crush garlic. The pieces do not completely go together because the handles bend so that they are touching, but the crusher does not completely close. The joint holding the pieces together is not very tight and it allows the pieces to not line up properly also contributing to the problem of not fully crushed garlic. This is a better garlic crusher than my previous $1.50 press... but it is not worth the price and there are probably better ones. I have used the Good Grips press and liked it, but read the reviews that said it broke, so I tried this one. Bad idea."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't buy","review":"... I used the press only 5 or 6 times before the metal broke at a seam in the back of the garlic holder pressing basket thing. for the press to work at all you must peel the garlic and even then most of the garlic squezes up through the top instead of beeing expelled through the holes at the bottom and you are left with juice, a few chunks squezzed out by the handle, and a wad of garlic nearly impossible to remove crushed in the bottom of the basket. DONT BUY!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck","review":"Although this garlic press looks nice and has a handy cleaning tool attached, it doesn't work at all.

I am a fan of Italian made Pedrini products, however, the garlic press didn't measure up to their otherwise high quality products. After scant use, the metal snapped at the joint. Even when it did work, very little garlic would actually squeeze through the holes. If you're willing to invest a few bucks in what will surely be a life-long kitchen mate, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND the Rösle garlic press. It's German made, heavy weight, and requires just the slightest pressure. You won't believe how well the garlic extrudes! Great design and easy to clean."},{"rating":"1","title":"I not good.

Really, how much can it cost for them to at least put them in an earring type box that make them look like they are the fine jewelry they are supposed to be?

Use the review section to remind yourself of the most prevalent theorems and do some of the test problems to review the computations.

Second, the explanations of the solutions are rarely satisfactory. Third, the review section is a complete joke and, like the questions in the practice exams, many of the topics it covers are completely worthless with regards to the GRE (e.g. cubic spline interpolation, fourier series). I didn't read the review section very thoroughly (though I did glance over subtitles, so I know that a lot of time-wasting material was included), but what I did look at in some depth was poorly explained.All of this said, the book isn't entirely useless.

While studying questions that are modestly harder than the actual test is often a good way to score high, this book goes well beyond that level, to the point of being almost useless.The proofreading of this book is remarkably poor.

For example, the appendix on \\"flag officers who died in WWII\\" omits at least two admirals, including one whose death is mentioned in his entry in the body of the book.

It wasn't the best though. You can tell what the plot is after the first chapter. The author tried to put some mysteries in the book, but it just made the stories drag on and on.

This book could of have been one of those books that would hold you in suspense. But the way it was written, all you'd say is 'Oh, Didn't see that coming. Oh well' And when they proposed, they all said the same thing. How much they loved her, and that they wanted to spend the rest of their lives with her. I thought that it was ridiculious to have a town such as Rocky Bluff. Except for when we go to meet the Lord. It was hard to imagine living in a town where everyone actually liked everyone.

With no legal background whatsoever and a myopic philosophical vision which seems ingorant of the liberal tradition upon which the right of free speech is grounded, Butler provides an obfuscted discussion (and that's all it is, a discussion) of the issue that is at the best of times, irrelevant, and at the worst of times, offensively misleading. The book is worthwhile only as an example of what happens when a postmodern thinker in the French tradition tries to tackle a subject outside the race/power/gender/subjectivity canon outlined by the philosophers of the 1960s. If you have an appetite for reading philosophical trainwrecks, then by all means read it. If you want something serious on the issue of free speech, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"a star for every year they've served me well","review":"These spoons are designed perfectly.

The visualizations tell so much about the new knowledge now being acquired from the spacecraft in orbit of the planet. While the book is short on scientific detail, it is not designed to be a scientific treatise. It will take years to digest what is now being witnessed. The many Saturnian moons hold so much new knowledge yet to be understood. The images only begin to tell the story but each is worth seeing while the experts struggle to explain their meaning. I HIGHLY recommend this book to the astronomer and the lay person alike. It is well worth every penny to share in the spellbinding images contained on nearly every page with a brief text description. This is a display of The Lord of the Rings!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Treasure","review":"I'm glad they were able to make a book out of all the pictures they took, they are amazing and worth appreciating.

Did you notice that \\"Say You\\" is in MONO but the rest of the stuff is in stereo. And who ever mixed \\"Fading Away\\" killed it. They brought the violins up way too high during the instrumental part. I will have to admit, the stereo of \\"This old heart of mines\\" (on the album by the Isley Bros\\" is a much crisper cleaner sound than the MONO version.

If you wanna see George's family again, I'm writing a book called Curious George and Johnny. I got this book at Waldenbooks in the Sunvalley Mall, as part of a huge H.A. Rey treasury. It was so cool when they used Cecily as a boat,bridge,mountain,eeter totter and harp. There was only one problem: I could not tell which monkey's which. They all look eactly the same. The main reason I like this book is because George was in it. And one more thing, my dad suggested the reason George wasn't with his family at the beginning of Curious George, is because he wanted to take a day off and do something out of this world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cecily shouldn't put up with that.","review":"I know many of you are going to complain about my lack of imagination, I take the book too seriously.

Cecily allows the monkeys to do all sorts of odd things to him, As mentioned, Tie him to a tree by his neck, ect.... in this reviewers opinion it is not appropriate for young readers. It crosses the line from cute and just for fun to Cecily allowing the monkeys to treat him in an inappropriate manner just to have friends to play with.

My primary amps have been a 59 Bassman reissue and a Sonny Jr.- Sonny II. If you're used to a mic with a crystal or ceramic element don't buy this mic! The gain on this thing is pretty poor. A good mic for acoustic style harp or singing/playing through the PA..Sonny Boy style...but not for you if you want a mic with gain or a crunchy sound. Im not in the habit of saying anything negative ever but if you're used to a JT-30 or Green Bullet with a vintage element this thing will disappoint you. On the plus side the size of this mic is cool and the volume control always wins points with me. Im kind of stuck with this thing so im going to try an EQ and maybe try a differnt amp or two.

But they didn't include this feature when the radio is set to AUX, which is what I use for CD's and XM radio. The boosted low frequencies make music from these sources unlistenable.

You only get a radio station, no other alarm sounds. And you better have good eyes and memory because when that alarm sounds in the morning, you can only shut it off with the remote. And only by pressing the correct button on the remote. I wonder if anyone at Bose actually took one of these home and tried to use it.

The material can be used with a wide range of age and ability levels.Ruby's Studio: The Feeling Show is a tool that can be used at home, in school or in a parent education class.

Two thumbs up from this mom."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost magnificent","review":"This DVD has quite a bit going for it. It is indeed a magnificent film, and as a film deserves 5 stars. Visually it is superb. The action is set in most realistic places and the costumes are very good. All the singers look their parts, particularly our drum major. All act extremely well and the singing good to excellent. but I do not have a score. So why not 5 stars? On occasion the orchestra overloads the sound track causing some distortion, and secondly, it is a film. As a staged opera during interludes the curtain is down and there is only the music for one to concentrate on. Here these interludes are filled with action - usually Wozzeck walking from place to place - and one is drawn to attend to the action instead of just listening to the music. A small point. I still await a modern staged Wozzeck in Hi-Fi sound. But I will not be throwing away this DVD in any case. Despite any faults it has moments of true greatness."},{"rating":"2","title":"extraordinary production","review":"I first saw this film in the 70's I thought it was wonderful and have long awaited its commercial availability. The singing acting is first rate overall. I am still impressed how the entire cast, especially Unger (the Captain) refrain from the exaggerations and histrionics that normally accompany these roles. For me, however, the real superstar of the performance is Bruno Maderna, a composer-conductor who consistantly projects a complete grasp of Berg's music and how it should be performed. Anyone who loves Berg should not hesitate to pick the audio CD of his Lulu. It's only the two Act version, but he EASILY beats out all recorded competition. One more thing: the Italian Wozzeck with Gobbi, Dow...etc is also incredibly good. Nino Sanzogno, a student of Hermann Scherchen, is nearly as good as Maderna! One CD manifestation contains as act from the BBC broadcast with Boult conducting from the mid-30's which Berg heard before he died and was very impressed by its quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great way to do Opera","review":"I thoroughly loved the real locations, and the sound was good, didn't have the echoey sound defect that lots of other things have for me who only has the tv speakers to hear from. The performance isn't as thrilling as Christoph von Dohnanyi's conducted Decca version, the only other version I've heard, the singing for example is more melodic here as there it was more spiky and eccentric. One last thing, in the Amazon product description, I was enthusiastic about it having a music only track, but alas there was none on the DVD I received. Still a 5 out of 5 product for a lover of modernist classical music, and also those who like films with a depressing 70's look and feel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Expressionist Opera","review":"I learned of this opera in music class.

Being an anarchist (a much- misunderstood political philosophy that involves organization without hierarchy- not chaos or bombs), I found the author's trashing of the anarchist point of view (which, might I add, he obviously did not research beforehand) appalling. Stoddard's \\"anarchists\\" bore no resemblance to anarchists in real life. If he was going to make his antagonists anarchists, he could have at least researched anarchism before he blindly trashed us, spreading yet more misconceptions about what anarchists believe. I must admit that the premise of the book was interesting; however, I found the book itself to be offensive and poorly written, with irritating characters and *really* bad dialog."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very annoying book","review":"While it's been a long time since I tried (unsucessfully) to read this book, I thought I'd at least stop in to give my support to the \\"High House haters\\" camp, which seems to be in the minority here (god knows why).

Anarcho-trashing aside, I thought the supposedly \\"deep\\" good'n'evil theme was so mind-bogglingly, stupidly obvious (not to mention better done in literary masterpeices such as \\"Star Wars\\") that, even in a skimming of the book, I wondered how anyone could call it a \\"masterpeice\\".

Most of the album explores quieter moments with only a few songs featuring a \\"full\\" rock sound and getting over mid-tempo.

The parts are extremely small and usually never have a speaking part. He has a useless agent who seems as lost as he is and his friend Maggie is even more completely hopeless, she lives in a hovel without much money and usually is treated worse when working as an extra.

What we get in this DVD is a few minutes of deleted scenes (understandable), but the \\"Video Diary\\" was horrible, and half of it was just Ricky Gervais being a complete baffoon while \\"working\\" on the second series.

It wasn't funny sad, it was just uncomfortably sad.That said, if you are a die hard Series One fan you must simply see Series Two as a follow-up. While you will mostly be disappointed, there are a few (and I really do mean a few) redeeming scenes (Brent giving his motivational talk and the photo shoot leading up to it--hilarious).For Series One fans this is a must but if you still need to be sold on British comedy after Series One don't waste your money because you won't get this one especially."},{"rating":"2","title":"Do it yourself, I gotta save some Africans!","review":"I am encouraging all readers to GIVE IT A GO.

Instead it is an autobiography of the author. To make matters worse it is not even a good autobiography. While the author has had an interesting life and many diversified experiences in many fields the book doesn't read well. The author, for instance, will note that he took over a new position and he'll go on for pages and pages about who he hired and how competent they were. However in these pages of lavish praise he tells the reader little, if anything, substantive about what they (or he) were doing or accomplishing. This happened over and over through the book until about two thirds of the way through I just gave up reading it. On the positive side he does convey the distrust that the third world feels towards the western nations on environmental issues and discusses ways and bringing the two together.

It is a bit easier than some of the other EA games such as the Battle Field series. You are limited in strategies and weapons available. Ammunition is in short supply for much of the game which adds a touch or realism to the game I suppose.The player gets to participate in the 82nd Air Borne operations in the European theater during WWII much While at times challenging, it lacks save points. If you don't complete an operation or have to quiit, you loose all the medals and ground you have covered up to that point. It makes an operation one long and tedious task. Other EA games function better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good game","review":"This game is a fun game, I got it on thursday the 30th and I played it for 3hrs straight and I beat the game play on easy.

The controls were fair but not like Metroid Prime and the graphics were ok at best. In short buy Medal of Honor heroes 2, you miss out on the ohhhhhh so fun air drops (not really) but it's the classic me vs. Nazi Germany kinda feel. Much better game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too little for the $","review":"If you can find this for $20, go for it. The graphic and gameplay are fun for that price.

It almost becomes a tear jerker from Leslie Ann Warren's very convincing cry in \\"her own little corner.\\"Actually, here, the wicked ancestors are a bit more comical in order to appear more clumsy, and ill mannered.

Reading the other reviews, and realizing how well-known this 1964 version is, I realize I must be in the minority, but I really do not think it is a good production. I read somewhere that though the original tapes for the 1957 Julie Andrews version were lost, some sort of version does exist. I wonder if it will ever be released. I have that CD, and recommend it highly.(2006 update to this 2002 review: 1957 version now available on DVD; rather a dated TV production, but Julie Andrews shines!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow, in a Bad Way","review":"This production of Rogers and Hammerstein's Cinderella is cringeworthy at best. I understand this was a television movie, but they couldn't at least choose good actors and provide a better set? Cinderella acts and sounds like a complete ditz, all starry-eyed and breathless voice. It's partly the fault of the camera-work though. Every 10 seconds and it's an extreme close-up of Cinderella's face. It's frightening. I love the music and this musical, but if it's not well-acted or well-sung, it's not enjoyable for me. I've only heard the Julie Andrews version in soundtrack form, and already that one is 100X better. There's none of the pleasant, exciting, and lovely performances of the original cast. This version has no energy. The exception is the Prince and his parents the King and Queen; they weren't bad. But the rest of the show is the epitome of cheesiness - which could have been avoided if feeling and energy were put into the performances, even despite the terrible sets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Against Julie Andrews this version is just not good.","review":"I remember trying to watch this several times over the years and never could.(Even as a kid I thought this was very dull.) The Brandy version was more watchable but NOTHING compares to the Julie Andrews version.This cast is the worst of the three versions, Stuart Damon is laughable as the Prince and Leslie Ann Warren who've I've enjoyed in so many other shows is soo miscast.

In many ways, aside from the all-star cast, it gives the impression of being a good high school or college production, by today's standards. However, the music is alternately gorgeous and funny, and sticks in your head after you've seen it. I remember watching this on TV as a child and wanting so very much to BE Cinderella.

I recently saw it again after about 20 years, and must say I was extremely disappointed. Yes, it had an all-star cast, and Leslie Warren's performance holds up quite well. But compared to the 1997 production (with Brandy and Whitney Houston, etc.,) this version is SO stiff, so wooden, so BORING, and the guest stars all stodgy and way too old for their parts. (Pat Carroll as a step-sister? She must've been at least in her late 40's when this was filmed.) But most importantly, the sets are so unbelievably cheap and tacky, the special effects are so shoddy -- it's really embarrassing to watch stars like Ginger Rogers stooping so low to appear in such a \\"stagey\\" low-budget production. (Buy the newer (1997) version -- it was directed by Rob Marshall, the same man who directed the Oscar-winning \\"Chicago\\", and compares almost to the Wizard of Oz when it come to the production quality.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Impossible!","review":"...for a movie to be this bad!(even for an old movie that was fimed for t.v) The sets were horrible and very fake looking.

The stepmother and stepsister were ok and provided brief comic relief. But Leslie Ann Warren was awful! Her acting was very chessy and fake and her singing... She sounded like a contestent on American Idol! (a bad one)She was so out of tune and had horrible diction.

For the fan, it has a certain reference value, detailing the Carter family history for instance, but the whole truth, as we now know it, is not told, by Peggy Knight, who it appears remains a faithful and trusted friend to Johnny and June.

The overwhelming amounts of tender philosophy and outrageous views of the \\"life force\\" of a raw diet (scary, truly scary) are completely unrelated to training a dog. The book was denigrating to anyone who has ever given a leash correction, gone hunting, or looked at their dog in any way other than with pure worship.

I love my dog, and give him lots of positive attention. However, these techniques are based on the owner not needing a job, so that every second can be given to the dog and the training that needs to be done at all times. Hand making food, and making sure I have new age music for my dog? I don't like much new age music. I think my dog can get by with what I listen to. The idea of playing the music when you go away is to give the dog the appearance of attention so they won't get bored and become mischevious. I however, don't think pandering to every little thing is good. We shouldn't need to play the dog music for the rest of its life when we leave the home. I love my dog, but I think that the dog should work around my schedule a little more than this book implies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much new information","review":"The attitude of the author was a little scary to me. He acted as if most people beat their dogs, and this book would teach you how to give your dogs treats and love instead of hitting him/her to get the behaviour you want.

Does not give enough options for solid obedience or behavior issues, the advice that is given is, in my opinion, not going to work out well with most dogs. Certainly didn't work with my dogs. Book is slanted towards \\"all positive type\\" training, and not a balanced method including corrections."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book has half of the equation","review":"This book fails to take into account that treats and rewards are only part of the equation for learning. Most of the good manners we want our dogs to learn can be taught by what we reward and what we ignore, but not all!I have watched mother dogs interact with their puppies many times, and in addition to playing, licking, grooming and affection, she will also use strong body language, a lift of the lip to show teeth, a growl, a nip or pinning the puppy when appropriate. There ARE times when it is appropriate to use these techniques also, and using both rewards and consequences is what produces a well balanced dogs that are a pleasure to have around. Paul's book does not address this."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really, REALLY did not like this book...","review":"For some odd reason, this book just irritated me. First is its attitude that every other training method, particularly those involving compulsion, are cruel. They are not, what is cruel is training the dog in a fashion that gives it little respect for the owner. Also, in the beginning the author describes an out-of-body experience he had. What the heck does that have to do with dog training? It kind of set the tone for the entire book. I gave it two stars because the training method WOULD work for a submissive dog not given to challenging his owner's authority.

The breathing ? not for the dog but for the human trainer .... geeezzz louezeee ! This \\"original dog whisperer\\" may be a great dog trainer if you work with him one-on-one with your pet, but via a dvd.... don't waste your money or your time as I have done; invest in a dog obedience class and get hands on, in person training - it will cost you more but your money will be much better spent than to buy this sorry dvd."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT the Cesar Millan Dog Whisperer!","review":"Note that this video has nothing to do with Cesar Millan's television show on the National Geographic Channel called \\"The Dog Whisperer\\"The DVD teaches the most basic dog commands, and is ok.But if you want books or DVDs related to Cesar Millan, this item has nothing do with him!

Of the four CD's that we suffered through (only two worked without skipping or reading an error half the time)we learned more about how to breathe and visualize your dogs good behavior than any solid training information. I also don't think that any person who picks up a CD on nonviolent dog training needs to be reminded several times in every section not to hit or bite your dog. That was just insulting.

Paul Owens explains in minute detail how to make your dog into a model member of society; a dog who, for example, can sit calmly through a tail pulling, ear grabbing or pot banging. The book gives step-by-step instructions for teaching your dog to do the basics (e.g., sit, down, stay, come, heel, go to bed) and to do them in any environment, ignoring any noisy or visual distraction. And not only does Owens' non-violent method work (I've used it on my dog, she's now a dream pup), but it also makes you feel like a caring dog-owner. After using Owens' effective methods, I would never dream of using any abusive, corrective methods on any dog."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Book is Great","review":"If you are totally frustrated with trying to find a compassionate yet effective way to train your dog, this is the book for you.

Simply imposing your will on another creature isn't violence, especially when that imposition ensures the continued physical and psychological health of the creature, as it does with dog owning humans and their dogs. I want to go for a walk at 7am before work. I think Owens would have me ask the dog if that was okay, and come back inside if the dog didn't seem into it. Ridiculous.

Dogs don't have to be mistreated nor do they have to be coddled like royalty with bribes and adoring phrases. Save the treats and praise for tricks, not for establishing boundaries and basic rules of appropriate behavior."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some Good Training Concepts But...","review":"This book has some good concepts on training but nothing that I have not seen elsewhere. A few of the reasons for the low rating are the extra chapters in learning to breath, and how to speak dog. If I want to learn how to do meditation breathing I will buy a new age book. Also the diets recommended in this book for your dog are for those who have a 6 figure income and an organic grocery store available to them. The author(s) also assume that you do not have to work to have this income based on the recommended daily routine for caring for your dog. I also was misled by the title thinking that this was the Dog Whisperer from the television show; it is not. I found this out after I bought the book and I finally got to see the show.

It's a bit see-through on the front which helps to reduce heat and make you feel more comfortable. This is the most comfortable of the 3 thongs I own, especially since the strap going over your behind is supported by slightly more material. The additional material on your behind prevents the product from pulling too tightly against the sensitive area of your behind, but still goes inside the crack a little to give you some umph! This is a comfortable product to wear all day. UPDATE: After about a year, I've realized this is not an all-day comfort item. Better for the weekend or a night out. Also, needs slightly more support.

From the beginning it was difficult to operate - it is hard to adjust it and then it doesn't stay adjusted. I only use this peeler for one week each fall, then carefully store it in the original box until the next year. This care has not helped the life of this item at all. In 2010 it began falling apart - after a total of 3 weeks of use over 3 years. We got it out today and it won't hold together at all; we couldn't even get through our small batch of apples.

How could the manufacturer of the Progressive International fail in every regard? The first use was flawed, with irregular coring and peeling, but still faster than hand-preparation. Very careful washing and drying still resulted in a rusty mess when I got it out to use it the second time. With the first apple, the coring arm snapped off the spring and the interlock lever fell to the ground. When I unscrewed the device to see what could be done, the rubber gasket fell off.I am mechanically inclined yet cannot repair this.

It worked fine the first day. Unfortunately, after only two batches (two 5-gallon buckets), this peeler is completely toast. The wooden handle that screws on broke first; we had to find a longer screw than what was provided to make it stay on. Then, the device at the front of the peeler that cores the apples began to bend. I tried to bend it back in place, but the issue is that it's dulled enough that it's no longer cutting through the apples, and the weight of each piece of fruit is just pushing it further out of place. Finally, the rod that you put the apples onto is bent and wobbly as well.I'm sending this back for a refund and will be looking for a heavier duty peeler. Very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"No stock","review":"Sold it but didn't have it. Bummer If you don't have it take it off the internet.

They found the problem, let me know what it was..then sent me a new one, no questions asked. I love this peeler..so I was quite happy and very impressed. The point is..if you have a problem, they will remedy it immediately. Buy this peeler..as it works great, saves lots of time and you can rely on Progressive 100%! They stand behind their products..and don't look to blame you for any malfunction, as many companies do. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank you, Thank you!","review":"I don't know why I waited so long to get one of these. When I think of how many Holidays I stayed up late peeling potatoes.I love peeler, I can cut a 10pd bag of potatoes in 12-20 mins!We even tried cucumbers, and it works well with any fruit or veggie that is hard and has a skin. So now when my family wants homemade mashed potatoes or potatoe salad, they get it and I am not in the kitchen all day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some ideas to share....","review":"I purchased this through Amazon with full knowledge that there were some 'bugs'. Overall, however, I have been pleased. Progressive does send an extra blade with the peeler/corer and the blade is fairly easy to adjust. I do have difficulty trying to 'center' the item being cored. I wish the mechanism would hinge up (as a stand mixer might). It would be easier to line up the apple that way.Regarding the small clearance in the clamp: What I have done is to mount the peeler/corer on a heavy, old cutting board. It then hangs part way over the countertop or bake station and allows some stability as well as portability.I have also noted this peeler/corer will do a very nice job on cutting home fries without having to mess up the food processor.All-in-all, a fun gadget."},{"rating":"1","title":"Apple Peeler","review":"It arrived with no handle.

He would love to wait for his apple to eat. He is now in school and still tells his mother about this 'thing' that did his apples. I am now about to purchase one for him. Thank you for creating such a wonderful and helpful product. Don't ever stop making them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it in the long run","review":"When I first recieved this apple peeler, I loved it. It peeled and cored apples in no time..making easy work out of pies and any dish calling for sliced apples. Well..after a few mos of use, it now stinks. It pulverizes my apples, no matter how firm. It doesn't finish coring them..instead it breaks it into pieces..leaving half a core. My opinion is..this works great if you only use it maybe once every two mos. With more use, it starts to fail. Mine is useless now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I wanted","review":"I was very dissapointed in the international apple peeler.. It was very cheeply made and deffinately did not work well.

Who's idea was this???\\" I also furthermore agree with others who say that there are some songs on here that shouldn't be at all.In summary, as a fan of Black Sabbath, and a fan of hard rock and heavy metal in general, I feel that such a travesty of an edit of Iron Man alone is enough to bring this down to 1 star by itself, and is an insult to classic metal as a whole.

Well, I guess Ms. Osbourne is just putting this \\"money maker\\" out in time for that Rock & Roll Hall Of Fame ritual.Honestly, far too many important songs are missing, you'd be better off buying the \\"Symptom of the Universe\\" two disc set from a few years back.

Sure, it has a lot of great songs on it, but why in the hell would you butcher one of the greatest songs ever? Iron Man was the first Sabbath song I ever heard. In my opinion, it is possibly their best tune, and it is DESTROYED on this album. -WHAT THE !@$#? There are also a few songs that should not be on this album and a few that aren't, but should be. If you're just a casual Sabbath fan and don't mind the butcher getting a hold of Iron Man, this would not be a bad album for you. If you are a serious Sabbath fan, or you want to hear their music in its glorious entirety, I would suggest We Sold Our Soul For Rock N Roll (GREAT ALBUM)!!!I have also seen good reviews for Symptom Of The Universe, but I haven't heard that album yet.

I used them as office speakers for a long time and they did the job well. They were replaced by a pair of vintage ADS L10's, and the M50's now serve as rear channels in the living room, where they are probably overkill for the job, but blend in very nicely with their great sound.While I would not personally purchase speakers on the basis of looks, I can especially recommend these if you're looking for good sound in a well-designed and stylish package.

While in prison his wife marries an endearing Forest Ranger and squanders hundreds of millions of dollars on frivolous pursuits. Upon release he lives with his daughter who runs a Women's Employment Agency and rooms with a lesbian gym teacher.Now it would seem impossible to let this story line jump the shark but with bad writing, directing and editing the impossible happens.

The unlikely romance between Spacey's character and a much younger (and much better looking) \\"lesbian\\" stretches credulity. But I still enjoyed this movie.

We resorted to pulling out the dough, rolling it out, and cutting it by hand on the last use, and that even didn't work right. My advice is to stay far-away from the pasta maker, as the construction is flimsy/weak, its very difficult to clean, and unless you have more luck that us, you won't get it to produce pasta.

Dan Duryea, who usually had a supporting role as a sinister villian, gets top billing this time & really plays a sympathetic character who just wants to know who killed his wife. Add great support from Peter Lorre & June Vincent & you've got a very entertaining murder mystery. The plot is never terribly exciting but there's a great twist at the end that makes it well worth watching. For film noir buffs I recommend adding this gem to your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Memories of Legion Stadium of the 50's","review":"As someone who will soon turn 60 years old, I can totally relate to this CD.

One day a wizard barges in & demands a particular sword form his mother. But to Daystar's surprise his mother melts the wizard & the next morning she sends Daystar with the sword into the Enchanted Forest & tells him not to come back until he knows why he had to leave. And here the adventure begins where he meets a talking lizard, a fire witch a dragon & much more.I highly recommend this book because it's so much fun & full of adventure.

The group meets many exciting challenges, new people, and difficulties along the way.The message to the readers in this story is to always stick to your friends. They will always be there in time of need.Patricia C. Wrede, the author of \\"Talking to Dragons\\", did a fantastic job on different personalities of different characters.

Cimorene is now living at the edge of the Enchanted Forest. When Daystar turns sixteen Cimorene sends him into the Enchanted Forest with his father's sword without telling why. Daystar runs into many new and old aquantencis. Shiara, who is a fire witch, is the really funny part of the twist. She is very quick temperd and does not enjoy being polite, which is very important in the Encahnted forest because rudeness to anything, even to a bush can be dangerous. Daystar run into more people including: Morwen, Telimain, and a stupid, overdramatic, princess. I agreed with one of the reviewers about Daystars affection toward Shiara almost didn't exist. I guess Cimorene was assuming Daystar was in love with Shiara from the story when she was a stone.

That could explain some of the discrepancies between this story and the ones that \\"precede\\" it. If it is the same, Patricia Wrede has done a great job of weaving it into the rest of the series. In fact, it's because I enjoyed this book so much that I read the others.

Wrede takes us through yet another jaunt in the Enchanted Forest- this time through the adventures of her main character's son.

A great read, all in all, and I must say, I liked the way it closed the series together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wanting more!!!","review":"I loved the series. I've read in through several times and everytime I've enjoyed it. My only dissapointment is that I want more. I don't want it to be over, I want to see what happens to Shiara when she's training to be a fire-witch, the king of the dragon's princess and future Queen of the enchanted forest. I want to see what Daystar makes of everything. His father didn't know a whole lot about his magic and the enchanted forest what will Daystar learn as he's stumbling his way through without having the advange of growing up there and having his father teach him everything? How will Cimorene get everything running smoothly again in the enchanted forest now that it's been without a king and queen for so long? My only real dissapointment is that she ended the series before I felt that I knew the whole story. It just kind of stopped and left me longing for more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantasy novel for All Readers","review":"If you have ever read any of Patricia Wrede's books, you will know what an excellent fantasy writer she is.

Everyone who read it loved it.If you like any books with talking Dragons, read this. Only, don't forget the other books in the series. This is the fourth and final in a quartet of fun!Tell me if you liked it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck!","review":"This book is a muddled mess compared to the other books of it's series. I loved them! But this book is very confusing, not to mention pointless. Daystar leaves his house and blunders about the enchanted forest like a fool without knowing what he's doing. He is involved in a few confusing incidents, and you have no clue wether the outcome is good or bad. Besides, it is missing my favorite characters. I would have liked to see more of Cimorene, Telemain, and Morwen's cats.

Put the inner lid over the basket, then the locking cover. That's is. No waiting for water to boil, no oil or salt to add, just remove the lid lift the basket, your automatic strainer, and serve. Microwave a mug of sauce, and you're done. Easiest cleanup.There's also the option to steam vegetables with an insert, and of course, rice.

Shipping was fast since I'm a Prime member. Box appeared in decent shape. After opening the box, I took out the machine & the plastic lid had scratches on it. I then looked at the top surface of the machine & there were water stains. The blade had some kind of blemishes on it like it was put through a dishwasher & it damaged the surface. Also in the crevice of the blade there was either rust or food residue. I didn't notice until later there were two types of tape on it. This appears to me as either an open box or returned used item that I received. I wouldn't have cared but the description stated the machine was new. No way it was new based on the condition of the mixing blade. I returned the item & placed another order.

Any ice/water w/ fruit or juice concoction has nothing close to the cosistency of an icee or gelato, not even close. No matter what method or mixture, it is always slush - about the same as a $30 blender?? Ice cream? Again, any combination of heavy cream, ingredient ratio, etc., etc., has a horribly waxy stick to the roof of your mouth feel and taste. Called the manufacturer several times and tried their suggestions - to no avail. One rep. stated not to use heavy whipping cream. Well, where in the world can I find regular non-whipped? Nowhere in this city and I live in one of the top ten in the US. Would that really help? Not sure. Every other sugestion has not worked. And yes, it cools and freezes just fine.If anyone truly understands what I'm speaking about and has any proven suggestions, please share!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tastes like store bought ice cream","review":"I had wanted an ice cream maker that makes ice cream like Italian gelato. However, after trying different recipes out, I was disappointed with the machine as I find that there is too much air incorporated into the finished product. It doesn't really taste any different than mass produced, inexpensive supermarket ice cream. I anticipated a product that tasted better than my 20 year old generic machine I purchased in a hardware store. I called the manufacturer and asked a few questions and I was treated very rudely and given explanations that didn't make sense. That is when I decided to return the machine for fear of having problems with the manufacturer in case any problems should arise with the machine in the future.

I also wanted to make good gelato since I can't go to Italy all the time. I had first bought the Lussino 4080 by Musso. It was terrible. Too soft right out of the machine and full of ice crystals when put in the freezer for any amount of time. It didn't get firm, it became a rock. I returned it and got the Lello Gelato Pro instead. It is quieter, has a washable bowl, costs about half the money, weighs much less and makes 2 quarts rather than 1&1/2 quarts. There is no contest.

Clean-up is inconvenient & may be messy. The stirring stem gets in the way of removing your finished product (worse if you're making a sorbet than if you're making ice cream, because of the greater liquidity). The plastic spoon they supply may be useful for removing ice cream, but doesn't work for softer deserts, which just roll off the spoon. I use a small soup ladle, which is tedious.

You don't have to mess with salt or ice or putting a bowl in the freezer. Also, the Musso creates a nice, creamy consistency. I've even tried skim milk, sugar, salt, vanilla and a little chocolate. I was suprised that even with skim milk the ice-cream had a nice texture and was creamy. It was delicious!I used to think it was a pain to clean and wanted removable bowls. I had already came up with a design to modify the unit. That was until I read the directions and added a 1/2 cup or so of warm water and let it run for a couple of minutes. The clean-up is really easy. Actually it's a preferable design since you never have to replace any seals or complete any other maintenance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent. Note that cleanup is easy.","review":"I have had this machine for about 2 years, and it is excellent and very reliable. The reviews here are quite accurate. One note ... It is very easy to clean ... The easiest technique is to use paper towels, which takes about 2 minutes total. (1) Remove most of the ice cream with a spoon, and let the machine bowl warm up a little. (2) Wipe out the bowl with 2 paper towels, after 3-4 rounds of wiping, the bowl will be spotless.

And there it was all done (even cleanup) in 60 minutes including learning how to use the machine. Absolutely delicious ice cream like I remembered from our recent trip to Rome. Now I can always have my favourite frozen desserts. The accompanying booklet even suggests taking a commercial low fat yogurt and just pouring it in. This disputes the need to having to always make a custard base. Not true for this beauty!

Make it cheap as possible to increase profits and hope it lasts a few months.I was ready to go back to the manual type I grew up with and figured after making them for so many decades, they must have it perfected. Nope. The first pencil I tried to sharpen came out with a lopsided tip. Wood on one side extending almost to the tip. I thought maybe the pencil was off center so used a hand held sharpener.

Additionally, at least one screw hole is partially blocked by the sharpener when you go to screw it in, meaning it helps to have a jointed bit holder.Once mounted, it works ok.

My sharpener is mounted directly on an exposed 2x4 in my workshop and the screws seem fine so far (yes, they are a little small). Last but not least, it puts a sharp point on my pencils!

While sharpening a standard #2 pencil the handle is difficult to turn, and a young child may have trouble grasping the pencil tight enough to keep it from turning.

If you do the logical thing and rotate it so the dust collector is vertical, the mounting flanges bend.That means you can't rotate the dust collector 90 degrees if you elect to mount the sharpener on the wall. Yes, it works but as soon as you remove the dust bin to empty it, you'll have sawdust on the floor.

It is possible to use this sharpener to sharpen on center but you have to really work at it and often waste inches of pencil trying again and again. It shouldn't be this hard to use a sharpener.I recommend that you find an alternative sharpener."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same story, different sharpener","review":"I purchased this item for my stepdaughter's new \\"learning room\\". My wife calls it a playroom, but we agreed that more learning and less playing should take place in it. Anyways, this sharpener looks great and it is exactly what I wanted in that department. Heck, from a functional standpoint it even feels great to use...right up until you slide your pencil out to discover the freshly sharpened tip is only HALF lead. Just as many of the other reviewers have mentioned, the alignment must be off resulting in a very frustrating writing utensil. I've pushed in different directions trying to get a good result with limited success. Even if I had success applying x amount of pressure in some direction y degrees, do I really expect our 6-year-old learner to replicate the process each time. For now I will continue to tinker with it in hopes of a better performing sharpener."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't get this one!","review":"If you want pencils with lop-sided points that are ground to a nub then this is your model. I returned mine. After 3 tries, I found the one I had been looking for: the Bostitch \\"Antimicrobial!\\" It works perfectly. Save yourself some disappointments and get the Bostitch. A bit more expensive but worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well, does the job!","review":"I mounted this to the wall in my basement & my son uses it daily to sharpen his pencils for homework. It does the job nicely. I recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"4 Stars for this piece of junk? I think not!","review":"I agree with the last reviewer. Cover doesn't line up right resulting in unevenly sharpened pencils. Piece of junk! I am so tired of playing with it, came on to Amazon today so I could order something else. Saw this one near top of the results and am now all riled up. I'm sure I bought it because of the 4 stars. Buyer beware!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sometimes old-fashion is better","review":"This pencil sharpener just works, which is more than I can say for most of the electric pencil sharpeners I have bought that cost more than this traditional design. While the quality of the materials is not quite what similar sharpeners were made of 20 years ago, it still works very well."},{"rating":"1","title":"X Acto pencil sharpener","review":"Overall, this pencil sharpener looks great and is high quality. But, that is as far as it goes; the cutters are so course and very sharp that they tend to grab and turn the pencil instead of cutting it. If you hold the pencil tight, it will cut and sharpen the pencil but usually not at the right angle. It tends to pull the pencil to the side so the point doesn't hit the stop and it just keeps sharpening. The older manual sharpeners would only rarely offset the cut, so something isn't designed as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Xacto pencil shapener","review":"This is a totally inferior product not worth any price due to poor quality construction.I remember growing up with a product similar in design though it had the BOSTON name in days gone by.This xacto is a poor poor imitation made of cheap pot metal that will fail with only moderate use.Avoid this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"sharpens crooked...!","review":"I needed a sharpener at home for my kids and the various sizes of pencils they use. This thing is good in theory, but poor in practice. Every single pencil that is sharpened in this machine comes out with one side sharpened, one side pointed wood. A big disappointment. I paid more for mine than here on Amazon.I also tried battery operated kind made by the same company...not enough power. Now I am looking at the grand daddy of pencil sharpeners...electric! I think I will skip the X acto brand though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Good","review":"Hi This pencil sharpener works good, but is not as well made as the really old ones. The metal is thinner and it's not as good quality as the one I had as a child. It is, however, reasonable for today's workmanship."},{"rating":"2","title":"works great","review":"A lot of folks saying this sharpens only one side. Did you folks never run into this at school? Twist the pencil as you sharpen and it won't happen. Sharpening one side is common on this style sharpener. Twisting the pencil allows the teeth to cut evenly all the way around the tip."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so \\"sharp\\"","review":"I thought this was going to be a good sharpener, but it doesnt matter what pencil I use, it just does not sharpen well at all. I'm about to pitch it in the trash. Only one side of the pencil sharpens while the wood remains on the other half, making it impossible to write with. It's junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"pencil sharpener","review":"i bought this because the other sharpeners dont leave a point it worked ok but know it only wants to sharpen on one side and yes ive tried different pencils"},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy somewhere else","review":"It's a pencil sharper with few moving parts, so it works well. Good product. But the store that sells it charges an enormous shipping fee ($7.50) that is more than twice the cost of the product! What, was it shipped from the North Pole? Buy elsewhere and save yourself some dough."},{"rating":"2","title":"good sharpener","review":"i give it a four star because its not the top. but a good one for the price, it will do the job for you.i also cannot tell you too much because i only used it maybe twice."},{"rating":"1","title":"desk-mount does not mean suction","review":"I was under the impression that, like most desk-mount sharpeners, this one had a vacuum/suction mount (little lever to make it stick to the desktop). This one is screw-mount only. Now I've got to find a place in my house that I feel like drilling holes for a pencil sharpener. Not happy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sharpener","review":"We've been using this for about 6 months and so far it's fine. I'm a bit old fashioned and wanted one of the traditional sharpeners to have for our homeschool room and this one does the job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoyed","review":"While I usually really like Amazon, I am severly annoyed with this product and the customer service department in India or where ever it is. I needed a return address for the Return Dept. because there wasn't one provided in the return process online. After two different, lengthy, chats with customer service I was finally told that I needed no address because UPS would have a pre-printed label; which was basically my original question. It took 45 minutes to figure that out by the NASA thinktank. Other than that, the sharpener worked twice before one of the two blades quit working. Awesome..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was excited to buy an oldschool type pencil sharpener for our home, but have been very disappointed in this product. It simply does not sharpen well. The pencil either comes out not sharpened, or slightly mangled, sometimes both."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good metal sharpener","review":"Got this for X-Mas, and it seems to be good quality. All metal beats plastic any day. Can mount to a desk, although I haven't done that yet.Possible cons are the screws....they seem quite small and may not hold with kids/abuse.I didn't realize this was a desk mount only. I should have got the vaccuum mount for wall.I still recommend it based on its apparent durability."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully written","review":"Though others may say this book was just \\"another\\" book with the same old story line, I found it to be so wonderfully written and rich in detail and imagery that I truly felt that I was THERE and participating in parts of this book. I am and always have been a reader of many different genres but this book truly touched me in the wisdom that the author was hoping to pass onto his readers (I would think anyways). I am going to pick this book as our book clubs next book as I want to share it with others. Enjoy the book and the insights in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't like it","review":"Very small book and very simple decorations. The best pictures are the ones on the cover. Do not recommend it at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flawed","review":"I bought this book for my husband, a high school baseball coach, as a Christmas present. He has ALWAYS had a strong bunting game, so I though that maybe this book would give him some extra tips on how to maybe explain something in a different way or some drills he could run. He calls himself a student of the game, always looking for new things to add to his bag. Well, he was very excited when he got it, however he told me a few days later that after getting into it and reading it he wasn't so impressed. I don't understand a lot of his baseball talk, but from what I made out of it, he felt that the bunting technique that was being taught was old school and flawed."},{"rating":"1","title":"PC on the Missouri","review":"I can hardly think of a book that has been more disappointing than this one. Expecting to read a scholarly analysis of the Lewis and Clark expedition, I read instead a nit-picking critique of words used in the explorers' journals. One chapter entitled \\"Hunting\\" barely recognized that these men had to shoot animals to live in its fevered attack on the fact that the explorers and their men actually shot animals. The reek of political correctness overwhelms this book. Certainly Lewis and Clark were human and not saints as they traversed the continent, but the conclusion one would draw from Slaughter's book is that Lewis and Clark (and Columbus and James Cook along the way) never did anything right. A sadly deficient work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Creative pseudo-history","review":"Slaughter's book is, by far, one of the least enjoyable and befuddling 'history' books that I have ever read. The book is not a historical hack-job, for Slaughter knows his subject and has created a well-documented and researched work. The problem, though, is his flagrant revisionist bias, barely concealed throughout the book both in tone and content. I would strongly recommend more straightforward history tomes rather than this speculative retelling that places Slaughter in the shoes of Lewis & Clark... as though he knew their very thoughts. In fact, only Lews & Clark were themselves, and knew their thoughts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deconstructing Lewis And Clark","review":"If you think Lewis and Clark would have been better off on a voyage of discovery via peyote buttons, to their inner selves in the Mandan spirit world, rather than heading for the Pacific Ocean, this is the book for you.If you think they were just racist, sexist, homophobic, Christian, Euro-centric males out to take credit for the discoveries of the minority groups they were exploiting, you've hit the mother lode here.If you are searching for an example of the sorry state of American history as it is presented in academia (the author is a professor at Notre Dame), you need look no further.Some might call it an embarassing attempt to cash it on the popularity of Ambrose's UNDAUNTED COURAGE. Others might call it a pathetic attempt to exploit that book's popularity. I find both viewpoints to be useful -- EXPLORING LEWIS AND CLARK is embarassing AND pathetic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jealous Cry Baby","review":"Author is a jealous cry baby. I guess he upset that L&C went on one of the last great adventures and he didn't get to go along. Don't waste your money. You will soon find this book in the \\"8 for a dollar\\" bin at your local book exchange. I think I might send this one back to the author, I sure don't have any extra room on my shelves for garbage like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kids Love It","review":"I teach dance classes for kids ages 8-11, and they love this CD.

I made this purchase for my seven year old grandaughter and she and her friends have been enjoying singing and dancing to the catchy tunes. The music in this CD is like the music their parents listened to back in the days of \\"Grease\\".

Great music, appropriate lyrics...good buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Even Better than the Original","review":"The songs on this CD are even better than the original High School Musical CD. There is a wide variety of music from the dance numbers like 'I don't dance',and 'Work it out', to the over-the-top songs such as Sharpay's 'Fabulous'. It includes some romantic songs such as 'Everyday' and a song where Troy realises he needs to make some changes in his life shown in the song 'Bet on it'. The songs certainly tell a story and make you want to see the movie. Great entertainment for kids and parents will enjoy this CD also."},{"rating":"2","title":"4 Star review for a 2.5 star movie","review":"Well, like many other 42 year old men, I counted down the days until....well, scratch that. I know this movie is favored by young kids, mostly girls, per chance. Don't know why I love this franchise so much! The first movie and soundtrack was awesome!The music here is very good. Professional and exciting to listen to. The songs are very thematic. Much more than the first one, by the way. Every scene was set up for music, you could tell.I recommend this CD if you liked the first movie and music!Good job!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even close to \\"Fabulous\\"","review":"Although much, MCUH better than the first movie this movie and soundtrack was much more mature and the movie actually was okay. The main parts of the soundtrack are as horrible as the first however for this soundtrack a few songs caught my attention.Fabulous was a catchy, hilarious song that I quite enjoyed.I Don't Dance was a good song as well because Ryan(Lucas Grabeel) sang it.You Are The Music In Me sung by Sharpay(Ashley Tisdale) was also amusing in multiple ways.However the rest of the album such as Work It Out and Bet On It were horrible and had idiotic lyrics like the first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh Please","review":"give me a break high school musical has always sucked but when the second one came out me and my friends had a good laugh i mean seriously the second one was worse than the first. i didnt even think it was possible.

I use the Parker 51 that my parents gave me for Christmas in 1964 for writing notes, more or less daily, but I am probably on my 4th bottle of Parker Quink over a period of more than 40 years.I give two stars for the attractive color of the ink."},{"rating":"2","title":"A unique Pathway to a deeper relationship to our God","review":"It is a refreshing and wonderful guide on using creative art to enter into a deep inner space where one can relate gently and peacefully with our God.

Her biggest virtue was having a rather prominent unibrow, and while her screechy voice and inability to act were well matched by the cheap Universal movies in which she starred.Her few years of popularity are a mystery to me....Universal video has assembled a bunch of her films in this DVD collection in ratty transfers and a shoddy package. Her bevy of fans (all three dozen of them) may eat this up, but as the Amazon sales ranking suggests, this release will probably not have a follow-up.Deanna is forgotten, and bless her heart, let her stay that way!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Yours to Hold !","review":"Hey folks! ....if you take a look at Amazon's U.K. page, you will see that a fabulous 19 DVD set of Deanna's movies has just been released here.That's almost all of her movies in one set.

This is nice since my daughter can not sit for long periods yet without support. She likes the animal print. I hook one of her toys to the loops on the inside so she has something to play with while I am grocery shopping. I would say the only down fall is how large it is when all wrapped up.

I was very pleased how easy it is to just put the cover on the cart and how easy it is to clean. The colors are really nice and colorful. I love the idea that you can attach toys on to it. It sure is a great idea to keep my grandson from getting germs from the cart, when the little ones love to touch all around them. I exspecially love the way it is so soft all around him. No more cold hard metal pieces for the baby to lean on. The delivery and packaging was great. What a wonderful gift it made. It is made very sturdy. I think everyone that has babies, children should own one of these. You can't go wrong on the price. It is really a great price for this buggy bagg cover. I would highly recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeps germs away from my daughter & me.","review":"I love it! Great way to keep my daughter from touching/chewing the cart and me from having to touch the cart handle. There are loops to attach toys and 2 side pockets to hold small items. I find the material thickness to be perfectly fine, I mean come on this isnt a carseat it's fabric meant to be a barrier between baby & cart. If it were padded or had an organizer in the back it would be too bulky & take up cart space. The only reason I didnt give it 5 stars is because the safety belt is too long & it isnt attached to the product which means it will most likely get lost (Mine did) Overall great product & makes an excellent babyshower gift."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best cart cover ever","review":"I love this Buggybagg shopping cart cover.

You have to cut your potatoes down to about a 2x2x3 square to even fit it in the cutting area.Then to cut a potato of that size, you have to exert some pressure, usually after about 5 or 6 potatoes, you will bend the braces on the side and it'll never cut right again, and even prior to bending, it never completely pushed the fries all the way through the blades anywayAnd if the potatoes are not completely firm, it just turns them into one big pile of mush.If you actually like making fries, spend the money and get a good quality one that isn't half plastic/aluminium.

Now I am not sure what makes this cutter international or progressive, but it does cut. The size of the unit is somewhat smaller than I would have preferred which results in somewhat smaller fries. However, the cutter performs the task fairly well. Although the grip is made for one hand, be prepared to have your other hand close to give it a err...hand. Quite a bit of force is required to complete the cutting task. Not so much that you need heavy machinery, but enough that I was surprised.For an intermittent tool in your kitchen arsenal that costs under $10, I say this cutter is a good buy. Happy cutting!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Greatly Disappointed -- A $$$ waste","review":"I just used this for the first time tonight and was quite disappointed. I have not yet tried the large size cutter but the regular-sized cutting blade simply did not work. It was a struggle between me and the potato-cutter. I was pushing so hard, with the potato still not being cut by the blades, that I could actually see the outer portion of the handle bending. I doubt it will be long before it breaks completely. When I finally managed to force (not \\"push\\" but \\"force\\") the potato through the blade, it would jump the cutter across the counter due to the pressure I had to use, then, of course, it was only halfway through the potato.

The unit does not come with a shoestring cutter.

Often, I had to push the handle so hard that the arms bent but did not break. This was due to resistance from the potato. Sometimes with that much pressure, the rubber vacuum foot would give way resulting in the cutter flying across my kitchen counter.Tonight, all of the above happened and when I finally pushed through the last part of the potato, I noticed something odd about the metal cutting piece. One of the horizontal cutting blades had separated from the rest of the grid.Perhaps this would work better with small and older/softer potatoes.

Easy to clean and saves alot of time without taking up alot of space in your cupboards."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gets the job done","review":"Gets the job done. however, wish the blade went farther back, have to use small potatoes. And perhaps maybe an all stainless steel one the plastic feels weak. Other then that you get what you pay for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be careful when using","review":"While this fry cutter definitely works, it is VERY VERY hard to operate since the sliding mechanism/torque is not long enough to make the cutting action easy to do. My husband and I had to try several different methods (including using both arms and my chin to bear down on the handle) before we could cut potatoes with any frequency. Even then, I'm scared to use it b/c it takes so much power to cut! I'd stick to knife-cutting if you can."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Item","review":"This little french fry cutter is the easiest thing to use. The best thing is, is goes in the diswasher for easy cleaning."},{"rating":"2","title":"french fry cutter","review":"Good product, excellent at cutting french frys as long as potatoes are not to big. Very easy to clean and store."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun snack plate","review":"We use this snack plate with the 17 oz soup bowl (cereal bowl in our house) and the coffee mugs for snacks and desserts. It's a fun presentation.In 3 years, not one of these pieces (from our entire set) has ever broken, and they are great in the dishwasher. They're sturdy but not clunky, and the pattern has some fun pieces, such as this one and the 17 oz soup bowl with the two little \\"lips\\" (tiny handles?) on the sides."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING","review":"Had to return this item 4 times due to screen misalignment issues. It would stay in a loop at the align screen option. I am on my fifth 5555 and it finally works without a hitch!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible customer service. Unreliable device!","review":"Pros: The product is great when it works. It has all the awesome functionsw that you can find in a little device like this. It is very user friendly and when you purchase a SD card, you can store music, pictures, and other files that you could use. Not only that, the GPS system works quite well (again, when it works...)Cons: The device failed within a 2 week period. I send it in for \\"review\\". Came back with a bill for over $300 and said that I dropped the device. Unbelieveable, I did not drop the device, the connector to recharge/sync stopped working. Well...dealing with their customer service was like hell. I would highly recommend that you STAY AWAY from this product unless you can are technically familiar with these devices. Otherwise don't expect much help from the customer service."},{"rating":"1","title":"HP IPAQ 5555 Lacks Service and Support","review":"HP engineers developed an acceptable product in the IPAQ 5500 series handheld computers. It has many features and capability for many add on features. This is all overshadowed by the lack of customer support. The devices also have a serious reliability ans survivability problem. One drop and your system is out of alignment and you quickly find yourself bogged down in HPs customer support system. They seem to have contracted out customer support to a company in another country and the folks you talk to have no expertice or interest in customer service. If you pursue the issue up the corporate complaint system, it only gets worse. This could be a good product, but with a serious lack of customer support and a very fragile product, you would do well to look elsewhere. If I ever get mine back from IPAQ repair, it will go up for sale and I will look at the new Toshiba handhelds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great features, HORRIBLE reliability","review":"I am currently waiting for my second ipaq to be repaired, I just sent it in to HP. THe first was DOA, this one died within 6 months of getting it. When it works, and dosent need to be reset it is a great product, but generally I have to reset the device at least once a day and I am curious how often I will have to replace the unit all together."},{"rating":"1","title":"ABSOLUTE JUNK!!","review":"This product has nothing but problems. Faulty battery.... Pour technical support. Limited warranty of only 90 days for software (beware this is a mayor problem), and 6 months for hardware. I spend 2 hours with a technitian somewhere in India, and not only did I loose all of my data, but now the handheld does not ever turn on. Now I have to send the handheld for service and after it is return try again to resolve the connectivity problems that I was having. Do your self a favor DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"I just purchased the IP Ipaq 5555 Pocket PC. It is an EXCELLENT tool to have. Very easy to learn... the next best thing to having a laptop, only easier to bring along with you. The memory and speed of this is far greater then any other handheld I have experienced. Thanks HP for another great product... now to find more accessories for it! :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"You can get a better paperweight for this price...","review":"I bought this new and had to return it to the store after it started crashing... like my previous 3835 iPaq (purchase price ...) (would crash once every two times used) and Jornada (purchase price ...) (would crash all the time) both of which died almost exactly after one year of purchase. When I owned these I had to re-enter all my contacts and addresses more than I can remember...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Pocket PC","review":"When I was first looking around for a new PDA, I looked at the HP 5555, and was turned off because of the price. But after much reasearch I decied to go ahead and buy it. Let me tell you I dont regret my purchase one bit. I have never had any problems with it thus far (had it for about a month). I love the fingerprint secuity, and all the built in goodies. The wireless internet is wonderful, I can connect to the internet at home, work, or even Starbucks. Its great for anyone who needs a powerful handheld. For me it has been a blessing at work, I can keep track of all my contacts, and sync it with my e-mail at work. I would recommend this Pocket PC, to anyone who needs a powerful handheld."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreliable","review":"This must be the most frustrating device it has ever been my misfortune to own! With some regularity, and with no apparent reason, it resets itself to factory settings. I spend more time restoring and reinstalling than I actually spend productively.At least 5-6 times per day, I have to do a soft reset because the thing locks up. Half the time it won't connect or sync either via USB or wireless.I've had the iPAQ for a year now, and am just getting ready to do a complete reinstall. Once again, it reset itself. Two weeks ago, same thing. This is the last time, however, there is a hammer in the iPAQ's future. I mean it.Afterthought: who ever heard of a device that can't be turned off? What numbskull designed a computer that loses everything if it loses power? Duh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally for MAC","review":"This Pocket PC is wonderful. All of the features work well. Especially appreciated is the handwriting recognition - it simply works pretty well - the processor is strong enough so you do not have to struggle with recognition. It takes a bit of getting use to - but once done it is very handy - especially for someone who does not like a lot of paper - keep your thoughts, notes, etc electronic. The recognition software is an update to the Newton - which many Mac users loved but which Apple dropped but with a lot more processing power. If you buy this and are a Mac devotee - I would also recommend PocketMac Pro - which is a Mac front end - including a look and feel of OSX - now you do not have to sacrifice synchronization or OSX."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Design - Great Ideas","review":"Well, you have to give credit to HP. If this product worked as advertised, it would be great. The problem that has plagued HP since the 3000 series started is the battery. It isn't replaceable by any part that you can get your hands on, and it has a shelf life of about 1.5 years. If that is the longest you intend to keep this product, then I strongly endorse this model. It is stellar, and several of the other reviewers have made great points. However, beware of out of warranty time. Our company made the mistake of buying several, and they started dropping like flies shortly after the 12th month. The model I have for my personal use died after 16 months, and I was told that it would be [money amount]for the repairs plus [money amount]for a year of extended warranty."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of time","review":"Total and complete data failure (and will not restore even after a full backup) 6 X in the last four months.

I never had a problem with quality from Amazon before but this was definitely the exception. I knew it was plastic when I ordered it. When it came it looked like it was discolored. It also had yellow glue in the seams. This was the first time I returned something because of quality.

I finally found time to pick up reading for more than 10 minutes at a time and pulled this one off of my shelf. Boy am I glad that I did...it's just such a fun read. I was hooked from the moment I opened it and didn't lose that until I read the last word. I was telling a friend that it was one of the hottest books I've read in a really long time. If you have a special someone...prepare them ahead of reading this book because they will want some advance warning of what it could do to you. I enjoyed the kind of woman that Reese is and the kind of man she makes Derek be when they are together. It's a great beach, plane, and anywhere read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!","review":"I hated this book. It took all I had to finish it. When I started out I thought, well maybe it's one of those that just takes a bit to get into....by the time I was half way thru I realized it was not going to get any better. The plot was so thin & it was in no way funny. I never actually got a feel of the characters - like they were real or had real feelings - I could not relate to them. Now the only reason I gave it 2 stars was because the sex scenes were good & plentiful - infact that was the only thing that made the book interesting. And now that I think about it, it was like a porn: no storyline, plot sucks, fake characters, but lots of sex. I do not recommend this book....unless you wanna waste your time. Man, I wasted my money.....I wonder if I can get it back....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved this book","review":"Two people. Two worlds.

Erin McCarthy is an auto buy for me and she will be for you too once you read this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Erin McCarthy book.","review":"I've read a lot of Erin McCarthy's books and this one is by far the worst. The characters know each other for all of two seconds before they start going at it like animals. That is something that normally wouldn't bother me but neither one of them showed a single endearing quality that should make either one of them WANT to sleep with the other one. I got about a quarter of the way through the book before I had to stop reading it. All I heard was WHINE WHINE WHINE WHINE WHINE! Shut up already! No one cares! The plot is weak and almost an afterthought- something that was only written in to keep the story going while the two main characters have sex. I'm definitely upset that I spent the money on this one despite the negative reviews I read."},{"rating":"1","title":"SSSOOO BAD!!!","review":"This book is terrible!! I threw it away and I never do that but this book only deserves the trash bin. I liked Ms. McCarthy's other books but this one had no plot at all and did not make me care about any of the characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Puerile Read by Ms. McCarthy","review":"I was really hoping that SMART MOUTH would be better than MOUTH TO MOUTH (my first Erin McCarthy novel). Surprise, surprise...it didn't take me long to see that I would be disappointed--AGAIN! I didn't even get pass Chapter 2 without rolling my eyes at the heroine's silly antics. I found Reese even more obnoxious than Laurel (the female protagonist of MOUTH TO MOUTH). She's a snotty character: selfish, arrogant, annoying, and yes...bitchy. I wouldn't have had the patience that Derek (our hero) so amazingly bestowed upon her. Thus said, this is definitely going to be my last Erin McCarthy read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Porn with witty dialogue","review":"This book is basically porn with witty dialogue. I can't believe someone actually publishes this kind of stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Match!","review":"Serious Journalist wannabe Reese Hampton and FBI agent Derek Knight are a sizzling couple in the making. This is my first Erin McCarthy book. I was very impressed with her witty dialogue, steamy encounters and the emotional weight between the characters.Both Reese and Knight come with some baggage. Reese was raised without a mother (who died when she was very young) by her father and four older brothers. She is looking to take control of her previously male dominated life and to be taken seriously in her journalistic pursuits. She portrays herself as not looking for a commitment. Knight is ten years older (age 36), divorced, does not get along well with his boss and is leading a lonely life while trying to hold his career together. Reese brings laughter (and great sex) to his life, but at the same time poses a challenge and threat to his current FBI investigation of price fixing among pharmaceutical companies. Their romance is heartfelt and passionate in between their sassy repartee!"},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE VENDOR","review":"Ordered this as an x-mas gift.
