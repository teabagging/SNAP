What bothered me is that the author manages to make CSS look horribly complicated, when the fact is, the authors of CSS never intended it to be so. A book of this sort should start by trying to show how to use CSS in a practical, simple way, to gain the reader's trust that this technology is not off the deep end. Instead, Eric seems to spend most of his effort and time explaining \\"what can go wrong\\", which demonstrates his own knowledge of CSS but does little to transfer that knowledge to us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a book for beginners","review":"I had to buy this book for an Intro to Web Design class and many of my classmates and I agreed that this is not an easy book to follow.

When describing some CSS feature, usually first a brief (incomplete) definition is given, and then the feature is further explained by giving examples. Working your way through the examples, and combining remarks spread out over several pages, you usually find that not all aspects of the feature are covered.

This goes true in the various browser interpretations of the CSS language and the different behaiviors each presents.This is where CSS: The Definitive Guide should have stepped in to fill that void. There should be browser compatability charts showing quirks mode, standards mode, and all the different behaiviors of IE 4/5/6, Opera, Netscape, Firefox, etc.Authoritative?

With the vast majority of the world using IE, all too often you'll spend time reading a section and trying to understand it only to find at the end of the section a blurb \\"This feature is not supported in any version of IE\\". The first time it was aggravating, by the fourth or fifth time I began to wonder why the book wasn't structured so that readers could be made aware in advance of theoretical features not yet supported. For the most part I'd have skipped past and saved time.There are simply not enough examples in the book and many of the ones that exist are confusing. I can't quite explain it, I just found the book aggravating.

With only a couple of months use, it's too early to report on durability. However, the alternative was the Ryobi (at HomeDepot) -a good looking unit, priced less than this, but with NO batteries. AH, that's the rub, the battery and charger are more than the cost of the B&D; broom, charger, and battery.So, if you're looking for a lightweight broom (not the power of a corded or gasoline blower, but my wife is happy), this is probably the best way to go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I expected to get.","review":"I found that this blower does just as advertised, it's a broom and that is what I wanted.

The battery lasts for the work needed done, which I use for two yards on one battery. The battery will give you plenty of life if charged up just before use. I plug it in the night before and leave it until the next morning. Have also used the same battery with the weed trimmer and then put it in the blower.If you want to blow a large amount of leaves into a pile and expect it to act like a motor driven blower, then you will be disapointed, but if you just want to clean up the grass clippings without carrying around the heavy motor driven blower, this little blower does the job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great buy!","review":"I bought this to clear the small patio at my mom's apartment.

It is a great replacement for a broom however and for that it works great.We have a 50 foot porch which is always in need of a sweep after even a light wind. Needles, leaves, pieces of cones always seem to make their way, it is a constant battle. Using a broom takes too much time to do everyday as is taking the time to get out the cord and electric blower which is overkill. This little blower works perfectly. So easy to use I just grab it and flip the switch. I can have the porch clean in about a minute. Works well for the patio and garage too. As a bonus I was recently surprised to find it worked well blowing the needles off our roof, another issue we have to deal with every summer.I have a couple of batteries. I always leave one in the charger, the batteries last a bit longer when I do.If you have a lot of sweeping to do this is a great tool!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hope you like sweeping","review":"This device is perfect for people who love charging batteries and love manually sweeping stuff with an old-fashioned, human-powered broom. Because you'll end up doing both quite a bit if you buy this device.I wanted to love this device and have lots of other decent black and decker 18v stuff (I like their weed-whacker). But this thing is so frustrating because the blower is not strong enough and only lasts 2.5 minutes.Mine came with two batteries. Each battery, fully charged, lasts about 2-3 minutes. It's kind of surreal. Even if the batteries kept up, this broom is not strong enough to blow piles of leaves off my driveway and deck. I still have to break out the regular broom and sweep.I have a small deck (<75square feet) and can't even use this to blow off a few leaves.That being said, my kids love blowing it at each other and since the blowing power is so weak I don't have to worry about them harming each other."},{"rating":"2","title":"Garage never looked cleaner","review":"I have a garage below street level and all the leafs from the street blow into my garage.

After the initial charge of 8 hours, I was fired up and ready to use my new cleaning toy. When it started to die after 10 minutes of use, I called the B&D customer service line and the rep told me (somewhat sheepishly) that the factory spec is 12 minutes of battery life when fully charged. Obviously B&D doesn't advertise this niggardly amount, but they don't hide it either. Ergo, caveat emptor. 3 hours of charging for 10 minutes of full usage is highly vexing, mostly because it's a great product when it's in use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great light-weight blower","review":"Great for what is made to do.

In the past, after mowing I would drag out a broom to sweep and clean up the sidewalk. It also serves to clean off grass and leaves from my mower...again I had used a broom on that too. I keep the batteries at the ready and so far haven't needed both during one session, but like knowing I have a back up. It has really been a big help."},{"rating":"2","title":"More Than What I Expected","review":"I was a little skeptical when I put this on my wishlist.

The blower is not heavy at all, even with the battery. It's \\"blowing power\\" is very adequate. I had a great time shooting all the acorns out of the cracks in the driveway that I could never get with a broom. The on/off switch is also located in a very convenient place. You can easily turn it off or on with the same hand that you are holding the blower with. The best part, for myself, is that I have multiple Black & Decker cordless devices (hence multiple batteries). Even though I have this flexibility, it is not ultimately necessary. Once fully charged, one battery did my front sidewalk, driveway, and halfway through the back patio. This is a great device. If you have already invested in B&D, this would be a great purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cordless Broom Review","review":"I purchased this item for use on my back patio and walkway, as well as my driveway. Although the battery seems to run out rather quickly (15 mins), having the extra battery makes it worth getting. The total runn ing time of 30-35 mins is enough to clean the whole area without any problem. My wife says its the best item I've purchased in a long while. We both highly recommend it to save time over using a traditional broom, and it is very lightweight and easy to operate."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's OK","review":"It's OK. It does a good job for small areas. The air stream is not as strong as my electric cord blower, but is OK for porches and decks. Fortunately, there are two battery packs, so one is being charged while using the other. This is important as one charge doesn't last long. All in all, the convenience of no cords to mess with makes this a good buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"good for what I bought it for","review":"I didn't want a corded blower because I have a 5 acre lot and a gas one is too noisy (I have a old gas weedeater) so I bought this one at Lowe's. They had a special where you get a free extra battery ($39 retail). I already have the 18V weed eater so now I have four batteries and two chargers which keeps me in power as needed. This blower isn't as robust as a gas or corded one but it did well getting the pine needles off the deck and driveway. I'm hoping it's strong enough to blow the needles out of my gutter but I've not climbed up there yet to give it a try.Overall I'm pleased with this product because having read the reviews I knew it wasn't as strong as the others but it does the job just fine for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short Battery Life . . .

Still, it is powerful enough to blow grass clippings and lighter debris. Not sure yet how it will perform with piles of leaves in the fall. The convenience of not having to drag out the extension cord is a plus for me. I have other Black & Decker cordless appliances and always have a battery charged and ready to go."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesnt last long","review":"B&D should really be honest about the charge times. As many have said, the plug free is convenient. But I just picked up a gas powered one for an extra 50 bucks, and its like a new lease on life. This machine has about 10-15 of really strong blowing. After that, it wanes down to a soft blow in about 5 minutes. With all the hassle of having to remember to plug in the batteries (which die out over time), I am glad I picked up the gas one. I guess for a sidewalk cleaning or walkway it would be nice instead of having to do the daily sweep. But instead, go and try a gas powered one and you will be shocked at the difference. This one is pretty light, another pro."},{"rating":"2","title":"great for light blowing tasks","review":"I live on the Palouse of the Pacific Northwest and it is very dusty year round. Have purchased this to clean my deck, driveway, garage and porch(without wasting water spraying the dirt off the hardscapes). It is light and easy to swing with one hand. I love the B&D 18volt tools.

You can buy a new unit with battery and charger for $68, but the charger and battery are $35 separately, so it's like if you buy a battery, they throw in a new blower.Not very eco-green as now we'll have old batteries to get rid of, and 2 blowers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Quick Clean-up","review":"This product is perfect for frequent light \\"sweeping\\".

According to the instructions, the battery will not \\"over charge\\", so when I'm not using the blower I leave the batter in the charger so it is always ready. I had been using a much larger,heavier, and noisier corded blower (which would still be better for blowing leaves on the lawn) but it is such a pain to mess around with a cord long enough to do reach all areas.

I have one at the house and one at the office. It is perfect for blowing off the sidewalks on a daily or weekly basis. It is not for blowing leaves out of the yard. I get about 10-15 minutes runtime on mine at a decent velocity. After 5-10 minutes you will start to notice the blower loosing a little steam. But as long as you are using this to replace a hand broom you will love it. This is not a serious yard tool, just a handy way to keep tidy.

No more dragging around heavy extension cords and getting tangled up in them. My size and age don't permit my use of the heavy duty gas powered equipment, so B&D solved that issue for me. Wish they would come out with a cordless hedge trimmer and edger. I have this blower and the cordless weed wacker, two things I have to do with every mowing, so it has cut my yard work time considerably. My neighbors have caught on too.

I will grant it is a benefit that the 18 volt has a removable battery so I can change batteries when one runs down but even when the battery is fresh, it does not blow as hard as the old model.

It will sweep your porch or sidewalk with ease. I can do my porch sidewalk and front driveway in about 5 minutes.

This fine product moves the debris without launching it everywhere. As far as being a leaf blower, it is not, but for the purpose it is intended, it cannot be beat. I highly recommend it. It fact it was the first product in their 18V system in which the same battery will work in many different items.

This doesn't mean that this is a bad book by any means, but it definately does NOT live up to the purpose of Complete Idiots Guide series- you must have some previous experience or outside help to learn to knit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Photograph problem","review":"There are no photographs of the projects in this book! It would be much easier, especially for beginners, to know what the hat they're knitting should look like when it's finished. There is a photograph of beautiful knitted mittens on the book cover, but the book doesn't contain any mitten patterns. Go figure. I wouldn't recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"This helped me","review":"I learned to knit and crochet a little bit when I was a kid but I could never muster more than a single chain. I decided to get this book a few months ago and see what I could learn from it with my tiny bit of background supporting me. It worked! I have gotten through all of the knitting chapters and I have knitted four scarves. This is beyond my expectations, believe me. When the weather turns colder again, I will attempt something more challenging; mittens, perhaps, or a hat.I'm not sure how well this book would serve someone who had never knitted ot crocheted before at all. Remembering how the needles felt in my hand as a kid was probably a big help.I like the way the book is organized. I found it easy to follow and the writing is friendly. The drawings are helpful. I'm looking forward to getting through the crocheting chapters!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book will make you feel like an idiot","review":"I got this book hoping that I could teach myself how to knit. However, the illustrations did not provide enough consistent information for this visual learner, and I found myself constantly stuck and had to ask around for help to finish the most basic steps. The book provides a decent overview on knitting basics (e.g., needles, gauge), but does not include enough information for completely idiotic knitters (like myself) to get ourselves out of a pile of knots. You can get the same amount of information in this book, with the same illustrations, on the Internet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incomplete Reference","review":"I bought this book early in my knitting career and find it to be occasionally helpful. It's good with some knitting basics, but the two patterns I tried really weren't that cool. I completed them and they look okay, but I'd never want to wear them. To expand my yarn obsession (I guess) I used the book to learn to crochet. Some of the diagrams were helpful, but in the end this book didn't help me get the hang of it at all. There are some interesting tip boxes, and some good background, but overall I bet there's a better \\"basics\\" book out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete Idiot, indeed.","review":"I'm hardly stupid, but I just did NOT understand the instructions at all. This book may be for idiots, but it also made me feel like one.This book seemed to over-simplify steps to the point that I found them complicated, and spent more time second-guessing myself (and cussing out the book) than I did any knitting. The illustrations are very unhelpful--photographs would have been much better.I had previously used a much thinner, much easier to follow book with photos that I got at a craft store some years ago. I will be looking for that book again, and using it before I ever touch this book again. What a waste of time.I didn't even look at the crochet part. I'll just ask my mom how to do that, before I look to this book for any more answers.I'm just glad I got this from my library, and didn't waste actual cash buying this useless thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crochet and knitters dream","review":"An excellent overview of both knitting and crochet for all levels. I love the international comparisons for both stitches, methods and hooks/needles. A top class reference book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good refresher book -- not for brand new beginenrs","review":"When I started knitting, I took lessons and still found it very challenging, so the thought of learning how to knit from a book seems very strange to me. However, after just one in-person knitting lesson, I do use this book quite a bit as a reference. I often refer to this book when I haven't knitted for a while and have forgotten how to increase or bind-off. I do think the projects are quite good for beginners, though, and plan to knit the scarf next. I also plan to use the book to re-learn crochet, which I learned when I was small. I think the book will rekindle my memory quite nicely.If you are brand new to knitting, here's my advice: find a knitting store, or a little old lady, and have them teach you. You will learn more from them than a book. Plus, when you are doing things incorrectly, they can point that out -- which a book can never do. Then get this book to help you when your teacher is not around and you get stuck."},{"rating":"1","title":"dissapointing","review":"I bought this book to further my crochet skills. Most of the stitches I looked for had useless pictures or were not even listed. Also in the back of the book there are listed various knitting publications- but not ONE for crochet. The way the book is done it seems that the crochet was a tack on at the end with not a lot of thought. There are more than a couple knit projects in here but only one or two for crochet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ummm...HELP!","review":"Knitting and Crocheting are things I have always wanted to learn. So I picked up this book in hopes I could learn the techniques. I followed all the directions but never knew if I was doing the stitches right.(I haven't gotten past the knitting part) The illustration showed how to do everything, but it never shows the finished stitch. I'm still stuck on casting on cause I don't know whether or not I'm doing it right. I think if I could get past this I would enjoy this book more. Has great tips and what you need to begin. Just can't get over the fact that it never show the finished look of something."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read this book - but talk to someone who knows how too.","review":"I think this is a great book - but I did not think so until I actually sat down with someone who knows how to knit and got the basics. I have since lent this book to a friend who crochets and because of her previous knowledge as well, she finds this book very helpful. As a complete idiot though, I found this book a little confusing. I mean, it is straight forward enough but for whatever...reason, I could not get off the first row until I got some real life assistance! Definitely a great book to accompany a class though!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Any other knitting book better than this one","review":"I was very disappointed in this book. No photos, few illustrations (and poor ones at that), and not a great bibliography. I would say that any leaflet you could get at a craft shop would be better, or print stuff from the 'net. Even better, go to the library and check out what's there.Don't waste your your money on this book. You'll be an idiot, that's for sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't even make my first stich!","review":"I was so excited about getting this book and ran out immediately upon receiving it to buy my yarn and crochet hooks. Since this book is aimed at complete novices, I was sure I'd be doing basic stiches in no time.Instead, I spent an hour trying to make my first chain stich -- and I never managed to do it! The pictures are confusion and unclear. They leave out complete steps and are totally inaccurate in some instances. If I can't even do the first stich, how helpful is this book going to be when I try anything harder?A complete waste of money. To add to it, there appears to be no way to contact the authors or the publicsher to express my frustration to. The web page listed on the book had no contact information and didn't even list this book title. The people at MacMillian publishing were no more helpful -- they had no email or phone number for me to call."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice features, but lasted only a couple hours.","review":"Used once to trim 6 round hedges. Gears broke through side of plastic housing. It's all jammed up now, and no doubt has a shredded gearbox. I tried cutting about three 3/4\\" branches with it. It's not really up to that task. In fact, it's no longer up to any task. As others allude, the switch is very cumbersome to use -- a poor design. The pivot worked easily, and was handy while the unit was working. Life = 2 hours. A major disappointment.

Don't even think about trying to use it on a normal sized hedge. You also expend so much energy holding the power trigger on, which effort is responsible for you breaking out in a heavy sweat.

They seem to have geared this trimmer towards trying to protect people who would hurt themselves with a product that would actually do the job right. There are so many safety features that you could probably give this to pre-schoolers and let them go to town without any worries. Unfortunately, if you're actually looking to trim your hedges you will definitely be disappointed. Be prepared to make many passes to get a neat cut and have soar fingers from having to constantly hold down the lame safety feature to keep the blades going. Then be ready for certain features to quit working and make your job even more difficult. My advice- buy a Stihl- their products rock and are made to get the job done (unfortunately not available at Lowes or Home Depot). The hedge hog serves no useful purpose."},{"rating":"1","title":"didnt last very long","review":"I trim 10 bushes twice a year. It worked great, but on year 5 the gears stripped out.

Lucy's story unfolds in an unsual way with only bits and pieces revealed as she weaves together her past and the present. I found the occasional third person reference disturbing at first but realized it helped explain Lucy as a person. She really did not know her Japanese lover or even herself that well. One has the sense that by the end of the story she understands herself better but we, the reader are left with many unanswered questions. Overall it was a very well-written, often poetic book.

The remastering that's been done with the Bernstein/NYPO recording, however, does not make it sound even remotely as good as the Kondrashin recording. It may have been nearly thirty years since Decca made this recording, but it still sounds great today and it's a better combination of performance and recording technology than you will find anywhere else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Offensive to True Christians","review":"This book is an imitation of Souljah's \\"Coldest Winter Ever.\\" The author has highly offended me by blasphemying the name of Jesus Christ by putting Him in the same category as a \\"pimp.\\" It's written in narratives with little dialogue. \\"Whoa unto those who bring offenses.\\" If Monique Morris didn't blasphemy, I would've given this a higher rating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too Beautiful","review":"This book is an instant classic.

In the book there is a crazy twist on how he makes his decision on the path of life he choose for himself.

I have tried to buy all the used copies I can find for our school library here in Rwanda!This book is about an aunt who is savvy and quirky without ever verging even slightly on being silly: she is a resilient woman who we have to respect even when we don't like her...but then, maybe we do like her... The two very engaging and real kids who are kidnapped by her must make a monumental choice, and Clements makes you wonder: what would I choose if I were them?

Janet Howell is a complete and utter snob - how could she be such a witch when criticising Jessica's outfit, and it was so low what she did - wearing the same outfit she had dissed on Jessica!

I would have liked to see a split screen with your time and heart rate at the same time instead of having to swap between the two.

Then the watch would go blank lines which told me that it was, again, losing contact with the unit. When it did this 3 to 4 times in 5 minutes, I decided that it had to go back.Very disappointed in this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heart Rate Monitor","review":"I've used monitors for over five years.

The numbers are large, which is good for my 52 year-old eyes. The alert tones are easy to hear and decipher.Then why am I disappointed?When the alert is on, my brand new TImex Personal Trainer locks on the out-of-range BPM. For example, my 70-80% range is 126-144 BPM. If I go to 146 BPM, the alert correctly turns on. But no matter how slow I run, or walk or even stop exercising, 146 BPM continues to display and the alert continues to sound. The same happens if I go below my target and try to speed up.The only way to coax some sense into the Personal Trainer is to shut off the alert by pressing the On/Off key, at which point the Personal Trainer displays the correct, and variable, heart rate.It is possible that this is a software glitch unique to my unit, but it is nevertheless irksome."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not For Women","review":"This a good heart rate monitor.

I asked the trainers what sender they're using and they all use Polar because it sends out a much stronger signal and won't be compromised by other senders in the area...this Timex is just too weak to compete with other heart rate transmitters to be used in a gym environment...

One minute it would say my heart rate was 43 beats per minute, then it would jump up to 190+ beats per minute... even though I was working out at a steady pace. I spent countless hours trying to figure out what I was doing wrong. I replaced the battery. I returned it to Timex for repairs twice. The S&H costs alone for the repairs are a big % of what I spent on the watch in the first place. It still doesn't work. Lots of time and money down the drain. Then I borrowed a different HRM. It works like a charm every time. Turns out I wasn't doing anything wrong besides buying a piece of junk. Timex USED TO BE a respected brand name and make good products. Live and learn.

My friend & I worked out togther and her Timex said she had burned 4x as many calories as my heart rate monitor reported. I wish I could burn almost 900 calories in a 45 minute easy jog/walk.

Fortunately I found a good balance with the Timex T5G971. The watch does a great job and is very accurate. I also found the price fair. The directions and setup was easy to follow and not over complicated. Finally with the option of being able to change out the battery yourself is a very important factor that is not available for many other watches but is available for this model.

The first one lasted about a year before the strap stopped sending my heart rate to the watch (I changed the batteries and everything). I figured that I would buy another one because the first one lasted a year, and hopefully the second would be better...I was wrong. I've had this second one since May and it now only accurately keeps my HR for about a half hour, then it goes to about 30-50bpm and nothing else until I use it a couple days later."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch still working, chest strap unit died quickly","review":"Started out using this quite a bit but before long I started having trouble with it not communicating with the watch. Put a new battery in the chest strap and it seemed to help for awhile but pretty soon it was not working consistently again, threw it in a drawer. Ran across it again and put another battery in to see if it would by chance work but no such luck, dead. I mostly take walks so don't work out at all intensely so this unit really didn't see any tough usage. Lasted about two months reliably. Save your money and try something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"I JUST LOVE IT","review":"This is a great device. It works perfectly. It measures your heart rate all the time along the workout and when you've finished, you can review your average HR, your peak HR, the amount of calories burned, and even how long have you been working in zone (between the upper and lower target zone limits you set). And finally you can also measure your recovery HR.It's been a great help for my workouts. Now I am more motivated.Totally satisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"ALL AROUND 5 STARS","review":"This heart rate monitor tells the time and date, is a stopwatch, a one-minute recovery function, counts your calories burned during a workout and has alarms to keep you in the Heart Rate Zone you want to be in (fat burning / cardio / etc).

If something happens to the strap or it stops working, I'll be sure to edit my review, but for now - the price is right and the product is solid.It does not have GPS.It is important to read the instructions to understand all of the functions of the watch.CONS:Does not work while swimming - it kept trying to tell me that my HR was 38 after 4 laps at the pool.

About six week after I received my order my heart rate began to fluctuate erratically. I knew that the heart rate monitor was malfunctioning and tried all remedies suggested in the manual, including buying three new batteries. Nothing worked.

My biggest problem is that the start/stop workout button is on top of the watch face. If I'm wearing a tighter fitting running jacket and gloves the pressure from them turns off my workout so I lose all of my data. It also doesn't have a stopwatch (up or down counting) which I was almost positive I saw in the watch description when I purchased it."},{"rating":"2","title":"great for it's price!","review":"It takes a couple of times to get used to getting a reading from the chest strap to the watch.

I have never formally \\"trained\\" before, so this is my first HRM. Had it for 2 months now and I love it. I've had no problems with signal. I particularly like the warning beep if you get out of your preset zone. Also replaceable battery (many of the other monitors out there do not have replaceable battery which seems ridiculous to me).

I would recommend this HR monitor watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Would be a 5 if it had a Pedometer & Better strap closure","review":"Fortunately I read prior reviews and knew about the hook problem on the strap. I can see how it could rip easily if you are not careful when putting on the strap. It is comfortable, except when driving to the gym.

I had to get online to figure out some things, but for the most part it was easy enough. I'm not too sure on how long it will last, it SEEMS like it should last a while, but who knows. I don't really like the screen, but I'll have to adjust as time goes on.I'm giving this a 4 out of 5 right now, since so far it does what it says it will do.

Works great with the receivers in stationary bikes, treadmills and stationary rowing machine. The chest strap works reliably even without application of electrolyte gel or water. However, I just apply some minimal water on the chest strap before wearing. I also use the target heart rate zone and recovery features. It also helps in giving you the approximate calories burned during your activity and shows average and maximum heart rates. Needless to say that it can also act as a watch. I specially love the Indiglo (backlight) option to read the display when I am running outdoors early morning or late evening. The battery can be replaced by user. This is a great product for the given price. I would definitely recommend buying this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works well for a month or two","review":"I bought two of these heart rate monitors in early June.

On cold days, I wear gloves that come up high and can muffle the watch.Then, again, maybe the battery is now weak. A Liquid Crystal Display is more tolerant of a low battery than an analogue \\"beeping sound\\".Here's a little trick.

A huge disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Calorie counter is inaccurate","review":"I purchased this product around four weeks ago. The instructions on its use were a little convoluted but I managed to figure them out. The heart rate monitor and alarms work fine, but the calorie counter is miscalibrated. I noticed this when I tracked average calorie count for activities at my weight vs that reported on the watch. I then compared the monitor watch with a monitor on my treadmill. Rate and time were spot on, calorie count was far too high. I called Timex and they were very nice and promply sent me an exchange watch which they said that they had tested...it did the same thing.I lost faith in trying for another return and recalibrated the watch myself by inputing my weight minus 60 lbs. I came up with that approximation by trial and error. Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this product.Signed,Nolan Jones"},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch froze during HR monitoring","review":"I purchased this watch on Amazon. I was used but \\"new condition\\". I should have know better... It froze while monitoring heart rate. It happened repeatedly. I contacted Timex support and they told me how to perform a hard reset on this watch (press and hold all buttons at the same time). Performing the hard reset did \\"unfreeze\\" the watch without me having to remove the batteries to do it, but Timex said it needed to be sent back to the factory for repair. I've used Garmin watches for running for years with no problems. It's too bad. This experience will probably make me stay away from Timex in the future. Of course, as I mentioned, the watch was in used condition, so my guess is it was a return that someone picked up, changed batteries, and resold without really knowing what the problem was. However, it still was a lemon for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work for me.","review":"Despite many reviews touting how well this heart rate monitor functions, I could not get it to work for me. The first time I tried it, the monitor was able to find my heart rate but it was far lower than what was possible. After that, I was never able to make a connection between the chest strap and the watch despite trying multiple positions and re-wetting it constantly.

I had a Polar F4 that was nothing but trouble. It never read my heart rate properly and a half hour of INTENSE (85% max heart rate) cardio would give me a calorie burn reading of about 115 calories. The Timex is far more comfortable to wear. The chest strap stays in place. It's consistent, it doesn't just stop reading my heart rate for no reason. Easy to program, easy to read the results, and perfect for what I wanted - a heart rate monitor that told me how many calories I burned! Also the watch band is very soft, comfortable, and stays closed. If you want something simple (no bells and whistles) and reliable, without breaking the budget, this is the right product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Value for the cost","review":"I purchased this through Amazon.com for about $40. By far the best price on any similar item I could find. I've had a Polar chest strap that is compatible with most high end exercise machines but wanted a personal monitor and couldn't find a matching watch for less than around $80. The heart monitor on the Timex works great. I've had it about 4 months now without any problems. It was fairly easy to follow the directions for programming the watch to include my age, weight, etc. for personalized calorie counting and the watch function is good too. The negatives: The buttons are easy to use but feel a little cheap, wonder how long they'll last. It doesn't have a stopwatch feature. The excess strap doesn't stay put very well and ends up flapping around very often. All things considered, very happy with the purchase. Would've liked a higher quality product with more features (stopwatch), but for the price, very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"just right","review":"bought this to replace a Polar HRM and it worked as advertised.

It took several minutes to start and when it did, my heart rate was all over the place. It never came near the heart rate shown on some of the workout machines at the fitness cetre. The chest strap fasteners were also found to be very flimsy and I could see it breaking down after a short period of time. For these resons I return my purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for P90X","review":"I bought this for P90X. It does exactly what I want it to do. It is very simple to set up. You can plug in your zone and it will tell you if you are too high or low. If you want, you can set an alarm sound to notify you if you are out of your zone. It also measures calories you have burned. I know there are better hrm out there but for what I do, it's perfect. The chest strap does need water on the sensor at first to be able to read your heart rate but once you are sweating and working out, it works fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice product","review":"Timex seems like an old time company but this product shows how they are really up with the times these days. This will give you a nice baseline to start to measure progress and changes by, but keep in mind that thier can be a lag and it is not necessarily real time reporting. Works wonderfully to give you a resting heart rate but is VERY sensitive to your body's movement and readings will jump all over the place.Considering, what you pay for this, I think it is a good value and very reasonably priced. I would recommend it to anyone who works out and just wants to keep it more interesting while exercising."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Product","review":"This product does what it needs to do.... good functions for price... gives you average heart rate during workout, max heart rate during workout, time you worked out, and some other functions. Good product for price... The only cons I would say are that sometimes the monitor acts funny and doesnt read the heart rate correctly, but does not do it often. Overall I would give this product a 7.5/10. A good basic heart rate monitor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good","review":"The watch seems to be accurate as far as heart rate goes, but the calorie counter is definitely quite a bit higher than what I think is actual calorie burn. It does make you feel like you did a great workout, but you have to remember you can't go eat a big bowl of ice cream afterward because you probably didn't burn THAT much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heart monitor did not work","review":"The battery in the chest strap was dead, so I bought a new one ($5!), but it was still inoperative.

The HR monitor would never work she would have to stop what she was doing and it would take a minute or so to get a reading it would go from 60bpm while she is perfoming an aerobic activity to like 170 or there wouldnt even be a reading...it was so frustrating.

It worked for just 6 months and then went crazy. I thought it just needed a new battery and had that changed. It still didn't work so I just assume it is broken. I read the reviewer who said Timex wanted shipping plus a fee to repair and return. I can probably get a new watch for the same amount plus hassle factor. I will just buy another watch but you can bet it WON'T be Timex. To end on a semi-positive note, the unit did function perfectly until it quit! I love the aspect of the monitor to rate my workouts and track them. I will buy another monitor, just not Timex."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value of money","review":"I purchased this monitor after spending a significant amount of time of on-line research and professional advice from health experts and sales reps. However, it took me a while to realize that I don't really need all the bells and whistles that come with more expensive alternatives. I was very much inclined to buy a Polar FT7. Finally, I purchased this one because of its better design and manufacturing quality. So far it has been doing what it is supposed to do without any hitch after four weeks of use. No regret yet!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped working after 3 months","review":"This product worked fine for several months, but then started giving erratic readings. I changed the batteries, but could not get the monitor to pickup my heart rate. The watch kept time, but could not detect heart rate, having done so fine for the first few months. It is still within warranty; however, I can't seem to find a way to return it to Amazon (the seller) and Timex.com won't accept warranty returns unless purchased through their site. I'm guessing the seal on the chest band must not be great and that perspiration got into the battery housing - just a guess though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look else where","review":"So the reviews I read where hit and miss on this Item. I only bought it because timex is usually a good brand and this was in my price range at the time. I've only been using this item for a few months and now it doens't work. the on/off button stopped turning it off then it quite working all together. What I can tell from the warrenty information this won't be covered because I'm sure they will say it was from wear and tear on the thing. Honestly it should have lasted longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lasted only 6 months","review":"I bought this HRM to replace a New Balance model that I had for over 2 Years. The band had broke. When I got the Timex one it was easy to set up and I liked the features very much. Tracking my workouts was easy and I really liked it better than the previous one however, this week it stopped working. It will not pick up the heart rate. The watch works and all the other features work. I replaced the battery in the strap twice just to be sure it wasn't the battery and it's still not working. I plan to send it in under the warranty but have to pay $7 fee plus shipping and it will take 4-6 weeks. Really annoying after just leass than 6 months of use. I will have to be without one to track my workouts till it comes back. This is the biggest inconvinenece even more than expense. If you are looking for a HRM I would pass on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"good watch","review":"Good watch/monitor. the chest strap hooks seem weak so I leave them hooked and place the strap on over my head. some treadmills pick up the signal and will display the heart rate. The weak link in this product is the chest strap hooks. If they break the chest strap is useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for","review":"My wife bought this for me as a gift. It worked great for about 6 months, then stopped working. It has worked only intermittently since then. I've replaced the battery in the chest strap and the wrist monitor. I was about to buy a new one last week, tried this out one last time, and it worked, but only while I was sitting at the computer. I tried it again tonight for my workout and it would not sync up. I popped the battery out of the chest strap and re-adjusted the battery, but it did not work.Also, one strap of the wrist band popped off. We took it to a watch repair shop and they were unable to get the wrist band back on. This is due to the poor design of the pin holes for the watch strap.So, I have a monitor that I can't wear on my wrist and the chest band won't sync back to the monitor. It was great for 6 months, but was made to break too soon. I'm going to buy another heart monitor, but not this brand. You may have better luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"An HRM with usless extras","review":"Pros:+Cost+Accurate heart beat monitor+Works with Polar enabled Gym Equipment+User replaceable batteries+The transmitter has a low volume beep with your heart to let you know its working.Cons:-Cheaply made (other Timex watches @ $25 dollars don't feel as cheap as this one) (- 1/2 star)-Calorie Counter is not accurate and manuals don't provide the formula used by the watch so you can't adjust the watch's estimate for your personal situation.Had they published the formula, then this wouldn't be such a big deal. The watch doesn't adjust for gender (it's not an input), it is way off but itseems to adjust for weight which you supply (-2 star).-Poor documentation with watch and none on Timex web site. (- 1/2 star)Recommand?No. If you just need a heart monitor, get the T5G941, Omron 100 or Polar FS1. If you want calorie monitoring get a Polar F6, F7, FT7 or FT40. The FT series Polar watches now allow end users to replace batteries on the watch and heart monitor."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is for small people only.","review":"This product is for small to medium-sized people only.

I read the Amazon.com reviews and CR's high rating, and chose the Timex for both functionality and price ($45 on Amazon vs $70 from Timex). The watch performs as advertised. It's necessary to thoroughly wet the monitor itself before exercising and the watch reports all of the information I wanted, including a warning when heart rates fall below or go above desired levels. It also has a handy heart rate recovery feature over a one-minute period which is useful for cardio training."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timex T5G971 Heart Rate Monitor Watch","review":"I don't need all the fancy bells and whistles and this unit does a good job.

Learning that several friends had purchased and returned some of these I discovered that this Timex monitor has been used successfully. So far it has worked fine and is simple to use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't be afaid of UNISEX in the title","review":"This watch case measures 37.5 mm wide (excluding bottons), and +/- 45 mm long. I was concerned it would look too girly on my 7 3/8\\" wrist, but it wears very nicely.After owning 3 much more expensive Polar Heart rate monitors, the simplicity of the Timex is a joy. This watch is for measuring your heart rate, timing overall excersize, and your \\"IN ZONE\\". Thats it, and that is all I want it to do.The only reason I did not give this watch the score 5 of 5 is because the calories burned calculation is off. I wish I were burning 1,200 calories in 60 minutes on the treadmill! Actually I am only burning 1/2 that. My main concern is getting in the aerobic heart rate zone, and staying there, this watch fulfills that need."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I ordered this HRM about three weeks ago and have been very disappointed with the performance. The signal from the monitor to the watch has been inconsistent at best. About half of the time, I can't get the watch to detect the band, despite using water, etc. Additionally, I've seen technical difficulties on numerous occasions already (obviously not reading correctly). The HRM also grossly overestimates the number of calories burned (one of the main reasons I even bought an HRM). Save your money and put it towards a higher quality product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't have asked for anything more","review":"Great consistent tracking of my heart rate and workout stats to aid my training.

My chest sweat is all the lubrication I need lmao.(side note: I have one chest hair strand on my chest, so for the hairy chest gorillas that are worried about this monitor not working for them, don't let my review fool you. From some other reviews it seems like the hairy dudes are having trouble getting accurate readings)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Timex Heart Rate Monitor","review":"I have now used my Timex heart rate monitor for about 6 months. I chose this monitor over a similarly priced Polar model because the Timex model had a higher rating from Consumer Reports.Initially I would have rated the product very low, because it was difficult to maintain the link between the sensor and the watch. I was changing the battery every few days trying to maintain the signal connection. After several months of experimentation, I found that the problem was the way I was positioning the monitor. For me, I had to place the monitor band across my chest at an angle to get the sensor in the correct position to sense my heart beat. Even now, I sometimes have to adjust the sensor up or down on my chest in the middle of a workout to maintain the connection.After understanding the issues involved, I would rate the monitor much higher. It does provide the information that I want. I now change the sensor battery about 1X month."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for the price, but . . .","review":"While I appreciate the features offered for the excellent price, I found the caloric burn counter to be vastly overstated according to my workout intensity and length. I looked for troubleshooting advice in the instructional booklets and on Timex's website, but found no help at all. Individuals, like me, who use a heart rate monitor count on accurate feedback, so a calorie counter that says I burned 1,300 calories in a 2 hour workout span--one Spin class, and 45 minutes of lifting, plus breaks--isn't accurate, as much as I wish that it was."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"In spite of this model being top-rated by a leading consumer magazine, I've had lots of trouble with this heart rate monitor being accurate or functioning correctly.

Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stop Working","review":"I replaced the battery in the monitor, but can't get a reading on the watch. It does work with the equipment at the gym.

It accurately keeps track of your heart rate and has features like telling you how many beats per minute your heartrate comes down after working out, however the one thing I'm not happy about with this product is the feature where it tells you how many calories you burned. It drastically overestimates the amount of calories that I burn during a workout, so it's not very helpful in helping me diet but I like that I can keep track of how fit my heart is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Basic Heart Rate Monitor","review":"I have been using a Polar FS1 heart rate monitor. The battery in the strap died and I could buy this Timex for the price of replacing the strap. I just need a basic heart rate monitor. This Timex works fine. I was surprised to find that the Polar will pick up the signal from this strap so I can also continue to use it. My only complaint about the Timex is the display. The display is not as dark as the one on the Polar which makes it much harder to see. I either have to hold the monitor close or turn on the Timex's nightlight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good basic heart rate monitor","review":"I got this because I wanted to be able to monitor my heart rate as I start an exercise program. So for a beginner, it's a great tool to have, simple to use. It came with a booklet about how to determine your maximum heart rate and what the different heart rate zones were and what they meant, which was helpful.However, if you're a smaller woman, it may be too big for you. I have the chest strap set to almost the tightest it can go, as well as the watch band, and I normally wear size small or medium in women's clothing, so if you're extra small in women's clothing this may be a bit too big to fit comfortably."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bargain Heart Rate Monitor","review":"Wanted to monitor the intensity of my bike rides and did not want to spend $300-$400.

The output is: Time of exercise session, time in the selected heart rate zone, average rate, peak rate, calories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Meets our training needs","review":"My husband and I each bought monitors when we began a training program. Our only problem has been that my husband's monitor stops picking up his heart rate when he uses certain of the cardio equipment at the gym.

We think the problem may be due to the posture his body assumes on that particular piece of equipment (recumbent bicycle).

Excellent value!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really Unisex","review":"Well, I was hesitant about buying something that was Unisex and I was right. The sensor that goes around the torso doesn't fit me. I suppose I could tighten it till I can't breathe and then maybe it would read my heart rate but that isn't what I was looking for when I bought it. The sensor does work when I push it into position. If it were more flexible (the material the sensor is a part of) it might read my heart rate. So back this heart monitor will go. I will buy one specifically for women. For the record, I AM a thin person with a petite torso (although being pregnant my torso IS growing :) I didn't see a measurement that said if your torso around the sternum measures less than XX, this product is not for you. That would have been helpful."},{"rating":"1","title":"John Cameron Swazye should have tested this~!","review":"I got this form my husband.

You can return it IF it's in the original box, and.... IT HASN'T BEEN USED OR WORN. I decided not to purchase it because the seller obviously thinks no one will read the details.

The price is great, but I guess you get what you pay for. My biggest complaint is that it is very difficult to program, and the instruction book is very little help. I never did figure out some of the features. The other problem is that I don't always find it to be accurate. Typically it's in sync with the built-in heart rate monitor on the treadmill at the gym, but sometimes the rate displayed on the monitor drops so dramatically, I know it's definitely wrong. Maybe others will have better luck with this product than me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Failed immediately","review":"Within a half hour after I started my first treadmill interval with this device, the chest strap heart monitor stopped transmitting.

It worked well for about 6 weeks, then the transmitter stopped sending a signal. The \\"water proof\\" casing on the transmitter wasn't waterproof, and perspiration obviously had gotten into the battery and caused it to corrode. It failed to work when I replaced the battery, so I called Timex. They sent a replacement (about 4 weeks later). The replacement never worked. The problem is not in the watch, but in the transmitter. I know this because when the first transmitter was working, the cardio equipment on which I work out would pick up the signal from the transmitter. Timex struck out twice. Today I ordered a Polar FT1 - hope I have better luck with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ready, Set, FAIL!","review":"Can't really rate the performance of this piece because once I slapped it on my scrawny wrist, it failed.

I noticed the watch was only picking up my BPM sporadically so I thought it was the battery. Off to radio shack where they tested the battery and said it was a good battery so that wasn't the problem. Put the battery back in the sensor and now it won't work at all. Very disappointed! I was wondering why it was so cheap compared to the other watches and now I know. You get what you pay for! I will call Timex and try to get this returned.

When it did respond is was very accurate - the rate was identical to that obtained with an electronic cuff blood pressure monitor. I went to the Timex web site which was not helpful (the manual sucks). It is interesting that the 40 reviews posted on the Timex site were considerable less positive than those on the Amazon size.

I used it once and wound up returning it because of how awful and inaccurate it is!First off this is a Unisex HRM, so any calorie count that you are getting is based off a male because you cannot enter your gender into this HRM.Second, there is no way to enter your age. So you don't know if you are getting the count of a 10 yr old Male or 50 year old male.Three, you can't enter height. Someone who is shorter vs someone who is taller are going to have very different calorie burnsWhile you can enter your weight into the watch that doesn't mean a darn thing because you have none of the other info. As my mom's personal trainer said, it's like have a portable treadmill on your arm since for most treadmills that what you enter into the machine.I would caution anyone who is looking for an affordable HRM to stay far away from this one and save up for a Polar instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely disappointing product life-span of 7 months!","review":"My husband wanted me to order this product for him and he used it when he went jogging.

This product is made poorly and after reading some other reviews it seems that we are not the only family $50 poorer with a broken product. Seven months is a very short product life and this is a purchase we heavily regret. In my opinion, it is not something you \\"need\\" and with such a short life span, it is definitely a hole in your pocket you could do without."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch didn't hold up outdoors.","review":"Took it on a week long rafting trip through the Grand Canyon, and upon returning home, I realized that three of the four plastic buttons on the sides, had fallen apart and only the metal under them was OK. The watch still works, but it looks like h***, and it is now no longer usable for personal applications. I am very disappointed in this Timex product. It was supposed to be waterproof etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth the money","review":"The first thing wrong with this product was the lack of instructions. There basically was none. It did not tell you how to use the strap. The calorie count is a fraud too. I must be an amazing althlete to be able to burn 300+ calories in 15mins. A waste of money would not recomend to buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply doesn't work","review":"I was very excited to be getting my first HR monitor and based on the other reviews I had high hopes for getting a quality item. However it just does not work. I've tried different positions for the strap. I've tried changing the transmitter battery. I've tried it wet and dry. The watch will not pick up any signal until I am about 20 minutes into my run. Then the reading is not even close to accurate. It intermittently shows a ridiculously high or low reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good at tracking heart rate, not calories burned","review":"Base on my own manual testing, this did seem to track my heart rate very well. The instructions were a little daunting based on the manual supplied with the watch, but after some tinkering I figured it out pretty quickly. My only complaint about this product is in it's ability to track calories burned. I'm a big guy and expect to burn more than the average fit person but for 60 minutes of intense cardio (P90X)it calculated that I burned 1,320 calories. That would be fantastic if I could believe it. Using some various web calculators to estimate calories burned (even one that takes into account additional information such as sex and average heart rate) my highest estimate was about 740 calories. It's hard to believe that this watch is providing reliable numbers.So I'm giving it 2 stars because the calorie counting function was of particular interest to me and part of my motivation for purchasing this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I bought this product because I mainly just wanted to monitor my hear rate during workouts - ie Running, weight lifting etc. However, that is the one thing that this product did NOT do. I would start my workout and try to get the heart rate monitor to work for the first 15 minutes. Finally, it would kick in, so I would start running or doing my work out only to have it suddenly say my HR was 60BPM when I could barely breathe. I tried moving the monitor to see if I had placed it on the wrong spot. No matter where I put the monitor it probably would only actually work 10 mins out of a 60 min work out. This product was a huge disappointment. After trying to get it to work the entire time for multiple workouts with no success, I returned it. I do not recommend this product to anyone unless they don't actually want it to monitor their HR all the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked well for about 6 months.","review":"It worked fine, but then it started getting harder and harder to get a reading. Now, it doesn't pick up anything at all. I replaced the battery but no it still didn't work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreliable","review":"Bought one. A few months later, it stopped working. I returned it to Timex and they replaced it. A few months later, the replacement stopped working. I give up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay at first, but does not last","review":"I bought this HRM less than a year ago. It was my first hrm and is okay for basic functions. After some time though it only picked up my heart rate sporadically. Also, the chest strap broke, which basically makes it unusable. I was hoping this product would last at least one year, but alas it did not. Spend the extra twenty and get a polar. That is what I am getting now."},{"rating":"2","title":"works well for me!","review":"I have purchased this watch 3 times. It is simple to use and the battery is easy to change. The only problem I had was the band on the one I bought for my daughter. It started throwing irratic numbers for the heart rate, after a year or so. No reason... sometimes it was correct..sometimes not. But to replace it was worth it.All in all, a good product for the money !!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Timex Unisex heart rate monitor watch","review":"I bought this for myself a year ago. Really like it. Simple operation. Comfortable chest strap. I am slim female and the chest strap adjusts from small female to large male. I bought another heart rate monitor for my son who has a large chest and he's pleased with this product, too. Great value!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Timex heart rate watch","review":"Good watch if you are looking for a cheaper start. It works very well and is right on the money. It sinc's with the cardio machines at the gym without doing anything. You have to wear the chest ban for it to work. Wish you didn't but that's the fact. Highly recommend for those wanting to keep track of how you do."},{"rating":"1","title":"10 Day Life","review":"Stopped working after 10 days. Worked fine up until it quit during a run. Liked it when it worked. Very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Need Help with Average Heart Rate","review":"I just purchased this watch and like everything so far. I have everything set up and have worked out 5 times with it. However, the Average Heart Rate has been the same for the last 4 sessions, even thought I vary the time, distance, and intensity. This last session I actually kept to 20 minutes with several high intensity sprints, but still the average heart rate was 133. Is this a defect or it possible to keep getting the same average?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Calorie Counter","review":"Had to return it twice and eventually requested refund because calorie counter doubles calories (and did on both watches I received from Amazon). Heart rate monitor (chest strap) very accurate but it doesnt do you any good when the counter broken. I knew something was off when the watch said I burned 800 calories on an easy 3 miler.When I look at the watch on the internet, it appears others have had same problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the HRM, but don't trust the calorie counter!","review":"This is my first HRM, so I can't compare this to other products.However, I found programming the HRM as easy as programming a digital watch. During my workouts, I have not had any problems with communication between the chest strap and watch. Interestingly, the HRM stops working when I step into my car..(perhaps the radio interferes with the signal?). But whatever - don't really need to monitor my heart rate in my car anyway!The chest strap fits well, and I forget it's there (I'm a female though and used to having a bra strap...men might find the chest strap annoying I guess).The only thing I do not find useful is the calorie counter - it will say I've burned 800 calories while the treadmill says I've burned 300 (and yes - my weight was programmed into the treadmill). Otherwise, good product for a great price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product","review":"Got it as a gift after I let it be known that my Garmin 301 HRM croaked (everything else still works on it). This little unit works great and I like the fact that I can replace the batteries on the strap as well as the watch itself. The only thing is the attachment points between the elastic and hard plastic parts of the strap seem a bit cheesey (especially when compared to the Garmin strap) and I'm afraid they might break soon. Oh well, I'll be careful with it and will report back with an update soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great at first, Fails after 8 months","review":"Timex makes great sport watches. I had hopes that this heart rate monitor would also be great, and after 4 months of almost daily use I was pleased and would have given it 5 stars. Then it started acting erratic, giving occasional bad readings that increased with time until it finally became useless. The heart rate monitor part of the watch no long turns on. I tried replacing the batteries but that had no effect. It still works great as a watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not BUy","review":"This is the second Timex TSG971 I tried. The first one did not work at all. The second one only works periodically. I even tried electrode gel without success."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works very well","review":"This heart rate monitor watch has worked very well. The chest transmitter has also worked flawlessly with the heart rate monitors on the treadmills and other equipment at my health club. The only drawback is that the chest strap that came with it just barely fit at 38 inches; some people may need to order a larger size strap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Great","review":"I purchased 2 of these about 6 months ago and so far I've had no problems. It is very easy to set up and works great. I do wonder about the calorie count though. When I use it the calorie count shows different then the treadmill shows. I'm not sure what one is more accurate. The heart rate seems very close to my blood pressure/heart rate monitor. For the price it is well worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Stopwatch?","review":"I couldn't believe that this watch did not have a stopwatch. It seems to me to be a pretty standard function of a watch, even a basic one like this. The majority of people using this watch most likely want it for running, but the lack of a stopwatch to do any sort of pace work or speed work makes this only useful for people who don't care about time. If you want a stopwatch and a few more functions, without paying too much more, take a look at the Timex T5J031. It's only slightly more money, but it has many features that I would think most people would deem necessary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"Worked fine for 3 months then became very hard to get any reading and quit during the middle of work outs. Now shows heart rate of 30 on those rare occasions when it shows anything."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Display and Very Repsonsive","review":"This is my fourth HRM and by far the best. The display is big and very readable even in dim light without using the indiglo. My last two HRMs were the older model Timex Ironman 100 lappers. They became very unreliable even with new batteries. I used to have to use electrode gel just to get them to work at all. This HRM gives me an accurate reading immediately and continues to do so as my heart rate changes during my workout. It works great even without electrode gel. It doesn't have any fancy features but I don't need them. It does record your time in the zone that you can set and you average and peak heart rates. It also has a recovery time feature that measures how many BPM your HR drops in one minute. The sensor belt will also work with the HR display most treadmills and other indoor machines. This HRM has already improved my training significantly because it is so accurate and responsive. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent basic heart monitor","review":"I bought this heart rate monitor because I wanted to increase my exercise level without putting myself at risk. The unit is fairly easy to program and seems to work very well so far. (I've been using it about a month.) The strap that goes around the chest seemed a bit awkward at first, but I soon forgot about it. I especially like the fact that the unit does not have any unnecessary bells and whistles. Its \\"recall\\" funtion is particularly basic and helpful: after a workout, it scrolls through your peak heart rate, average heart rate, time elapsed, calories burned, and recovery rate. (The last is especially important.) You can obviously spend more money on a heart rate monitor, and perhaps get more features, but I've found this to be a solid and reasonably-priced performer for someone who doesn't want a lot of excess baggage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after 6 months of light use","review":"I do not use this HRM often but that didn't stop this one from breaking pretty quickly. I also find the instructions pretty poorly written and not very helpful.The real kicker is that Timex charges you $8 to repair their own faulty product while under warranty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Calorie Counter is WAAAAAAY off","review":"I bought this HRM to keep track of how many calories I was burning during my workout. I have started a new reduced calorie diet, and knowing how many cals I burn during a workout is pretty important. During a 30 minute light jog, this Timex told me I burned 700 cals. Ummm yea, I wish. If that was the case I wouldnt be on a diet!!!!!!! I made sure I set up the info correctly and gave it another try the following day. Same ridiculous amount. FYI, this kind of workout only burns 125-300 cals.If your looking for a basic HRM to track BPM, to make sure you stay in a certain zone while working out, and dont care about calorie count then this is a great affordable option. If you want to track calories burned, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great investment","review":"This heart rate monitor was on consumer reports as a best buy and I definitely agree! I have had no problems and am very happy that I bought it. My sister in law bought 4 different heart rate monitors and finally ended with this same one and is very happy. It does need to be wet on the chest strap before starting a workout. It counts calories too! And you can check the status anytime during your workout, you don't have to wait until you're finished like some others do. Highly recommend it!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Breakdown","review":"The monitor worked well for 4 weeks. Then it began defaulting to the watch mode and gave off and on heartrate readings. Within a week it stopped altogether. I replaced the battery in the sending unit but it didn't help. I will be returning it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy with purchase","review":"A heart rate monitor was recommended with the Insanity workouts my husband and I recently started. After going through the first couple of workouts, I decided it would be a good idea to use one to make sure our heart rates weren't escalating to an unhealthy level and that we were allowing our heart rates to decrease to an acceptable level during the intervals. We've found this monitor to work well and consistently. I like the workout results that are shown at the end - minutes we worked out, average heart rate, highest heart rate and calories burned. It's a great way to see how hard we worked from one day to the next."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not so accurate... but reliable.","review":"As far as I can tell on the watch and in the manual, you can only set up your target HR, not your age, sex, age, etc. This monitor is great with getting my heart rate quickly and consistently during my whole workout. The downfall is the fact that it overestimates my calorie burn by a lot. Besides that, I love it. I'm still trying to tweak it so it's more accurate. I will update the star rating if it improves!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch works fine, but monitor stopped after a few months","review":"When I first received the product it worked right out of the box and is very user friendly. However, after about 2 or 3 months the monitor stopped working. I changed the battery out with no luck. Hopefully it is covered under some type of warranty. I am very dissatisfied with this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Timex Makes A Good Watch","review":"I bought one of these monitors when the Omron HR-100C I had been using failed after 18 months. I basically relied on the Timex name and reviews of the produvt on this site. My experience was decidedly inacceptable. The Timex chest strap worked well for 30 days, after which I had to replace the battery. That was repeted two more times before the watch quit receiving data from the strap. I checked the chest strap using a new Omron watch and it continued to work for about 2 weeks, it them also went completely dead.I have gone back to the Omron product which at least worked for 18 months before. I still use the Timex as a watch only and it performs that function well. My conclusion is if all you want is a watch, get a Timex. If you want an HRM, better get something else! It may be the higher priced Timex products are more reliable, but who wants to spend that kind of money to find out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Liked it at first but it broke in 6 months","review":"I had reviewed this item favorably 6 months ago when I first purchased it, initially at 4 stars see below, and have used it 4-5 times a week. This week it is malfunctioning--doesn't register a realistic heart rate (30 bpm, I don't think so) and after receiving a signal, I can't turn it off. Plus, even after I remove the heart band and move into another room (where it shouldn't register), it still seems to register the same bpm. I'm disappointed and don't recommend. I'm trying to contact Timex since I think it's still under warranty--let's see how that works out.(This is a very basic heart monitor, but that's what I wanted. It will recall the calories burned during my workouts and my average and peak heart rate. The manual is impossible--I ended up watching a YouTube to figure out how to set my weight and maximum heart rate.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awesome - when it works","review":"This had more than what I thought I was buying.

Now I'm searching for a new SIMPLE one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great HR monitor","review":"I wear it every time I go to the gym & it's so much fun watching my heart rate while exercising. When I use the elliptical, the electric bike & the walking machine I don't have to hold the handles to send my HR readings on the screen of the machine. The belt you wear under your chest sends the signal to the gym machine & you watch your heart rate on the machine. It's great. When you wear it walking around or running outside of the gym you can watch your heart rate on the watch. I really love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inaccurate calorie burn","review":"I found the calories burned to be WAY off. I had heard that the cardio machines overestimate calories burned, so imagine my suprise when this HRM read about 100 calories over the machines, even when I only worked out for 10 minutes. I would suggest spending a little more money and getting a Polar HRM. I retured this one and got the Polar FT4 and I LOVE it. Much more accurate and comfortable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"Regardless of Timex's past history their latest products are not worth the money regardless of the amount.

Whenever I really start pushing myself and my Heart Rate starts getting into the 170+ range, this thing always starts 'freezing' up and showing a much lower heart rate. For example, I may be at 190 BPM but the watch will only show me at 40 BPM (which is below my resting heart rate) and it will stay there for 2-3 minutes before it is accurate again. I absolutely hate this product and wish I could get my $$ back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only works on some people","review":"After I first purchased this monitor it did not work so I had it exchanged with no difficulty.

I was careful to wet the electrodes and not have any thing that would interfere with the signal. It did not show that I had a pulse. I then had my son-in-law try it out. It worked fine on him!!!

It lasted about a month and quit working. They replaced it under warranty, and that one worked for a couple months until it started giving me erratic readings, which is something you don't want in a heart monitor. After an online search, I settled on this Timex due to it's cost, reputation, and serviceability (some brands have to be returned to to the manufacturer to have the battery replaced). So far I am impressed. The users manual could be a bit better, but it's not that difficult to figure out. Readings are quick and accurate. The only nit I have to pick with about it is the chest band isn't designed for large guys. I have a large chest (think of a barrel), and although the band is adjusted as long as it can go, it still has to be stretched to fit, and after a while becomes uncomfortable. It would be terrific if they made an extension for it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"love it","review":"this watch was easy to use, and I love being able to see my progress and if i need to push harder.

Ten minutes into my run it displayed my heart rate as 85...when I stopped to take it manually it was 175. Today it registered my heart rate as 45 during a circuit training session.

I sweat a LOT when I work out and I think that gets into the battery compartment of the chest strap.

About 80% of the time it would give me a heart rate that seemed accurate; 20% of the time it would go into la-la land and show either 60bpm in the middle of a hard interval or 217bpm during my cool-down. I joked to my companions that it was really a random number generator that beeps.After several sessions I determined that it occurs when (a) there are power lines within ~50 yards or (b) I had a head wind of more than 5mph.In less than a year the batteries are showing signs of wearing out, so I'm going to take the opportunity to replace this pathetic thing.

The only thing I am concerned about is the clasp on the belt. It is an unusual clip and I can see how it could be broken if you get in a hurry.

You can wear it above your belt while weight lifting and then slide it up to below your pecs when you need it.Overall, good and reliable."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far..so awesome..hope I don't jynx myself!","review":"I am going to school to become a personal trainer/Phys Ed teacher, and this was a must in my life, as I really am interested in knowing my exact zones and calories burnt, and not so much relying on cardio machines or estimates. This is my first heartrate monitor, and I must say I am very pleased with it, today I did some circuit training at the gym, being my first day using the monitor. I must say I UNDERestimated myself when it comes to calories burnt, as I was told I burnt about 500 calories in 43 minutes (thank you P90X Biceps and Back). Can't wait for the spring for some nice long outdoor runs! So far, a fantastic beginner heartrate monitor, as I went back and forth between Polar models and this one, I finally flipped a coin and this was what I went with.

I don't know what went wrong in the editing process but there are quotes where there shouldn't be, other characters talking in the same paragraph as another so it's hard to figure out who's talking, and there are no spaces separating different scenes in the book.

I enjoyed her style and loved the New Orleans setting. However, even though the story really hooked me for a while, she lost me on page 238. When the heroine kept doing careless things like entertaining a strange man and telling herself over and over again that the weird things that were clearly happening to her was all in her head (even after the cops warned her that the danger was very real), she lost me.I also felt that the heroine didn't really DO much of anything except look sexy and get victimized. I suspect the author could have dropped 50-60 pages and tightened this story up a lot.I imagine writing a book on deadline is pretty hard, so I'll take that into consideration and give Ms Jackson's next effort a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Real Page Turner","review":"This was my first book by Lisa Jackson.

The plot of this book sounded interesting, but when I started reading, I realized quickly that it was a jumbled mess of unconnected events thrown together to try to make for a story. I got about 2/3 of the way through it before throwing it away. The book is riddled with spelling errors, which I believe is because it was self-published.

Though I don't like this cycle but I found no.2 and no.9''Choral'' as extraordinary. If you want a great performance of No.9 or a great sample from Solti's catalogue, buy this one...I have some problems with this recording; some string&bass passages and horn parts are poor. But totaly, this is very good performance, especially for chorus and soloist performances and Solti's tempi. In comparison with other great performings (Furtwaengler, Klemperer, Stokowsky, Bohm, Jochum, Isserstedt, Reiner, Giulini, Fricsay, Szell, Celibidache, Kubelik, Bernstein or Karajan-62&76 / See my Beethoven list) ofcourse, this is in same first class and better than many.. On the other hand,my favorites are still Furtwaengler (1951), Klemperer (1964 and 1957) Karl Bohm (1970 and 1980), Stokowsky (1968), Isserstedt (1965), Jochum (1970's) and Giulini (1972,with LSO and 1980's, with BP)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plodding and unispired","review":"Orchestral phrasing, no less sense of arc through each movement and the larger piece, is just simply non-extant.I read the recommendations on here and bought this because I believed the chorus had nailed it.While I would agree that the recording engineers have done a good job of bringing the chorus forward, and the singers certainly place their final consonants well, no, the sopranos just don't quite make it or hold it all the way up, all the time (no slight to them, the piece is ridiculously demanding vocally).So I'm back to Karajan '77 and Rattle with the Vienna Philharmonic (notwithstanding Rattle's unfamiliar, even alien, sense of phrasing, the sopranos are outstanding)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Metallic taste","review":"After 30 days use, our coffee has taken on a metallic taste.

This week, I called each one of these stores in my city, and NONE of them have the filters! I am furious that once again I'm going to have to pay $15.00+ to get two of these filters mailed to me!

However, the shameful wastefulness of these filter pods and handles is NOT necessary. It's just a carbon filter pod, just like what is used in a Pur or Brita faucet filter. It's terrible that the replacements come with extra handles. The handles are reusable, and there is no reason to replace it. Sure, buying new filter cartridges for your faucet filter isn't the most environmentally sound, either (there should be a way to simply replace the carbon inside rather than an entire plastic cartridge), but at least you get more use out of that. Bottom line: Just use an on-tap water filter or a filter pitcher INSTEAD of these filter pods and you will get the exact same result with your coffee."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't figure out how to get the screen out of Brewmaster","review":"says it fits the Brewmasters but can't figure out how to get the screen out that covers the filter and replacement filter looks too big"},{"rating":"1","title":"does not work with my coffee maker","review":"Did not fit coffee maker as stated in manufacturers websiteEven after I called manufacturer to verify that it was for my coffee maker"},{"rating":"1","title":"RIP OFF","review":"For 12.99 you only get 2 filters and another handle (which you don't need).

I especially like 'Il Lamento di Federico', because Pavarotti succeeds extremely well in expressing Federico's extreme desire. The interpretation of 'E lucevan le Stelle' is extraordinary.

I don't always go back to fill in missing reviews, but I felt compelled to do so here because this book has stuck with me. That must say something about it.The writing wasn't the smoothest, but the romance and plot development was well done. The pacing was consistent and I couldn't put it down until I was finished. It was gritty and sexy at the same time with a decent mystery to keep you engaged.Honestly, while I forget some books as soon as I put them aside, I have often thought of this one and have continued to hope the second book in the series would become available for Kindle. I finally gave in and ordered a paperback!So- bottom line. This is worth the time since I have been looking forward to getting back into the \\"Nightcreature\\" series!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Blue Moon","review":"I really enjoyed this book, it keeps the reader on the edge of their seat with more twist and turns than a roller coaster.

This is a major must read!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved the dialog","review":"I absolutely loved the dialog in this book. The first person narration by Jessie had me laughing out loud throughout the book. Yes, there is a lot of mystery and some really scary situations but she could always insert a wisecrack or sarcastic comment and lighten the moment. My husband even asked me what I was laughing about as I read the book. These were great characters and you came to care for them. I think I'm usually pretty good at seeing twists in a story but I didn't pick up on the truly evil character until the very end. I'm going to read the other books in this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't get it","review":"I prefer werewolf books where they aren't the bad guy but don't mind a good old crazed werewolf killer book either and this really wasn't either of those. The \\"evil\\" werewolves didn't seem all that bad to me. Sure they ran around creating other werewolves which may not be nice but its not exaclty evil, for a cermony which if pulled off also didn't seem like a big deal other then everybody else eventually becoming a werewolf. I don't think they actually killed anybody in the whole book and they weren't crazed blood thirsty monsters while in wolf form either. The \\"good\\" guys however kill a bunch of people that happen to be werewolves. They never bothered to bring up what was so bad about being a werewolf. You get to live forever unless killed by silver and can turn into a wolf. Yeah that sucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not to be believed.","review":"Seriously. I love urban fantasy just as much as the next guy, but the author did nothing to illuminate any character's inner world. Each was flat as a pancake.

And even that was a little tough to swallow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jessie and Will","review":"I am not going to go into too much detail, I see this has been done already. I did not like the fact that this story was in the 1st person, I found that reading this in a 1st person did not add as much depth as I normally find in my novels. I also did not consider this a romance novel. Will and Jessie had few interactions, and what interactions they had were unstimulating. Overall I find this a disappointing read and I do not recommend. I find this more of a supernatural story than a romance novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blue Moon","review":"I really like reading this book,.

While it didn't hurt, it certainly didn't help. The first part of the book goes over what to expect during the process, methods used and such. If you are far enough in the testing to get to the oral interview than you are already familiar with the process (or you should be). As for the rest of the book's questions and proposed answers, if you want to sound like a clone then get this book but, in my opinion, it won't help you pass the test in the near future if you pay too close attention.Be original, be confident, and be honest if you are taking the oral.

No relay layout and no specific cruise control information at all - two specific points of interest for me right now. This book will walk you through general topics like timing belts, brakes, and oil changes.Where my Honda Chilton manuals were printed on newspaper thin paper to cram as much information as possible into 1 book, this one is printed on normal paper and is thinner than the Honda manuals. Book fails to address hardly any of the Cabrio specific items such as convertible top care, and top replacement.Do yourself a favor, gather your courage and money and spend the $50 or so on the Bentley manual.

The manual lacks in detail - the many sensors the car has are mentioned, but never described. There was no troubleshooting information for any of the sensors I was looking for.

Negative - the leak detection system is not mentioned in the entire manual ... (there are exactly 5 items under \\"L\\" in the master index and Leak Detection is not one of them).There is no listing of ODB fault codes and there is no (useful) trouble shooting guide.At first I thought that the manual is for the expert mechanic who just knows many of the things that the manual does not mention.

To those who do not know any better, the Marine Corps is not full of drug addicts, rapists and thugs. The fact is, in 16 years I have not met anyone that comes close to the characters you write about in this book. I feel sorry for you, since it is painfully obvious that you have some type of vandetta against the men and women who put their life on the line for you and do it happily. Yes we will continue to do so for you Ms. Stillman. Sleep tight tonight, We are on the wall.

The book had a few mistakes. Only geographical errors. This is a really great book. I blame the Marine base for Mandi's murder because Underwood was not keept on base like he was supposed to.

I would recommend this to anybody who loves reading, beautiful prose, and true stories that read like great fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sloppy","review":"This book looked interesting on the new books shelf of my local library (2 copies available). The hype on the jacket promises insight into life in the Mojave, the Marines, the lives of the unmoneyed, etc. I found no such insight. First, the multitude of geographical errors lead me to conclude the author does not care to get her facts straight; after geography is easily verifiable. [...] Thus, I suspect other details presented as facts may also be false. Second, the disjointed presentation is confusing to no good purpose. Third, the only outside research into matters other than the details of the case appear to be a few published statistics on San Bernardino County, compared to the state and nation. Ms. Stillman would have been well served to at least read a few books on each of her purported subthemes: the Marines, the Mojave, the underclass, domestic violence, why some some women always seem to get beaten."},{"rating":"1","title":"overwritten underacheiver","review":"I'm a true crime fan. I've also spent time in Twenty-Nine Palms. So I thought this one would be a sure winner. Wrong! The author obviously feels she's \\"too good\\" to tell the story in a straightforward manner. So we get page after page of how the Mojave Desert is laced with earthquake faultlines, the high desert is where Americans come to recreate themselves and other claptrap meant to lend \\"deeper meaning\\" to the events. But what has greater gravity--the author's awkward literary pretensions, or the fact that two young people were horribly murdered? In a sense, the author does the two girls a disservice by placing her own ambitions over their fate. Look to Ann Rule, Jack Olsen, etc. , for good, solid writing that allows the crime to tell the tale."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down","review":"... I am neither an acquaintance nor family member of the murder victims whose plight is recounted in Ms. Stillman's book. Nor am I a past or present resident of Twenty-nine Palms. I found this story to be engrossing with the a depth that goes well beyond a specific incident in a specific desert town. It is loaded with symbols and meaning that speak to a much broader America. That people whose lives are entwined with this story take issue with the author in their reviews is no surprise as Ms. Stillman writes with chilling candidness. As a third party reader, I found it to be a quick and exciting read and I found Ms. Stillman's writing to be very evocative especially in the way she describes the desert."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a World!!","review":"This books holds 277 pages. I lost complete interest on page 92. Before that, I started to get the understanding that EVERY male character in the book is either a drunk, a wife/child beater, and a rapist. Or even all three!!

Knowing that I know about my time in the Corps and the fellow Marines (both male and female) I have met. This fictional outlook on the people who make up the Marine Corps is biased and negative.

So I was startled to read a book that depicted all of the swirling emotions that are conflicting. John did a great job!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ten Times Better Than Any Grisham","review":"This book is ten times better than any recent John Grisham book. And twenty times better than any David Baldacci. For one thing, it has a well-thought-out plot. It has some characters with some depth. The relationship between Dismas Hardy and his wife still lacks any depth, however; she ends up being mainly an irritant as opposed to a positive element in the narrative. Still, I would recommend this book to anyone as a superior effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is my least favorite of this author's books.","review":"I started with \\"13th Juror\\" upon a recommendation from a friend. Was hooked - went back and read the prequels, have read all the sequels, and everything else this author has written. This one has been hard to get through. I hardly recognize Dismas. Graham isn't really all that likeable either. I really don't feel like I know the character. Sal is the best developed. If this is the first Lescroart you've read you may find it okay. But - go back and pick up another. This isn't his best work by a long shot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, Predictable, forced my way through it!","review":"This was my first read by this author and most likely my last.

I would recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Mercy Rule","review":"Dismas Hardy, at his best. A regular guy, working hard at his craft, to support his family. The usual Abe Glinsky, Frannie, children and cast of characters. Deep development of the victim, the accused, policemen, politicians and dysfunctional, families. Was it murder or mercy? A question, we may all, at some point, have to answer. Excellent courtroom drama."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well written.","review":"This is my first by Lescroart, and I found it to be well-written and easy to follow. The book is based on the issue of assisted suicide, and whether or not Graham Russo helped his father kill himself. The medical examiner's official standing is that it is a homicide/suicide equivocal -- which means that it could be either, there is not way to tell, and no indicators to make him lean one way or the other. This book addresses one of the medical issues that is at the forefront of today's society, but it does it in a way that is subtle and not in your face. Throughout the book, Graham Russo maintains his innocence, thus sending Hardy on a search for the truth leading him to unearth a secret almost twenty years old."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great 50's CD","review":"I grew up listening to the McGuire Sisters and I have always liked their music.

Unfortunately too many of her songs have that \\"Cole Porter\\" sound and feel. Many of her songs have the Cole Porter sound, touch, and general tune...which is quite irritating since it reminds me of the Lawrence Welk Show and Big Band Era, which I am a little tired of. Country and Big Band (Cole Porter) just don't go together. Almost all of her songs have that Cole Porter sound...which gets damn well annoying after a while. By the way, a light drum would be pretty rather than just a drab guitar. Give me a break...Claire Lynch is trying to give Cole Porter a \\"Redneck\\" sound...no way in hell that's going to work out. The songs \\"Stranger things have happened\\" is almost 100% a Cole Porter song with the Redneck voice of Claire Lynch...my goodness, this does not work out (and sounds awful).

First of all, the price is way too high for a single piece of rubber. Second of all, it's very difficult to get on and off, since it's made out of rubber and iPods are made out of metal (a lot of friction). Thirdly, it gets dirty very easily. The screen to protect the iPod's screen isn't made of plastic, but instead rubber (like the rest of the case). It picks up dust and lint very easily and sticks to the iPod's screen. I think that's supposed to be a plus (sticking to the screen), but not all of the air bubbles go away, which creates very annoying shadows on the screen of the iPod. The dust and lint also create more annoying shadows.This case is very bad. Soon, I'm getting a Contour Showcase iPod case. It looks very promising and actually worth the money, unlike this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIFIC TO YOUR IPOD","review":"This was the second case I bought. I thought it would be reliable because of the screen protection, ventalation, and silicone rubber. WOW WAS I WRONG!!! The only thing this case could possibly be used for is a duster. It is open at the top of the case so when ever you try to adjust and or take it off dust collects inside and is a pain to get out. Another complaint I have is that is scratches the screen whenever you take it off. I now have a long scratch down the front of my pod.

I am a college professor and needed something to take my class materials home to correct; even legal size papers would go in with room to spare.While well-stitched, the leather is poor as well. It's not a rich brown, but a pale brown, some orange-y brown and some yellow-y brown which make it look cheap. A leather piece should be consistently colored. The fake gold clasp and zippers further cheapen the look.So, considering it's oversized proportions and patchwork leather, I am sending it back.

No cream, No sugar.","review":"I would say that this is a pretty straight forward album. The production is good, the lyrics are good, but it sounds a lot like typical \\"Underground\\" rap album. Jagged, dissonant beats. Braggadocia. \\"I'm the baddest rapper\\" type stuff. You've heard it. I've heard it.And unfortunately in my opinion, Planet Asia's delivery is not all that unique. I always found him more appealing as an accent to others. It really is a good thing that he has guest rappers. But I have to wonder if it is because Asia, himself, knows he can't carry a whole album himself. Or even an EP for that matter.All and all, I wish I didn't sound so harsh. It is a good effort in a world of wack albums, and for those who like their hip hop pretty straight ahead (you know, the \\"true hip hop heads\\"...PLEEEASE) may love this album. But I think good is quite a distance from great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good and very exciting","review":"Save for the disappointments of the Fifth and Sixth, this Sibelius Cycle is the one to own. And for those two symphonies, I recommend Maazel's second cycle, with the Pittsburgh Symphony.These recordings are spacious, and well defined. The remastering is a bit grainy, but the performance qualities overwhelm any worries about sound quality.Maazel here conducts Sibelius with an urgency, with a rush, that I haven't heard anywhere else. His sense for the architecture of Sibelius's symphonies is greater even than Berglund's, and his orchestra, the VPO, responds to his every whim like a well-trained gymnast.One other reservation is the Second symphony, most people generally prefer a more \\"Ormandy-esque\\" approach, but for those looking for the music to have more impact than beauty, this recording will not disappoint."},{"rating":"2","title":"a great budget recording","review":"I feel much the same way about this anthology as about Rafael Kubelik's Mahler cycle. There is quite a substantial amount of music for very modest cost. The performances of Nos. 4,6 and 7 would merit 5 stars by themselves, for the same price. The rest of the cycle is pretty good too, except perhaps (disappointingly) No. 5, which is interpreted rather perfunctorily. This was the Vienna Philharmonic's first recording of this music and almost needless to say they play very well. The sound quality is very brilliant, making no allowances at all for the age of the original recordings. I still consider the Colin Davis and Paavo Berglund cycles to be more convincing in terms of interpretation, but this set still remains excellent value for the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great value and a great set.","review":"The best version of Sibelius' 1st I've ever heard.The best 3rd I've ever heard (perhaps a desert island disc)The best 4th I've ever heardThe best 7th I've ever heardThe best 1st movement to the 5th I've ever heard."},{"rating":"1","title":"wonderful version bad reproduction","review":"The 4th symphony by Maazel and the VPO has always been one of my favorites.

But the music is more original than successful. The band's broad range of stylistic influences is actually their main problem. The music comes across as fragmented and unfocused. The songs, most of which are fairly long, are collections of several disparate themes that are largely unrelated to each other. For instance, heavy metal riffs abruptly segue into jazz piano solos. The result is that this CD does not really sound like a coherent whole.

It shows how a friends best attempt to help, sometimes doesn't end the way they planned.

It was one of Maestro Mantovani's classic gold records, an enormous favorite then and now. These are the original London/Decca recordings so you will hear the brilliance of the authentic Mantovani sound. To some, it may be hard to imagine today, but this album of Strauss waltzes meticulously orchestrated by the late Mantovani stayed on Billboard's charts for about 60 weeks, reaching as high as #7. For those who cannot get enough of Mantovani LPs on CD, scoop this one up fast and enjoy Vienna through the creative lush sounds created by the world's greatest light orchestra leader."},{"rating":"1","title":"non bellissima interpetazione","review":"gusti personali, certo, ma non mi ha fatto impazzire l'interpretazione. preferisco le interpretazioni piu' classiche, ad esempio, per capirci, \\"sul bel Danubio blu\\" che si ascolta nel celeberrimo \\"2001\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly Has Come of Age","review":"It does seem curious to me that the early Church saw fit to leave this Gospel out.

This mesh version is a knock off from the real one. I once owned the real one with a cloth cover and it was great. This product offered, is the same price with an almost dollar store quality. Cheap frame... after only about ten uses the slide adjustment loosened so it can only be used in two positions, up or down. The mesh is weak... if you weigh over about 98 pounds be prepared for your butt to sink into a hole that grows with continued use. It is auckward in not folding completely. I had saved the chair as a present for myself to use on vacation. I opened it a week after the return policy date. I contacted the company as soon as I realized this was not the item I had expected. With four attempts the company was not interested in my being satisfied by taking it back or giving any kind of exchange or refund... even in having the box and all the packaging."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality, poor customer service","review":"As comfortable as this recliner was, it lasted less than two years. The eyelets for the rope started rusting shortly after I got it, then after about a year the frame started falling apart. I contacted customer service (the manufacturer, not Target's, because it was three months after the 1 yr warranty) but they wanted me to ship it to them at my own cost for repair. That would have cost more than the price to begin with. So I finally just threw it out -- after 1.5 years and barely using it, keeping it folded and covered when not in use. I only weigh 139 lbs, so my weight certainly didn't contribute to the deterioration of this chair. What a disappointment this product turned out to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"I thought this was a great book. Its a good story and Rawn's story-telling is very straight forward. My two complaints however, are that the plot got convoluted (someone else's review said the same thing) and that the similar character names can get very confusing. Example: Sioned, Siolnell, Sioneva. There are so many characters that I often had to go back and review the last thing they had done (sometimes dozens if not a hundred pages previous). But, my complaints are minor next to the great story told in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Epic High Fantasy at its Best!","review":"Rawn has once again brought a way of life to the eyes of her readers. As in all her books the characters live and breath on the pages in harmony with the story. I love the way she has jumped from here to there in the time line. Completely a delight to find an author that has learned that not all readers suffer from \\"time jump\\" confusion. This book was thoroughly engrossing, without being a chore to read. I could not put it down, though I seem to have that problem with all her books! Now if she only continues from Skybowl....I personally would love to see what sort of adventures Jihan and Rislyn, Meig and the rest have as they grow. I also find the story line of Andry (a man) defining \\"sin\\" in the name of their Goddess. After his death will Goddess Keep still follow the path of his example under Chayla's care?"},{"rating":"2","title":"confusing in the beginning","review":"In the beginning it was a bit confusing cause I haven't read the previous serie.

Melanie Rawn let people die, not just peasants but also lords, princes etc. It all makes it realistic.Robert Jordan can learn from Melanie Rawn! Great serie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"sucky","review":"OK, so Melanie Rawn's other series were good. Then I read this series, only to be shocked. I had to plow my way through the book. The only interesting parts were the treacheries and the like, and the abductions, etc. But overall, this whole series could not hold my attention, and let me tell you, if I'm reading a good book, my attention doesn't wander at all. Come on, when reading this series, it took about 4-6 weeks to read it, instead of the usual couple days. But maybe I shouldh've started with the 2nd book, like I did with all other Melanie Rawn series. I hope I never have to read it again, and that is an unusual comment for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"too many characters","review":"Hmm im one of those who have not read the dragon prince and went straight to dragon star. Maybe this was why i found the book rather confusing as the characters were not introduced formally and i felt like i was stepping halfway in.

Yet after a very exhausting effort of reading this book, that is more than just cunfusion. Well it is one of the worst books I have ever read, out of thousands of books I have previously read. I have read many of the other reviews listed here. Most of these reviews have one thing in common, one must read the previous Dragon Prince books first. STRONGHOLD IS CONFUSION BECAUSE IT SHOULD NOT BE BOOK ONE, BUT THE BOOK NUMBER AFTER THE LAST DRAGON PRINCE BOOKS. Who ever heard of taking a book in the middle of a series and calling it book one. This author could learn a lot from Robert Jordan!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't even think about reading this book.....","review":"...unless you have read the previous trilogy. At least, I can but hope that helps it. Amid unpronouncable names, vague references to dragons that are smarter than the people and serve no purpose, characters with weird powers that are never explained,and some of the most convoluted family trees I've ever read, lies no plot, no reasoning, no explanations, no nothing. Some people are attacked by an enemy that comes out of nowhere, which is never explained as to who they might be, where they came from, or why they came in the first place. The people fight and run, fight and run. It is undoubtably one of the worst books I've ever read. I don't even have a desire to read the first trilogy to try to figure everything out. I was terribly disappointed. I certainly will not pick up another of this author's books."},{"rating":"1","title":"ASHKENAZY","review":"Ashkenazy plays like he has someone on his back with a stop watch , I dont like his tempoes I dont like his rubato , I dont feel ease like I should when I listen to the nocturnes , get Barenboim's nocturnes - these are decent recordings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it; filter arrived broken first time but perfect second time.","review":"I was even more pleased than I thought when I saw how beautiful, light, and elegant the glass is.

Bodum's European design awards and long history, I came away unimpressed with this \\"tea pot\\".Using fine quality whole leaf tea DOES result in some of the leaf matter getting stuck in the small drain slits at the bottom of the infuser. The other flaw was the loose \\"rattly\\" lid that is just poorly fitting. You will know immediately that this product is not up to snuff the second you pick it up and notice how thin and flimsy the glass is. It's a cheap piece of glass just waiting for an accident to happen on a slippery/wet kitchen counter, or from one good swoosh of kitty's tail to send it smashing all over the floor.As one reviewer said of another of this company's teapots, \\"I expected more from Bodum\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to clean","review":"I picked this up recently and tried several varieties of loose tea in it. The bottom line is that tea does get stuck in the one that I own. I have tried a couple of methods to get the tea out to no avail. It might be hard to see from the picture, but the \\"holes\\" for the water are actually slits in the bottom around the bottom rim of the infuser. The slits are actually sickle shaped and the tea gets caught in the narrow areas. I imaging that differences in the cuts would either make or break this product. In my case they make me want to break it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Idea, but breaks far too easily","review":"This is a great product...until it breaks. The glass is very very thin. While it may be boro-silicate glass, the infuser part of it has slits that weaken the whole structure. I've had two of these, and the infusers last about a week before the slits in the infuser turn into cracks that spider through the whole thing until it breaks in half. Nice idea but the execution leaves a lot to be desired."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware...product was shipped broken...refund only 50%","review":"I bought their stainless steel infuser, and stainless steel travel mug.

I should have listened to other reviewers who had written about broken glass upon arrival, but I found out the hard way. Amazon packed this in a box much too big for the package's size and put almost no padding. Needless to say, the second I opened it I could hear the shattered glass moving all around the package. It was mangled! Do yourself a favor and just buy this at a store even if it's a few bucks more. Between the time lost spent waiting for this as well as having to go to the post office to return it, it was simply not worth it. This one's all on Amazon, not Bodum's fault."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap","review":"If drinking tea has any sort of calming-ritual effect for you, you won't want this flimsy, clunky thing.

The author discusses the lives of the poets amongst their friends, acquaintances, other writers, & artists in Italy where living was less expensive and the climate more favorable. There are many cute stories about their son Pen and how the couple disagreed over various aspects of his unbringing. Also touched upon are the previous generations of both the Barretts and the Brownings and their history in Jamaica. Besides learning about the the Brownings, this book gives you a good feel of what life was like in the middle 19th century.

Painful for me anyway as I remember Liz from the late 1960's with her beautiful voice but the passing of four(4) plus decades takes the shimmer off most things.

This unlike other gamebooks I have read let the player name their character and gave me very open roleplaying decisions. I also like the excitement factor which the author is maintaining constantly. I loved how clever traps were thrown at my character and how I nearly reached failure in some of the traps. The illustrations in Crypt of the Vampire are well done too. The combat system the author uses is very simple and easy to pick up too so this game can be played by not only the seasoned roleplayer. My friend who normally does not roleplay even enjoyed this book. All together, I think that this is a great book which most people seeking a short fantasty trip or many will enjoy. Defintely a book which you should purchase!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous for young kids","review":"I read this story to my 3 year old because I remember loving Babar as a child, but I will not read it to her again.

The first JV mix goes to 10 minutes, with just a few pieces of the original vocals spread about; the second, the 'dub', is just a self-indulgent affair that sounds exactly the same as the first, but without any link the original song. Come on!On the other hand, the remix by Danny Saber, while not great, isn't as stifling bad; it appears he actually knows what he's doing, and intended to make a very dancey version of this song.The original is great, but of course why buy this single when you can get the title-track on the actual album, and the Danny Saber remix on the newer edition of the album? I may seem like a hypocrite, seeing as how I bought it, but I'm collecting, so if you don't want to collect everything of Bowie's, don't ever get this."},{"rating":"1","title":"$10?

In previous books, the author subtly made references to her other stories and characters. Sort of a bonus for readers who are paying attention to the details. In this book, though, I found it too intrusive and forced. There were too many characters from her other books present for no reason at all.

Dessen's other books do a pretty good job of tossing you into the story and getting you into it quickly, but this one wasn't up to the test."},{"rating":"2","title":"book","review":"This is an amazing book.

In her real life, Annabel is the girl who has nothing:she doesn't have a best friend anymore since her friendship with mean-but-exciting Sophie ended with awful rumors flying, no peace at home while her older sister's eating dissorder preoccuoies the whole family's attention, and no ability to tell anyone what is going on in all this malicious chaos.When Annabel meets Owen Armstrong everything changes- he is intense, obssesed with music, and determined to always tell the truth, no matter what the consequences.Annabel hates confrontation could she find a guy who thrives on it? Couls she explain the night her and Sophie stopped being friends?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Listen","review":"*********THIS HAS SPOLIERS**************The Cover was very interesting so i pick it up and started to read it. when Will Cash came into the picture (or rather the book) i new what her secret was, i knew the end before i even got to chapter 4!If you have ever read the Novel \\"Speak\\", then this is not worth reading because its basically the same ploit. litterally!I'm Sorry if you disagree with me, and if i ruined the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Good book by Dessen","review":"This is one of Sarah Dessen's best and includes all the things that make her books standouts.

I've been wanting to read a Sarah Dessen book for a long time and I finally got a hold of one. I do hope that the next book of hers that I read is a little bit better and holds my interest more. With all of that said, the book wasn't bad. It was alittle bit slow and slightly predictable, but a predictable book can be good sometimes. I've definately not lost hope for Dessen though and will be seeking out another of her books to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Eye Opener!","review":"If you have a daughter, sister, granddaughter, etc...I highly recommend this book.Story is very real.

Sad book","review":"I had never read a Sarah Dessen book and this book was amazing. I just wasn't expecting it to be so depressing.

At times Paul Christopher is a bit too enigmatic for me to really grasp, but his cousin's devotion is touching-- indeed the whole family is devoted, in an isolated, loner kind of way. I particularly liked learning so much about falconry and hawks."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm Not An Espionage Fan...","review":"...but I'm a big fan of the work of Charles McCarry. This is the best flat-out adventure novel he's ever written and it's obvious that he had a great time doing it. Oddly enough, in all the good reviews this novel has received, there has been very little praise given to the humor it contains. 'Old Boys' is not only beautifully written, well-plotted and marvelously paced, it's very humorous...in a very quiet way. I enjoyed and admire this book a great deal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my type","review":"Not what I would usually read and did not hold my interest as some books do. I bought it on the off chance I would enjoy it and it wasn't one of my best picks. Worth what I paid for it though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Almost 30 years ago, McCarry wrote 2 of the best espionage thrillers ever produced, The Tears of Autumn and The Secret Lovers. Following the success of these books, McCarry produced a series of books involving some of the same characters in those books, particularly his hero, the CIA spy Paul Christopher. These later books were generally good but not at the level of Tears or Secret Lovers. McCarry's characterizations became shallower and the plots of his novels increasingly complicated and implausible. Old Boys, his first espionage novel in years, continues the unfortunate tendencies of his later books. The plot is highly implausible and in fact, not developed well. There is a host of characters, few of them developed well. This is a mediocre potboiler from someone who can clearly do better."},{"rating":"2","title":"mccarry scores again","review":"As usual Charles McCarry has produced another exceptional thriller. Although it follows the latest twist in the Christopher family history it can be read on a stand alone basis. McCarry's novels are literate and absorbing unlike much of the genre. Sadly this may be McCarry's final work {according to the WSJ review}."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dullsville","review":"Perhaps I'd put too much stock in all the praise I'd seen heaped on Charles McCarry and this book. What a great espionage writer he is, the party line went. Our Le Carré, etc., etc. But this book, which I purchased at full price in hardcover, was so dull and disappointing that I gave up in anger and disinterest not even half way through. McCarry probably has been as good as his admirers say, but in this book, he seems to have switched on the auto-pilot, taken the money, and run. I quickly grew tired of all his fancy brand names - dropped, it appears, as a way to suggest authenticity and insider knowledge - and all the exotic locales he pushes his characters to, as if scouting locations for a movie. I have not given up; I will now try his earlier books, starting with 'Tears of Autumn,' and keep my fingers crossed. I remain hopeful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Very Good Book","review":"It starts off interestingly enough -- great plot idea, interesting characters, intriquing tradecraft. But, as another reviewer has said, a bunch of old spies -- suddenly endowed with energy and fitness more appropriate to twenty-year-olds -- just start trotting off all over the world, for little apparent reason. The cast of characters is too long. As the plot of this long book unfolds, it slips into unbelieveability. I just skipped the last few chapters -- I no longer gave a darn about how the book ended. I'm quite surprised that others consider McCarry as one of the best espionage thriller authors in the business. I haven't read his other books but if \\"Old Boys\\" is typical, I doubt that I ever will."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let Old Boys Sleep","review":"I have read all of Mr. McCarry's other books with Paul Christopher as the central character, and they are all top drawer. This work, unfortunately, has little plot - and what there is of it is uninteresting - little about Christopher, and at the end, the reader does not really care. His mother is the most interesting though confused person in the book, and at the end, we learn little about her motives. All in all, this book does not measure up, sorry to say."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is funny, even though he explains it","review":"I bought this book anticipating nothing more than a rehash of \\"Seven Years of Highly Defective People\\". Instead, however, Adams starts right where \\"Seven Years\\" left off, in terms of the comic timeline. The book is very much like \\"Seven Years\\" in that Adams provides funny handwritten comments under almost every comic, but unlike \\"Seven Years\\", the book is organized chronologically, and not by character. That said, the book is very funny and very enjoyable to those people (like me) who like a bit of a \\"behind-the-scenes tour\\" now and then."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"I feel like commiting random acts of catness...\\"","review":"This is the best Dilbert Collection I've ever read. Usually, (While Adams does make a lot of gems) you have to comb through his books to find something that just makes you laugh hysterically. With this book, your search can end, and you can lean back and enjoy Dilbert at it's finest, with little, strange, but somehow normal seeming comments by Scott Adams himself underneath each comic. This is truly a masterpiece, and I suggest it to any funny comic fan (including Dilbert), because it will leave you pasting many of these comics on your cubicle and laughing on end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great title","review":"you every wonder why life is the way it is then this title is just one of many example of people living as they are."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money for Dilbert lovers.","review":"This book is maybe my 10th dilbert book or so.

I absolutely love this recording, recorded in the Sofiensaal in Vienna, which has unsurpassed acoustics. The Vienna Philharmonic plays like the best orchestra in the world(which they are). This recording has fun, drama, and brilliant clarity. Magnificent singing by Jo. When I purchased this recording she was virtually unknown, and now everyone knows how talented she is. You must hear her Queen of the Night."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great \\"Men At Arms \\" Duet; The Rest Holds Together Well","review":"Here's what I really love about this performance. The \\"Men At Arms\\" duet is given a perfect reading, for once really indicating the plainchant base really well, but without missing the almost spooky sweep of the music. Chailley, the scholar, had this right: this duet is about the intersection of various religio-musico valences. The rest of the performance is the typical Solti band-masterish solidity one would expect. But that is a sort of virtue in an opera that doesn't always seem to cohere. I don't know what to say: I have a different standard for opera conducting. If it doesn't seem to drop the ping-pong ball, it is a success in my book. And Sumi Jo is a dominatrix as the Queen."},{"rating":"2","title":"OLD SKOOL","review":"I love this old school CD. I am young but the lyrics and the music really had me grooving.

It says on the back \\"Everything you need to know to maximise IIS 5.0..\\". This is completely untrue. This book teaches you nothing about the latest features of IIS, for example, it have virtually nothing on ASP. It is not comprehensive enough to be a reference manual, nor is it written in a format that would make it easy to read from start to finish like a study guide. It is not one of those books where you can read a single chapter and get an understanding of that subject.

Okay, something horrible happened, but she is basically a psychotic killer searching for constant prey. I couldn't relate to her as a female in the least. I love strong female leads, however Leigh just came off as whiny and the constant cracks that we saw with Jessie are echoed, less successfully. Just like Blue Moon, the story is in first person; while in Blue Moon I loved Will and forgave more, the sentences are so choppy and short- similar to the sentence structure of a third-grade journal. This will be my last from the series. I was hoping for so much more from a good premise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Satisfies all those howling cravings","review":"This is a good, solid book. Fulfills my need for a bit of mystery and violence, friendship and passion.Characters from the first book, Blue Moon, return to support the story which allows you to keep in touch with old favorites. The new couple are just as complex as far as character development and their passion simmers throughout. The four of them make an oddly charming dynamic of gritty women and gorgeous men.As far as paranormal romance series go, this one is turning out to be darker, especially considering the focus has been on the women. Lara Adrian's Midnight Breed series is pretty dark, but the men are the central characters. This series isn't as sexually charged, though the passion and romance is still engaging.Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read","review":"I really enjoyed this book, the problems were minor.

The author has released a great tease of a short story and the idea of the jager-suchers is seductive. However...I like a heroine whose strong and realistic, not simpering and brainless. Yet the heroine in this book was a mouthy badass taken just a little too far. Granted she went through a nightmarishly tramatic experience, but she ends up a little to winey and...let's face it, psycho. She has absoilutly no sanctity for life when she has lost her own loved ones. She's kind of a female Van Dam, amusing for a few chapters but soon wearying. She's not interesting enough to be an Anita Blake. Our hero and his counterpart Will are also made to sound like the little women who stay at home. Why can't the man and woman be equal?

I see that this box-set recieves a lot of 5 star reviews, and it feels like its just a hype. Is it the songs they like so much, or the package, or do they just feel they have to give this a 5 star review because they spent so much money on it (combined with their unconditional love for the band).I was myself a big fan of the band at the time when I bough this and I still didnt like it.

This did EXACTLY what it was supposed to do. His jaw dropped open and tears of joy swelled in his eyes. It is the reaction one wants when giving a present and it is that feeling inside, when you give that kind of a gift, that makes something like this so incredible.If you do not like The Smashing Pumpkins, then don't buy this.

It is the worst pencil sharpener I have ever used! If you have 10-15 MINUTES to waste, you can partially sharpen a new pencil with this pencil sharpener. It takes at least that long. On previously sharpened pencils, I can never get a good point with it. I regret buying it and should have returned it to the store from which I bought it (not Amazon).

As with the other reviewers, noticed slow motor in just the first few uses. Thought maybe the shaving case was full. First time we removed the front shaving case, pencil shavings spewed all over the room because the receptacle is too small and awkward to remove. Within 5 uses, the pencils were not sharpening evenly. Upon inspection, bad design is to blame. The metal sharpening gear grinds up against plastic and erodes the gears quickly.When I was a kid, my grandparents had a metal sharpener attached to the door frame. You dialed up the size of pencil you wanted to sharpen, stuck the pencil in and cranked away until you had a nice sharp point. How I long for the good old days when sharpening a pencil was easy and darn good fun for a kid! Save your money, do a little research and keep a manual sharpener handy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Design","review":"The thing I don't like about this is the design. When you open the part to take out the pencil shavings it doesn't come out easily. It sticks. It never went smoothly out of there (I tried it about 6 times). So I could just imagine trying to keep the pencil shavings in there until with it sticking and all of the shavings getting everywhere. 90% of the pencil shavings wouldn't have made it to the trash because of the poorly designed front part (which is where the shavings are supposed to come out). I returned it. I didn't bother testing the blades sharpness. Maybe the blades sharpness will make up for the fact that 90% of the pencil shavings would fall out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unacceptable!","review":"This poor excuse for a sharpener doesn't center pencils well at all, so wood frequently intrudes upon the point. The motor is exceptionally noisy and quite weak -- it stalls easily. The single cutter is small and the waste recepticle requires frequent emptying or else it spills shavings.

This one is going back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic excuse for a pencil sharpener","review":"If this product is an example of how electric pencil sharpeners are made these days, I'm going back to a manual unit mounted to the wall. The motor is very weak and once it is done (finally) sharpening a pencil, it is not done well. Sometimes the point is sharp, but it is very uneven. It leaves wood exposed on one side, right to the very tip.

It seemed to be full of characters, most of whom you know very little about till they come up again later in the book. This means searching through the beginning somewhere to identify them.

I travel to Europe twice a year, and these are fairly comfortable even for a 9 hour flight. But more importantly, the noice cancellation is effective enough to protect by ear drums. Over the ear styles would be better, but I haven't found anything for less than $125, in this style. Structurally, they are a bit flimsy. After one year of use a strap broke.

Technically, this mouse IS more comfortable.

But...only ONE step.My biggest complaint, however, is that the function just isn't smooth. The cursor is constantly hesitating, not registering clicks, or freezing onscreen briefly, and all that with the receptor device about three inches away from the actual mouse. (Yes, that kind-of defeats the purpose of wireless, but this thing just gets worse with distance, as other reviewers have noted.)

But from a practical, usage perspective, it failed in one important area - it is very uncomforatble to use. If used in the proper hand position - i.e., hand on the side of the mouse (neutral wrist position) vs. hand on top of the mouse (pronated wrist position), it forces your pinkie finger to drag against the mouse pad (or other surface) as you move the mouse around. While probably not annoying enough to bother anyone for the first 30-60 min of use, it's extremely bothersome for all-day, office use. I also have an Evoluent ergo mouse; and the Evoluent mouse flares out at the bottom to form a small platform, which supports the user's hand. With the Evoluent mouse, my hand glides effortlessly over the mouse pad, without ever contacting the surface.

Literally, if more than 5 inches away from the receiver, the mouse pointer movement often becomes erratic and jerky, 2 feet away -- loses the signal completely. I haven't seen a worst range from a wireless mouse/product ever, and I've used a couple dozens of different ones over the years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not robust","review":"After six months the side panel covering blistered and began to come off.

I went to CC to try out some mice and this was by far the nicest, but very expensive. Jumped on Amazon and found this mouse at a great price and bought it. I was a little leary about it being wireless, but it has worked flawlessly. My wrist pay is definitely much less and the mouse performs exactly as I had hoped!! Going to purchase another for my home desktop!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Better, But Not Perfect","review":"This mouse is a lot better than most others, but it's still not perfect. My hand rests at a more natural angle, but the thumb rest is sort of awkwardly placed. After trying to get used to it for a week or two, I just started holding the way that felt most natural. I don't know if I'm doing it ergonomically or not, but it feels a lot better to me.One complaint: the wheel is very difficult to click down on. I use that middle click constantly in Firefox, and it's very irritating that it takes so much force to do so."},{"rating":"1","title":"still have pain :(","review":"I've had this mouse for a little while and the good points areit's solidit has many programmable buttonsit's precisegood battery lifethe bad pointsthe angle still is not verticle enough to relieve the pain on top of my hand and wrist"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"After using this mouse for six weeks, I still cannot find a comfortable way to use it. Wrist & hand fatigue develops very quickly for me even though I've tried raising and lowering the mousing surface, using a wrist rest and adjusting my thumb & wrist positions. Another source of irritation is the screen flicker that occurs momentarily when switching between applications (apparently a bug in the IPoint software that installs). Using with WindowsXP."},{"rating":"1","title":"I liked my logitech better","review":"Been using this about a month. I have a small hand and this MAYBE gave me a tiny bit more comfort. I really can't tell a difference. My hand is raised about an inch where my index finger rests but it does not turn my wrist the way it is advertised. I have to put my index finger over to the left side of the mouse which turns my wrist over to the same position as a regular mouse. The buttons would need to be on a more vertical line for it to work the way they claim. To use the thumb buttons I have to pick my hand up off the table to reach the second one. This is basically just an extra tall mouse. ALSO I have my mouse 1 foot away from the reciever and I frequently lose the connection. This is the worst mouse I have ever owned as far as that goes. I will be replacing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The mouse that lasted a few hours","review":"Received this mouse today. Unboxed and I was excited.. Need relief on my wrist.. Plugged in and the CD it came with was blocked by Windows 7 (x64) for compatibility issues. No problem, download Intelipoint from MS site and that was resolved.Installation went fine and I began using it right away.. It would not work on a simple $3 mouse pad. If froze often.. It was very inaccurate, shaky and jerky on my desk (wood). Left clicking became multiple and triple left clicking.. I tried it on 3 workstations at the job, same resultI wouldn't waste anymore time on something that shouldn't be so difficult..Boxed the mouse back up and back to Amazon it went with UPS. I'm thinking about the Wow Pen or Evoluent mouse right now. Cant believe there isn't such a larger market for ergonomic mice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but not great","review":"While very comfortable to use, it's got a bit of a learning curve after having used standard mice for so long, despite it's natural holdability.

Very responsive and precise but uncomfortable as the side buttons are too far back.

What could they been thinking of when they designed the location of the side buttons."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for small hands","review":"I'm a petite woman with relatively small hands and this mouse was much, much too large for my hands. If I rest my hand on the side the way they instruct you to, I can't even come close to putting my index finger on the left button. The only way I could use it was to hold it the way they show in the \\"wrong way\\" drawing. It should specify not for small hands."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Arthritically Friendly","review":"I have arthritis in my hands which makes working very difficult enough. It is hard to lift my fingers as it is, but this mouse, which came with my Microsoft Wireless Natural Desktop Pro keyboard/mouse package (I got it for the keyboard only) is so tall that I continually found myself clicking buttons when I didn't want to. I had to hold my hand high enough in order to not accidentally click buttons, that my wrist became very strained and sore. I use it for baseball practice now :-)The mouse may work well for others, but if you have rheuumatic issues with your hands, this is not the mouse for you. Incidentally, I have been using the Logitech MX Revolution with much success and little pain. Best mouse I ever used. It may be called something slightly different now, but definately worth a look."},{"rating":"1","title":"CAD users beware","review":"If you use the middle mouse button a lot you will find this mouse discouraging.

However, this mouse is terrible using it on any surface. The tracking is choppy, and very, very inexact for pointing and selecting - it is driving me nuts. I had always used Logitech mice, which scroll, point and track very smoothly. I am very sorry I purchased this mouse. I plan to replace it with a Logitech. Unfortunately, I waited too long, and cannot return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not live up to the HYPE","review":"It's wireless, very comfortable, but it's jumpy. I don't know where the problem is, but when you move the mouse, even just a little bit, it jumps. I adjusted the different settings for the mouse, Sensitivity and such, \\"No Joy\\" in fixing it. For me it was unusable and I retured it to the store where I purchased it at. If you play games, or need real sensitivity, move to another mouse. This one will make your head hurt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for big hands","review":"I love this! although not very exact,it is comfortable. my wrist never hurts anymore.

It's a relief going back to my original mouse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pain-Free","review":"I have larger than normal hands, and have to use a mouse for 8 hours a day or more sometimes. After using several other mice, all which caused hand and wrist pain, I tried out this mouse with great results. The pain in my pinky and ring fingers went away, as well as in my wrists. I have also recommended this mouse to 2 other people who both have loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Microsoft Laser Mouse 6K","review":"I'm not as fond of this mouse as I was a previous 6000 model but it's growing on me. Due to the increased height of the mouse it almost forces your hand/wrist into a more relaxed or natural angle, thus less stress on wrist and elbow. It took a bit to get used to but again it's growing on me. I use rechargables in it which don't seem to lose power any faster than throw aways."},{"rating":"1","title":"it's... ok","review":"this has a more ergonomic shape than a standard mouse but I think it's not really enough to make a huge difference. I tried this mouse out for a little while and it didn't completely solve my problems with discomfort, it helped a little but not enough to settle on this model. The silicon pad where the thumb goes for some reason has begun to degrade, yellow, become bumpy... it feels nasty... this happened after relatively little use. I think it's not really ergonomic enough to be considered an ergonomic mouse."},{"rating":"1","title":"two years, left click fails","review":"just like what the reviewer below says - left click fails. its been good only for two years. just like what the reviewer below says - left click fails. its been good only for two years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Left-click failing","review":"This was a great mouse when it worked, but now after a couple of years the left click is starting to fail.

I was very dissapointed with this mouse. After working with it for a few weeks I just got rid of it. The biggest problem is that the small plastic pads on the bottom of the mouse do not glide effortlessly over the smooth surface of my desktop. The rubber-like material that MS is making these pads with drags a bit which makes this heavy mouse seem even heavier. It is heavy and cumbersome to use to the point that it was actually making my forearm ache.The Logitech mouse that I had replaced (finally had died) with this mouse had very hard plastic, almost like teflon smooth pads on the bottom that make that mouse effortless to move. I just bought another Logitech Mouse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't relax hand","review":"The design is great in theory, but the buttons don't offer enough resistance, so if you actually relax your hand you will push both buttons simultaneously. After about a half hour of use your hand will be exhausted. Additionally, it's not quite tilted enough, so the pressure point is your wrist bone at the base of your palm. Those aren't even the worst things about it. The worst thing is that the mouse won't work on a typical desk surface. If there is any shine to your desk surface, like polished wood/veneer, forget about it. THERE IS NOTHING GOOD ABOUT THIS MOUSE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short life-span","review":"Mine worked for a year or two and then stopped working. I tried changing batteries, rebooting, etc. I liked it, but it should have lasted much longer than it did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent device","review":"With my older mouse I was starting to hurt my carpal tunnel. At first it started with my fingers feeling funny (slightly numb and shaky) and then I started to loose some amount of sensation. This started to carry on to other things as well - like holding a coffee mug or cell phone etc. After researching some amount, I found this mouse. I have been using it for a couple of months now and all my carpal tunnel issues seem to have gone. The manufacturer has a nice guide that shows you how to transfer weight to the edge of you palm rather than the base of your palm (as is the case with a regular mouse). It worked like a charm for me. I do not have any criticism for this mouse - I only wish they make another one that is travel friendly, this one being large and a little on the heavy side - both attributes actually help the desktop model."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wireless problems...","review":"I my experience ALL wireless products are inherently unstable just like the reception on a cell phone. The signal can encounter interference from many sources and when that happens you can experience a range of problems...and this was my main issue with this mouse...Not sure if its defective...but on a regular basis the click and double-click don't seem to be work...have to keep clicking. Sometimes the mouse slows down to a crawl...all seems like some kind of interference with the wireless signal between the mouse and base unit.Aside from that...the design of the mouse is good. The problem is that the mouse is too small. I have small hands and its too small for me so your finger tips hang over the front of the mouse and actually clicking on the buttons is a bit more difficult. Basically they need to make mouses in different sizes like clothes: S, M, L :)At the moment I just stopped using it...I guess that's why its so cheap now :|"},{"rating":"1","title":"A real disappointment","review":"I have purchased dozens of items from Amazon. Never returned a single one. Until now. I am returning this mouse. I thought the ergonomic design would be an improvement. It actually does feel good and puts less stress on the wrist. But, none of this matters if the mouse doesn't work. And a lot of the time, it doesn't. The wireless connection is periodically lost. I have changed batteries. Moved the receiver, etc. Nothing helps. At times, the mouse is unresponsive. It is totally unreliable and often useless. I have had to keep a traditional mouse ready at all times so I can use it when this one fails.Evidently, Microsoft is aware of some of the issues. It would have been nice if the mouse were 100% reliable BEFORE it was introduced to market.I would not recommend this product. Save yourself the aggravation and frustration. Buy a different brand.

In use, however, it is so tall that my wrist needed to flex upwards. Very uncomfortable. I joked with my colleagues that it would make a great projectile, and I felt like throwing it out of frustration. If I've learned anything in the search for comfort, it is that all reviews are subjective.

This means that it requires significantly more effort to move the mouse and this adds up during the day.2.) I can't use it without a mouse pad with a wrist rest because all the weight of my hand falls on the left edge of my wrist which is the only part touching the desk surface.

I would have had to go up 3 or 4 sizes just to get it descent, and it would have looked horrible. The material doesnt look as nice in person (I bought the burgandy dress, it was the only color available at the time), it looks cheap. The ruffle hangs poorly and looks poorly cut.

Don't get me wrong, it's a great dress, but it just wasn't right for my body type. At all. It didn't hide ANYTHING. And it wasn't quite big enough for my chest. The length is pretty good. Starts just below the knee, and then goes diagonally downwards towards the right. However, if you do not like VERY clingy things, do NOT buy this dress.

I felt that this dress, along with the other four, was cheaply and poorly made, which I guess isn't surprising because it costs so little. It probably would have looked fine on somebody else anyway, but it definitely didn't look good on me. That's fine, not everything you try on will look good, but the sizing here is way off, by normal size standards AND by their own size charts. I normally wear probably a 2X, but this 5X was VERY snug, and by their size charts it should have fit easily. For some of their other dresses, a 3X was way too big, so there's no continuity there. Also, the cut was very strange on almost all of the dresses, meaning they would be tight some places and way too loose in others. I've never had that problem before.I will say this: the dresses came quickly and, when returned, my refund was prompt."},{"rating":"1","title":"not attractive","review":"I bought this dress to wear to my brother in laws wedding.

Favorite tunes...sparkle off the hammered dulcimer and waft from the harp strings into a fanciful spray of sound and feeling. I was prepared to hate the synthesizer, but it's used so tastefully that I really didn't notice it. This is a well-crafted, well-produced album that I'm sure would please the old blind harpist.

O'Carolan's compositions are pretty and whimsical, making for an album that is well-suited to cozy winter evenings. It is more of a showcase for Naylor than for Ross.

Dans une discographie surchargée, ce disque n'apporte rien d'autre que les sonorités pesantes des (superbes) cuivres de Chicago, outrageusement mises en avant par une prise de son spectaculaire mais peu subtile. Gestion très personnelle des tempi (beaucoup d'accélérations nerveuses superflues - et non écrites-) sans vraie conception d'ensemble autre qu'une lecture découpée et nerveuse mais sans drame profond, ni mystère. Hautbois très médiocre en début de second mouvement. Le troisième, épais et mécanique demeure inhabité. Le finale rugit avec un pompiérisme conquérant vite lassant. Solti appuie exagérément les verticalités de la partition en courant le risque d'entraver le cours naturel des phrases.

One sad thing about maturity is that you leave behind some of the old stuff. It seems like every CD, No Doubt skimps more and more on the horn sections. I REALLY like this CD, and I think the lyrics are their best yet. However, I was hoping for more of a ska sound. \\"Return of Saturn\\" is more alternative than their previous albums, with the summer soundtrack hit, \\"New\\" to back this statement. There are some tracks that are pure No Doubt, and show their unique sound-- my favorites being \\"Bathwater\\" and \\"Six Feet Under\\". There were some tracks where I only liked the lyrics, including \\"Magic's in the Makeup\\"-- I didn't like the mellow sound it had.If you like the older No Doubt, as in Beacon Street era, you may not like this album as much. If you prefer \\"Tragic Kingdom\\", chances are this will be your new favorite CD. Either way, give it a listen. It's definately worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Doubt is a breath of fresh air for the music world","review":"I've been a fan of No Doubt since their Tragic Kingdom album and like many other fans have been anxiously awaiting for this new album. It was definitely worth the wait! The main difference between this album and the last is Return to Saturn has more of a new wave groove to it. Less ska/rock which is both good and bad. Instead of trying to copy their last hits they have come out with new and refreshing sounds that still have that No Doubtness that's so unique! My particularly favorite songs are \\"Ex-girlfriend\\" \\"New\\" (which are both singles) \\"Six Feet Under\\" and \\"Bathwater\\". A lot of the ballads are also good. Overall I think everyone should own this album along with Tragic Kingdom!"},{"rating":"2","title":"BUY THIS ALBUM","review":"Return of Saturn is a terrific album. You can't not love this album. Gwen's vocal ability is terrific. The entire album is terrific. If anyone doubt's that this album is good, then they should listen to Simple kind of life, Too late, Dark Blue, Six feet Under and Home Now. The lyrics to all the songs on the album are so poetic and revealing. I love the fact that they chose to go a different route than the last album. People today are so use to hearing the same thing over and over, I mean how do you account for the success of Britney and Christina, that they can't see a gem when its in front of them. This is a classic album. If you're a real no doubt fan than you will love this album. Just because it's not as light as the first doesn't mean that it's bad.

It was depressing and just plain horrible. The only song that was pretty okay was Simple Kind of Life. the song Ex-girlfriend, for me, teetered between good and really, really awful.

This cd just isn't in the same class as \\"Tragic Kingdom\\", which still remains one of my favourite cd's. RoS just seems to drone on, and every second track seems to be a slow, serious ballad. I initially thought (hoped) it'd grow on me, but now I've just resorted to skipping the depressing tracks (strangely most of the odd-numbered ones) so that I can play a sequence of music that half-resembles the same up-beat, fun vibe of TK.I guess it was inevitable that No Doubt's music style would change so many years after TK was written, but by this much? \\"Return of Saturn\\"s sombre music is, for me at least, a major let-down.

Only this time, Gwen speaks of her love life in her usual pouty and in-your-face style. Yes, they did change from their previous ways, but change doesn't necessarily always have to be a let down. If they had kept their light punk noise, which happens to be a wonderful noise, it would be as if Gwen had kept her platinum blonde old-hollywood hair. Instead, they give a slight change in their music, allowing Gwen to go bright pink. They just like to keep themselves interesting and it definitely works."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love No Doubt!","review":"I have loved No Doubt since I heard TK.

Most of the songs are quite slow -- not ballad slow, but whining slow -- and seem to focus on when Gwen will ever be happy with a relationship. Or when will she manage to get married. Please. I'm sure many other women will find this recurring theme irritating. Also, many of the songs are mixed-up musically, with arrangements tossed in that keep the songs from having a real melody. Ex-Girlfriend is catchy, but the rest of the album leaves a lot to be desired. Do your de-evolving a thousand years in therapy and cheer up -- then write your songs. Maybe next time out \\"Saturn\\" will pass through the \\"Tragic Kingdom\\" and the results will be more entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Return of Saturn: no doubt to be a success","review":"Excuse the pun in the title, but this CD has everything. From the soft and sad tune of \\"The magic is in the make up\\" to the rather disturbed and unforgettable quickie \\"Staring problem\\", you can't miss out on this album. \\"Ex- Girlfriend\\" kicked of the album with a strong foot, and \\"The Simple Things\\" followed up in a ginger state. This CD is good for pree teens to 30 year olds. It's nice to know that a band can come out with more than one exellent CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"ILOOOVE NO DOUBT BUT....","review":"THAT BAND HAS GOT ME THROUGH SOME CRAZY TIMES SO WHEN I FOUND SOMEONE HAD TAKEN MYT RETURN OF SATURN A FEW MONTHS AGO I WONDERED HOW I COULDVE ONE LET IT HAPPEN AND TWO NOT HAVE EVN NOTICED WELL YA'LL THE ALBUM EXCEPTING A FEW AWESOME SONGS THAT DIDNT EVEN HIT THE RADIO THIS ALBUM WAS NOT WHAT IT WAS AND I MEAN THAT AS NICELY AS POSSIBLE I CANT SAY WHAT IT WAS BUT MAYBE THE ENERGY FELT A LITTLE FORCED OR IN SOME CASES NOT EVEN THERE BUT ROCK STEADY TOTALLY MADE UP FOR AND MADE YOU FORGET THE AWFULNESS THAT WAS THIS ALBUM."},{"rating":"1","title":"SKA?

I couldn't get into it at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"a HUGE disappointment","review":"OK, first off, I am a big ND fan. But this album reeked. It's amazing that ND thought this was an acceptable follow-up to the incredible \\"Tragic Kingdom\\", because this CD was a completely different kind of music. The only OK song on this CD is \\"Ex-Girlfriend\\", which is sort of back to the rock feel. The other songs were boring, too slow, too shallow, and just awful. This is the worst ND CD I've heard so far. I was amazed that this horrible CD came after one of the best CDs I have, \\"Tragic Kingdom\\", and that the same band made them. Gwen sounds different, and this was just a waste of my money. Don't buy this, no matter what. The only thing you might wanna buy is the \\"Ex-Girlfriend\\" single, cuz that's at least decent music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Saturn - no deposit, no \\"Return...\\"","review":"So we have an hour of Gwen moaning how lousy love is.

Otherwise, forget it."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY BORING!","review":"I Don't understand the Wide-Acceptence of No-Doubt.The Music&Lyrics all Sound the same.this album is very Uninspired.It's Basically Gwen Stefani&Group.it's all on her Shoulders.Her voice is Still a Hurting thing on the Ears.what does NO Doubt do that Fishbone doesn't?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Return to Stink","review":"I got the album thinking that the CD was going to rock. It didn't. I was pumped after getting the Go Sound Track and hearing New thinking that they were working on some really good tunes. Instead I get the album and find out that they have sold out. I never thought I would hear so many ballads, but after they banked on don't speak, I see why they got greedy. Buy another album. Don't waste your cash."},{"rating":"1","title":"It really sucked!","review":"This album is an insult to the word ska. What kind of music are they heading toward now; Britney Spears? It features too much synthesizers and not much brass. Tragic Kingdom and their self-titled album are much better than this. The only songs (that were mediocre at best) were Ex-girlfriend, Staring Problem, and New. This album was poorly compiled."},{"rating":"2","title":"cool!","review":"Listening to this album, I hear such a GOOD 80's new wave influence (like Missing Persons, the Cars,etc) mixed with some hip hop beats. I grew up in the 80s! I brings me back but it doesn't sound recycled...I highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Pop Album by the Best Pop Band","review":"No Doubt used to be a ska band which shared venues with the likes of Sublime, arguably one the best American bands of the past decade.Unfortunately, mainstream audiences didn't respond to their ska-oriented albums, and they saw no other solution but to go pop.Pop is characterized by having no feeling, which actually makes it the antithesis of ska/reggae. In other words, No Doubt, which I still consider to be a wonderful band, sold out for your enjoyment and to stay alive.Nevertheless, leave it to Gwen and Co. to prove the nay-sayers wrong in that pop can be a legitimate music genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD, but could have been better","review":"I love No Doubt. This is a great one to buy, my favorites were Ex-Girlfriend and Simple Kind of Life. Simple Kind of Life sounds bad at first, but after a couple times of listening to, you'll like it more and more. One thing that could have been better: Some of the songs sound the same all the way through. I personally like the song to change at least a little."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME CD","review":"this is a rad CD i waz a bit disappontied becuz it didn't have the same sound of the songs on Tragic Kingdom but after ive listened to the CD a few times i began to love all them.

The songs are so entertaining and very hip. No Doubt has made a great triumph with Return of Saturn and I assure you that you will not regret buying this awesome album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Probably their best","review":"\\"Tragic Kingdom\\" put them on the map, and I love the breezy, fun-loving \\"Rock Steady\\", but \\"The Return of Saturn\\" is probably No Doubt's most artistically accomplished work. I think what makes \\"No Doubt\\" such an intriguing band is the juxtaposition of the mercurial, innovative, fleshed-out sound of the band combined with Gwen Stefani's sincere, vulnerable lyrics and vocals. Those two powerful, yin/yan forces really come together beautifully on a lot of the tracks here. While the band explores and experiments with sounds and influences, Gwen adds the emotional core by singing about lost love, insecurities and longing for family. The result is pop music bliss."},{"rating":"2","title":"Return Of Saturn ROCKS!","review":"I am not a huge fan of No Doubt, but this CD is one of my favorites! I can't stop listening to this CD. Ex-Girlfriend and Bathwater are probably the best songs on this CD. All of the songs are catchy with lyrics about real life and relationships. You can really relate to them. It doesn't sound like Tragic Kingdom but that's a good thing. CD's should all sound different. I would highly recommend this CD to any one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It just gets better","review":"Who'da thunk that they could only get better? No Doubt spectacularly avoided the sophomore slump with this killer followup to \\"Tragic Kingdom.\\" It's different-- and better-- as Spin (or Rolling Stone?) said, \\"if you liked Tragic Kingdom, you'll really like this CD, and if you didn't like Tragic Kingdom, you'll really like this CD.\\" My fave song this week: \\"Six Feet Under,\\" the super New Wave-y '80s throwback of which I just can't get enough. If you liked \\"New\\" on the _Go_ soundtrack, wait 'til you hear it AFTER the extraordinarily haunting \\"Marry Me.\\" You can't go wrong with this soon-to-be-monster followup from my favorite Orange County ska/punk/new wave/'80s denizens, No Doubt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should of stayed on Saturn!","review":"I am sorry, but No Doubt's glory years in my view are over. This album is rather primitive when comparing to their fantastic and energetic Tragic Kingdom. Lyrics are OK and music is nothing special. Return of Saturn lacks all the spontaneity and energy that Tragic Kingdom launched and put No Doubt at the top of the charts. It seems as if No Doubt is moving away toward different directions of music of which only lead singer Gwen Stefani seems to be benefitting from. She should do herself a favor and pursue a solo career and leave the other band members on Saturn."},{"rating":"2","title":"This album is pretty good.","review":"I got this album yesterday, and Im still hearing new things, but what I have heard is very good. The best song on here is the Piano and Strings Instrumental secret track."},{"rating":"2","title":"new wave is back","review":"This cd won't produce the hits that tragic kingdom did, but top to bottom, it's a much better record. A wide variety of 80's music styles, from punk to new wave to ska are paid tribute here, and the band's range and ability to pull them all off is amazing...as for Gwen, her voice, her lyrics, are better than ever, she remains the goddess of all she surveys... this cd rocks hard at times, makes you laugh at times and moves you at times...it's a great, great record."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good try but it's missing something","review":"For the first six songs of \\"Return of Saturn\\", I thought No Doubt had done what I thought was impossible - top \\"Tragic Kingdom\\". But the rest of the CD limped to the finish with an occasional flash of brilliance. Don't get me wrong it is still a must-have, but I think it doesn't have the same staying power as \\"Tragic Kingdom\\". The song that impressed me the most was \\"Simple Kind of Life\\". It ranks right up there with \\"Don't Speak\\" in my opinion has one of the best songs of the last 10 years. A good effort overall from the quartet. Hopefully, it won't be the last"},{"rating":"2","title":"The album get better with time!","review":"First time i listened to the album it seemed that all the songs sounded the same, but after listening to it a few times in the car, it is now clear that this is a good album! The SKA and Reggae beat is there and the lyrics are sharp. All in all a solid album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Cd!!!","review":"I don't think comparing this cd to it's past ones is fair. I think this cd is really great. I had to get it before I went on vacation. But still something is bugging me a bit, it isn't very ska. They pride themselves on being ska, and yet there cd doesn't sound very ska to me. Where is the trumpets? It is still a great cd. Probably my favorite in my cd collection right now. I think it deserves 4 stars, it is wonderful, but missing the ska feel and style. Over all it is a great cd!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"why bother","review":"I will never understand how this group got off the ground. Each new song of theirs grates on me from start to finish, and Gwen Stefani's pouting, hiccupy voice makes me cover my ears and grit my teeth in pain.

I'd rather go to the dentist and listen to muzac: at least those people don't pretend to be \\"way cool.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good","review":"My sister has this CD and it drives me nuts, of course if you like this band then knock yourself out."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Emotional Estrogen Skirt-Fest!","review":"Return to Saturn received rave reviews by critics everywhere. I honestly don't understand why. Saturn's singles are subpar compared to Tragic Kingdom. \\"Ex-Girlfriend\\" is average at best. \\"New\\" has a good chorus line (\\"Don't let it go away...\\"), but the rest of the song just isn't interesting. Nearly every song on the album (except maybe \\"Bathwater,\\" \\"Simple Kind of Life,\\" and \\"Six Feet Under\\") are far from exciting. Most songs deal with Gwen's female-problems including wanting to be married, wanting children, her insecurities, blah blah blah. Maybe you got to be a girl to appreciate this album. Let's just say Return to Saturn isn't exactly going to put hair on your chest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply Wretched","review":"There is NO DOUBT that this will get The Pea's vote for worst album of the year. \\"Ex-Girlfriend\\" is the first single released off of this album. That should tell you just how heinous the rest of it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"How could anyone like this kind of music?","review":"Well i believe it's about everyone's tastes, but really this has no quality artistically speaking.

Every song on this album is good and I really enjoy this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Growing...","review":"Now I feel silly. At first I thought this album was above average, but it's growing on me. At first, I was a little mad about the new, slower tempo sound. In its own right, this is a very good album. Any of the few songs with a horn section (especially \\"Leftovers\\") returned my thoughts to the old school (ha ha) sounds of No Doubt. However, I am sitting here praying, hoping, that they don't give up the old sound completely. The punkier, energetic, ska-like tunes made them what they are. So I shout out to them: Don't forget your roots!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Some very catchy tunes...","review":"Return of Saturn is perhaps the product of a more mature No Doubt, but it hasn't lost any of the qualities that make No Doubt stand out as a unique band. This album is not as diverse as, say, Tragic Kingdom, but it does provide a good mix between rockier, more upbeat tunes such as Ex-Girlfriend, Six Feet Under, and Artificial Sweetener, and slower ballad type tracks such as Simple Kind of Life. Some of you may find that it takes some listening to before some of the songs grow on you though. Is this one better than Tragic Kingdom? Hmm, I'm not entirely sure. In some ways yes, in some ways no. As a whole, I prefer Tragic Kingdom, but there are several tracks on this album which are superior to almost all the tracks on TK, such as Ex-Girlfriend and Artificial Sweetener. Still, this is a great album, and I would certainly recommend it to anybody who already likes No Doubt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Evrey song is wonderfull","review":"This No Doubts best cd yet. All the songs are grate with the lyrics and the music this is a must get cd. I say if you want this cd then get it and you will not regret paying the 15 bucks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Little too tragic but they return to rule the kingdom","review":"Really, this should be rated 3.5 stars. A very good disc that is not quite up to the level of Tragic Kingdom. The anger at every guy feel of Kingdom has given way to the naked anger at oneself that permeates Gwen's lyrics. Ex Girlfriend,Six Feet Under, and New are the logical extensions of the hyper grrl sounds of Tragic. With the countryish Simple Kind Of Life, No Doubt may have written their best tune yet while Gwen successfully wades into Stevie Nicks territory with Magic's In the Makeup. The horn happy Old Bathwater is their one daring exploratory tune akin to Tragic's discoy You Can Do It. The one complaint is the album is a tad too ballad heavy as it seemed the pressure of writing another Don't Speak got to them. Nevertheless, this is a more than solid disc that should be the top rock seller until the arrival of Binaural on 5/6. One last question: How does Gavin feel if Gwen is still obsessed with Kanal?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very \\"New\\" Sound","review":"\\"Return of Saturn\\" is obviously a new and different sound from their last album \\"Tragic Kingdom.\\" No doubt displays a more grown up sound with songs like \\"Magic's in the Makeup\\" and \\"Simple kind of life.\\" Although No Doubt does stick with their true roots with songs like \\"Bathwater\\" and \\"Six Feet Under.\\" Return of Saturn is a great album and will most definetly rise on the charts. Gwen's singing and lyrics are better than ever! I highly recommned this album to anyone that enjoys No Doubt in the least bit."},{"rating":"1","title":"This cd isn't that great","review":"I actually didn't like this album, I really admire this band, but i only like 5 of it's tracks, and those aren't that much great, Ex-girlfriend, Simple Kind of Life, Bathwater, New, and Comforting Lie is the ones i find OK, the rest is weird-style punk, some slow ska-punk and girlish imitation of punk(ex #4) if you are going for this album, please buy another one, don't waste your money"},{"rating":"2","title":"This one unfairly got a bad rep","review":"I like No Doubt a lot too, and this album was different than the others. However, I still liked it a great deal. It's a good breakup CD to listen to, if nothing else. Definitely worth it, if only for the angst value."},{"rating":"2","title":"Supreme Cd from an extraordinary music group!","review":"Return of Saturn is by far the best work that No Doubt has put out, they have come a long way from their Self Titled Cd back in the 80's and have proven that they can make it, despite all the hype. The lyrics are addicting and the beat will keep you humming all day long. Each song has a powerful message about an everyday occurence in life and the guitars,trombone,and drums are incredible making up an amazing sound. Gwen Stefani's vocals really top it off with her array of a pitch and her classy style of presenting herself. This is a must have for anybody intrested in ska or rock or any of the like. No Doubt is definatly in a category of their own"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Cd","review":"I liked this CD better than their old on. I still love their old CD, but I would suggest getting this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"A GREAT RETURN","review":"This is a fun, fast and fabulous album. You can work out to it; you can dance to it; you can drive to work with it. I can't wait for the next one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"There's No Doubt that this is another Number 1 seller","review":"Very rarely do I buy CD's the day they come out. However, this was one of them. I thouroughly enjoyed this album just as much as Tragic Kingdom. I have no complaints of this album. It is obvious however that Gwen's personal life and desire to have children heavily influenced the lyrics. Such as in \\"Bathwater\\", \\"Ex-Boyfriend\\", \\"Simple Kind of Life\\" and \\"Marry Me.\\" I really like the way that No Doubt is heading. It is always good to see a band from you're home town do as well as No Doubt has. Definate props are in order for No Doubt, and I can't wait to see them in concert. Definately buy this album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"This is my favorite CD from No Doubt. it came out 4 and a half years after their breakthrough album TRAGIC KINGDOM. This album is really fun and I just think overall a better album lyrically and musically. It's one I can listen to from start to finish without skipping any tracks. \\"Ex-Girlfriend\\", \\"New\\", \\"Simple Kind of Life\\", \\"Magic's In The Makeup\\" are all great songs. Check it out, definately their best cd!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just plain awesome!!","review":"No Doubt is my favorite band ever..and I must say that this is one of there best albums. It's a change from Tragic Kindom..but not a HUGE one. The songs are less catchy..but that's not a bad thing. The lyrics are great and you really feel that Gwen really believes in what she is singing. The cd starts off with \\"Ex-Girlfriend\\", a face paced song with a harder edge than most of the songs on the cd. Aside from the tempo of the song, it sets the tone for the rest of the cd. This album deals with heartbreak, wanting to be married, and wanting to have kids. Most of the songs are mid-tempo. Some of the best songs on the cd are \\"Ex-Girlfriend\\", \\"Simple Kind of Life\\",\\"Artificial Sweetner\\", \\"Comforting Lie\\" , \\"Too Late\\" and my favorite \\"Bathwater\\". The reason I didn't give this album 5 stars is because some of the songs like \\"Marry Me\\" and especially \\"Dark Blue\\" seem like filler tracks...and aren't very strong songs. Definitely buy this album, you won't be dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"True to their roots","review":"This is a great sounding CD. No Doubt has never lost their distinctive sca foundation, and this cd has some great tracks on it. A good follow-up to the Tragic Kingdom."},{"rating":"1","title":"I expected more","review":"I love No Doubt, but this album... I expected more... yes substance is good, talking about deeper things, but I only listen to \\"ex girlfriend\\" and \\"Go\\". This album just doesn't cut it for me. This album is like a downer. Too sad."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful cd!","review":"I think that this is an excellent CD... actually very different from Tragic Kingdom, I think. This CD didn't have the influence of Eric Stefani, who was no longer a band member at this point, and I think that the sound is interesting. It isn't my very favorite from No Doubt, but I do adore it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stefani shines","review":"Gwen Stefani, the lead singer of No Doubt, has a voice that you either love or hate. Many people I know will switch the radio when they hear her and consider the Moby song 'ruined' when she performed a duet with him. I am from the other camp, of those who think her throaty vocals, that sound as if she has just been crying, are facinating. Because Stefani also writes most of the lyrics, we get a rare opportunity to climb into someone else's head; someone who is young, famous, and trying to be just like the rest of us. This album seems to follow on to the Tragic Kingdom album, almost like a sequel in a book. This is the next phase of adulthood."},{"rating":"1","title":"?","review":"The only truly good song on this CD is #1 X-Girlfriend! That song has a good beat. I bought all of No Doubt's prior CD's to this one, I don't really like any of their songs besides, Excuse Me Mr. Just A Girl, and X-Girlfriend. I wouldn't call No Doubt untalented, the guys CAN play music, even if it did sound like the Circus was coming to town on Tragic. On this CD, the Circus sound does not show up much. Gwen is very pretty, it is true, but I can't believe that people are going out to buy No Doubt's albums because she is lovely. I would like to say that Gwen can't sing, but that wouldn't be true, because she can sing, she just does NOT sound good to me! The songs on this album are so slow! The album loses speed after the #1 song!"},{"rating":"1","title":"SO SAD YOU'RE HAPPY NOW","review":"Some bands seem to thrive and create their best music out of turbulent romance and internal intrigue. Cases in point; Fleetwood Mac created Rumors, Oasis created Whats the Story..., No Doubt created Tragic Kingdom. With the Return of Saturn, Gwen Stefani is waxing poetic (and not very well) on marriage, motherhood and the joys of love. Given the sassy, take that attitude of Tragic Kingdom, Return of Saturn sounds warmed over, listless and uninspired. 5 years in the making, it seems like too little too late. From a personal standpoint I'm glad and hope Gwen and Gavin are very happy; from a musical one, I can't wait until that relationship burns in flames...there's the next great No Doubt Album."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Doubt's Softer Sound","review":"Frankly, I am dissapointed in this new CD, I was looking for the faster punk rock that I was used to hearing from them, but when I put this CD in for the first time, it sounded like a completely different band. Aside from \\"New\\" and \\"Ex-Girlfriend\\" all of the songs are VERY mellow."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO, Thank You!!","review":"When did Missing Persons make a comeback??? Oh wait their now calling themselves NO DOUBT these days."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is what I waited for?","review":"O.k. I'm 33 years old, which probably makes me the oldest No Doubt fan in the world. But I loved Tragic Kingdom. I think it's one of the best albums of the 90's (not saying much) with influences from ska to hardcore to salse.But the entirety of Return to Saturn is like the last two songs on Tragic Kingdom -- just kind of there, with no real purpose. These songs just drone on without really doing anything. There's no energy, no creativity and no substance.I'm disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Doubt an Alanis Morissette spin-off?","review":"Gwen Stefani continues an age of whiny women singers (Alanis Morissette). The lyrics are so-so and the music is a little bit better. The song 'Ex-Girlfriend' is extreamly repetitive. This CD is tolarable but not recomeneded execept for hardcore Alanis fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"No doubt definatly matures with thier latest release.","review":"Follwing up Tragic Kingdome was no easy task, but No Doubt's 2 year break from touring surly paid off. The punk rock Ex-girlfriend single shows the versitility of No Doubt with its catchy chorus and great interlude. While I'm not in love with, Simple kind of life, I would hope the hauntingly beautiful ballad, too late, be their next single. This song shows the true originality of No Doubts creation.....and is beautifully stripped down in the classical piano bonus track hidded after the final song. From the first to the last song, No Doubt again will thrill you with their unique sound that can never be dublicated. Definatly a must have for any music enthusiast. Gary"},{"rating":"2","title":"No Doubts \\"Return\\" was worth its wait","review":"Even though it has been 5 years since no doubt spun into the mainstream music scene with a Ska/Alternative hit album, their new album \\"Return of Saturn\\" proves that they are talented musicians with Staying power. Their sound has matured as with the lyrics. Even with a few subtle electronic type sounds that give the album a \\"futuristic\\" type appeal. The album features hit songs like Ex-Girlfriend, New, and \\"Simple kind of Life,\\" along with bonus tracks \\"Big Distraction\\" and \\"Full Circle,\\" that are not available on the US version of the album, and in my opinion these 2 songs are great tracks that should have been placed on every release. Over all this is a great CD that has the ability to please not only die hard No Doubt fans, but new-comers as well. \\"Return of Saturn\\" will have you returning for more and more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty good album","review":"I thought this album was pretty good! I don't like the last 2 tracks on the Cd, but the rest is pretty cool! Gwen's voice is much softer this time, and she sings beautifully! The lyrics are awesome as usual. I do like \\"Tragic kingdom\\" alot more for some reason. It's like this album is too \\"soft-pop\\" at times. It's not too heavy like in \\"Tragic kingdom\\" or \\"the Beacon street collection\\".

After long uses of hard gripping, plastic will chafe your skin away also. But the blades are great, I love those. I will buy these blades again for my other utility knives.

It looks so professional out of the box, but wait til you try to use it. The biggist problem is keeping blades in the knife. Any drag whatsoever, and the blade pulls right out of the knife handle.The two knife halves are held together with a spring action locking system, and they simply don't squeeze together tightly enough. You can't keep a blade in on any weight siding paper, but blades often pull out when cutting shims, or other wood materials, too. However, the worst feature of this product is it can be a hazzard. On one occasion I noticed that a blade stored inside the handle slipped through the butt end of the handle and was protruding about 1/2\\" out of the handle. It could have easily sliced my holding hand. I've abandoned using this knife and gone back to old an trusty generic type. Use this knife with caution.Jason-------Carmel Valley"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I was expecting","review":"After viewing a few blades, I picked this one out because it looked very industrial. It worked well at first. I used it to open boxes, cut open plastic packaging. Then I started to use it while working around the house. Cutting drywall; the blade comes out. Scoring silicone around sinks and bathtubs; the blade comes out. Scoring paint along moldings; the blade comes out. Now my spring activated opener doesn't work anymore. I have to pry it open with a screw driver.I gave this a 1 star because it has a high price and very little value due to fact the blades pull out and my opener ceased to work.If you are looking for a blade that you can work with. Look elsewhere. If you want an over priced amazon-package-opener to store in your kitchen drawr. This might just be for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be close to an emergency room","review":"This knife stinks, not only does the blade pull out (noted in other reviews) but STORING the blades in the handle is a NIGHTMARE.

(Being illegitimate, she had no claim to the succession.) Though she never married, Charlotte had three children by Prince Ferdinand de Rohan, who were raised in the strictest secrecy regarding their parentage; none were even mentioned in Charlotte's will of 1789. However, the author provides convincing documentation that the youngest of Charlotte's children, Marie Victoire de Rohan, was legitimated by her father and married a Polish nobleman named Nikorowisc. Their granddaughter, in turn, married Count Leonard Pininski and became the author's great-great-grandparents. Claiming descent from the exiled Stewarts is practically a cottage industry, but Pininski, whose mother was a Scot and who grew up in Britain, makes a good case for the validity of his particular line."},{"rating":"1","title":"Window screen repair tool","review":"This item was a real disappointment.

Yes, Solti does deserve his spot among the great Mahlerians; his Mahler's Eighth is arguably the best available, and I do get a guilty pleasure from his Second. Still, Solti only captures half of Mahler's world at best; he has little sensitivity for the reflective and delicate emotional aspects of Mahler's music. In all fairness, no single boxed-set of Mahler's symphonies by any one conductor adequately captures the whole of Mahler's music; perhaps Kubelik's comes closest. At any rate, before you declare yourself a Solti/Mahler die-hard, give a listen to Horenstein's Third, Barbirolli's Fifth, and Bernstein's Ninth with the Berlin Philharmonic (not the Vienna Philharmonic). You owe yourself a listen to the very best of Mahler."},{"rating":"2","title":"Girls Aloud","review":"This album is a great follow up to there nwe single No Good Advice, it has a mix or r abd b, rock and of course pop!

I think their good lyrics make up whatever else they may lack, personally, because I've been waiting forever for a pop band to actually show us (even if they didn't write their own lyrics) that they have something decent to say. (We smoke as we choke/As we sink another Coke) and (Danger is a lazy girl with no soul/Here I am dirty hands..)

Believe me, this song will blow you away. The girls try and do a ballad, \\"Forever and A Night\\", but for right now, they need to stick to more up-tempo tracks, because that's the weakest song on the album.

Three major problems: biggest is short battery life-just over 2 hrs, and I was very careful (and once it's dead you're done until you can recharge). The Sony HD minidisk recorder gets 6 hrs with a battery add on. Next are the separate monophonic mini microphone inputs that are not compatible with any quality mikes I know of, and third, adjusting recording levels is overly complex with no quick way to adjust both channels, not a good thing for live recording.A good try that needs a few key design tweaks"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hendee is better than this","review":"Being a fan of the Noble Dead series, I was looking forward to reading something different by Barb Hendee. I think she cut her teeth on this novel, because the writing just didn't even compare. The characters were pretty flat - I found myself not caring much about any of them, save an elderly vampire with dementia, and I really didn't care about the humans, either. Eleisha, our \\"heroine\\" vascillates between acting human but not really being able to feel human, but feeling sorry for humans...see where this is going? She's an anemic character in an anemic plot, offset by stronger, more evil vampires that seem out of place sharing a novel with her. So all in all, I was sorry I read it. I will, however, continue on with the Noble Dead series, which is fantastic in comparison."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great story on a great topic","review":"\\"Blood Memories\\" is a a great book that demonstrates that being a vampire would be a tradgy. Barb Hendee's inturpritation of the vampire condition is wounderful, and though it has little violence, it makes up for it in a killer plot. I would definently recomend this book to anyone who likes books in the vampire gendre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great books","review":"I have been a keen reader of the noble dead sagas but these books by Barb blow them out of the water.These are some of the best books I have read in a long time an once I started to read them I can't put them down.If your use to reading the noble dead sagas then you may find it hard to read Hunting memories.

All of the songs on this album are re-recordings - they are NOT ORIGINAL!! They are sung by Tommy Roe, but they are NOT the genuine, original recordings, and they just don't sound the same! I believe that Amazon should WARN people, in BOLD TYPE, if an album is made up of re-mixed or re-recorded songs or if songs are done by someone other than the original artists!! The only way to protect yourself is to read the description very carefully - to see if the songs are by the original artist, first of all - and then to listen to the music samples of the songs in the song list. IF the list of songs does NOT offer music samples (Windows Media Player, etc.) then BEWARE!! Somebody would rather not let you hear them before you buy! I'm going to be very careful in the future!I feel like I was ripped off. But, for six dollars, it's not worth the shipping to send the disc back.

I know there are many versions of this story, but the one with the fairy godmother has always been the one closest to my heart. When I first saw the cover of this book I was already entranced with its beauty. Never have I seen Cinderella's ball-gown so detailed and lush with colour and magnificence! Being an artist myself, I give alot of attention to the visual part of a book. With all respect, I must say that whomsoever criticises the book's pictures in a negative way really needs to learn about the beauty of original art! K. Y.

So the album title is a premonition that the great rock will return to the U.S. They are right. This album is a juke-box style album where various forms of rock are packed in. When She's Good She's Good reminds me of Van Halen, She's Gone/I Do--Foreigner, Dead Dog--Led Zeppelin, My Secret--U2. Start with your favorite style of rock and after a few listens you will find yourself hooked to the whole album. MY SECRET and CHERRY CHERRY are sure-hit tracks which fit well in radio airplay and the rest of the tracks also have high potential in modern rock track charts. Let's celebrate the return of the great rock and D2's forthcoming return to the mainstream."},{"rating":"1","title":"New Music is Un-good","review":"I guess even great bands like Danger Danger are releasing horrible music. Well I guess it's not their fault, and if I wasn't so into 80's rock I probably would have liked it, but there's just something about the music nowadays that I don't like. It doesn't have a cheesy pop rock sound to it anymore. This album is nothing compared to their others. Even Poison is releasing music I don't like, Power to the People really stunk! I went to a Poison concert last year and when Poison played the Power to the People song, Poison almost got booed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amateur effort - not recommended","review":"Wouldn't recommend it except to fill out your background reading of a fairly obsessive couple preparing to and then climbing.

The book is dense with practical tips on getting in shape, getting there, and getting to the top, with just about everything to keep you out of trouble in-between. This is not a page turner for the professional mountain climber or the extreme sport fanatic. But for the average hiker with aspirations for a sunrise at the top of Africa, it's hard to imagine a better guide. Pay special attention to the tips for staying healthy - the authors (both from the Mayo Clinic) obviously know of what they write."},{"rating":"2","title":"Monument to Mediocrity","review":"Perhaps an even greater achievement than climbing some tourist trap is reaching the final page of this tedious, self-absorbed, mind-numbing journal. A fine example of children's literature, this is unfortunately intended for adults. The grammar and use of language is haphazard at best, almost as if the authors were grabbing words out of a hat rather than taking advantage of the well known, universal rules of the English language. Yokels might appreciate the prose being tailored to them, but educated individuals will have difficulty stooping to the level of this stumbling narrative.And unfortunately, I must agree with the previous reviewer who pointed out the anatomy inaccuracies.This book, however, is not without its strengths. One can appreciate the great value the authors place on their climbing 'achievement,' much like the satisfaction felt upon surviving Disney's Space Mountain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreary","review":"I didn't think it was possible to make Kilimanjaro sound dull, but this author has tried very hard to. The Forewords etc are excellent -- but then they are written by other people -- it's just the meat of the book that's at fault. Some more practical advice would have been useful too. I climbed Kili in June this year and while this book came with me to the summit, it remained in my backpack the whole time. Nothing beats a good (human) guide, of course, but even if you do decide you need a guidebook, there are better ones on the market than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just one big ego trip wrapped up as a guidebook.","review":"Lack of practical info, badly edited, quite a few errors. . . just a big ego trip for the author.

The melancholy, the autumnal sound, the lovely sadness, particularly of the 2nd movements. Brahms is not just another Beethoven. Some orchestras and conductors just don't get it. My favorites are Toscanini, Furtwangler, Munch, Walter, Karajan, to mention just a few. This same lovely sound is also available to you by way of the Clarinette Quintet with Oppenheim and the Budapest, the Alto Rhapsody, the German Folk Songs with the Roger Wagner Chorale, the Song of Destiny.

Great music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Renditions of the Brahms Symphonies","review":"I can only share the enthusiasm of reviewers who praise these performances by Georg Solti and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. I own most of the Brahms box sets (Chailly, Harnoncourt, Karajan, Bernstein, Bohm, etc.), but I have to say I'm most impressed with these recordings. I actually prefer Solti's and Harnoncourt's to Karajan's acclaimed cycle.I'm not sure what is about these performances that make them so great. The tempi are excellent and not rushed. The overall sound quality is really good, especially considering this particular box set was released in 1991. The performance from the Chicago Symphony is excellent.To all those who enjoy Brahms' music, you really should consider this set. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"From compositions to cost: a superb 4-cd collection","review":"Brahms's four symphonies represent a good example of\\"quality over quantity\\". Like most perfectionists, Brahms was his own worst critic, and the very fact that he considered these symphonies worthy of publishing says volumes about their musical value. Moreover, they are more than deserving of the time and effort invested in them by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, conductor Georg Solti, and London records (my deepest gratitude goes out to all who played a part in bringing about these superb recordings). And given that this four-cd collection is priced less than two cds makes it head-and-shoulders above most other current bargains. If I had a nickel for every time I've listened to one of these symphonies, I might have enough to buy a back-up copy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Already known excellence","review":"Excellent - I already had audiotapes of these performances and I am now glad to have the CD's, too.

The Sports Instruments had at least as many functions yet was much easier to use. I am sure that it can't be to difficult, and I will look up the steps again, but the functions should be organized better so I can figure it out without remembering the minutia.I guess I will live with the middling user interface for a reasonably-priced heat rate monitor that has worked flawlessly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice... good little training tool and toy","review":"I bought this HRM to help me as I began a training program, and decided on this one rather than a Polar monitor because it was cheaper and because it was a Timex.

It's not something that I personally would go around wearing all the time, but it's easy to read and the buttons are easy to use. The indigo is not ideal for when I'm running on the street in the evening since it lights up the numbers rather than the whole face of the watch, but this is a tiny issue.Overall, fantastic product, and I'm so glad that something this well-featured is availiable at such a competitive price from Timex."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bought in Apr10.

Would highly recommend this device!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good watch...good value","review":"I was a little skeptical about this watch buying it based on a picture and some research as I like to have my hands on things before I buy them but this was a very good choice for an active person. I use this 6 days a week for various training from running to biking to weights. This is a good sized face, the back light is just right although it would be nice if it stayed on until the user selected it off. The functions and set up are all very easy and after a quick run through of the manual you really don't have to refer to it again.One thing I don't like is the value of your ratings are only established by your weight...no gender or age. I have yet to use this in a pool yet so I am not sure how water tight it is either but for dry ground workouts it has proven to be a good value in the two months I have been using it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Easy to use","review":"This is the 3rd heart rate watch I've bought, I had a Polar and a Nike, the Polar was great, very, very easy to use, the Nike was rubbish, and this one was supposed to be the best---but its very difficult to use (I mean anything besides the heart rate part)---recording workouts, the interface, and calories burned--are not clear. I still have not found out how to see Calories burned, and there is no indication of how to see calories burned in the instruction manual--even though it says that it calculates calories burned on the box and in the description.As a heart rate monitor--it is very accurate, but for everything else it suffers with a poor, confusing interface--I don't even bother wearing it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading description","review":"Misleading description of product, not good sales & marketing approach! Will post negative facts on lineProduct sucks sucks sucks"},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning.","review":"There was nothing wrong with the functions; however, the wrist band that i received was gray. One of the reasons why I got it was because people said it looked aesthetically pleasing and it was okay to wear it when you are not working out. The images on the site show that the wrist band is black which looks nice, but the gray wrist band makes the watch looks really ugly. Decided to send it back, which was the first time i ever had to do that when i bought something online. They weren't able to replace it, only able to refund me."},{"rating":"2","title":"It does what it's supposed to","review":"Purchased this watch about 3 weeks ago. It works great! Heart rate always works and I also use it as a general timepiece and a timer. No problem and it's easy to use for the basic stuff. I really don't need anything more than the heart rate and target zone/history and the timer. I did find the directions a little difficult to understand but it's that kind of thing where if you don't use it a lot you have to keep referring to the book... who has the time. Would have given it 5 stars if the literature were a little more user friendly."},{"rating":"1","title":"not very good","review":"The basic functionality of this watch was good while it lasted. It usually gave me an nice summary of each workoutbut:1..I am skeptical of the accuracy of the calorie count.2..The plastic watch band started to crack and I had to have it replaced.3..The chest strap has stopped working and nothing I did fixed the problem- so I can no longer use this watch.I wish Timex could send me a new chest strap!For these reasons I cant recommend this watch. Try something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great monitor for the price","review":"My wife and I set a goal for 2013 to get healthier. I purchased a pair of Timex T5J031's to help monitor our calorie, heart rate, and other stats. It has been a great tool in helping us meet our fitness goals."},{"rating":"2","title":"First Time User of Heart Rate Monitor","review":"The Timex T5J031 is the first heart rate monitor I have used. The instructions were easy to follow and the watch was easy to set up. The monitor has been used with a treadmill that also measures heart beat and the two instruments were within one beat of each other."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Basic Monitor","review":"I purchased this monitor for my spinning class. My instructor told me I should be sure to get a digital monitor rather than an analog monitor because you will pick up the heart rates of nearby cyclers with an analog. Very good advice. Apparently even the digital can pick up another heart rate if the batteries are low. I didn't give this a 5-star rating only because the instructions are difficult to understand if you are trying to use all of the various functions of the monitor. If you just want to use the straight heart rate monitor, this is a good economical choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for HRM!","review":"Seems to be accurate for HRM.

The screen of the first watch froze. This watch stopped communicating with the transmitter. I have friends with Timex monitors that work fine, but I have had bad luck, and plan to switch to a different brand.On the plus side, the watch was easy to set up and the directions are clearly written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mistake, Mistake","review":"As a watch this Timex T5J031 is great - but trying to use for heart rate monitor - horriable. The chest belt stopped collecting data in less than a month - not sure if it's battery or what - but hate this watch. Had to order another without chest belt. I read the reviews but did not listen to the low rated reviewers (should have)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed - might have been good but not water resistant","review":"I was looking forward to using this for running. I liked the combination of features, the style, ease of use. I jumped in the pool after my second run with it. When I got out there was water in the crystal. I hadn't pushed any buttons while in the pool and was never more than a couple feet under. My previous Timex's never had this problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor performer","review":"This product does not allow you to add real information about yourself (i.e., age, weight, height, etc.). The result, calorie burn count comes out about half of what you really burn. Absolutely no accuracy. I sent it back quick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning,,, Does not display HR on Gym Cardio Machines","review":"This is my third HRM over the last 10 years, the previous two were both Polar models. When I bought this HRM I made the WROMG assumption that my Gym's cardio equipment would pick up the HR signal from the chest strap and display it on the machines' display, nope. I like this feature as it is much easier to track HR on the cardio machine display rather than glancing down at my watch. Obviously the signal protocol is not industry standard, sucks! The two brands of cardio machines that I tried this on were LifeFitness and Cybex and apparently they only seem to pick up HR signals from Polar HRM straps. So I am in the process of returning this HRM.I was surprised that I did not see any feedback about this in the reviews for this product. I actually like this HRM but it does not meet all my requirements."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good to Go","review":"Everything I expected and more. I've used it constantly since I bought it and I have no complaints. I thought there was a problem with the heart rate function until I realized that I didn't have the chest strap on, Duhhh. Good product, worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loving my new Timex","review":"I am super excited about the purchase of my Timex T5J031 Unisex Fitness Heart Rate Monitor. I have owned others and paid much more for other's that worked ok, but my main goal was to see the Calorie burned indoors as well as outdoors. It is easy to set up and use and I have been getting very accurate results. I would highly recommend this product, it works well and it is a great price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product!","review":"This is best workout tool I have ever purhcased. It works great and I really like being able to see how many calories I've burned after a workout. The chest strap is comfortable and I like that fact that I will be able to change the battery myself whenever it dies. I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to monitor their heart rate during a workout and keep it in a specific range."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does the job","review":"First watch didn't work but Amazon was great and sent an immediate replacement. Second watch and chest band work just fine. I'd give this a five star except that this heart rate monitor will not show up on the computer on my Lamond bike (my Polar monitor and Omitron monitor both do). But - it does track my calories in the watch, so that is really useful when I'm on the rowing machine or on the weight machines. Chest band is comfy and when the watch band is fastened at the very last hole, it curves around my wrist nicely. I would recommend it and recommend you buy it from Amazon just in case you have a problem with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked for awhile","review":"At first I loved the performance, but now I can't even get a heart beat after changing batteries etc. I have only had this device for 2.5 months."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just doesn't work anymore","review":"This watch was FANTASTIC for about 9 months. Then it simply stopped registering a heartbeat anymore (after going insane for a few days telling me my heart rate was 190+ while standing still). Really enjoyed the layout, fit, different modes and the strap was comfortable. Replaced all batteries and reset the transmitter but to no avail."},{"rating":"1","title":"water damage after first swim","review":"This watch is not water-proof at all. The first time I went swimming water leaked inside and now the display is not readable. I swim laps, no diving - I'm very disappointed with this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great HRM","review":"Bought this for tracking calorie burn and keeping in the zone for Slim in 6, and now P90X. It is easy to set up, as long as you read the instructions. The strap is comfortable once you get used to it (feels weird at first).My only complaint is that the calorie burn calculator does not take into consideration the fact that I am female. For example, after a round of Plyometrics it will say my burn was 1000+ calories, in fact it was only 700ish. Not a huge deal, I just have to take a few minutes after my workout to crunch the numbers.Overall, this HRM is a great tool for fitness and weight loss. It will tell you when your heart rate is too low or too high, which is really motivating. For the price and functionality you really can't beat it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alarm loud enough","review":"I purchased this watch/heart rate monitor in 2009 and it is still working well. One of my main concerns when I purchased this watch was that the timer alarm would be loud enough to hear while jump-roping and listening to music with ear-buds. While I don't always hear the alarm signaling the end of my workout, I usually do. I however do not have my music volume real loud. It is certainly louder than any other watch I have tried. Overall I am happy with all the functions of the watch. I can also set a range that I want to keep my heart-rate at and can hear the beeping of the watch if it gets too slow or too fast."},{"rating":"1","title":"worked great for three months","review":"Ordered this HRM to maintain target heart rate during workouts. Liked all the features that the watch provides. But like the title, it worked great for three months. Now it is not receiving data from the chest strap. Would wipe down the transmitter after every work and it still crapped out on me. New batteries with a reset did nothing. Well on to search for a new HRM that will last more than a couple months."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Awesome about sums it up. This product is ready to go and very user friendly. The feature of H/R zone (5) plus chrono is great.If your thinking about a top end H/R monitor at a budgit price this is it. Polars are so over rated! Come on, a Polar with with same features will run you well over a $100.00."},{"rating":"2","title":"FIrst HRM watch","review":"I wanted to get a read on my heart rate during my runs and when I was at rest. My rest rate is very low. The watch is easy to use and set up. The actual Monitor fits around your chest and requires a little moisture in order to pick up the Electrical Signal that makes your heart beat. If it is on snug and moistened I believe the rate to be 99% accurate. I read a lot of reviews before pciking this one the one that caught my attention was how easy it was to start using it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent value for the money","review":"If all you need is a heart rate monitor that will provide continuous readout and time in and out of zone- if you're running or riding a bike and want to make sure that you are getting an adequate workout- I don't think there is a better buy on the market at this price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Bought my unit about 18 months ago to replace an Acumen EON basic which was unreliable and inaccurate. Based on the reviews I expected a change but was sorely disappointed. The unit started giving erroneous readings within a few months. Changed transmitter batteries and did the reset the manual calls for. Would work for awhile and then flop. Finally, the company sent me a new transmitter. It too worked for several months before producing readings way too high or low. Changed batteries and many resets later, the watch stopped producing a heart rate. Decided to bite the bullet and try Polar even if I have to send the watch in to change batteries."},{"rating":"2","title":"My first HRM","review":"I have run used this HRM for several weeks now and am pretty happy with it. It is my first one, so I have nothing to compare it to. I have found it to be quite easy to use and very helpful in making my runs meaningful. I have used it at the Y a few times and it doesn't work with their machines. I ran a 5k with it and for some reason it didn't start sending a good signal until half way through. I like the cal. function and I like that I can see the heart rate, the zone I am in, and the time all at once.As far as keeping it simple and stupid, this watch is it. Nothing too fancy, just another extremely reliable Timex product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Water in the Watch","review":"This watch has leaked water into the wrist watch after 10 months of use. I don't dive, but swim laps in a pool. If the watch did not leak water, I would give it a 4 out of 5 for over all performance. Be cautioned, if you buy this watch it may leak water into the display."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good First Heart Monitor","review":"this is my first fitness watch. I've been using this for over a month during the gym and when I run, about 2 hours a day. I love how it shows your heart rate so you'll know you're always in the right exercise zone. it has not failed me yet and I'm glad I bought it. The instructions are very easy to understand, especially for a first timer like me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great HRM watch","review":"I bought this about 6 months ago, and I love it. It works great, easy to read display with lots of display options to based on what you want to see at the time by simply clicking the Heart Monitor button.The monitor itself is comfortable and provides easy access to change the battery, though mine is still running so I haven't had to change the battery yet.My girlfriend has one as well and we work out together at home in close proximity and have not had any problems with crossed signals or anything like that.The steps in entering your stats (age, weight, etc...) are simple to follow.Bottom line is that it's got lots of features for the price. And I've been using it between 3-6 days a week for nearly 6 months with no issues, and my girlfriend has been doing the same for 3 months and no issues with hers either. There's nothing that screams \\"Wow!\\" about this watch, it just does what it's supposed to do.I'm glad I didn't waste my money on a Polar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Product with Lousy Instructions","review":"I purchased the Timex fitness watch based on positive reviews. It looked like just what I wanted to upgrade from a lesser value fitness watch. When it arrived I programed it and made sure the battery was in the chest strap and then tried to make it work. I was quite surprised when I could not get a heart beat icon on the watch. I pushed the right button and adjusted the strap---still nothing.I then started reading the instruction booklets and they did not help in any way. The booklets seem to be focused on fitness theory and workout max and min. There was no clear instructions on how to get the watch to work. No troubleshooting.I'm very familiar with fitness watches as I have used them for more than 10 years. I would rate this watch as a do not buy. I sent it back to Amazon for a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"This product did not work for me.","review":"I was so excited to order this watch, however it did not work at all for me! I could not even get the heart rate monitor to work for over a few seconds. And, yes, I did wet the parts on the strap that help it work. I even went out and bought a new battery right away and it still did not work.However, I did send it back, got my money back and ordered a Polar watch and I LOVE it and it worked right away!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I have always liked Timex products. The Ironman brand is well respected and easy to use. The heart rate monitor technology used in these watches has much to be desired, however. I have never gotten a consistent heart rate on this watch. I have gone through 3 different chest straps, which Timex replaced no questions asked, and countless batteries. I have used ultrasound gel on the chest strap as well for better conduction... still no consistent HR. I love the functionality of the watch but the HR is frustrating. I went with this brand originally because you can replace the battery yourself. Polar has since come out with a few models with that feature. I finally switched over to a Polar and no problems whatsoever. Sorry Timex, I love the watch but the HRM stinks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does what it says","review":"The watch and the heart monitor worked perfectly on first try. I have been using them for a couple of months, and the watch always has received a signal. The instructions are a little complicated for all the things you can measure. It came with three small instruction booklets, instead of one inclusive one, but I am only interested in heart rate monitoring and a determination of calories burned, as well as the usual watch functions. For that, it has been flawless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inexpensive and accurate","review":"Works as advertised.I have a 44 \\" chest and the band is a little tight at the largest position.The watch band is not as flexible as I would like.The equipment works in every function as stated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strap too short, BPM way wrong","review":"I just got my new Timex, I was excited due to the highly positive reviews in this page.My first problem was with the chest strap: it is too small for me even at the maximum position. I have a large chest size (I am a male, 5'9, 192 Lb, my chest is large I admit), so it is very uncomfortable, I can barely breath. I have a Polar strap and monitor and that strap fits me fine without even extending the setting to the maximum.The second problem I found is the heart rate showing 30 BPM!!! I must be dead I guess... in fact my resting hear rate as measured in other ways is exactly double that value (60). The 30 figure is way wrong of course.In short, I'll be packing this toy back to Amazon after no more than a couple of hours in my possession."},{"rating":"1","title":"Timex T5J031 Digital Heart Rate Monitor Watch w/Chest Strap","review":"It worked fine at home; however, when I went to the fitness center and worked up a little sweat, it quit working."},{"rating":"1","title":"The chest strap for this is very small and itchy.","review":"I am a male around 5'10\\" around 300lbs, I have always had a stocky build.

The instructions are pretty easy to follow, but I must admit that the features are not very intuitive and some of the language in the instructions is confusing to follow. Took me about 10 minutes to get it programmed. I wish it more readily displayed the Calories Burned rather than having to wait and see it in review mode following my workout, but all-in-all it does what I need.

However, I question the stated capacity, which may only be obtained by filling all the way up to the top, including in the spout. And, as other reviewers have stated, it is impossible to fill through the center opening because the handle gets in the way no matter which way you turn your tea kettle; plus the handle \\"gives\\" when the filled pot is lifted,leading me to question its eventual durability.

The numbered movements in the 9th are not as listed, and one must change discs to hear the 9th in entirety. I don't know what the big deal is about Solti's jerky interpretations, and the quality of the orchestra's performance is mediocre. Poor intonation permeates their renditions and gives one the feeling this is a special edition of bad takes. There's nothing wrong with Beethoven, and the poor recording may not be doing justice to Solti and his orchestra, but be forewarned that this is a poor set of recordings. PolyGram should apologize. If I could get my money back, I would purchase Szell's recordings.

As another reviewer suggested, dental floss is the only way to clear the leaves from the slits when cleaning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"First of all, this teapot is so pricey because it is mouth-blown. However, the quality does not match the price. The strainer is a piece of glass with slits cut in it to strain the water. However, the design is poorly made because the tea leaves end up blocking the passage and water does not get through. Secondly, the teapot is made of very thin and fragile glass. A simple tap against the sink will be enough to cause a chip on the infuser. And lastly, the infuser and lid are very loose fitting causing them to wiggle freely around the teapot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice looking pot, but way too fragile","review":"The first pot was broken when i opened the box. I did not think anything of it, as accidents happen during shipping. So i returned it and got another one(super fast, A+ for amazon returns department). We used it for several days and were really liking it, other than it can be hard to clean depending on the size of the tea you are brewing, as the slits can get clogged. Then one day i was washing the strainer and it tipped over and shattered. I did not drop it on the floor, it simply tipped over while drying and broke. I had a feeling this would happen, because as soon as we took it out of the box i was thinking how fragile the pot looked. This would be a good pot if the glass was thicker, but as it is it is way too thin, both the pot and the strainer.

And knowing that, that he didn't even recognize her when he saw her again nine years later?There was little heat between the characters (honestly, by the time they got to it, I was too irritated to care) and too many other distractions going on.

The author demonstrates good knowledge and expertise in the subject and provides very helpful examples and interesting implementations. The illustrations in the book also make understanding MDX easier, since MDX, like XPath, has some concepts like hierarchies and context that are best understood by visualization.However, his writing style is very parenthetical and rife with interludes, which is sometimes irksome and disrupt a smooth flow of ideas.Buy it if you're building a non-trivial UI for Analysis Services or asked to generate sophisticated reports.

Many explanations of functions could really benefit from editor's touch (bold here, cursive there). Try to figure out the meaning of a new function when one sentence contains three words \\"level\\" and each one refers to something different.

Next day check stock and tweak recipe according to customer feedback. Once your recipe is set then everyday check the weather and add or subtract ice accordingly. Check stock of supplies and tweak ice and that is it everyday. Not a lot of options to really do much. Each type of stand has a choice of upgrades but you can only purchase a limited number and then in order to have any other upgrade you must sell one that you already purchased.

My 5 year old is able to connect most of the pieces but does have some difficulty connecting joints when the structure is near completion.

Also, the proofreading is bad, with many typos, and the photographs are generally of such poor quality that they are almost useless. The writing is generally uneven as well.All of this gives the impression that this book was a rushed and lightly-treated project. I will search for a better one on the same topic."},{"rating":"1","title":"unreadable drivel","review":"After being enthralled by Luc Sante's \\"Low Life\\" (The best NYC history ever written) I'd hoped perhaps for some gems of storytelling about this street's amazing past, but all I found were tedious commentaries with all the style and allure of a real estate listing.It's hard to believe that this author has received acclaim for other writings, as the style is devoid of any vibrancy that would compel me to complete even a paragraph at a time without groaning from the effort.Even the few photographs in this book are hard to look at, thanks to the low resolution, poor printing and low quality paper. I'm a big-time NYC nostalgia fan, but this book is useless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly, the BEST of the S!","review":"Unlike all of the other reviews you see on this page, there's no need for me to rate all of the songs, because in my mind I think that S Club deserves a big fat FIVE for ALL of the songs, whether old or new. The Greatest hits album consists of 13 hit singles (bring it all back, s club party, 2 in a million/you're my number one, reach, natural, nhadct, dsm, have you ever, you, alive, love ain't gonna wait and say goodbye:-(, plus the 2 bonus tracks. I do think that they should have put some more unreleased songs on there such as, 'Rain' 'A million love songs,' and a personal favorite of mine, 'Diskotek!' Overall, this is a great collection for S Club fans worldwide! They've been my favorite band since day one, and they will stay that way forever! Even if you're not an S club fan, I'm sure there's a little part in you that actually liked them...after all, they are the 'Best'!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Item not received!","review":"I was rather confused to be asked to review an item that I have never received!

Fine scratches on the s/s shaft, and the top screw was stripped. Not happy about this!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pitiful","review":"This was among the least romantic books I have ever read. The heroine - Samone never really told the hero, Jon that she loved him. Samone treated Jon as someone to spend time with until a black man comes along. It is just as well there was no mention of marriage, because one got the sense that this relationship will not last. There was no real love or passion. If like me you like your love scenes to be passionate if not steamy, this book is a complete let down - the love scenes are treated as an afterthought. For example, this is a bulid up to a love scene, \\" Jon turned off the lights and turned up the music.\\" The next paragraph begins with \\"Morning. Samone woke in a panic.\\" If I could have given less than one star I would. Do not waste your money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good book","review":"I thought MJH did a good job of exploring interracial relationships. I was interested from beginning to end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Talk about selfish.","review":"Ladies if you \\"don't need no man\\" read this manual on how to keep men far away from you, and you will never have a man. The main character was so selfish that I wondered if the author was serious. She made her out to be some wronged woman because she couldn't get a man to agree to a marriage. She was the most selfish character I can ever remember reading.I just got put on to this author and have started ordering her whole catalouge. I love the way she writes and can't wait to read the rest of her books. Although I hated the main character it wasn't because of the writing. Very entertaining book."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was the Deal in this book?","review":"How in the world do you explain investing 4 years of your life with someone and just because they are not ready to cross the line of marriage when you want them to, you get spiteful and go and have an abortion. How is it that you are so ungrateful to the fact that even though you are not married, Max is totally devoted to her, caters to her every whim, faithful to her, and she still isn't satisfied. How do you justify Max being dumped by Samone and not trying to fight for her after all of this time, and not confronting her regarding the pregnancy that was there until the day she goes to the abortion clinic. No man wants to see his unborn child be aborted regardless of the motives. It seems to me that these two people gave up on fighting for their relationship. In comes Jon and all of a sudden Samone can now find true love. She seems to have turned it on and off, just like water. I didn't enjoy this book nor did I care for the way she made Max seem weak."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelieveable","review":"I never thought a woman could be so catch up on color. Samone was really something with her remarks. If I was Jon I would have told her where to go and when. But I know that is not the way the story was to be. Otherwise I enjoyed it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Character Development Is A Problem","review":"This novel about interracial love has the same problems I see in other novels on the subject: the black man is all bad and the white guy is all good. The same is true for novels featuring a black man/white woman: there's an evil black woman and the white girl is a saint (see Eric Jerome Dickey's \\"Milk in my Coffee\\").In this novel, I have no idea what motives Max's behavior. And Jon is nice, but what else? The fact that he is nice and white contributes little to this story. I guess we can't have a black woman falling in love with a flawed white man, can we?I'm hoping to read a better interracial love story someday."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing.","review":"I did not read this book with an open mind. I was predisposed to enjoy it. How could I not - a contemporary story, a savvy up and coming black woman, etc. Unfortunately, the protagonist was the most unlikable character in the entire book. She was pathetically weak and needy when it came to Max. At the same time she was pig headed, cruel and ignorant with Jon. I wanted to root for her and Jon for the simple fact that he was an evolved male that didn't require a self esteem zap to exist. But, every time she did that idiotic begging thing with Max, I just couldn't do it. I found myself hoping he'd stay with Daryn or go back to his first girlfriend - because he definitely deserved better than Semone. The only one I liked from beginning to end was Jon, and would like to have known more about him and less about the self fulfilling prophetic life of the Harlemites that time forgot."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT STORY, FAST READING","review":"I really enjoyed the book. I couldn't put down, I just wanted to see how Samone was going to handle her problem. I'm really not a romance reader, but I must say I enjoyed the story line. I wished the male characters were developed a little more. I am going to suggest my book club to read it as an in between book from our regular selection. I passed the book on to my daughter who is a romance reader, she loved the book and read it in 2 days.I feel Margaret is a good writer, and looking forward to other works by her. (maybe a mystery)"},{"rating":"2","title":"I Ain't Mad at Ya!!!!!","review":"A beautifully written book. Decisions, Decisions. Max has ISSUES and besides he's SPECIAL!! Great decision Samone. YOU GO, GIRL! If after four years Max don't get it, then just maybe he'll get it on the way home. MOVE!! Samone's endured enough, and Max you are \\"OOPS, OUT OF TIME\\" is the way I see it!! Jon Everette was a man after my own heart. You just gotta respect him. You want it, you go get it. That what I say!! I ain't MAD at ya, Samone Lewis!!! life is just too short."},{"rating":"1","title":"A BIG DISAPPOINTMENT","review":"I couldn't wait to read this book, wish I had. The characters were not believable. I have never introduced a boyfriend as my \\"lover\\", I'm still puzzled by that one. If you have read Sandra Kitt's The Color of Love or Close Encounters, you are going to want to skip this one, it doesn't compare."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was just O.K.","review":"I didn't like the main female character in this book very much. She came off as selfish and self-absorbed. It was all about her and I'm surprised the main male character didn't leave her in the 5th or 6th chapter. She had no positive characteristics. She treated the main male character very bad. She was so vain, I'm surprised she had the strength to hold her own head up! She was so totally superficial that I found myself wishing I would \\"meet her on the street,\\" so I could put some sense into her. The book was just O.K. and certainly NOT a book I would read again."},{"rating":"1","title":"convoluted","review":"If you jast have to read something, you won't feel like you've lost any brain cells on this book. If you have something else to read, read it. Most of the the negative comments on the book are dead on. samone is selfish, Max is selfish, Jon is a sucker.When was this story set? I figured because it was published in 1998, it was set then or at least around the mid to late 90's. If that's the case, a lot of things don't add up. Reminiscing about Samone's youth didn't made her appear older than what she should have been.I, also, found it unbelievable that she would be with a white man. The idea that she wanted Jon the take responsibility for Yusef Hawkins death and racism was assinine. I believe most men, black or white, would have walked away from her due her all-around bad attitude and her hot and cold mood swings.Without giving away too much of the story, I would say it's not worth buying. New or used."},{"rating":"1","title":"PLEASE!!!!!!!!!","review":"This is the first book that I have read of Ms. Hodge's and I have to say I was extremely dissapointed. Samone's character was impossible to like, she was so needy of Max that she has an abortion in order to keep him. She doesn't want to have a baby and become a statistic at her age. Gimme a Break!!! What a idiotic and selfish reason. In the meantime, Max couldn't make up his mind about Samone and he was foolin around with other women. Jon is so in love with Samone yet he starts messin with someone else. There was no real meat in this book. The characters were shallow and self-serving. The love she tried to create between Samone and Jon just didn't work because neither of them seemed to know what it was. It's rare that I read a book and don't empathize with any of the characters. There was no one to like except for Samone's friend. Do yourself a favor, save your money and your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's love got to do with it?","review":"That's how I felt about this book. There was no love involved between any of the characters. It was more of an obsession and lust than the need to love and be loved. I felt that Samone was lacking as a character. The author concentrated more on complicating the plot rather than develop the characters mindset. I was greatly disappointed in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A WASTE OF MONEY!","review":"This lady (the author),whoever she is, did such a poor job on this \\"book\\". Stuff in this book was so unrealistic, such as the fact that she introduced Jon as her lover, you don't go up to your friends and say \\"Hi, this is (fill-in-the-blank) my lover.\\"! That's only a little pea in the pod, so much other stuff bothered me about this book, especially the whole abortion deal. Basically, just save your money, instead purchase Color of Love by Sandra Kitt."},{"rating":"2","title":"As an Interracial romance, this book was sizzling!!!!!","review":"Samone Lewis is one hip, confident and gorgeous black woman. Margaret Johnson-Hodge wrote Samone's character to fit any woman with an open mind. This book moves along clearly and concisely from begining to end. It shows the fear most lovers endure when opening oneself up to love and trust. Both male characters sizzle, but Jon's character makes you want to leap into the book. Outstanding!"},{"rating":"2","title":"PERFECT PEOPLE NEED STAY AWAY","review":"For the rest of us regular folks who have struggled with love, doing the wrong thing versus the right thing; for those of us who loved too long and did not let go of somebody soon enough. For those of us who ran away from a good thing until there was no place else to run, and managed to turn around and accept the goodness that was in front of us, then read this book.I read some of the comments before I read this book and then again after. Realized those who couldn't stand the main character, who seemed real irate with her were either perfect people who never got anything wrong, or was on their way to some Jesus like state, loosing what makes us human in the process.Every book ain't for everybody, but this books sure nuff was for me. And I just wanted to say you Ms. Hodge go on telling your stories cause there's folks out there like me who knows exactly where you're coming from and absolutely loved, understood and appreciated all that you had to say."},{"rating":"2","title":"Youssou N' Dour: I Bring What I love","review":"It was very interesting.

I would highly recommend it for any family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"This book is fantastic. I keep it in my purse (its small and fits perfectly). We've used it many times.

For children over 3 or 4 years old this book is fabulous!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great New Romantic Stuff","review":"A great (if not superb) early 80's fix. The music and singing seem more uncertain than they would later on, which is either a good thing or a bad thing, depending on your point of view. Most of my favorite stuff is near the beginning - \\"Girls on Film\\", \\"Anyone Out There\\", \\"Planet Earth\\". The last four tracks are good enough (but it's hard not to think of the dumb video that went along with \\"Night Boat\\"), and the album ends with a pretty good instrumental, \\"Tel Aviv\\" (Simon Le Bon must have felt left out - he yelps wordlessly throughout the song). Not deathless music, but a good listen, and we could all use more of those."},{"rating":"2","title":"GET IT RIGHT!","review":"To everyone out there who thinks this TRULY Duran's first album, you'd be wrong. This is the re-release of the first album that came out after RIO when IS THERE SOMETHING I SHOULD KNOW was released. Check the listing for the DURAN DURAN (Original recording remastered) - THAT'S the first album.The re-released dropped the track TO THE SHORE, edited PLANET EARTH, which was originally a remix version, and rearanged the track listing adding IS THERE SOMETHING I SHOULD KNOW.For those of you who desire to have the omitted track and the added one, get Duran Duran+1 which contains all the original tracks and it puts TO THE SHORE back where it belongs. I am really disappointed in the so-called Duran Fans out there who have the mistake in touting this as the first album.Die hard Durans such as myself, will want all three as they each slightly different."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did people really like this stuff?????","review":"I remember how big they were, with their flashy clothes, hair etc. I remember Hearing their songs in clubs and the radio.

My absolute favorite song on this CD is \\"Planet Earth\\" (ba baba ba baba baba). We just passed through a decade of popular music which I concider mostly junk. Step back two decades and relish the creations of the \\"fab five\\". They may look a little strange with heavy eyeliner and big hair, but they are truely musicians and artists - even to this day. (ask any Duranie) Be sure to try to their other albums!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Debut","review":"I love this Cd and carry it always in my car. I enjoy the hits, but I listen over and over to Friends of Mine and Sounds of Thunder. If I was in a band and were to do a remake of a song it would be Careless Memories.

The very first CD I bought back in 1984 was the British version of this album, which originally had the same track listing as above.Back in 1999, I was surfin' Amazon and noticed that they had the import version that *has* the \\"To The Shore\\" track on it. While it's been tacked on to the end of the disc instead of placed after \\"Careless Memories\\" where it belongs, it's nice to have it on CD after all these years. It's also nice to have the \\"proper\\" British titles for the songs (for example, the correct \\"Anyone Out There?\\" instead of the US version's \\"Is There Anyone Out There\\"). Now, if only they'd put \\"Faster than Light\\" on CD..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is there anyone out there?","review":"Excellent first album.

I thought it was an educational book about the wine regions of Italy, but it is actually more like an encyclopedia of Italian wine grapes. Instead of approaching the study of Italian wines on a regional level (the preferred method), the author chose to look at it grape by grape. In a VERY large font (I guess they wanted the book to look big), the author provides information about all of the major grape varieties in Italy in alphabetical order. If this is what you want then please buy this book - it does have good descriptions and pictures. If you would prefer to learn about the amazing wine regions of Italy, and the relationship between the wine, food, history, and culture of each region, then look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic","review":"On this, his 3rd CD, Kelly Joe Phelps has shown that he is not one to rest on his laurels. This is an incredible display of songwriting and powerful playing while being subtle at the same time. Not an easy task. Kelly Joe's interpretation of old folk and blues standards are interspersed with amazing original material. His sensitivity as both a player and singer has never been more apparent. You are doing yourself a great injustice if you don't go out and get this CD immediately. It gets my vote for the best release of 1999 in any genre. See Kelly Joe Phelps live, if you can, and be stunned. Buy this CD and be amazed. This is that rare release where every cut is exceptional."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intense and beautiful","review":"Kelly Joe Phelps plays blues guitar like nobody else I've ever heard. His guitar playing is a highly unconventional, intense, sometimes furious, lyrical, almost freeform backdrop to his stories. Fascinating to watch him, hunched over the guitar laid on his lap, seemingly lost in his own little world.The voice that tells the stories is smoky, also intense, focused. The songs on this album seem mysterious (like the title of the album) at first because you don't hear the lyrics for a while, just the words - but the words seem interesting and emotive all by themselves, even when you haven't tuned in to the meaning.Tuning in is an essential part of listening to this album. You won't get to know the songs unless you listen a few times. Probably many times. Then the rapid-fire guitar starts to make sense, you begin to hear what he's saying, and you'll start to really enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent! Truly wonderful music!","review":"Playing lap slide and acoustic guitar, and with a unique, earthy vocal delivery, Phelps most closely compares to Ben Harper. Yet, he is in every sense his own artist, breathing new life into each measure of music on this CD. With incredible skill as a musician and songwriter, Phelps opens up the possibilities available to roots musicians in nearly every genre. In much the same way that Corey Harris' new CD pushes the boundaries of blues, folk, and other stlyes, Phelps is helping to redefine and update a form of music that has too often been simply rehashed. Anyone who wants to know what amazing things can still be done with a single guitar and a voice need go no further than this record."},{"rating":"2","title":"Turned me on to the blues","review":"I've never been much of a blues afficianado, but this CD opened me up to a whole new genre. The vocals hit you right in the heart and the musicianship is outstanding. Just a great, great, piece of work."},{"rating":"2","title":"An extremely unique treat.","review":"I am in the middle of the book and totally love it! The author has done an amazing job of writing the way women think.... overthinking, justifying, overanalyzing.

I am looking forward to reading the author's other books"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Little Too Strange","review":"Having read Alice Mattison's \\"Book Borrower,\\" I expected more from this book, especially after reading editorial reviews about it. I know there was all kinds of symbolism in this book, and it wasn't that hard to get, but mostly I just didn't care enough about any of the characters, except maybe the husband Pekko.

Powerful in its simplicity, EMBRACING THE MYSTERY simultaneously challenges and comforts the reader. It has helped me to look for the face of my Higher Power in every situation - good or bad - and to view each situation in the light of faith and possibility rather than the darkness of fear, doubt and insecurity. I recommend EMBRACING THE MYSTERY to family and friends who are seeking a more meaningful connection to their Higher Power, or God and for those in 12 Step Programs.

It discusses practice planning, season planning, pre and post season approaches, as well as sections on very high level tactics for offense, defense and special teams - including key reads, key rules and key teaching points. There are numerous coaching aids and examples throughout the book on skills evaluation, scouting keys and documentation aids. If you are looking for a decent book to give you a baseline of information that you can refer back to, this is it.

Just cast near to shore or structure, wait a few seconds, twitch your rod tip and expect action. WAM! I'm sorry but as much as I like the torpedo, I've got to say that, even with the FREE Super Saver Shipping option, at $999.99 this is just not a good buy. I know this sounds harsh, but think about what you could get for the same money: A pretty decent canoe. A usable, but old, boat motor and trailer. A really special rod, real, and tackle box, a bushel of burgers from the value menu. So, be wise, go for the $4.05 model torpedo. This is good old fisherman Bob, always lookin' out for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Blues You'll Ever Hear!","review":"I heard Will solo on a demo tape a few years ago and couldn't get the songs out of my head. Now, with his second release (and first with his band), I am even more amazed at his talent. I can't believe they're not signed to a major label! I mean, they make great rocking music without the addictions common to this genre. I love the CD. I love them live. They are a band not to be missed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hot, Blue, and Clean-livin'","review":"When I was in college I was very into the Chicago blues style and its copiers, from Howling Wolf and Muddy Waters on. When I became a Christian, I turned away from all that, because though I liked the music, the \\"Whisky and Women\\" emphasis was not where I wanted my head to be. I didn't think it was possible to play the blues with Christian lyrics. Whoa! I was wrong. This is one of the tightest, hottest blues bands I've heard in a long time, sort of like the Howling Wolf London Sessions with Eric Clapton doing the guitar for the Wolf. Very crisp. The lyrics are not evangelistic, but they come from a Christian moral worldview. If anyone else is doing this, I haven't heard of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent material !","review":"In this book, Maurizio Giuliano has been able to collect material which may otherwise have been destroyed, on the secret tensions and divergencies among Cuba's political élites. It is the first time that this type of documents are published, enabling scholars and others to know more on this delicate issue. The stories of repression against Cuba's dissidents are no news, but the repression and internal purges within the élites are something very different, which can indeed tell us a lot about the prospects for change in Cuba 'from within'. This book therefore does a marvelous job. It constitutes an extremely valuable source, as well as fascinating reading with extremely astute intepretations and observations."},{"rating":"2","title":"these are my go-to spatulas","review":"Unlike some spatulas that can separate (top silicone bit comes off) these have held together so far with daily use for the last couple of years that I've owed them. They're good! I even bought a set for my mom, who shockingly didn't have ANY spatulas in her whole house. (That's so wrong!)my only quibble is that the larger spatula is a little too big for me to use very often. It's good for large quantities of thick batter, like when you're scooping batter into mini-loaf pans but otherwise I would like to have another medium-sized spatula.

When it came in the mail, I was surprised!! The pug toy is BIGGER than a real pug. Yes, BIGGER! And the plush part is semi-true... the legs have metal rods in them to keep the toy up right. I felt a little dismayed at the false advertisement for this toy. Firstly, i don't think anyone really wants a stuffed toy that could eat (figuratively) the child's real dog. And secondly, there is limited movement for a \\"plush\\" toy. When i see the word plush, i think of a soft, cuddly toy that a child can enjoy... not a lawn ornament with fabric on it.

Again, nothing like the catalog picture.

I have struggled with SAD for well over 20 years and have had a light box for 12 years and have even tried some medications. But I have never experienced the results I have had with this visor. In three or four days I was already feeling the benefits. This has been the best fall season I can remember and I am actually looking forward to winter.

Ask me again later in the winter :-). There are a few problems: the biggest issue is the price. I have several bicycle lights that have approximately the same components, including being programmable, and they cost approximately $30.00-$40.00. What you have here are two led lights, a cap, and a wall charger-not really worth the price, not even close. I think they are preying on peoples' unhappiness. Also, the cap is very forward-heavy; you can't just walk around your house and do things without it slipping in front of your eyes and down your face. Also, as other people have mentioned it's very bright, which is probably good for the SAD effect, but that requires careful adjustment on your head, and not something that keeps slipping forward."},{"rating":"1","title":"Side-effects/horrible migraines","review":"After using the Light Bright Visor for about 7 days I had a horrid migraine. I didn't realize though, that this was the cause. I stopped using the visor for a few days, then started it up again. After another few days I had another severe migraine. I finally figured out what was going on. I also had symptoms of dryness in my body, my vision seemed worse, mild naseau, a very strange feeling that is hard to describe but a strange unpleasant feeling in my head. I do have a history of migraines so I now realize I should not have been using this product. I have used a light box in the past and got very good benefits from it. I would say that if you have migraines I would be cautious about using this product. Otherwise, I'm sure it will be helpful to many people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product!","review":"I was using the old Bio-Brite but this model is infinitely more effective.

Or when the omens are promising. The author is learned and writes gracefully, evoking an earlier age -- or many earlier ages -- when literary critics and scholars wrote lucid, elegant, and insightful prose for their peers as well as for the educated -- or simply the interested -- general reader.I won't say much about the topic, oracles, except to say that we homo sapiens seem to have a rather persistent propensity to be afflicted by oracle-ism: a kind of prophetic wisdom, at odds with commonsensical or empirical knowledge, and therefore acquired on the cheap.

That is not a bad thing. The experiment is one the reader should not want to succeed.Michael is a confused young man, a true product of his environment, who eventually becomes almost too certain of his righteousness. A thoroughly and completely used man, impulsive, charismatic just enough, his is a compelling story which can be read easily and appreciated on several levels: a simple tale up to a profound indictment of science unchecked by any real consideration of right and wrong. The subsidiary characters, the reluctant but redeemed Kim Green, the trapped Judge, and the paternal Nathaniel, offer great insights about the state of Michael's futuristic world.Although of particular interest perhaps to the science fiction fan, I heartily recommend this book to the general reader. It is a story which could resonate over many readings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money","review":"This book is just below mediocre in what it provides anyone who would open its covers.

It is a part of the \\"manual\\" which should have been included in the game box, especially since the standard manual is lame, too.

Although I have always known the darkside of human nature, still surprised to see it was published black and white. Human, like other animals, fight for survival. Don't we often see our children grab from others? In our modern world, with government and all that, in order to grab things from others, one needs to create excuses so a mass can be formed. There can be all kinds of excuses, the most common used are race and religion. (I grew up in China, and my family were prosecuted because my grandfather was a landlord before the communist took power. In this case, the excuse was \\"class status\\", not race.) To me, this book is just an excuse to grab from Jews.I read other reviews on this book, either \\"one-star\\" or \\"five-star\\", seldom between.

Next, the author tells us within the first five pages what this story is about: hominids mating. Then there are the dumb dialect of some of the African characters - \\"After we kill dem, do we pull out deir teeth and put dem on da imami tree for luck?\\" (p. 494) - and the repeated descriptions of hominid reproductive organs.I could forgive the cliche characters, predictable story, and hominid (and human) sexual activities if the book were at least well written, but the narrative is a disaster.

The attachment parenting spin on this book is so strong that it is virtually useless to anyone who does not follow this philosophy. I sent this book off to Goodwill.

Janequin was hundreds of years ahead of his time in creating music that reflects the sound of the words: La caquet des femmes sounds just like the cacophony of raised women's voices in a busy public place. La Guerre replicates the emotions and sounds of war. One of the songs is the sound of the wind. And so on. Yet the early music feeling is strong. Ensemble Clement Janequin is world-renowned. The singing is magnificent. True, a nod to the previous reviewer, there is no translation of the text, which is in old French. The CD was recorded in France by a French ensemble, and only the old French text is provided in the booklet. In my humble opinion, that's all that is needed. The music speaks for itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good DVD set not so good seller","review":"I bought this DVD set from Amazon.

You can do this with services.msc orwrite a script linked to a short-cut to do this. If you don'tshut off WZC the connection will hang every minute or so andXP re-scans your NICs.

It is NOT compatible with the Wireless Zero Config service in XP. Every 60 seconds, it drops the connection and reconnects in about 5 seconds. So this adapter is fairly useless for online games, streaming mp3's from another pc on the network, SSH connections, or anything else that requires constant connections.The ugly: It seems as if NetGear has completely abandoned this product! The software download page makes you guess which driver is the right one, and it hasn't been updated in forever...

Anyone who has read his Confessiones cannot help but think what a boring life he lead .. however, after having read these letters, you realize that that was just one side of his life. These letters are moving and very interesting. True love letters from another time - yet they feel timeless.

The quotes are woven together by a text which covers roughly the 14th to the 20th century of the history of Burma, now called Myanmar. The result is a combination patchwork of facts and opinions that unfortunately are not only often incoherent but sometimes appear bias in nature For example, very little mention is made of the brutal 2 year war waged by the British to wrench control of Upper Burma from native hands. In this regard the reader cannot help but note what may be interpreted as a pro-British stance. Because of the disjointed nature of this Burma history I found it difficult to follow and ultimately tiresome. There is a bibliography of the works quoted as well as a list of the works which were consulted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying","review":"I like Dutch audio that I can listen to over & over again.

I got all excited at the end because I thought the last disc was just conversations in Dutch that I could listen to over & over again, but again, the conversations are only 30 seconds long with lots of babbling. I was bummed because I really liked the content of the conversations, which is why it gets 2 stars instead of one.Get Pimsleur, or for even more Dutch that you can play over & over again (if you don't mind reading the English parts), get Living Language Dutch.

However, how do you change the time? There were no instructions enclosed and the pin on the top doesn't do anything. It appears you have to take the watch apart to change the time or send it in to the company. It has a lifetime warranty for repairs but should changing the time be considered a repair. I think not.

The cord is thick and it looks awkward because it doesn't run smoothly down your shirt, it goes down in a zigzag pattern (like a wrinkly headset). Also the earbuds are a little larger than most and it is hard to get them to fit correctly in your ears. Mine have fallen out many times. The only thing from saving the buds from falling to the ground is the neck strap.I have owned mine for over a month now and have been having some problems. At first one of the channels was going out on the left headphone and eventually I lost the entire left side. The microphone has also gone out on it too and I know this because the people on the 'other end' cannot hear me. The concept is really good, they just need to work on the design."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good quality but awful design","review":"As if this thing was not designed for consumer but submarines in 1950s, it will probably last worst usage but uncomfortable.The cord is a very thick protective metal like a coil.

As peaceful sounds to fill in the silence of a room, for meditative tranquility to search and achieve an inner calm, or play it as dinner music when you have that \\"special someone\\" over, this CD works.To listen to it as music, it is minimalist but has many colors and layers to interest the listener. Each time you hear it, there is something new. I would say conservatively, I've played this CD 50 times and marvel at never getting tired of listening to it.Their second CD \\"Bali Dua\\" is equally compelling and picks up where this CD leaves off.

It was such a joy to see this again. This is a great show for kids (or nostalgic adults). The puppetry is great. The show is very musical, but the songs (by and large) aren't corny or annoying. Some of them are actually a bit tender. The episodes often deal with themes like prejudice and the environment.That being said, I'd recommend getting the newerFraggle Rock: Complete Series CollectionDVD set.

The sadistic Fowler takes great enjoyment in tormenting Merlin,but the boy manages to escape him to find a wandering band of magicians, who soon discover that the boy can see into the future. As they try to harness him for their own ends, Merlin uses his magic to elude them...The innocent wild boy of \\"Passager\\" is gone, and we get to see hints of Merlin's future power in this story.

Besides that excellent piece, the work by Yusupov on this CD is outstanding, and a good example of the beauty that can be culled from an amalgamation of cultural styles in music. The piece uses a number of odd members of the flute family which one can rarely here in western music, along with strings and hypnotic percussion. The Amirov piece is excellent as well, though not as good as some of his other symphonic maqams. The Terteryan piece is the weakest, yet interesting in its own way, lots of percussion here as well.

Once you take out the card, the camera would work. We tested the card in another device and it worked properly.

But it was the sound quality of the video that really threw me off. I got this as a Christmas present and loved it... Until I tried playing the video back. In a nutshell, it is nearly impossible to hear anything anyone is saying if they're further than 10 or less feet away, even when you download the video to the computer. So I thought to myself, why not just buy a microphone for it? Wrongo! I found out the hard way that it isn't possible to use a microphone with the camcorder.So, if you just want a camera to make music videos or other silent productions, I guess this is fine for that.

I find the stills, however, to be of great detail (I can see the wrinkles around my eyes...wait a minute...is this a good thing?). That being the one good feature isn't enough to make up for the other problem: the software. This camera comes with some cheesy brand of software that caused my computer to malfunction, then the problems ceased when I uninstalled the software.

The tribe of humans in this book are descended from a mysterious group called \\"The Twelve\\" that founded their city in the distant past. Where The Twelve came from and why humans are so different from the other animals all around them is something that is on their minds as they realize they have to move on and find a new settlement. Their quest is full of battles with ants, giant insects that are subdued with spider-venom tipped spears, and all of the stuff that makes great adventure.

Thus, it is refreshing to see that there are still gospel artists out there like Norman Hutchins who know how to produce music that ministers!Although this will be a another big commercial hit for him, since all the songs are so catchy and singable, what I like about Rev. Hutchins' music is that he has consistently proven that you don't have to water down gospel music in order to be successful. Covering the bases from Praise & Worship, to Contemporary, to Traditional, what stands out about this CD is you can feel the anointing that was present all over the place at the recording!! And when he shares his testimony about being blind, the shekinah glory fills the room.

Although I was told that the music beared some resemblences to Pink Floyd, I couldn't help but picture a couple of guys with electronic music equipment playing out in the middle of an Arizona dessert surrounded by cactus plants! The music was so dry it made me thristy and the vocals brought anything but coolness to the music, instead hindering it even more.Although the album isn't poorly crafted or anything, it is quite odd sounding and something doesn't quite blend well on here.

The CD is a disappointing attempt to meld various influences and only ends up sounding like so many \\"new age\\" albums: strangely soothing yet annoying. The comparisons to Pink Floyd are a HUGE stretch. The overly engineered reverbs and echoes become increasingly superfluous as the album wears on. The CD isn't terrible it's just that there's other CDs that are far superior. If you like the guitar-hypotic sound of this cd then try Michael Brook's Cobalt Blue (this is the man that invented the infinite guitar). If you like the more vocal/pop aspects then try Moorcheeba's Big Calm. If you like the more electronic side then there's Banco De Gaia.

Culled mostly from tunes he wrote over a ten-year period as drop-ins for National Public Radio, the disc shows Wainwright at his least insightful, his least imaginative and his least interesting. The kind of tossed-off style that can be charming in his more personal material is annoying when applied to topical matters - especially when those same subjects are joked on radio, television and comedy club stages. I suspect that Wainwright doesn't think he's saying anything profound when he offers lines like \\"Ice used to be a nice thing/When you laced up figure skates/Now it's a thing to win a medal on/For the United States.\\" But he's not saying anything particularly funny either.

After 15 years, I enjoy \\"Dress me up as a robber\\", \\"Take it Away\\", and \\"Ballroom Dancing\\" like no other songs I know. The album brims with variety, beautiful and harmonious melodies, and, most importantly, it is tremendously upbeat. \\"What's that your're doing\\" is too raunchy and repetitive.

The book makes it more than clear that the institution was aware, tolerated, and at times rewarded research ethics that stink to high heavens. The possibility that the likes of Gallo and his supervisors may have influenced a generation of scientists is truly appalling.

I believe the No Fear version actually changes meaning of the original several times.

Left hand page is the text of the play, to the right what each character says is given the literary equivalent of subtitles in colloquial english.For example, a character says about men in a shipwreck: \\"Not a hair perished. On their sustaining garments not a blemish, but fresher than before.\\"Confused? Look to the translation on the opposing page: \\"Nobody was hurt in the slightest. Even their clothes were unstained, and look fresher than before the storm.\\"Works better than a mere glossary because it puts the meaning of the characters' statements into 21st century English.

I love books by Ann Rivers Siddons, Dorothea Benton Frank and others, so I was hoping I'd found yet another author to enjoy. To be honest, for the first 10 chapters or so, I did. However, after a promising beginning, the story just plain \\"bogs down.\\" It's very rare that I just give up on a book, but I have to admit that with this one, I did. For a book that began with such promise, it slowly, but inevitably becomes ponderous, and just plain boring.

This book is fantastic. Writing historical fiction is an art, and Elizabeth Musser has mastered it. Her character are so real and show so much depth that the reader feels as if they are walking those same Atlanta streets. For those who are turned off by the Christian teaching, let me tell you, it is such an integral part of the story that it could NOT have been written without the change in the main character. Her transformation is more than a quick salvation story common to much of Christian fiction. The transformation is very realistic - no sugar coating of living \\"happily ever after.\\"While the main plot centers around Mary Swan, the sub-plots are equally as real and moving.

The movie was all out of order, they had Darcy asking Lizzy out way to early in the movie. Things just seemed to out of sync. Even the brief \\"qoutes\\" from the book before they went the next scene jumped all around. There just wasn't enough tension built up between Darcy and Elizabeth. Even the characters they had all mixed up. I understand some liberty must be taken, but you will find yourself asking - why won't this movie just end. You get your romantic ending which makes it worth the rental, but definatley not the purchase. My local video store actually ordered it for me just so I could rent it. My suggestion is to stick with the original 1995 production of P+P by A+E w/ Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute movie...","review":"I liked this movie pretty much-it's a pretty faithful take on the actual novel. I do think a Mormon cultural setting is actually an excellent way to spring P&P into a modern context, because really, Mormon young adults tend to think about marrying alot earlier than most other folks for moral and religious reasons. The main problem I had with the movie was that it had a tendency to swipe some key scenes from other Jane Austen flicks-ie, P&Pw/Colin Firth, Mansfield Park, Bridget Jones Diary. Other than that, it's a nice, clean cut movie that your kids can watch with you without having to tell them to turn around or cover their ears every moment like most other romantic comedies.

However, I truly enjoyed this movie. I began to fall in love with the characters very early on in the film. It was like reading Pride and Prejudice for the first time! I love how the director stayed true to the book, but managed to make it unique and added Austen's sharp humor into the script where the 2005 (Keira Knightley) adaption didn't. The only thing wrong was that I would have liked to have seen Mrs. Bennet!"},{"rating":"2","title":"squeaky clean modern P&P","review":"For starters, this really is a comedy version of P&P.; At 104 minutes, some of the P&P; plot had to be cut and obviously this is a revisionist and modern look at Austen's work. It is smart, witty and clean enough to be a family film. It might make men groan, but, as a chick-flick and a movie you can watch with a tween daughter, this film works.Do not expect well-developed characters, because they are not here. The characters that remain in this film are portrayed in comical ways (i.e. Bingley's clothes & comments, Elizabeth's clumsiness under stress, Lydia's husband-hunting obsession). Do not expect erudite, and you will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jane would be horrified!","review":"I am a huge fan of Jane Austen's work and Pride and Prejudice is my favorite of her books. Naturally I was curious about this movie. I LOVE the 1995 miniseries, h6wever my hopes were not particularily high for this movie especially because of its origin. I did not find it funny, and it took all of Jane Austen's own subtle humor out of the storyline, making room for the overly obvious jokes which did not add to the story. I think that Jane herself would be distraught at how her story has been twisted into this \\"latter-day comedy.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad variation on P&P; skip it!","review":"One of the worst variations on Austen's Pride and Prejudice. The main problem is that Darcy is so unlikable, rude, arrogant and even mean in the first part, that he is completely unredeemable. A hero who suggests to the owner of the bookshop where Elizabeth works that she is useless and he should fire her? And for no serious reason? Pray, what kind of hero is that? I'm sorry, I just don't find the notion of causing someone to lose his job for no serious offense as light or funny.Also, Colins was a sweet but half-witted man, nothing in comparison with Austen's Collins. The pace was slow, the heroes either uninteresting or bad (see above), so what is there to see? A complete waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly A Stinker","review":"My five-year-old tried to watch this movie with me and gave up after 5 minutes, telling me to watch the movie & tell her what happened. I wish I had done the same thing. This movie was SO LAME!!! There was no character development, the couples ended up together just because the story put them together, no because of any attraction or chemistry. Elizabeth comes off as an arrogant, shallow, feminist and her \\"sisters\\", or roomates in this version, are poorly sketched mockeries of the originals in the novel. Not one of the men was remotely attractive, exception being Mr. Darcy, and it's a huge point that the girls go to church but no one else in their group does. I laughed one time in the entire movie, and spent the rest of the time waiting for it to get better. The overall effect is so bland and goodhearted, you wonder why any of the couples end up together other than the need to go forth and procreate. Major waste of time and couldn't recommend it at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"There should be more pride ...","review":"I am a devoted Jane Austen and P&P; fan, so the idea of setting the plot in our time was quite appealing to me until I saw the film.The idea was good, the film ... not really. They could have done better I think. Orlando was a sexy Mr Darcy, but a better film could have done him more credit. Concerning Elizabeth I do not think there was any life, energy and freshness in the character or in the actress (as U like it).There were very few original ideas as to how the plot should work and the characters should act among modern circumstances, they should have been more detailed. Elizabeth's driving a Beetle is fine but it was only one detail among many that could have been more elaborated.There were some funny scenes, but altogether it's a weak, sometimes truly boring film, neither the actors nor the crew did any credit to Jane Austen or her fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Welcome to Steve Aylett.","review":"This book will make you laugh, because it is very, very funny.

I would strongly recommend a case with a hard plastic screen over one like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"ehhh","review":"A case with a screen cover is a must for any ipod, but it kind of defeats the purpose when it makes it next to impossible to read the screen itself. The case is rubber and knobby so its got great grip, it won't fall off a dashboard, but that also means that it attracts dust like crazy. So between that and the inevitable air bubbles on the screen cover it sort of negates the usefullness of the overall product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unusual, somewhat pretentious.","review":"The two reviews immediately below are typical of the type of snobby and pretentious attitude that is unfortunately all too common among the fans of Stockhausen. If you enjoy the pose of misunderstood avant-garde music, this is for you.Apparently the score makes some unusual demands of the performers, such as \\"Live alone for four days without food.\\" Why? Who knows? My guess would be that this, like much in Stockhausen's music, is simply there for the purpose of making the score as unusual as possible. (A good example is his Helicopter quartet, which requires the players in the quartet to perform their parts in separate air born helicopters, unable to hear each other.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to read & comprehend","review":"I bought this book after seeing a few positive reviews on the Internet. I found it very difficult to read & comprehend. The first few pages were filled with questions from the authors.

I did not expect to like this one much. But to my surprise it was one tough and time-efficient bootcamp style circuit workout of about 35 minutes including warmup and cool down with a one-time 2 minute rest between the two chapters which is welcome. The emphasis is on weights but most of it is compound exercises and gets your heart rate way up. It was well cued and very challenging. In a fairly short period of time it gives you a tough total body workout.

Unfortunately, here they are performed in a coarse and unmusical way. This \\"City Waites\\" ensemble is NOT the same one that recorded the wonderful \\"Pills to purge melancholy\\" of Thomas D'Urfey. The singing here is harsh and badly out of tune. There is scant use of instruments to make up for it or cover it up.

To be sure, make-up kit metal posturing never got much worse than this; a one-hit wonder bucket of buffoonery long on shellacked mullets and glittery glovies but desperately short on brains, balls and tact. This 18 track debacle of constipated lung flapping, pedal-effected riffing and pompously inflated apocalypsyncing (Final Countdown, Scream of Anger, Rock the Night, Carrie) works only as a nice reply to lead leather n' bouffant boy Joey Tempest's screeching query \`Who will survive, in the future to come?'

On the other hand, Dawn's low profile only adds to the pleasure of discovering this album, one of the best examples of epic, melodic Swedish black/death metal. Propelled by Jocke Peterson's superbdouble bass drumming, the tracks on this album frequently approach ten minutes in length. The relatively few tempo and riff changes make listening to this album an almost mantra-like experience, in which you can lose yourself in a relentless barrage of noise. Perhaps in time, Dawn's reputation will match the magnitude of their sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"Historic band!

A series of newspaper articles, the book works well as a \\"short read\\" or as a longer one. The topics and timelines are mixed -- sometimes with connections, often with none. But connections aren't needed because the snippets of daily life are usually presented with humor and often with a \\"been there, done that\\" reaction from the reader.

I was finished with the series, but we all know how searching for something new on the bookstore shelves sometimes leads to desperate purchases. I bought this third book with much trepidation. I took it home. I read it. I actually enjoyed it. The characters are becoming three-dimensional. The mystery was more interesting. The romance is more apparent, but still subtle.

I'm a huge Oliver Nelson and Eric Dolphy fan and this is a great album. It's not as great as \\"Screamin' the Blues\\" or \\"Blues and the Abstract Truth\\" which I feel are flawless, but this is a must have CD for many reasons. If you love either Nelson or Dolphy, that's reason enough. Great performances throughout, and for you audiophiles out there, the recording quality is very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"You may as well get the Dolphy Prestige box =)","review":"I'll start by saying that this is not the issue of Straight Ahead that I own. I have this as part of the Eric Dolphy Complete Prestige box-set that I reviewed here however many years ago, which was remastered more recently than this issue. So, my review is just on the performance and the quality of the album, not the sound.I love this album! It will always stand in the shadow of Blues & the Abstract Truth because unlike Abstract, this album isn't packed full of as many of the big names in jazz, but don't let that fool you. This is also a classic album.There are times here where Dolphy swings like a demented circus performer, and Nelson is (as usual), dripping with blues and soul. The tunes are great and the performances milk every last drop of loveliness out of them. This is one of those albums where I tend to think that no jazz collection could be considered complete without it."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Dolphy Fans Only","review":"Expecting Dolphy to play flute with Nelson on alto sax, I wound up with a primarily double alto sax session which is a no go for me no matter who the paticipants are. 1 track has Nelson on tenor sax with Dolphy on bass clarinet and flute at various points.All this was spelled out in black and white in the original liner notes which appeared on the back of the original LP, for all to read before puchasing.

Therefore despite some 'interesting' anectodes and impressions from Habsburg Vienna, the philosophical depth of the book doesnt go above our usual journalistic wisdom. I dont understand how other reviewers found this book brilliant or anything like that. I think recommendable as passtime only."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Breathe Through Your Mouth Because This Album Stinks","review":"Perhaps the lesson one can learn from this album is not to buy an album because of one song . . . you heard in a commercial. I bought this album and found out that I have been duped again.Is it wrong for me to assume that an album I take a chance on can have two good songs on it? I wasn't expecting this to be Moby, but even so I was caught off-guard by how abysmal this album is.After a couple of listens I found that I don't like any other song on the album and even \\"Breathe\\" is becoming quite tiresome. There is no \\"hidden gem\\" on this album, just one slightly-less-than-mediocre song after another.\\"Telepopmusik\\" is an appropriate name for the band that phoned-in this effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you want to hear more songs like \\"breathe\\" read this.","review":"Most people have come upon this album and Telepop because the hauntingly fresh tune \\"Breathe\\".In terms of this album (Genetic Album by Telepopmusic) you'll get two versions of \\"breathe\\" (original and a longer remix version). \\"Yesterday\\" is like a 1920's version of \\"breathe\\" sang using a radio-day-style vocal.However if you really enjoyed breathe and want to hear more songs like it, buy \\"Ghost Girl\\" from Amazon Digital right here in Amazon.com (couldn't get the link to insert it in this review).It is a fresh, short 5 song album that picks up where \\"Breathe\\" left off.

WOW!!! The album is a beauty of elegant, mellow dance tracks that combines a new french sound. Very intresting robotic elements that have a human feel to it. The main singer on most of the tracks has a voice that makes your heart ache for the loved one and Dance Me, Genetic World, Free and Smile are just and excellent electronica work and you just have to give the guys credit for the original and fresh name of the group. BRAVO!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"1st half worth hearing- second half not worth anything","review":"Honestly I was very excited to hear the first half of the album, I listened to it three times through hoping the second half would get better. It just started to annoy me even more. It sounded worse than some of the most amateur recordings of wanna-be hip-hop ever written. I was shocked that \\"Let's Go Again\\" was ever produced- It's TERRIBLE! Most of the samples are so completely random and pointless it was as though they were trying to throw in every sample they'd ever heard without rhyme or reason.Don't get me wrong, there is a market for this album- one may like the whole thing even. In all fairness the first few songs are worth hearing. However the remix of the single \\"Breathe,\\" at the end of the album isn't all that exciting. If you like trip-hop, and want to hear truly talented musicians look up Esthero, Lamb, Massive Attack- even Hooverphonic. But don't waste your money on this full length album, buy the single."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring... Don't waste your money or your time","review":"I purchased this cd inspired by the song 'Breathe', hoping that the rest of the titles would follow suit. Not.... At.... All! They are boring, droning, tired, unoriginal, and annoying. And I am usually not this critical of music. I am puzzled how such a nice song as 'Breathe' can end up on such a dead end album. If you are interested in buying this because of that song, save your money and buy the single/maxi-single. I've learned my lesson, the next time I am influenced by a commercial to buy a cd, I will listen to a few more songs before I do so."},{"rating":"2","title":"It grows on you...","review":"I'm not some esoteric music lover... I tend not to like the mainstream stuff but I don't like the way out stuff either. I can't tell you what obscure band these guys sound like. I, too, was exposed to Breathe via Mitsubishi, and found that I could play the song over and over from Telepopmusik's web site. After a while, I found myself playing the six or so other songs over and over (except for the \\"Hoola\\" song which I found annoying). Funny thing is that now I play \\"Hoola\\" over and over. I haven't bought the album yet, because I've been playing most of the songs solely for free on the Internet, but I do plan on buying it so I can hear it in my car. This music really grows on you. My wife doesn't like it... but I do!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth the Few Good Tracks","review":"\\"Breathe\\" is great, yes. And there are a few songs that are in the same vein that are all right, track 10 being a good example. Otherwise, this album is pretty shabby. The songs aren't really that good, and differ little from the same basic makeup. This would deserve maybe three stars if it wasn't for \\"Da Hoola.\\" This is the worst rap song i have ever heard, no joke. It is horrible and wretched and makes me sick. In the end, I'll give them respect for \\"Breathe,\\" but i would buy the single, not the album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mellow Out With Telepopmusik","review":"Telepopmusik is a good album to mellow out with. I like this album when driving in the car on a long trip. It just seems to mellow me out from road rage. Before purchasing this album, I have heard not so good things about this album with the exception of the track \\"Breathe\\", but I ignored them and just bought this CD. And after listening to it on my way home, I began to like the simplicity of the tracks. It's good in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not sure why the hostility","review":"This is a good trip hop record, with a liberal dosing of the \\"clicks and cuts\\" digital noise mentality. It all holds together quite nicely; even if it has been done before, it's all done quite competently here. Some very nice textures, digital noise, subliminal percussion, lysergic pads, etc. The rap song (\\"Da Hoola\\") is a bit of a misstep and should have been left off the album, but that's just a small part (if you want to listen to cutting edge avant rap, check out Missy Elliot's latest with Timbaland). If you like tripped-out electronica and you're not totally jaded yet, you'll probably like this. I can only surmise that the negative reviews came from expectations based on the way the single was presented in a car commercial. Anyone who likes Kraftwerk will love \\"Dance Me\\"; \\"Untranslatable\\" is pretty compelling claustroambient. If you like side 2 of Eno's \\"Before and After Science\\" you'll get into this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money...unless you can't LIVE WITHOUT BREATHE","review":"I was supremely disappointed when I listened to the whole CD. Even on bad CDs there are at least two songs that I like. That is not the case here. The CD is weakly written and produced. There is nothing that will shock you or make you smile. The music, other than breathe, is atonal and makes you cringe when you finally understand the next song is going to be just as bad, if not worse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Best","review":"I always had a certain type of taste in music as I experimented the joys of my art work. I felt that it was helping me keep a casual work pace, and I was never tired to hear it more than once. It's has a different unique style. This group first came to me broadcasted from a non-commercial station, KCRW 89.9 FM, a community service of Santa Monica College. Members of the station and numerous subscribers provide KCRW to be the first largest single source of financial support. It's a station that might appeal to people that have the same taste music as they do for this album. There's only one thing left for me to say about telepopmusik, I love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"short cd-player life!","review":"What a disappointment. Except for Breathe, the songs are very thin and boring, don't waste your time or money. If you want some good electronic get the new Oakenfold (Bunkka) or Underworld (A Hundred Days Off).You've got better things to do with ($) than to buy this and play it once!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Trippy smiley tunes...","review":"I, like so many before me, heard Breathe on Mitsubishi's commercial. Somebody over at Mitsubishi's ad agency has really great taste in music, because I bought this for that song, and it hasn't left my consciousness since I got it. It's just lovely, trippy, happy sounding relaxing music. Of course, several tracks on this are not trippy, but more hip hoppy, and those... well... they are inferior. But those with Angela McClusky... excellent.To me, it sounds like Boards of Canada with a steady beat and a purpose.Lovely, you should get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inconsistent quality.","review":"The Kraftwerk-style tracks are great. But the rap track is just awful. Why put such a different genre in with such wonderful electronic music? It just doesn't work together, and it's a bad track."},{"rating":"2","title":"Under Rated","review":"I understand many of the comparisons to Air that many of these reviews bring up. And I'd even go as far as saying if you like Moon Safari and/or especially Premiere Symptoms then you will enjoy this album. Both groups are tripped out and ambient, but that is about where the comparisons end. This cd has elaborate beats and bass work, whereas Air is based on the most simplistic beats (Kelly Watch the Stars for example). In addition Telepopmusic incorporates classic jazz throughout most of the cd. The music is lush and textured with many layers. A must for any fan on the genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"This CD is nothing special","review":"Sure, this CD has a cool looking jacket, but that's about it. Like many folks, my main interest in buying this CD was for \\"Breathe\\". Of course though, the souped-up version of the song from the TV commercial is much better. Not only that, but this CD has two different versions of \\"Breathe\\", which IMHO was done purely to fill up space on this CD. And unless there was something wrong with my particular CD, Track 10 appears to have 2-3 minutes of completely dead air at the end of it. What's THAT all about? Other than the pretty good \\"Breathe\\" track on this CD, the rest of the songs are just \\"OK\\". I'm sorry I bought into this... I much prefer one of my other recent purchases, LoveBox by Groove Armada. That CD rocks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One hit wonder","review":"While Breathe was just as delightful as it was the first time I heard it, the rest of the album disappoints. Not as smooth or clever to my point of view. Buy the track and save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"excruciating!!!!","review":"OK, I admit it, I was sucked in by the mass attention Telepopmusik received in Mitsubishi's ad campaign. The album starts and ends with \\"Breathe\\" and it goes downhill from both ends causing the rest of the album to converge into a valley of foolishness that makes you to want to bargain on your deathbed for the 50 minutes you wasted listening to this. Don't waste your money on \\"Genetic World\\" If your motivation to buy is because you like \\"Breathe\\", just buy the single."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I could rate it Zero","review":"We purchased one of these through a local Ace Hardware. Within two months the motor died. When we tried to get it serviced through the local company that is licensed for Essickair, we were charged for labor since \\"that is their contract.\\" I tried to get reimbursed by Essickair for this labor charge and received a rude phone call telling us they wouldn't cover it. Apparently, to get labor covered you have to ship the unit to them. (Which would cost an arm and leg, but they don't care about that.) Avoid this company - they will not stand behind their products."},{"rating":"1","title":"Essick Air Products 4D 7800 console humidifier","review":"Avoid Essick!!We have 2 Bemis humidifiers with same evaporative capacity and case design. One has rotary switches; the other has digital controls. Both are functional and QUIET at lower fan settings.The Essick unit (successor ownership to Bemis) is intolerably NOISY at even lowest fan settings. Customer service at Essick told me they were aware of the fact that these units are noisy and \\"that's just the way it is\\"...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money","review":"After filling the water tanks, the unit failed to start. The humidity level indicated 94% humidity and the motor wouldn't start. I contacted Essick Air and was told there was probably a failure of the built-in humidistat. I purchased my unit from iallergy.com. Upon contacting iallergy, the representative confirmed that they sold a batch of units that failed to work as designed due to humidistat/motor problems. They offered to replace my unit for free. Big deal. When I got the replacement unit, it worked but it is very noisy and the motor sounds like it is going to fail at any second. Do yourself a favor and get a SEARS Kenmore 12 gallons whole house humidifier. That is what I always used in the past, but they were sold out so I bought this unit. Big mistake!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad product; Non existing customer service","review":"I bought this product from Amazon in February 2007, and have since regretted my purchase. To begin with, I could not get the product to work. I could see that packets were being sent and received but I could not get to the internet. Over a period of 3 days, I called up customer service around 12 times. Every time, I had to wait 10 minutes and then had to leave a message. However, I never got a call back. I finally called up AT&T; and the technician there helped me navigate the product even though this is not one of the products they support.I finally did get the modem working, but once every few days, it stopped working and I had to reboot the modem everytime. After 6 weeks of suffering through the product, I have decided to return the product for a refund.

Her new book gives clear directions on how to roll every part of your body. The photos are great and the book does a good job of describing what and why you are doing these exercises. I am a Pilates instructor and I teach ALL my students Body Rolling. They love how it helps them relieve tightness and pain and allows them to move freely again. And it's very empowering to be able to do this for yourself. Yamuna is a real healer and her work has changed so many peoples lives, including my own. I highly recommend this book and Yamuna Body Rolling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"It's a different way to stretch and release muscle tension. Body rolling is an excellent relaxing (with some good pain) way to improve how you feel. The book could be written better, but I overall recommend it for the price. It's a good introduction to the concepts. More time could have been spent on describing the \\"rolling\\", since about half the book is about individual stories that are more like sales pitches than workout descriptions."},{"rating":"1","title":"body rolling only with balls","review":"I was hoping to find a book that had more information about using the foam rollers often used in physical therapy, but this is really set up to use the ball shown in the workout and the exercises are not necessarily transferable to other equipment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful photographs of a far away place","review":"I bought this book because we are planning a trip to Patagonia. This book with its magnificent photographs has been a huge help in planning the trip. Not because it gives any travel tips, but the photographs speak for themselves. This is not a travel advice book. There is no information regarding where to stay or eat. However, the photographs tell me what not-to-miss sites to include in my tour. The photographs are so gorgeous that I cannot hardly wait to get there. This book plus a good South American travel agent have allowed me to establish a travel plan to the most scenic locations. The photographer must have spent a long time traveling the area. His views of glaciers, lakes, dramatic clouds and wildlife show his talent. Many outstanding panoramas are included. These must have been taken with a high quality panorama camera. This is a very nice photo book, to be looked at over and over again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad product and bad service","review":"The whip almost immediately started coming apart.

That said, it's also crap. I was so excited when I first saw the gorgeous chain and detailing. Then, I opened up the watch to see a beautiful watch-face, considerately set to my local time. And then the back silver part, covering the workings compartment of the watch, fell off. I attached it again. It fell off again. I clicked it on one more time, and then I tried to change the time to make sure I could. I couldn't! Then the plastic cover of the inner workings and battery compartment fell off. I spent the next half hour trying to make it all fit together so I could just keep this gorgeous thing! But I couldn't. So I'm sending it back, extremely dissapointed. This was a present from my father and of course he feels bad too. Unfortunately the 'limited lifetime warranty' means it's limited to fixing the watch if it stops running, not any of the rest of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty, but not well made","review":"I got this watch as a gift for my mother. It is very attractive, and the chain was just the right length for her to be able to check the time while wearing the watch.Unfortunately after only a week of wear parts began falling off. She was able to replace them the first several times it happened, but eventually one was dropped and lost and the watch was no longer wearable.We were disappointed since it really was quite pretty and very functional. I suppose it wasn't very expensive to begin with, but she had hoped to have it more than a week before it broke!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Pretty","review":"I bought this locket watch as a birthday gift for my 11 year old daughter, who had requested specifically a watch/locket type pendant.

Then they go and release this compilation full of cheesy gangsta beats and half wit MC's, even the vets came with their worst rhymes. I was so disgusted with this CD, I quit buying Wu s**t all together. Wu Tang Clan have completely run out of steam, Rebel INS, and RZA's new joints is proof of that.

No one else shows a united front to create uncompromising East Coast hiphop with creativity but them. There are plenty of talented rhymers on this Wu-family compilation with Solomon's Child, Shyheim and Lord Superb ( from Ghost's two classic albums) being the standouts. RZA provides most of the music but 4th Disciple and Doc Doom also contribute bomb beats. For some fans of Iron Flag, this CD's production may be a little more synthesized and California-flavored but the swords are still sharp and with joints like \\"Outthink me now\\" and \\"KB Ridin'\\", the Killa Bees are stinging haters.

But after buying it, my wife and I were happy to discover that it's just as memorable and enjoyable as 'Long Way Round'. Sure the trip itself isn't as epic, and the first half is rushed due to a tough timetable, but if you enjoyed the sense of adventure, humour and sincerity of the first series, you won't be disappointed. By the time we were watching the last episode, we were as sad as Charlie and Ewan that the adventure was ending. Even when Ewan's wife joined the boys for 10 days during the final leg of the trip the show remained enjoyable.

A well developed capability and sophistication with certain prerequisite math skills is useful. The text does, however, accomplish its claim, namely providing a shortcut pathway toward some of the more fun stuff in advanced mathematics, like deRham cohomology theory, without requiring a long chain of prerequisite courses, usually amounting to an undergraduate major in mathematics. For students who have a natural affinity for advanced mathematics, this approach could provide additional motivation to pursue those interests.

After about 5-6 weeks, I could see small, blond vellus hair beginning to grow around my current hairline. A few weeks later, those hairs seem to be maturing into darker hair, and I think I see some additional vellus hair beginning to grow as well.It is no miracle cure, but I have to believe it works at least modestly well.

However, I found the characters to be non-believable. They were portrayed as too perfect and ideal for real life. The author doesn't give each character time to develop. Therefore, in each of the trilogies, there is an abrupt transition from when the couples first meet each other to when they end up together. The simple plots and unrealistic characters insult the readers intelligence. Also, I don't think there was enough variety in the vocabulary. Certain words such as \\"tug\\" and \\"good stock\\" were used over and over, to the reader's annoyance. A good editor might have picked up on these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment.","review":"I was disappointed by this book...I thought it was far from Nora Roberts' usual engrossing storyline. The three parts were simplistic and were carbon copies of each other. I did not feel this book compared favorably with her usual in-depth character development which made you want to continue further with the characters' lives. Though Ms. Roberts knows how to make you like the characters and knows how to write believable dialog this book just did not come up to her usual high standards."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grandpa knows best!","review":"Daniel MacGregor is a successful businessman who thinks that he knows best in matters of the heart.

Each of the young women is deeply involved in her own career, as a lawyer, doctor, or real estate magnate, but Daniel feels that family must come first. He finds a prospective mate for each of the girls and manages to have them introduced into his granddaughters' lives.

A beautiful, accomplished, strong-willed young woman meets a handsome, successful, determined young man and they clash, before discovering that they have the hots for each other. It's as simple as that. In fact, Ms. Roberts does the same in all her books, changing the names, occupations and locale. And she does it better than just about anyone.There's always a scene in which they \\"plunder.\\" She actually uses that verb a lot. I try to imagine it, and it always feels a little vague. There's plundering in all three stories of this book.The real talent is in the creation of the atmosphere. Nora Roberts is really good at that, and it shows here as in her other works. One can read the books for that alone. She takes the reader on a journey, and isn't that why we read fiction?I give this 4 stars for the sense of place. I'd give it five stars if the plundering were a little more of a surprise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Romantic..","review":"Here comes the BridesIn the continuing saga of the Macgregors, Nora Roberts introduces us to three grown up granddaughters of the likeable Patrioch, Daniel Macgregor.

He has decided that they have been single long enough and sets off to put in their paths Mr. Right. What ensues will make you laugh, and cry and shout for more as each story winds to its end. I found their lives and the way they are led from beginnig to end so much fun to read I couldn't put it down. Definitely a good read.

It overflows with Makotos own brand of intrinsic uniqueness. It's classy, low key, and beautifully put together to accumulate into a crescendo of fantastic melodies, riffs, and tunes that make one feel as if they're truly experiencing the mind of the artist. And oh my is it a brilliant one.Makoto is an unsung gem of drum and bass, and if you don't listen to this album, then you've missed some of the best the genre has to offer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really worthwhile","review":"I find this cd virtually impossible to listen to due to the poor production. To me, it sounds practically like a bootleg. Besides, it only consists of tracks from their first album, The Ultimate Incantation.Buy Live in Japan instead. That album has infinitely better production, and contains tracks from their first three albums.You may be able to find this on a combined disc with Black to the Blind, in which case don't pass it up! A great album and you'll get a chance to hear this even if, like me, you decide it's a little too rough sounding."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent performance-poor hearing experience","review":"This is a great live cd in the way that it has some of the best old-school vader songs on it. They are brutally heavy as Vader has always been! Also you hear Peter talking to the crowd (however in Polish because its in Krakow) and everyone constantly chanting \\"vader vader vader\\". Thats what makes this live album full of energy and excitement.However the recording is a little low, as the guitars aren't as intense as they usually are on a regular one. For most bands this wouldn't matter, but for Vader this instrument is unbelievable and it's important to have it as high as possible.So on that note I say good album, but get Live in Tokyo or a regular album instead, because you have much to choose from!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pale imitation of the previous Body for Life","review":"She tries to cover so many topics that at the end her book is nothing more than a big collection of well-known advice. The major withdrawal is the cold and not motivating tone of the provided information. There isn't a clear, step-by-step program for weight loss. Instead you can find some many rules and general advice. The photos in the book are taken from the previous Body for Life and this is enough to show that Dr. Peeke practically does NOT HAVE photos with successful before and after transformations due to only her version of Body for Life. This is too much boosted book in the media, which obviously fails to deliver up to the expectations of its readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very confusing and disappointing!","review":"Dr. Peeke has taken a simple, straightforward book as Body for Life and has turned it into something full of instructions and rules. At the same time they are very difficult to follow and many of them are not practical in the nowadays busy lifestyle of the women. I expected a lot more from it but the only thing which I got was a complete disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huh??","review":"I don't get some of these gushing book reviews. Are we reading the same book? I didn't really check it over but bought it on impulse knowing that it was a best seller. The content is so basic and common sense, if I hadn't bought it at an airport while traveling I would be asking for my money back. All the before and after pictures are kind of entertaining but that's about it. The original Body for Life Book, Joe X, or 5-Factor Fitness are all much better . True, they aren't women-specific. But they're gender-neutral, and won't leaving you guessing what to do. I found Peeke's book rather wishy-washy. I'm giving it two stars instead of one because editing and production quality are good, plus I know some women will find its presentation helpful. Just not me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many excuses not to do it!","review":"I ordered both the original Body for Life (which I love) and this other \\"for Women\\" version when I was deciding to make a change in my life.

This is one time when simple is best - man or woman, go with the original Body for Life instead of this knockoff that tells us we'll never really look that good and probably won't get through the program because we're too emotional, but all that's ok because WE ARE WOMEN.

It has good concepts like dividing women's life into phases, but that's it. Even though the author tried to appeal to women, I found the original BFL much more motivating. Maybe this book is OK for women who have not read other books or who have not followed a single program, but for me it was dissappointing, I felt much more involved with a male author than by a woman!!!

It was convoluted, the forms are difficult to use (Bill Phillips gives examples, with the forms filled out, not so in this book). The most disappointing part was that all of her before and after photos are the same ones from the original (and great) Body for Life book. If she thought she could tweek the program and make it beter for women, why didn't she share more of her before and after photos? mostly, I just felt ripped off. This book was a joke.

For those readers that may take issue with some of Dr. Peeke's advice, you should know that she can't hold everyone's hand in achieving a healthier life.

In 6 months I chaned my body completely, losing 60 lbs of fat and re-gaining my life again. When I saw this book I thought GREAT, a new, improved version of the original. Boy was I wrong! This author took something that is simple, easy, amazingly effective and turned a simple program into a confusing set of rules and instructions. As if we women don't have complicated lives already! This is just a more difficult, complicated version of the original. I'm saddened that she's trying to take credit for something that has worked for so many years for BOTH men and women. Not only that this has already been done, the before and after pictures are of people who succeeded in the ORIGINAL Body for Life program. If you want something without frills, if you want a no-nonsense approach to a new body, just get the original by Bill Phillips."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't love it.","review":"I prefer the regular Body for Life book.

Like \\"Play\\", it is evident that he is taking his jazz seriously, but it has something of the minimalist approach of \\"Circlesongs\\". Those expecting the sunny \\"Don't Worry...\\" McFerrin will probably be disappointed.While the music is not calm or inert, it is understated. The work here is subtle. He doesn't try to overpower you with his immense creativity. As the title suggests, there are no words in his singing -- something he has been exploring in most of his recent recordings. And in a bit of a departure, this CD is not just about him; he lets the other musicians take the spotlight.Bobby is evolving -- into a more complete musician. That's not to say his earlier works are lessened in any way; it's a realization that Bobby can dovetail his ideas with others. All in all, an interesting recording with much to recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Caught me by surprise","review":"I've been a rock fan most of my life, but since I've been playing bass I've been listening to a lot more jazz.

Bobby's silky smooth lyrics just grabbed me, and the disc is now a permanent resident in my cd-changer."},{"rating":"2","title":"very pretty.","review":"My favorite is the first track 'Invocation', but there are a number of worthwhile listens on the CD. Good music to keep on while you are doing something else... subtly stimulating and doesn't distract you with words. I prefer the ones that are more vocal than piano which is a change. There's a happy energetic quality to McFerrins \\"vocal sounds\\" that reach in, grabs you where you are, and lifts you a bit higher. I recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful surprise","review":"The Bobby McFerrin I thought I knew was one of those artist who keep doing what they do best just to show us what makes him better than other artists. Music is just an instrument for them to accomplish this ambition. I hate them all.I'm glad my prejudices didn't keep me from listening to this album. From track one, what you hear is Music taken as seriously and respectfully as it can possibly be, without one single false step. Then comes Kalimba Suite, able to grab your full attention from beginning to end. My god, what a wonderful song, this Silken Road. And so on. He keeps the same level of care and sensitiveness and wonder through all the tracks, always putting his admirable voice at Her service, never the opposite. And closes the album with a spiritually elevating song of a kind seldom ever heard. Beyond words. The title is actually more appropriate than anything that can be possibly be said about this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Short But Fun","review":"The premise of the game is that you're PaRappa, a dog who raps his way through winning over the girl of his dreams, who happens to be...a sunflower? Rap your way through a garage sale, making a birthday cake, driving a car, and more.The characters and situations are pretty funny, and get funnier if you mess up (especially the cake level.) The songs are ridiculously catchy and you may find yourself replaying levels just to hear the songs. The only downside to this game is that it is VERY short, and if you're good at rhythm-based games you can probably beat this one in a day. If you're looking for amazing graphics you may be disappointed, since the characters are all rendered as 2d cutouts, almost like a pop-up book. However, this is one of my favorite PSone games and if you like games that are a little on the silly side such as Katamari Damacy and Elite Beat Agents, this is a good game to buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"seems fun at first, but the timing is screwed up and is very glitchy","review":"i decided to try this game cause i have not played it in a long time, when playing the game on normal difficulty your timing has to be exact, maybe a little bit early. i cannot make it past the second level without failing on normal difficulty despite how accurate i was. now when you save your game, the menu is sensitive, you need to press the up down left right very quickly or it gets pressed more than once same problem with typing a letterthe game does have an easy mode which does solve the timing issue and make the game a bit more fun, but easy mode only plays the first 3 levels and it does not save, once you beat the 3rd level on easy mode it goes back to the title screen.also the saved games glitch up, for some reason i cannot access the 2nd level when i got up to it on normal mode."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality - But what did I expect for $10","review":"It's a $10 Wallet, it's almost worth $10.

Okay, so this is what happened; as some of you may know, Soul Train is back on Bounce tv. As I'm watching one evening, it's time to come down the soul train line.

I hurt myself, but that song will make you do that because of the great beat. And in my mind I could still be \\"automatic\\" but somehow, Oh Lord, a cramp. Can't do some of those moves anymore. This was so much fun. I love that song."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love or Uncomfortable?","review":"Sometimes I love it. Sometimes it makes me uncomfortable.Night Is The Notion, Living Is Suicide, and Radiation Blues are just what you would expect from an artist that had an uncanny ability to make a melody that no one had ever heard or created before and couple that with lyrics that talk of dark things with an off-handed melancholy. Amazing.Some tracks like Blood or Love and others are just great rock songs.But sometimes on this album, like on Demon/Chair, it sounds like he looks at times onstage. Sometimes he looks uncomfortable onstage, uncomfortable in his band, uncomfortable in his own skin and sometimes he sounds uncomfortable in these songs...and that translates to the listener. You find yourself figeting around in your seat trying to find the \\"right spot\\" and it doesn't happen until the next track starts."},{"rating":"2","title":"good tunes","review":"just an all around fun recording! good music and the vocals are right there, glad i bought this one! enjoy"},{"rating":"2","title":"bleak apocalyptic black metal","review":"These guys are an amazing collection of musicians that have put out one of the very best black metal releases of 1998.

Most helpful was that on Omnimount's website, they have a search feature where you can put in the make and model of your TV and they tell you what mounts will work for your particular set. That was a tremendous help as I almost ordered one that would not have worked. My TV is a 37\\" and 55 lbs which is only a fraction of the weight this mount can hold (up to 200 lbs). My husband got it on the wall in a short amount of time and we both were able to easily hoist the TV up onto it. Take the recommendation of another reviewer and hook up all your components before getting it up and you'll be very happy you did. It looks wonderful and feels super sturdy and secure.

The newer stud finders are very good and makes this process easy without having to drill tiny holes. Once the TV is on the mount, there isn't much space between the wall and the TV to make connections. It is better to have the appropriate connections in place before the TV is hung. If not, you will end up having to make the connections by feel and using a mirror. I hung a 51\\" Panasonic before making any of the connections. I ended up having to plug in the power cord and cable connections by feel. This isn't a problem if you've got a readily available companion to help lift the TV off of the mount."},{"rating":"2","title":"JUST WHAT THE DOCTOR ORDERED!","review":"This mount is very simple to install. The instructions were a little off as to which letter equaled what part but I used common sense and everything worked out fine. The mount is very sturdy and fit my 50\\" Philips plasma perfectly. The price,($158.95),including shipping was a great deal compared to $249.99 that Circuit city was charging for this same exact mount.

At random times the greeting reverts to a generic greeting, then tells the caller that the memory is full, even if the message counter shows no messages. Deleting messages (if any) does nothing. You cannot record a greeting, as it will respond with \\"Memory Full\\". You have to completely unplug it and let it sit, then reprogram everything. The only way you will know it has quit working, is when your callers tell you the machine quit working.

I have watched the program over the years and admired how the musicians capture the mood of each episode so well. I am planning a trip to New England and look forward to testing the CD out in the mountains of New Hampshire, the rugged coast of Maine and the diverse surroundings of The Cape. My thoughts will be with Ian & Justine as I travel to new and exciting destinations.

I have been a fan of the show for a while, and I always thought the music interesting, but had -never- thought there was a soundtrack to it! (Two actually!) I borrowed it, and I couldn't stop listening. It played (and still does, since I now have a copy) all the time. A very diverse mix of world sounds and styles, this really is a wonderful collection. It brings to mind the landscapes and grand vistas so often seen in the series. Anyone who loves watching Ian and Justine travel the globe needs this CD (and volume one, for that matter)! Even if you haven't seen the show, beg, steal or borrow this CD now! It is that good!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Once again, a masterpiece!","review":"These recordings are so good that I can't believe they are not more well known.

He was born in Jamaica around 1952, raised in England, moved to America. His chief philosophic work, 'The Resurrection of Aristocracy' briefly brought him to public attention in 1988, but his value system and theories about civilization were so hopelessly at odds with the dominant values of our culture that the establishment completely ignored him. His scathing denunciation of modern society is well worth quoting even today, as things have only gotten worse."},{"rating":"2","title":"computer electric cord","review":"The price was good.

So I gave Reebok the benifit of the dought, after all they did woo Henry. Anyways, the boot does not support your ankle because it did not lace high enough.

The toe material and the external heel shell started seperating from the molding on just the third time wearing them.The material was about the only thing going for the shoe.

His fanfares provide the listener with a certain Pro tem, but as time passes so has Williams'. He gave us something inventive in the 70s, when he was at his creative peak. Today, is it difficult to discern which is more indifferent, the music or the listener? What about the many fans of Williams, myself included? He is my reason for studying music. Nevertheless, like the composer, we should stop screaming from center stage. Fellow music lovers, if you keep buying albums, they will keep hiring the same composer. Allow a newer composer, an unheard \\"voice,\\" to speak."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very impressive stuff","review":"This really was one of William's best compositions and the performance by the Mormon Tabernacle Choir was inspired as well.

The author, Reginald Reynolds, wrote this book as if he was there moment-by-moment. The book was based on the life of Gandhi, the man of peace. I give it a half thumb (if it was possible). I really didn't feel the book.One reason I didn't like the book was that it was one of the older books that I've read. It was boring a bit. I didn't want to read, but it was for my book report. It screamed \\"BORING!\\" after the first several chapters.Another reason the events seemed to be weird. Reynolds didn't have to write about Gandhi's childhood. Because people don't want to hear about a boy who was a total failure up till his adulthood. It didn't make me want to read more.In conclusion the book was very boring, and I wouldn't recommend it anyone. I give 3 out of 10. And also a half of a thumb.D.

The overall approach encourages parents to deal with each other from their \\"true self,\\" and to engage with each other frankly and meaningfully, but without the need to succumb to trendy pscho-jargon. New parents, or any couple expecting a first child, would benefit from a look at this book, and many will find very helpful advice that makes them realize they are not alone!

This one had great reviews, and was well priced, so I ordered it.It's fine, he likes it well enough, but I was disappointed.The body of the shuttle has two 'doors' that open. They don't sit flush when they are closed and therefore overlap slightly.Also, the astronauts do not fit in the shuttle which really doesn't make sense.It's a little bit heavy, and because it's made of metal I worry that it could be dangerous if someone is too rough with it, especially the pieces that come to a point.I wouldn't buy it again, and I wouldn't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is not all metal, plastic bay doors broke first time being played with","review":"90% of the space ship is made out of metal and made well. Unfortunately that 10% which is made of plastic is the part which should have been made out of a more durable material. The first time my kids played with the shuttle they broke the hing of the plastic bay door off. These hinges are not only made of plastic but very poorly made. There is no feasible way fix the hinge as the little nubs are just too small to glue back on.I only recommend this product for older children/adults who will only use it as a display piece. Any amount of play and it will break very quickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's OK","review":"5 year old son asked for this from Santa. He got it. But hasn't touched it at all except for the first hour. I think it's ok. The lack of noise or lights or action bores the child easily I guess. He's not a demanding kid when it comes to toys but there has to be something in it for him. He quickly ditched this and went back to his Legos because while those don't generally have lights or sound or action, at least it gets his creative juices flowing and he can have fun the good old-fashioned way -- by pretend play. But there's not much you can do with rockets that don't make any sounds or give off light. Oh, and one of the components broke too within the first hour."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!

I wanted to like the characters; I wanted to feel for their situations. Yet they seemed so two-dimensional: Phebe questioning her ballet, Nikolai searching for a lost chess master. They didn't seem to have any other qualities, and I couldn't feel any sympathy for them. In other words, I guess they just seemed bland. Pencilled outlines on paper.The story itself was equally uncompelling, although perhaps I just wasn't the right reader for the book's story line. I found myself finding excuses not to pick up the book and keep reading, always a bad sign. I never finished it.When Ms. Freymann-Weyr's next book comes out, I hope to find myself drawn to it as I was to My Heartbeat.

Our litter box is in a smaller room in the house and odor can get trapped very easily. The litter locker was a pain to use, and somehow, odor escaped from inside. I threw it away after a few weeks and bought a little trash can with a lid. Much Better! Not stinky and easier to deal with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea, bad construction","review":"For what this company charges not only for the litter locker itself but for the plastic bag refills, there's no excuse for its flimsy construction. After only a few uses the unit would not wind completely anymore, easily getting stuck. Bags would also easily break, dumping cat waste into the unit itself. The problem is, this unit can not handle several days worth of cat waste without getting jammed - and if you have more than one cat, forget about it. It's easier just to invest in some cheap kitchen trash bags - wasteful to be sure, but easier than having this unit fall apart on you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great item to have for cat owners!","review":"This is a really great product to have for cat owners. I clean the litter box twice a day and no longer have to hunt down plastic baggies around my kitchen and leave the little stinky presents outside on the balcony until I can fill the big trash bag full of garbage and finally dispose of the mess. The only downfall is that the blue plastic baggies are thin and may tear when you open the box to throw out the mess so be careful and have a plastic bag handy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a bust.","review":"I used this while living in an apartment so that I wouldn't have to go to the trash each time my cats used the litter box.The litter locker frequently got jammed though with the spinning side and it wasn't odorproof.Plus, the replacements are costly and difficult to load.I threw mine away after only a couple months of use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy a Litter Champ instead","review":"I've had two of these--each time hoping for better luck in using it.

Never in using the two items did I have anexperience removing the plastic cylinder that it didn't break apart when replacing the unitWhat a revolting mess. The unit itself is flimsy. The Litter Champ is much more direct--no twising of the plastic, so no breaking and the plastic is much sturdier--cleaner, moreefficient, no odor due to breakage--an all-around better product."},{"rating":"1","title":"not really odor-free","review":"Sorry, but I can still smell the odor. Plastics absorb odor. After a couple of weeks the smell permeated the whole contraption. Also, the tube/bag thing doesn't last as long as they say.

Otherwise, it's not worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth the Money","review":"I bought this thinking that it would work better than scooping kitty litter into a small trash bag and tying it off and then placing it in the trash. I was WRONG. This does not hold much waste and takes up un-necessary space. If you want to buy something for your soiled kitty litter get a diaper genie and throw your trash bags of waste in that.

I am able to scoop the litter into the \\"litter locker\\" for over a month before having to refill. Even after the locker is full you can transfer the contents, nicely contained in the smell-proof bag, into your main trashcan without worrying about the smell.My only complaint- when it starts getting full the part that turns sometimes falls off the track. I've found that this can be helped by not over filling between turnings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly made and designed","review":"I bought this to replace the litter locker II I was using. Nothing wrong with the previous version, just thought the new one would be an improvement on the older one. Wow, was I wrong. This version is made of very cheap and flimsy materials. I could barely get it to stay together when I first assembled it. The spindle idea is moronic. It's hard to turn and wastes a lot of the bag.

This item is fabulous for my situation! Yes, I do tend to go through the refills pretty quickly (one per month), but to not have any stinky litterbox smells I think it is worth it!! And now I have just discovered the refills here on Amazon for almost half the price I have been paying in the petstores, so I will continue to use my Litter Locker for years to come. For me it is simple to use, there are no nasty smells, and it looks nicer than dumping used litter in the trash. I would recommend this item to any cat owner!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for multi-cat households","review":"I can see that this might be a fine contraption for single cat homes. However, I have 3 cats and scoop the box 2-3 times a day, which means the Locker gets emptied avery 2-3 days, NOT weeks as stated.

It was a little tricky to put together at first, but reading the instructions really helps. I have two cats and now after they make a stinky I just scoop and put it in the litterlocker.

Ended up throwing the thing away because it was more trouble than it was worth."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOTALLY FLAWED DESIGN","review":"The company that made this item must have designed it for mice. The flaw of this device is that it rotates the clumped litter around and around a huge wheel inside the canister. If you place any clumped litter larger than a peanut inside it, every time the wheel rotates around (you are required to do this to \\"seal\\" the litter away) it rips the bag on the inside of the canister so you are left with a trail of dirty litter when you empty it in the garbage. Such a huge disappointment. I don't know why they designed it to turn all of the litter every single time it is used. They should have designed it like a Diaper Geenie so that the litter just drops in. I would buy a Diaper Geenie for my cats, but they are sealed at the top and require pressure to place an object inside it. If you tried to use a Diaper Geenie with a scoop full of litter and poo...litter would likely spill all over the place."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Product","review":"The litter locker has been one of the best purchases I have made in a while. In an apartment with 2 cats, the whole cleaning the litter box process was becoming a pain, and very smelly. Its so much easier with the litter locker right next to the litter box and then you just give it one turn and it does NOT smell at all. I took time to read through all the instructions to make sure I was doing it right but overall its pretty easy to use. I would definitely recommend this to any cat owner!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Total junk!","review":"I picked up one of these at Petco. when I pulled it out of the box, the tumbler was already off the track, and once I secured it, it popped off again WITHOUT any littler in it!

I took it back for a replacement, but after looking at the other litter mate, I decided to just get a refund. The other was the same way. Absolute junk!"},{"rating":"1","title":"nice idea. poor execution","review":"There's supposed to be a little button on the front that locks the top and bottom portions of the box together. The plastic was molded poorly, so mine never connects and can't lock properly. Hence, trying to pick the unit up results in the thing falling apart. I lived with this for a month or so. The bag ran out, so I had to buy a replacement. The bag replacement is so poorly designed that turning the wheel never exerts enough force to pull out any more bag. Now I'm out $25 for the box, plus $9.99 for the replacement that didn't work. What to do now? Risk buying another replacement? Or just junk this piece of trash? Learn from my mistake; save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"No more plastic megalo-mart bags!","review":"I bought the LitterLocker Plus last month as a trial-run because if it didn't work, I was going to send it back. The refill already came with so I didn't buy anything extra. The refill (with 2 cats) lasted about 3 weeks. I decided that I couldn't shell out that kind of money for a refill, so I took the empty refill to Wal-Mart and matched it up with a Diaper Genie refill from the kid's section and they are ALMOST a perfect match AND they are under $5.00. I use the white ones.So, I think it's a good buy if you are tired of using plastic bags to scoop you kitty's litter and it really helps that you can use Diaper Genie refills."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like a diaper genie for cats","review":"I bought this and it does keep me from running to the outside trash twice a day. Still, my 2 cats must produce a whole lot of waste because the refill cartridges don't seem to last more than 2 to 3 weeks and the litterlocker fills up about 2 or 3 times a week. Still, it does a good job of concealing the odors and I can pretend that I don't have indoor cats in between cleanings.If I could improve it:The refills would last longerThe container would be a little bit biggerThe blade for cutting the bags would be sharperI'd add a little barrier to the hole where the waste goes so kitty litter isn't easily spilled out when you dump it inOverall, I'm glad I bought it. It wouldn't be big enough storage for more than 2 cats, and as it is, my two give it a run for its money. I guess I should just be glad that my cats are regular and leave it at that. ;)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Petmate litterlocker","review":"I have 2 cats and 1 litter box.

They were not crystal clear, but nevertheless I did get it together and after the fact, it really was a piece of cake to put together. Also the item is shown in blue and white, but arrived as two shades of tan. This did not displease me or my cat.

I have 3 cats and have been using the litter locker for about a year. I have 2 of them and they both work great. I used to use a little lidded trash can and every time you opened it up - oh gosh! the smell was overpowering. To those writing reviews that had trouble with their locker, you must have gotten a defective one because I have never had mine stick or work improperly. I only have to reload the cartridges every month or 2. Sure beats having to open that trash can every day. This product has been a true nose saver. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great way to seal away odor","review":"This is a dream come true. I like to keep a clean litterbox, but keeping the waste until garbage day was not an option and just makes the house smell . This way both me and the cat are happy.The Litter Locker holds the waste in covered and sealed until you need to dispose of it. This works on the same principle as the diaper genie, but with a much smaller profile. The auto-lock after half a turn is convenient so that too much waste doesn't occur.I like the light weight design (some people call flimsy) because it make it easier to move around and clean.I would definitely recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of junk","review":"The plastic is very soft so the product is flimsy and the parts doesn't fit well together.

Maybe this would work well for a single cat home, but for several it's not worth the investment. Plus, they're not made well.

This album seems to be a bit experimental and filled with half baked ideas. The power trio is great but doesn't lend it's ear to what makes a Belew composition great. Melody has always been a key to his songwriting and there is none on this album. It sounds as if he came up with a bunch of jam parts and then forced vocals over the top of them. \\"Beat Box Guitar\\" is a nice intrumental that really builds towards the end but there is little else of much interest on the album. Most of the songs are fueled on noise or noisy sound effects which is different but not necessarily good. Plus for an EP length album that is sold at full album prices, I feel a bit ripped off.

The end result is simply hysterical. After all that, arch enemy Monarch escapes from prison, villains inadvertantly, and inappropriately, fall in love, and dangers abound for the Venture crew.

This CD has nothing but hardcore punk covers of Smiths songs that all sound samey. Every song is revved up beyond belief and shouted over a pogoin' beat. That is fine for a one-off joke, but all of the subtleties that make the Smiths great are gone. If you weren't a Smiths fan in the first place, you would have trouble distinguishing between songs. Only the last track, a cover of Asleep, is slowed down to less that mosh tempo. No-name artists on a tribute album are expected, and it is nice to see that but what this bunch of punks obviously likes and appreciates one of the greatest bands of the 80s.

Omnipotent God is portrayed as forgetful, purposeless, inept and clueless about managing what he has created. Indeed, God attempts suicide only to rise out of the muck(promoting evolution rather than Creationism). Ferrucci's God decides not to hang around at the Nativity because he isn't sure he's the father. Further idiocy has Jesus getting drunk before the Crucifixion and flinging the cup at God. Most reviews have found this book entertaining. My Bible says, \\"How can men be wise? The only way to begin is by reverence for God. For growth and wisdom comes from obeying his laws\\".Psalms 111:10. This work is totally irreverant, blasphemous and discounts the power and wrath of Holy GOD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Revisionist Historian","review":"A literary connect-the-dots of historic facts and fiction, blurred visions of spiritual beings, and endless babble about how wrong we all were in re-formulating history. Interspersed with refreshing elements of revolutionary ideas, the momentum soon diverts into clichee and the reader is left with a pile of pulp made soggy by tears of boredom. Chance encounters with spritual beings are downgraded to the most primitive element and the fun ends there. An all too human tale of a writer lost in a paralell universe, an Italian who couldn't cope with the generic and abstract landscape of the new world. Pity those who spend not only the money, but also the time..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most entertaining blasphemous book I read in a long while","review":"Leave the Old Testament and New Testament god at the side of the road and get to know a sensitive, thoughtful introspective unsure diety.

Martin touches on very very cool topics, but my main gripe is that he whizzes through everything, often just giving a pointer to another book, which is great in that it encourages more exploration but is frustrating at the same time. But if you havent encountared recreational mathematics before, take a look, Martin does a wonderful job in making math FUN!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Majandra's got serious potential","review":"If you like Fiona Apple, Sarah Slean, Tori Amos, I would absolutely recomend this CD! I've heard it described as dark and depressing, but who says thats a bad thing?! You can really see Majandra in her songs, not Maria Deluca. Its obvious that she has a lot talent both as a song writer and performer and I will ABSOULUTELY look for whatever she puts out next."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was that really necessary???","review":"To quote Chandler from a \\"Friends\\" episode: \\"That was one of the worst things ever...\\". I have to admit that this CD reminded me quite a little bit of William Shatner's musical outings. Shatner also can't sing but at least he is funny. Majandra's CD just comes of as boring and pretentious. I think she tries to emulate the likes of Alanis Morrisette, Bjork or Tori Amos. Sadly, she fails. I hope she sticks to acting. She is cute as \\"Roswell's\\" Maria deLuca."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too short and just too unoriginal...","review":"Nice try for an acting-music cross-over wannabe, but Majandra...this ain't gonna work...She must have been thinking,\\"How far can I go without people noticing I'm trying to imitate Tori Amos?\\" and \\"Lets make the lyrics as dark, depressing and suicidal as possible\\"...well, you definitely crossed the line of good taste, girl.Her performance on Roswell isn't already oscar-worthy, but if I were you, girl, I would stick to that, because the closest thing you're gonna get to a \\"music career\\" is a Jamie-Lynn Sigler lite.And sorry, but what's the deal with that cover!?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hoped it would be good but it sucks!","review":"If there are Grammy's for the the worst CD of the year then The Sicks might get a record number of nominations. From the worst produced CD to a horrible voice. Come on! As long as she has been working on this CD, couldn't she come up with some better music? I can't honestly say her voice is bad because with the poor production put into the CD would could really tell. If you want a good laugh then buy this CD. If you want to waste your money then buy this CD. If not say far away."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT IS THIS!","review":"This is horrible! Majandra's vocals (which are pretty bad) are in need of some major help ... as do her lyrics.I had high hopes for this album after downloading the song \\"Siren\\" with its dark electronic feel but all that diminished upon listening to the repulsive \\"Ski-Ming\\" and \\"Bruises\\". All she sings about is wanting to manipulate and punish her spouse for no given reason which shows just how mediocre her writing skills are for it's all that she can think to write about. She's obviously not doing a very good job in expressing herself if all she has to reveal is her failed relationships. So given the fact that you can download 6 out of 8 tracks from various websites I suggest you do just that. Or better yet... Download \\"Siren\\" and then leave it at that."},{"rating":"1","title":"wasted talent","review":"She's seriously talented. I love her voice. She squanders it all on horrible material that at best is filled with pretensions, and at worst is boring. She could be a fine female chanteuse. She's way too convinced of her innate cleverness and unique sense of music. Which, i suppose, is why she's released little and it's gone nowhere. What a waste--it's a voice that could be a great torch singer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scheming Siren","review":"In the past, Majandra has talked about the difficulties of getting a song recorded without \\"phat house beats\\", but she's gone all the way and produced The Sicks exactly as she wanted it, resulting in the fascinating record we now have. Most of the songs on the album are quite dark, involving abusive relationships, manipulation, psychological games and so on. But Majandra's dark emotion is the perfect beginning for excellent music! She has a great voice and writes the most intriguing lyrics I've heard in a long while."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE worst thing I have ever heard in my life","review":"I was expecting this CD to sound something, anything like what she sings on the show.

I couldn't believe I wasted my money on this and it's not even worth using as a coaster..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent C.D.","review":"I have always been a fan of Majandra's and her music is very different and fresh. The lyrics make you think back to a relationship or a time in your life where you just needed to hear music that you can relate your mood to.

I was not disappointed.Majandra has talent, for sure. Her voice is luring and haunting, though some may call it an acquired taste. The beats aren't completely original, but they do add an air of uniqueness to the cd. Some of her songs do lack a certain harmony, but they are catchy lyrics that have more meaning than anything that ever came out of Britney Spears' mouth. Her words and songs have lots of meaning to them, which is what I believe makes the cd a lot better.Overall, I'd say that Ski-ming was probably one of my favourites on this album. I'd say give her a listen, if you like the styles of Tori Amos. She might need a little more practice before she reaches that far, but she certainly has potential."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent and hard to find CD","review":"This is an amazingly honest CD from Majandra who is probably best known right now as Maria on Roswell, but will be a bigger music star than TV star if she continues to produce such honesty and clarity in her music.Her voice is beautiful and har lyrics are raw and charged with emotion.Grab this one if you can find it! It is worth the money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"hmmm... it's not like what I expected","review":"hmmm... I was disappointed with this Majandra's cd. It was like a bad techno album with monotone lyrics throughout the whole song. The music sounded like it was thrown together in a backyard garage. Majandra's voice is awesome, but I was really disappointed.NOTE TO SELF: This is a lesson in how not to spend money.MAJANDRA: Love you, just not your music at the moment."},{"rating":"1","title":"To each his own","review":"I thought I was going to love this CD, because when I heard Majandra sing on the show I really liked it. It was my type of music, very poetic and folky, very Joni Mitchel like. So I bought her over-priced album, listened to it a handful of times, and hated it. The six songs have no variety, the music sounds the same, the words sound the same. It's like one big long boring badly sung song (she sings in one note the entire album). Majandra has the potential to be good, you can tell, but she falls short with this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album","review":"I've watched Majandra on Roswell before a few times... my wife is a huge fan of the show. So, not being a real fan of the show, I got the CD for my wife. To my surprise, not only did it fit in to the my wife's musical tastes, it fit into mine as well. I can only describe Majandra as Dido meets Kittie. Absolutely wonderful choice for those who prefer music on the melodic side and also an absolutely wonderful choice for those who prefer their music on the morbid side. All in all a wonderfully blended sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good, Not Good, Not Good!","review":"This is the worst CD that I have ever purchased, and I have purchased some bad ones in the past, ie Sheakspears Sister.

I pre-ordered the CD knowing that I would love it...unfortunately I didn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the first season soundtrack, but very good anyway.","review":"I really love most of the songs on the album. There are maybe four that I don't listen to. It's not as good as their first, but it has a good mix of girl bands. Love the Dirtmitts, Le Tigre, BETTY, Shawn Colvin, Heart, Dusty Springfield, Iron and Wine, The Organ, and Ladytron isn't half bad either. I can always count on the L Word to introduce me to some amazing music. I am a 16 year old lesbian and have just been learning about the music of our culture for the past 3 years. I want more as other reviewers have said. They needed a two cd set for both cds to cover all of the wonderful music. And I wish Kinnie Starr would have sang on the show and been featured on the album again. I can't wait to see what music is in store for season 3, but I know I will most likely be adding that soundtrack to my collection too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same as two other albums?","review":"I believe the recordings here are the same as the ones on \\"Groovin' Is Easy\\" as well as \\"Electric Flag [Live].\\" At least \\"Groovin' Is Easy\\" has a cover that is more late sixties than the others. Bad recordings of subpar performances. \\"A Long Time Comin'\\" is a great album of it's time. Check it out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mostly Mediocre.","review":"If you took most of the interesting parts and melodic sense of Sebadoh away, you'd have Snow Patrol, another average band blown up by the British hype machine. There's a few decent songs here: Chocolate, Run and Somewhere a Clock is Ticking, but this is adult contemporary for the younger set.Also watch out for the trite and over-literal lyrics, epitomized by 'Spitting Games'."},{"rating":"2","title":"NO it's not an Irish band","review":"when oh when will you learn to understand the difference between Ireland and the UK? Snow Patrol are a mix of NORTHERN Irish, which is part of the UK, folks, not part of the Irish Republic. Like New Mexico is part of the USA, not Mexico, geddit? plus Scottish band members (yes, also part of the UK). The band was founded in the UK. They market themselves as a UK band. They live in Scotland. They mostly record their music in England. Let's just enjoy a great British band, not try to pretend they are leprechauns."},{"rating":"1","title":"playin' it in the background while we shop","review":"For the 5 star fan: If you love this album, you REALLY should check out some music from the many artists that Snow Patrol's \\"Final Straw\\" has been compared to (ex: My Bloody Valentine's album \\"Loveless\\", Grandaddy, etc.) You may just discover a new new favorite band! As \\"totally awesome\\" as this album may strike you, a deeper dig into the indie archive will reward you ten-fold.I'm not surprised that so many people love this stuff. It's still more original and sincere than most \\"brought to you by Abercrombie & Blockbuster\\" radio.OK, how about 3 stars...in honor of the franchises that define our taste as well as our neighborhood's skyline."},{"rating":"2","title":"A new favorite","review":"I was recommended the album by Amazon's personalized recommendation and since those recommendations have usually been pretty good I went ahead and bought it. Truly, the first 8 songs are the best. There is enough variety and wonderful lyrics to make anyone happy. However, the same was not true for the last four songs. They all kind of ran together and while the last song \\"Same\\" is a great way to go out I often find myself skipping it to get back to the beginning. I love and adore the song \\"Run\\" (it really does make up for the mediocre last songs) and Lightbody's voice is just beautiful singing the higher sustained notes. This is also a fairly cheap CD and definetly worth the purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely one to buy","review":"Snow Patrol has been part of the music indusrty for some time and just now have they ahd a major breakthrough. With the hit song \\"Run\\" they have given people the chance to make them more than just a band...but an amazingly talented music group. Their Single \\"Chocolate\\" is one that many people would find relaxing and a great hit. \\"Spitting Games\\" is another that I think many listeners will find different, but very well sung. Gary lightbody's amzingly soothing voice tells you that he sings what he feels and that he has written these songs staright from his heart. The instrumentals in every song are amizing too. People who like Coldplay and Keane will love Snow patrol."},{"rating":"2","title":"actually 4.5 stars","review":"this quite possibly could be a life-changing album depending on the person. if you havent been introduced to good music this is definitely a life changing record, but if you are used to bands like bloc party and spoon, this is still one of the ten best albums of 2004. absolutely phenomenal album that has two really breakthrough songs: \\"chocolate\\" and \\"run.\\" both songs had good successin terms of public popularity. the song \\"spitting games\\" was probably the most commercially noticeable song being as it was their first single and it appeared on the ea sports game mvp baseball 2004, but in my opinion this is the only \\"miss\\" song on the album. \\"spitting games\\" is the only song on the album where i press the skip button so i dont have to listen to it. for me the song is too overly pop-y and repetitive. other than that, though, a breathtaking album."},{"rating":"2","title":"just one of those albumns","review":"Just one of those albumns that you will play over and over... and over, and you will never will get sick of it. Each song will be a suprise. I have there previous albumn, song for polar bears. at the time I thought it was good but final straw reached high above all expectations a different sound completly! if you like this sound of Irish talent check out \\"The frames\\" as well, I think youll find you identify with every song every albumm is brillent, same raw emotional sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good album...","review":"All right the album is not and never be a complete classic but somehow there is a certain appeal about the stuff that this band did on Final Straw. First of, the music is great; it really built an atmosphere that work quite well for me. Next is the voice, match quite well with the music and ambiance of the rest but really the lyrics are the strongest points out of the stuff.

I bought this CD before hearing it, having been a fan of past Snow Patrol and the Reindeer Section (Gary's other band). The song titles snapped me up right away - though these really great song titles give no indication of poignant or thoughful lyrics in the songs. This CD might contain worse lyrics than a Hillary Duff CD. I kid you not, and I quote \\"Maybe I can do it if I put my back into it\\"...why would anyone want to rip off Ice Cube of all people? I admit the songs on this CD are well crafted catchy pop tunes, but it severely lacks substance. The song structure is the same of every song, and it took me about five seconds to lift \\"Run\\". It's uninteresting, unexciting. They were horrendous live - backup vocals incredibly off key, and for the most part it was as if someone had just cranked the CD over the Opera House's PA...Now go buy some Wilco."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blow Patrol","review":"Do you like Coldplay? Travis? South? Keane? Pilate? The Stills? Do you enjoy listening to the same stuff over and over again? Do you buy whatever genre is trendy at the moment? The monotonous third wave light rock with emo undertones is the new post-grunge tough-guy radio rock with possible Christian undertones, and it's quite hot right now. Do you watch the OC? Did you buy the soundtrack? If you answered yes to any of these questions, than this album is probably for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a new band by the way","review":"Someone said earlier that this was \\"a good new band\\". Yeh, actually this is their third album. But my God, what a transformation! Before they really were underachievers, but Final Straw shows that they matured a lot and developed their musical talents. Gary Lightbody and co. should be proud, and this album is worth double the other two put together. Cracking stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Snow Patrol cd","review":"I really enjoy this band's unique sound. I definitely recommend their album, Final Straw."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alpinestars?","review":"Does anyone know if this band got its name from the Alpinestars song? I have to ask because the two sound so different. If you like this as well as electronic music then you will like Alpinestars as well and I recommend you check them out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark new wave rock","review":"It beats me why people compare this band to Travis, Coldplay and Keane. They are about as far from the classic pop sound of those bands - esp. Travis and Keane - as you could get. Instead, Snow Patrol have a driving, bass-heavy barre-chord driven sound with simple song structures. It brings out the beat, where Travis's songs bring out the strumming guitar and delicate chord changes. I guess the similarity lies with the emotional nakedness of Snow Patrol, which is what really makes them - and this cd - special. They are nowhere near as melodic as Keane, and, in fact, some songs verge on a kind of tedious blandness. But there is an obvious intelligence to the lyrics and an open anger that reminds me more of early Pub Rock or New Wave - Elvis Costello type stuff. I wouldn't mind a few more effective hooks (like the guitar riff in \\"Gleaming Auction\\"). This is driving rock - not the fairly light Britpop we've been listening to."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST ALBUM!!!!","review":"Snow Patrol's latest album, Final Straw, is the best album I've heard in a long time. Their work on The Reindeer Section's \\"Your Sweet Voice\\" has the same soothing, catchy qualities as their work on this album. Standouts on the album are \\"How to be Dead,\\" \\"Spitting Games,\\" and \\"Chocolate.\\" The haunting chouruses are hard to get out of your head, but they are not annoying and you never get sick of them, so you don't mind when they're stuck in your head. The CD has wide appeal- I believe you'll like it whatever your age and whatever kind of music you like. If you like the Scottish/Indie/Alt/Rock bands like Idlewild and The Reindeer Section, you'll love Snow Patrol's Final Straw. If I could buy any Snow Patrol CD, I'd buy Final Straw. Importing the CD is cheap- it costs around $16, and it only takes about 12 days to be shipped to the US, and it is definitely worth the wait. When I went to http://www.snowpatrol.net/ to hear sneak- previews of the album, I was definitely sold."},{"rating":"2","title":"A rarity","review":"The Final Straw is indeed a rarity - a CD where every track is extraordinary (i.e. no fillers on this one, people). The sublime songs Run and Spitting Games have no doubt been heard (and hopefully appreciated) by many on the radio. I would buy the CD for those 2 songs alone, but the whole CD has been nothing short of amazing. Incredibly introspective and thought-provoking at times. In summation, buy it only if you enjoy solid music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Drivel, Brilliant!","review":"This is a brilliant CD; a heartfelt and heartbreaking work of pure genious.

Maybe Snow Patrole has another album that's better."},{"rating":"1","title":"These boys are in the PRIME TIME now, baby!","review":"Man, these bands today are sneaky. Sneaky GOOD! And smart, too! I mean, they call themselves rock bands, and radio stations call them rock bands, but in reality they are 3rd rate, talentless alt-rock/pop bands. Very, VERY clever and very wise. I mean, if enough of these \\"sucky\\" bands spew forth into the world and clog up the radio airways like a big wad of soap and hair clogs up the shower drain, then we may actually begin to think that this is what rock music actually IS, jack! And by the way, by \\"sucky\\", I actually mean \\"sucky GOOD\\". I mean if they weren't good, how else could these absolutely useless, musically-challenged, bad-song-writing losers get so much airplay?? Not to mention the big endorsements they received recently from Bill O'Reilly, the surviving members of the Ramones, and TV's hilarious Paul Riser of \\"Mad About You\\" fame.God bless you A&M; Records - you know a smart, good band when you hear one!! Keep up the good work, y'all!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrendous","review":"This is a band that tries to sound sincere but ends up being sort of like Coldplay, only worse. Coldplay has nondescript, non spectacular guitars and what not but this is an insincere interpretation of blandness. It's not the least bit inspiring as SP try to convince you in the level of emotional maturity they hope to reach. There's nothing unique about the compositions, only the bare essentials apparent for a britpop band. There's nothing new covered here, just a very bad imitation of other things and something that screams insincere and slightly pretentious, but not the dramatic kind - the wannabe kind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't blasphemize T Rex!","review":"This album is rather vanilla and bland and boring, and should never be mentioned in the same sentence as T Rex. T Rex is all about establishing a wicked boogie-rock groove and crooning over it like a glam rock superstar. This album doesn't set up any sort of groove, and definitely doesn't have a hint of glam in it, so just because one person said that a Snow Patrol song kinda sounds like the guitars in T Rex doesn't make it any better, because they don't, so get your own opinion!

It keeps going for what seems like forever, even though it's only about 3:30. The lyrics are ok, but not great. People can relate to them, so that's why they appeal to some. The drummer needs work. A lot of work.When I listen to a cd, I like to listen to the whole thing through.

Comparing LFO to the Beastie Boys is like comparing McDonalds to a fancy restaurant. The lyrics in this song make Vanilla Ice look like a lyrical genius. Most of you who gave it one star reviews summed it up nicely. Each line has nothing to do with the other (What does the fact that New Kids On The Block had a bunch of hits have to do with the fact that Chinese food makes you sick?). The beat is laughable. This song will make a great joke gift in the future. If you want to buy some hip-hop, try these artists: Beastie Boys, Company Flow, Styles Of Beyond, Binary Star, High & Mighty, The Roots, Mos Def, Talib Kweli, De La Soul, Jungle Brothers, Lone Catalysts, Ugly Duckling, Arsonists, Clokworx, J-Live, Gang Starr, Jeru The Damaja, Rakim, KRS-ONE, etc., etc., etc. Need I say anything else?"},{"rating":"2","title":"It is an awesome song and the guys in it are so hot","review":"I think that this song is really cool and the guys in the song are really hot.

I've never seen a group sell out on their first song, its quite a spectical. Oh yeah, the idea for the song is really original, anyone ever see \\"Grease\\"? Crappy groups will rise and fall in their 15 minutes because they have a million tastless teenyboppers crazed about them because they're cute. \\"I like girls who wear Abercrombie and Fitch.\\" The shallowness in this song is horrible also.

It's not like some 61 year old man is going to stumble upon this LFO site and wonder, \\" What's Abercrombie and Fitch?\\" Anyway, LFO are deelightful. They put the groove in my heart. And when I am in times of trouble, LFO come to me, speaking words of wisdom, Let It Be. I wanna be your LFO!

If these guys have any talent, they definitely didn't show it in this song (I can proudly say that I've never heard any of their other stuff before). If I didn't know any better, I would have thought that my little sister wrote the lyrics. The lead \\"singer\\" tries to sound hard as he dishes out some of the weakest rhymes since Vanilla Ice. However, as bad as the quality of the song is, it does have some entertainment value. The chorus is catchy and I'm sure it will be a party favorite this summer (and this summer only). So borrow this cd from a friend and play it when you're feeling silly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lyrical genius? To quote \\"A Mighty Wind\\": I don't think so!","review":"It has been 7 years since this song came out. No one has really heard from LFO since 2001, either (their second album yielded a minor hit and then crashed). Besides that, the \\"singer\\" jumps from one topic to another faster than Dan's father on \\"Roseanne\\". What does that tell you? They're destined to become either:a) a 2-hit wonder groupor b) nominee for \\"Worst Song of the 90's\\".I think they'll have great luck with both. The lyrics are insipid and disposable, and their voices are dull. Not bad, just (incredibly) dull. I'm ashamed that the techno group LFO has to share an artist page with these geeks.

Then I come here looking to see what other people may have thought about the song and so many people seem to hate it. Two words that described what I noticed about the people that don't care for it so much- Retro and Flashback. Some people who don't like this particular song list The Beatles songs as better music. Yo, don't try to rate Gen-X or Gen-Y music if you're so RETRO! I'm sure some people back in your day thought The Beatles stunk major too!

Then, in a short paragraph, sum up why you like the band and what is so intriguing about their music. Write down Summer Girls at the bottom. Now put the paper in a safe place. The reason I asked you to do this is so in 6 months, when you stumble on the piece of paper, you'll have the faintest idea who they are. Face it: in 6 weeks you'll be tired of LFO, and you'll move on to the next boring musical group. Have a nice life, and remember the paper."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Vienna Boys Choir Goes Hip Hop?","review":"LFO sound like a children's choir that suddenly decided out of nowhere to start rapping. Not only are the kids not accustomed to the bredth of the english language, therefore using repetitious and simple words to rhyme, but because it is an improvisation, they are just trying to get through the song, and so they rhyme what they can and try to cover it up with their cuteness. The children in the choir have one advantage though: They can probably carry a tune. Oh yeah, one more thing: MILES DAVIS!!! Buy On The Corner!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This song is so bad Limp Bizkit should sing it.","review":"This is easily the worst song I've ever heard. Half the lines give you the plot of the song (this guy sometimes meets girls in the summer and sometimes he likes them) the rest is just bad rhyming.. i mean TERRIBLE. For example, \\"... my name is rich. I like girls who wear Abercrombie and Fitch.\\" It's not like it's hard to rhyme things into the plot (or lack thereof). And then they mention Cherry Pez. I can't stand for that."},{"rating":"2","title":"I've had my share of \\"Summer Girls\\"!","review":"Yo, check it, my whole wardrobe is Abercrombie & Fitch and Fundip is the greatest. For those reasons alone I would love this song, but also I have been hurt at the end of \\"summer relationships\\" before and this song reminds me of the girl I met at Cape Cod and the summer we had and the way I never saw her again.

The lyrics, however, are inane. Here is my translation of them. \\"New Kids On The Block had a lot of hits\\" = \\"I have bad taste in music, and have had for ten years\\". \\"Chinese food makes me sick\\" = \\"The strongest seasoning I can tolerate is ketchup. I am boring\\". \\"I like girls who wear Abercrombie & Fitch\\" = \\"I like snobby rich girls\\".

If I could, this song would get 0 stars. I'm not the kind of person who really hates music...

One day my friend and I were in the car when all of the sudden LFO's \\"Summer Girls\\" came on.

I'm not going to sit here and say that these 3 guys can't sing because I've never heard them sing. In thier song it sounds like they're talking or rapping or something!?

On the very first test that I took (Developing a Logical Data Model), there were SEVERAL errors:Several questions marked the correct answer as wrong, but then in the Answer section, showed the correct answer.There were questions that tell you to choose multiple answers, but then give you radio buttons which only allow 1 answer.Several questions tell you to refer to the figure, where there is no button to get TO the figure.There is no way to close a figure once you have opened it other than moving to previous or next question and then moving back.All-in-all a very poor excuse for programming!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oblivion and Perdition","review":"I purchased this book with the expectation that it would help me prepare for the exam. The CD provides practice exams and other resources to give one the impression they are on their way to certification. However, there are numerous errors in the book as well as on the CD, particularly with the \\"Edge Test\\" software, which incorrectly grades tests and does not allow users to select the right answers. This issue is actually moot, since the practice tests actually do not address problems presented in the certification exam.

As such it's quite an achievement; seldom has so much spurious and pretentious nonsense been published in a single tome. Even the cover is worthy of the cheapest conspirationist quasi-non-fiction; complete with pretentious claims about 'truth revealed'. I suspect that this writer is just out for some quick money, because the whole thing is so glaringly ill-researched and ill-founded, that he cannot possibly believe what he's writing.

It was a masterful set of compositions, well performed and recorded, in the classic church music tradition. It is not a Slavonic style, though occasionally one can guess that it is Russian, but it is complex and rich in sound. I was not surprised to learn from the liner notes that Taneyev was well respected and lived a long life as a teacher and composer.

Anyway, since then I have used the DataTraveler regularly (just about every day) to copy files between an HP laptop and two iMacs and it has worked without a hitch. One funny observation. They put an In Use light on one side of this drive. In about half the USB ports I have put it in, the light is facing away from the user. It would be nice if there were some universal standards for USB ports about which way is up, or in the case of vertically mounted ones, which way is facing the user.

Aslo used as a source is WEB DeBois, who while he did some very good work, and is worth discussing, was a communist that gave up his American citizenship and moved to Guana.If you can stand your history with a strong dose of bias, the art work and style of Gonick are worth a look.

Read the forums, particularly his spicy comments about Bush and Kerry. Other cartoon guides (Statistics and Physics) were fairly immune to this sort of bias and somewhat enjoyable, but in this one, it cuts right into the meat.

No one cares whether you're a satisfied customer or not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome kitchen organizer, on a budget","review":"I intalled these in \\"all\\" my undercounter storage and they are great. Install took about fifteen minutes each using only a pencil, tape measure, square, and cordless driver and drill = simple and quick.Makes it super easy to store, organize, and access all my cook and bake wear, cleaning supplies, and various odds and ends. I have been using them for over a year and have had no problems at all. Every slider is packed full and works smoothely. My gear is mostly smaller, and light to medium duty, so this is perfect for me.I suspect that heavy kitchen equipment, in larger installations, might work better with HD ball-bearing sliders - BUT they were four to six times more expensive than these ClosetMaid kits."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the best messenger bag ever made.","review":"The title says it all.

It is especially great if you have a 15 inch widescreen laptop, like I do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not serious.","review":"A typical recording done in the Third World by adventurers coming from Europe with a good equipment. The work is not serious, although most of the performers are real drummers. Titles of tracks are strange inventions and lack a minimum of musicological seriousness. However, the text written by Gustavo Goldman (who did not participate neither in the recording sessions nor in the final Parisian editing) is good. The other announced texts are tricky, because they have been picked up from books written before."},{"rating":"2","title":"Folligen lotion","review":"It seems to be working.

Not only did it not lengthen my lashes, after 4 weeks of use they looked stumpy, and shorter than when I began. No effect at all on brows. I used it on a small patch of thinning hair near my hairline and think maybe I see a tiny improvement. Will not buy again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much","review":"280 pages, chock full of average photographs. Thirty pages cover history and influences; 40 pages of introduction to Glaswegians, their pubs, football, arts, and music; 130 pages go into way more detail about Glasgow than you want to know. Too much information for a local or a visitor. This book should have been cut in half and shared with Edinburgh."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE WORST DVD EVER RELEASED","review":"This dvd is the worst i have ever had the misfortune to pay for.The picture quality looks like the lowest grade pirate rip-off you have ever seen x100. The sound only comes out of one speaker !! I own some very obscure films from cheap-jack dvd companies, who could care less about the quality of what they put out, but this dvd is so far beyond atrocious that i am unable to watch what i have paid for. By the way this is a classic 1970's British horror film. Anchor Bay or Blue Underground should acquire the rights to this film. The full title of this film is \\"VENOM the Legend of Spider Forrest\\" Please do not waste your money as i did on this unwatchable and unaudioable dvd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Natural, mellifluent","review":"So far, almost every interpretaion of Bach's well-tempered clavier involves the radical faith about music and music performance, and every one tried their best excavating the great depth hidden in this reportoire. Hence we can easily recognize every pianist's deep thought,as Gould reflected his extraordinary and shining charecter, Richter both contemplated and composed, Landowska sang, Schiff focused on acoustic sweetness, Goula insisted on clean, unpedaled line. Here Herwitt gives us a new scope, a natural structural thinking of Bach. Every prelude and fuge is kept in a very natural tempo and articulation, without strange over-emphasized theme and contertheme. The progression of Hewitt's music is mellifluent, sometimes you will find these Bach's preludes and fuges sound so sweet, even seem to be a whole new work! If you do not expect to find or receive some serious meaning of life or faith in Bach's well-tempered klaviea, then is is a very good performance indeed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bach: Well-Tempered Clavier, Book 2","review":"Bach: Well-Tempered Clavier, Book 2 is a recording with the piano virtuoso Anne Hewitt. Hewitt is the best interpreter alive today but still behind the immortal tallent of Glenn Gould. Ms Hewitt has written the linernotes and one also gets a very short bio on the performer. These are available in English, French and German. This is a truly a treat for the Bach affecionados and connaisseurs of classical music. 5/5."},{"rating":"2","title":"Angela Hewitt - Bach WTC","review":"This is a truly great recording.

Schiff is wonderful, too, but this is even better."},{"rating":"1","title":"not usable due to SonicStage","review":"Hardware awesome, software a flop. Since you HAVE to use their software the package is destroyed. I will give you the final nail on the coffin for me. I tried to put Podcasts on the device using the latest SonicStage 4. No chance. It wants to be able to find each \\"artist\\" in the Sony library. This was bad for the odd bit of music it could not find but obviously it can not find the podcasts in their library.I had bought one of these and had considered one for the girlfriend - no chance now. Shame as the hardware was A1."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware","review":"This is my second mp3 player; I had an inexpensive Creative that was easy to use and nicely designed but it stopped working after about six months. I figured I'd try a Sony. I should have done my homework first. This unit is flimsy, the design is awkward. You have to use Sony's Sonic Stage to transfer files and it takes forever. Not compatable with itunes. I'm not a tech person but from what I can gather, it's really for playing Atrac files, not mp3. I tried to convert my mp3 files to Atrac using Sonic Stage but this only worked 50% of the time - (maybe I was doing something wrong but I invested about 3 hours and still couldn't get half my files to play.) This is just a white elephant. Make sure you know what you're buying before you get this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hopeless","review":"Bought for great price and radio worked well.

Boy was I wrong. I brought it home and tried to install the software onto my computer. The program kept canceling the installation process and when I went online to get the so called patch it did nothing to help me. NONE of the music that I had PAID for and downloaded onto my computer were compatable with the SonicStage. I became very frustrated and deleted the whole thing off my computer and returned it. When I went to return it the lady told me that it sounded like I got a corrupt disc, which I bought her story and exchanged it for a new bean. Same thing happened, I couldn't get the program to complete the installation process and took the whole thing back AGAIN to Target. Definately a waste of my time. The player looks cute and is nice in your hand but definately not worth the hassle it has with it. Don't waste your time in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Older kid","review":"The walkman is easy to use with enough memory for my meager uses.

Only records in WAV format. I don't know if this is an exclusively IPOD OS feature but two hours of recording uses 1.5GB (Too much in my concern)2. It consumes the full IPOD battery in less than 2.5 hours and the worst part is that this device has not choice to plug any charger the IPOD simultaneously.3. It has to be very (when I say very is very very) close to the source in order to capture a good record.4. When the device is attached to the IPOD you have to be very careful because is too easy to disconnect.In other words need a better design to fix the power consumption problem, the recording sensibility/format and the \\"attachability\\" to the IPOD"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for GTD to dos or as an audio journal","review":"Wow! A product that works great, is well designed, and a great value.I have a 5th generation video iPod and looked at all the voice recording products. I chose this one because of the playback function. If you're recording lectures, this may not be critical but if, like me, you want to use your iPod as a portable memory jogger, this is a great solution.This couldn't be simpler to use. Just plug it in and it automatically opens to the voice memo settings, and if you want to save your memos, they sync to your computer when you sync your iPod.I'm using it for to-dos, as another \\"capture\\" device and also as an adjunct to my working journals, which are becoming electronic.In this age of information overload, I need all the help I can get to capture my ideas and this definitely helps.You can unplug the mic, by the way, which is useful for storage and also means you can substitute another mic of your choosing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Quality Mic","review":"This is an outstanding product.

Yes, perhaps Josephine Baker is not everyone's cup of tea, but this two-disc collection is a lot of fun to listen to and enjoy. The sound quality is not at all raspy, slurry or fuzzy, although you can tell that these are vintage recordings which have been re-mastered onto CD. They are probably from 78 rpm records or maybe even old film soundtracks. I found the sound quality to be very clear and good considering the source materials available! Columbia River Entertainment Group has done a nice job packaging these \\"Cocktail Hour\\" sets, of which I own five and plan to buy more in the future. Please, if you plan to buy this lovely Josephine Baker CD, ignore the bad reviews and don't be influenced by them at all. Thanks for reading my review, direct all comments to BrideOfCyrano@aol.com"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money.","review":"The songs on this album are great songs, but the sound quality is DIPLORABLE!!! What a DISAPPOINTMENT. I really like Josephine's style and voice, but you can barely make out the words on this muffled slurred CD. It's like looking at a beautiful piece of art thats blurry. I am assuming that all the records in the \\"Cocktail Hour\\" series are just as bad judging from the reviews I've seen. Too bad I didn't do my research before making this purchase. My advice to other customers...look for the same songs elsewhere. Don't waste your money on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh !!","review":"Nasty quality, slurry, blurry, harsh and poorly remastered. Truly sounds like a series of well-worn 78's. If that's your thing, you'll enjoy this recording. But, if you're interested in actually being able to HEAR Josephine's remarkable voice, then there's little little reason to waste your money on this 3rd rate effort, given the broad choice of much better remasterings available."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this.","review":"This is the most unfortunate recording ever of this great symphony.I think Rattle realized about this gaffe so he hasn't come back onRach's symphonies ever since.

I put it together using the very easy to understand instructions. I just finished cleaning my daughter's bedroom carpet which is bubble gum pink and it looks GREAT!! I was surprised at the color of the dirty water that it extracted and I thought it was fairly clean. I have a Bissell Big Green Clean Machine that is very cumbersome to use and does not have rotating brushes, only the small brush across the edge of the extractor and only cleans a well as the muscle you put into it so I didn't use it very often and is collecting dust in the basement as I write this.

As a mystery, it had me guessing and second-guessing to the end; the historical details of the Harlem Renaissance and Strivers Row were woven flawlessly into the plot and brought that era to life; the writing and characters were interesting, witty, and true to their natures. Even the sad aspects were handled with sensitivity and an understanding of the many types of people and their motives, reactions, longings, etc. This novel is a rare find in today's world of literature.

Persia Walker had me hanging on her every word from start to finish! HARLEM REDUX is what many period novels strive to be, but never quite achieve-namely, a seamless blend of meticulous historical research, well-developed characters, and an unerring sense for the Zeitgeist of the era-in this case, the Harlem Renaissance. An added bonus: The whole shebang is all jazzed up and juiced up with Walker's prodigious creative gifts. And the mystery plot was brilliant: It blindsided me at the end, while making me wonder why I hadn't figured it out myself-just as every great mystery plot should. This novel is a breath of fresh air to the world of mystery novels, and to the world of fiction in general. I hope that HARLEM REDUX is the beginning of a long and succesful career for Walker. She'll have my vote-every time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Captivating Read","review":"I have the horrible habit of always judging books by their covers, and in this case I was not diappointed.

It's ALL about mapping a value stream, running projects based on the value stream, and using VSM as the management tool for a lean office. I like that, but I felt that this book spends far too much time focused on the one tool, and doesn't emphasize that it's one tool that is part of an overall management system that will just require more.Pros:- Excellent, thorough, breakdown of VSM in the office- Focused entirely on an office/service environment. It's not a retread with \\"manufacturing\\" replaced with \\"service\\" like some books.- Visual, with excellent pictures and examples throughoutCons:- Only emphasizes one tool- The wastes discussion was weak compared to other office books - I found several others to cover them much more thoroughly, with better examples."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, Solid, Lean Office Book","review":"I found this book to be a staple for our Lean Office training.

I read through the book twice so that I could really understand the material. Most of the chapters are interesting to read although certain sections were a little dry. He includes really nice examples to get you started and alerts you of common mistakes and how to avoid them.My only gripe is that the book was published in 2005 and is now outdated in the sense that the browsers he mentioned are now basically obsolete. Firefox is not even mentioned at all. Also he covers web design tools like Front Page which is now history.A second edition of this book is definitely needed, however the core concepts haven't changed that drastically, so I would still recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for tutorial as well as a cookbook","review":"I was looking for some time for a book that would teach me the rudiments of contemporary web design (with XHTM and CSS), as well as provide examples or cookbooks to let me get to where I wanted; that is, pretty sites witha separation between the layout and the content (MySQL, etc).After going crazy looking at piles of books, I finally got a look inside this one. Perfect! You get the basics, and the issues (browser bugs, etc), recommendations on design choices, and some very attractive examples (which are lacking in many of the beginner books I've seen).

I would not recommend this book to anyone without a degree in linguistics and even then I would hesitate. The authors seem to maximize the use of technical jargon and acronyms without even the slightest effort to define terms for the non-specialist. This is an opaque thesis that I mistook for a general work on the subject of ASL syntax. Other books on the linguistics of ASL are head and shoulders above this one.On top of this, the photos are abysmal. For a book that is trying to illustrate subtleties of ASL non-manual markers, etc., to have the photos be so poor is inexplicable.

Even cutting thin, crisp crust pizza is a bit of a chore that requires repeated rocking of the cutter blade.

For the average person though, this is a great chair. I purchased directly from Amazon, not another seller. The chairs came assembled and the shipping was super fast.UPDATE: I've now had these chairs for about 7 months. I still love them. They are solidly constructed.

Ah the display it is hard to see in anything but bright light, but that is a minor flaw. I often wonder why displays on equipment like this are not backlit, I mean this is not a battery operated device so what's the problem?

Then the heating element gets caked and the unit starts to spit and sputter. This happens even if it is cleaned every week. It would be nice if the heating element were made of stainless steel or some smooth metal that from which mineral build up could be removed. It has a 5 year limited warrenty but I can't believe that one could last more than one winter. I have had 2 of these units but neglected the first one which died very quickly. I've cleaned the second one constantly but it still has a build up on the heating element after 1 month. I don't know how Honeywell can still be selling this unit.

Just a while ago, it was reading 45%, while it was actually 70% in the room, so the problem appears to be getting worse.

Truly, impossible.I must have gotten a little too vigorous in my attempts, because the unit doesn't work anymore.

Because of a bleeding nose, sore throat, very dry skin, I came up with a solution that works great and didn't cost me a penny, and builds up the muscles in my hands. I was about to toss away a empty hand spray bottle of Febreze. I filled it with water and spray it into every room. I point it high and by the time the spray hits my carpet, it has almost evaporated.

Sonic quality (amount of pops, crackle, hiss or noisereduction artifacts) is about as good as you can expect for 30'stango, which is to say \\"pretty freakin' good.\\"Pay no attention to the previous 2-star review, that person mostlikely does not dance tango. This CD is a bargain, and I wouldrecommend it as a first Canaro purchase, and also as part of amore extensive collection that a Tango DJ needs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Your Grandmothers Tango","review":"This album is good for what it is- and as the previous review states the sound is awesome for recordings from 1930-40's.

More like fear of terrible b-movies...","review":"First off - let's cover the one question you must be asking: how scary are the clowns and how spooky the movie?? SPOILER: answer: this movie has nothing to do with clowns, other than the killer who dresses, very lamely, as kind of a clown, but without must effort at it. It is utterly without anything spooky or otherwise horror-related. The filmmakers obviously tried to capitalize on a popular horror theme - but it's only the poor quality of this video that is even remotely scary. One of the dullest, worst acted, plot-less, and tedious \\"horror\\" movies you'll ever wish you'd never wasted your time on.

I have been hunting wild mushrooms in the Colorado Rockies since about 2000, so I know what great porcini mushrooms taste like. That earthy umami, almost musty, smell and flavor that you can smell from your pores after eating them... nothing quite like it. Well, I first bought this pasta from a store in Fort Collins, CO that specialized in select olive oils and vinegars, and didn't really hold out much hope that it would be anything special, but boy was I wrong. Cooked this up to al dente perfection and tossed with mild black olives, a homemade pesto, and topped with parm. regg., and this was revelatory! That great earthy porcini smell and flavor rang true and at just the right level to blend well with the pesto and cheese notes. Well worth the cost and shipping. Loved this so much I will be trying other flavors like saffron and black olive linguini."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish this vacuum never came into my life","review":"I acquired this vacuum in 06. It was a wedding gift that replaced my husband's vacuum from the 1970's. I started having problems with this machine in the first few uses. The belt breaks constantly. I keep a large supply on hand. The on and off button broke. I have to unplug it to turn it on or off. It is heavy and hard to maneuver. When not in the upright position, the attachments fall out. The handle part where you grip the vacuum? The cap on the end falls off.The good things, the good things...It does a good job of telling you if the floor is still dirty. The bag is easy to change.Other than that, I wish I had kept the one from the 70's. I'm SO ANGRY at this particular vacuum, I will NEVER buy another Hoover because I am so disgusted they let this one come into existence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money on this","review":"I bought this vacuum after waiting over a year for a new vacuum, I was so exciting to use it. In the store I tested it out and it worked great. When I brought it home, it did not suck up anything such as hair or lint (we have cats). If you have animals - DON'T BUY THIS ONE.

Not sure how they fixed it -- it may have been a belt.Now the Embedded dirt light is not working -- it's staying on red/dirty. It may be a gimmick-type feature, but I'd prefer that it work.Maybe the Orek has lasted so long because there aren't so many features. In any case, it's dependable, easy to use and light weight.

I have a bad back, so we even sprung for the self-propel feature. I used the vauum ten times and the belt broke along with the motor. It was still under warranty, so I called Hoover Customer Service. Their service is terrible! It took them over a month to respond to my calls, letters, and e-mails. In the end, they still weren't helpful and we took the vacuum back to the store.It had decent sucking power and was relatively easy to use. The weight made it hard to manuever and the fact that it kept tipping over whenever I used the attachments really got on my nerves.In my opinion, Hoover is no longer a name of quality and I don't recommend them for ANYTHING!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing like my old Hoover.","review":"After a year of owning and using this vacuum we are very dissappointed in it. We have not had any brake downs like others but it just does not seem well designed. The unit is EXTREMELY LOUD especially when I am using the hose. The units tips easy when using the hose. Where the belt is to drive the brushes it does not pick up dirt so you have to retrace that step every time. I also have a lot of trouble with it trying to eat thinner carpets and other things I am trying to clean. We also have noticed the design flaws other have pointed out here. None of these things were a problem with the old Hoover Spirit which was a wonderful machine. The Windtunnel Supreme does clean very well with the exception noted above. We cannot return ours at this point but I would suggest you could do much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time and Money","review":"Bought the Hoover Windtunnel Supreme two years ago.

Both my sister and mother have this vacuum as well- all of us are looking for new vacuums to buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacks Longevity","review":"I bought this vacuum cleaner 3 years ago to the month and unfortunately, now I have to purchase another one. I should have gotten the extended warranty offered at time of sale but I expected it to last at least 5 years. The on and off power switch was giving some problems, until about 4 months ago it finally stopped working. Once its on it stays on despite sliding switch to the off position. I tried to repair it myself from an online help instruction, but that failed. It worked once but then the problem resumed. Also,the bag indicator still remains a mystery to me.

It vacuumed wonderfully, restored the pile of my carpet, and the self-propelled feature was great. However, about a year later that feature disappeared (I admit I wasn't paying too much attention, but I did notice what a workout it was to push), and around Christmas, I realized that the vacuum simply wasn't picking anything up anymore. I took the whole blasted thing apart, cleaned the brush, checked the belt, poked through the hose with a coathanger, and didn't find anything. I couldn't afford to have it fixed, and judging from the reviews, that would've cost more than buying another vacuum anyway! The vacuum was nearly $300 when I bought it, which is a hell of a lot of money to spend on less than two years' worth of use. If that's going to be the case, then I think I'll stick to the throwaway models for under $100."},{"rating":"1","title":"heavy, hard to push, does not roll well when not vacuuming","review":"The unit is heavy and hard to push around. When not vacuuming and locked in upright mode, it is hard to move. A plastic piece scraps against the carpet when you tilt it and try to move it. The hose attachment have good suction, but it's reach is limited and it's hard to not move the whole vacuum by accident when using the hose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Already broken","review":"I have only had this vacuum a year, I'm not crazy about it. The attachments have to be used in conjuction with a tube with a flap on it, and the flap broke off, now if I want to use the attachments I have to block the hole with my hand or watch everything shoot back out. It also keeps tipping over on me. Othewise ok,"},{"rating":"2","title":"Still Going","review":"After reading the reviews, I had to issue my own. I purchased the Hoover Supreme Mach 3.3 Windtunnel in '96 or '97 and it is still going, however, just recently,the motor is making a loud noise just as I shut it off. I suppose it is finally dying. It has gone thru three remodeling projects over the years and only problems are belt replacements 3 or 4 times which I found no problem replacing myself as long as I have the right belt to replace it with. It does tend to tip unexpectedly and bags need to be replaced when only half full for best suction. After the brushes on the roller wore down, I had problems picking up fuzzes/strings ( I sew alot)from a tighly woven carpet - needed a lint roller! Instead of replacing the roller at $40.+ I'll put that toward next vac. Sounds like this may have been one of the better models Hoover has made over the years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great vacuum","review":"I just bought this at sears for the same price, and i love it. The dirt sensors are cool, the light turns from red to green when you have picked up all the dirt in an area. Simple to assemble, i did it by myself. It picked up the pile on my carpet well too, and it has a hard floor setting which worked well too. The only drawback is the short length of the hose, but there are two wands included for reaching.

I do think the red/green clean light is somewhat useful when it is red, but turns green much too quickly when the carpet is not dust or pethair free yet. I have a cat with soft fur and this vacuum is practically useless at picking it up no matter how many times I go over it. I have to use the attachments to get a better job, but as others have mentioned, the whole vacuum tips over after very little extension and the parts come off the hose easily.After vacuuming the same spot minutes after the green light was on, and after I thought it could pick up no more dirt, I vacuumed with another vacuum that amazed me on what was still on the carpet. Yuck!!!!I am finally looking for a new one that will actually clean my carpet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hoover WinTunnel Supreme - not so supreme","review":"This vacuum is absolutely junk.

His favorite recipe is for buttermilk pancakes. The batter is really thick and the opening at the bottom of the dispenser is too narrow to let the batter through. So be cautious before buying the dispenser - if your batter is pretty runny, then it should work. I suppose this means your pancakes are really flat.

Not that I was using this for parenting guidance or anything, but I found myself skipping over lots of sections. It also gets very repetetive after a while - the same things are repeated over and over in slightly different ways.You'd be much better off with either a real journal if you want to take lots of notes (this has very little writing space and is really just a book) or get a good baby book for recording milestones and memories.

So there's no reason to give it a bad rating for the actual use of it and what you're buying it for.

I got about three and a half months use out of this item before it completely gave out. Is it the batteries? No. Is it the bulb? Possibly, but that wouldn't make sense with a statement from Violight saying that it is a \\"lifetime bulb.\\" Either way, it's ridiculous.Spending $30 on this item isn't a big deal to me in the slightest.

These gizmos are absolutely useless.(1) Anything that gets on your toothbrush head was ALREADY in your mouth.

Which means it is sitting in a puddle of water that is likely to mold/mildew. So you can put mold/mildew INTO your mouth (that was NOT in your mouth before).(3) The puddle of water is likely to (a) rust out the innards of this gizmo and (b) short-circuit the gizmo's electronics.(4) The American Dental Association says these gizmos have no proven beneficial health benefits[...]Given all that, it seems your money would be better spent betting \\"Hard 8\\" at the Craps table in Vegas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good","review":"I bought this to take to Iraq.

After 2 weeks, I had to start shaking it to get the light to turn on. Now, I'm just waiting for it to quit working all together.

One worked, the other never turned off after 7 minutes, 20 minutes, 12 hours. I could only assume whatever sanitizing needed to be done, was done in 7 minutes on my toothbrush, but my wife's toothbrush needed some serious sanitizing, because hers never turned off. Made me wonder where her mouth has been that this unit never stopped sanitizing.I did believe this sanitizing crap was doing its thing. But I can't help but believe in fairies and Santa Claus.Basically on review of the two products I purcased, one works I suppose, the other is defective!

It worked for a few days and then would go dead on me. After a month of running out and buying new batteries, the unit finally stopped working all together.I never dropped this unit nor had it submerged in water.

Remote control on/off switch big/bulky and difficult to put on a key ring because of a small pass through hole. Also goes through batteries fast (if you turn it on for the flashing light and alarm).

No big deal, the key still worked. Until... last week, the lock somehow jammed, and I was unable to unlock the Wrap from my steering wheel. I struggled with it for quite some time and even called the 1-800 number on the key. Of course, no one answered. I left a message in a panic, and, of course, no one returned my call. The only way to remove the Wrap was to cut it open and dismantle the lock. The bf brought out his drill and chipped away at the metal and plastic. About an hour later, with a mess of metal and plastic shavings blanketing the car's interior, we removed the Wrap. Overall, a horrible experience. I would never recommend the Wrap to anyone and am searching for a new security device.

As the studio director he could call upon the cream of London's musicians and vocalists, so his recordings bear comparison with the best. Furthermore to begin with Crystalate produced cut-price records which were sold exclusively in Woolworth's. The reason for his relative obscurity is that to give the impression of a roster of bands they were issued under a variety of pseudonyms.So he is long overdue proper recognition, and this first volume spans the mid to late thirties, with just one 1940 track included. It's a well-balanced compilation, embracing a variety of styles and vocalists and enabling us en route to hear musicians of the calibre of Max Goldberg, Ted Heath and Freddy Gardner, to name but a few. The records may have been cut-price, but there was nothing cheap about the performances."},{"rating":"2","title":"Diversity in my school","review":"I read this book about 4 years ago, and I still tell people about it. I think that everybody who attends school should read this book. It tells about how much diversity is in our schools and how we shouldn't ignore it. A lot of students like to so they don't have to deal with it. But I think that we should all recognize those few people in school who are willing to stick up for others because they are being made fun of because of their beliefs or life-styles. This book shows a very good example of those few students."},{"rating":"1","title":"The War Between the Classes","review":"I think that the main topic of the book,\\"The War Between the Classes\\" by Gloria D.

The girl in the book, Amy, obeys her boyfriend as though he is God. Even though she the author makes it seem as though she is getting her own life back, in the end she still does the same thing. What sort of story is this. It makes it look like women are inferior to men!"},{"rating":"2","title":"No title","review":"This novel for teenagers, dealing with racial and social differences/discrimination and its influence on the already tense relationship between the Japanese girl Amy and the Upper Class boy Adam, shows how up to date the mentioned problems are. Based on an authentic incident, \\"The Color Game\\" by the teacher Ray Otero which was played by students to get an insight in what life means on the other side of society, reflects the prejudices and stereotyped pictures in the people's minds. The only problem of the novel is that the action can be guessed easily and that some situations correspond to the typical cliches although this should be avoided because by using cliches the author contradicts his main intention. But all in all, especially pupils should read this novel in order to get informed about the way society still operates today. They are supposed to think about their behaviour towards people who have another colour or another social status."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its a great story","review":"This story has an ingredible message which is you shouldn't judge people by their skin color or their cultures.Parents,yourself,and your beliefs shouldn't keep you away from the person or people you love."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice 1","review":"I used this book in a high school English course. It was recommended to me by the media specialist. Students loved it. I read it with them and I felt it was an easy, enjoyable read. The plot is somewhat predictable. As a teacher, I knew what the teacher was setting the student up to do. What was interesting to me was the way in which the characters in the book treated eachother. It was great to teach stereotypes in class. Also, this book made teaching cultural archetypes and universal themes easy. Students also really wanted to do their own color game. I would say this is a great read for young adults and that it helps students learn acceptance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book","review":"This book was very interesting. It started out slow, but as I advanced through the story it became better and better. I reccommend that you read this book. It's about Amy: from a lower class Japanese family, and her boyfriend Adam: who finds her different and \\"exotic\\" according to Adam. They struggle together as they move through the four most devastating weeks of their lives. The \\"color game\\" has given them the opportunity to see what it's like living on the low end.

I really can say that I did not enjoy it. In my opinion the story is already known. If you have the brave to read the beginning of the book, after a couple of pages, you can already divine the happy end: Of course nothing on the world can seperate the upper-class-boy and the poor, Japanese girl. By the way the Japanes girl (Amy) is the heroine of the book and everybody, even Amy's parents who did not agree with her relation ship to Adam at the beginning, because they are proud of their Japanes, old traditions and want to keep them, accept their daughter's relation. May be, that the system of classes and the prejudices of America are shown, but the plot, I think, is too simple for being a realistic great book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The War BetweenTheClasses","review":"The book deals with racial and sexual discrimination.Amy and Adam,the main characters,play at school the color game ,which devide the class into different social classes.The minorities are the Oranges and the inferior color is Blue."},{"rating":"1","title":"for pre-teens only","review":"I was made to read this book as a senior in high school, for all high school teachers reading this, please do not make 17 and 18 year olds read this. It is written for 10-13 year olds, and at our level this kind of book makes me cringe with irritation because of the level of writing. I and my peers just finished Hamlet for god's sakes and then we are made to read this. It is a good book for pre-teens, but for all you teachers, please teach this book to the age group it was meant for. I just wanted all teachers to know this. It is good for pre-teens but utterly annoying for higher level readers who read Ayn Rand for fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been good","review":"this book was nothing more than a good idea warped into a boring love story and a preachy message. The whole idea of the color game was a very original idea, but the overemphasized love plot made the book seem almost trashy. The japenese parents were displayed very well, but the rest of the characters were predictible and one-sided. The end was predictable as well, and many of the good non-prejudice ideas the author was trying to write were buried underneath a phony plot and were exagerated. The book could have been good, but in the end, i was dying for it to be done.

And now every time I use it, I seem to be just tossing around dirt behind me. The dust cup is also very hard to attach correctly and extremely hard to empty without dirt flying everywhere. The entire vacuum cleaner just seems to always be covered in dust. A warning to those of you who try to use the attachment. The brush roll does not turn off when using the attachment feature.
