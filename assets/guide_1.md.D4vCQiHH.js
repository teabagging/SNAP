The stuff is just a gelatin that you smear on the back of my heart monitor band during my work out to moisten it. Works every time without fail. The same stuff the cardiologist uses when they do my EKG every year so I knew it would be just fine. Yeah it works, doesn't take much and is cheap so how can you go wrong?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for use with pulse monitor","review":"I've been using this regularly for a couple of years. When using my Polar heart monitor for cardio, I've had trouble getting the chest strap to pick up my pulse sometimes - especially in cold weather when my skin is dry. Water by itself doesn't work reliably, but when I put a dab of this underneath both sides of my Polar heart monitor chest strap it picks up my pulse flawlessly.This is less expensive than some others, and a big tube will last a long time. Some other good points are that it doesn't have any odor or leave any sticky or messy residue - wipes right off cleanly after exercising.Another brand I tried worked well also, but was more like a runny cream with a strong fragrance. This is more of a clean gel that stays in place and just does its thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked as advertised","review":"Using product with my heart rate monitor.

It can be used with metals to conduct. Silverand and stainless steel. Silver contacts soldering into clips for the ear lobes or other areas, use your imagination. Punched areas of the body can have metal clips connected to ems or tens for thereaputic or fun. After placing conductors on cover the area with Spectra 360 and keep most adding more till you are done, this again will give you constant results and develope a good baseline. Keeping a log is a good idea, what conductors you are using, locations placed,duration of treatment, setting on ems or tens, the desired result and on 1-10 scale did it meet expected results."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product & good price","review":"It was easy to order from Amazon.

I prefer Spectra 360. Both products provided a good stable connection and heart rate readings. Spectra is a substantial clear gel that adheres well when you apply it to the chest strap. Buh-Bump is a thin liquid cream that tends to run and drip off the chest strap. Spectra cost me about $1/oz while Buh-Bump cost about $3/oz.I need a reliable HRM reading because I use a treadmill program which sets the treadmill speed based on my heart rate. If my chest strap does not make a good connection, the heart rate reading jumps around, and the treadmill goes a little berserk trying to get my heart rate reading to the target rate.Both products provided a good HRM chest strap connection, but Spectra 360 was cheaper and easier and more pleaseant to use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works very well!","review":"I'm using this stuff to get good reliable readings from a heart rate monitor that I wear during excercise sessions. It takes only a drop, and it works really well! Solves the problem of getting good steady readings from the monitor, especially when you're not all sweated up from the exercise. Cleans up very easily too. Also, because it takes so little, one tube of this stuff should last for a really long time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Spectra electrode gel","review":"I purchased this for use with a Garmin Forerunner 305 for running/biking.

Thanks a bunch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sold Out","review":"I have heard this CD many times; but I must admit I enjoyed watching it maybe even more than listening to it. I can't say that about all Christian Music Videos. Probably the highlight of the video is when Helen Baylor shares her story. She is a living testimony and it was a pleasure to listen to her story and see as a testimony how Jesus Christ has made a difference in her life and that she is \\"Sold Out\\" to Him; not her own anymore.Perhaps this is what makes this DVD truly special, is that in this portion of the video is ministry on a different level."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't do it!","review":"Unfortunately, this is an absolutely hideous recording of a pleasant performance.

The special effects include some of the FIRST underwater motion film ever made. There is no dialoged sound track, a pianist accompanies the black&white (sometimes brown& white) images while occasional subtitles elude to the drama as it unfolds. The image bobs and weaves like a video camera was held in front of a screen showing the celluloid film to make this into DVD. A tripod would have helped.If you must have any and all submarine movies, or are collecting samples of cutting edge effects before the era of synchronized sound, then this DVD is for you. If you're looking for the \\"20,000 Leagues Under the Sea\\" where the squid wraps around the sub in full color & sound, then I think the Disney version is the one you want. I'll keep both versions!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Classic","review":"For the time, the special effects in this movie are great. This is a great family film. To realize that this story was writen long before there was a submarine let alone a nucler powered sub is amazing.In a time of sail ships and steam powered ships, A brilent man that has escaped from slavery with a loyal bunch, discovers the power of the atom, and builds an atomic submarine. along with his loyal crew he now targets the poducts that come from slavery, and trys to sink every ship that carries cargo from slaves. his sub seems to the world to be a sea creature attacking ships and is hunted. because of his curcumstances, captin Nemo belives that humanity is doomed and refuses to have any pitty for anyone, and at any cost he knows he must never let anyone know about the atom because of it's great destructive power.

That's exactly what this film was. It was one of the very first films to make extensive use of underwater photography. Almost too extensive in fact. While long panoramas of coral reefs and sea beds in black and white might have thrilled audiences in 1916, they can start to get a little tedious to modern viewers. Overall, though, this version of the classic Jules Verne tale is very well presented. The acting and visuals are good for that time time period. The film goes beyond the book to present a very unique explaination of Capt. Nemo's origins and motives. This Capt. Nemo is very different from the one in the Disney productions that would follow.

Apparently this is another early film now in the public domain that anybody can \\"remaster\\", repackage, and sell on Amazon. (There's at least one other such edition also being advertised.)Since it is such an important early film you should purchase the 1999 Image Entertainment edition (UPC 014381466621), which appears to still available via Amazon; it looks the way you'd expect early 20th century films to look (i.e. hasn't been digitally modified to any appreciable extent) and it's watchable.Perhaps some day some studio really will remaster this film - but the A2ZCD edition isn't the One."},{"rating":"2","title":"Right on the mark,.......","review":"Professor Farron's book is packed with real-life examples and official policies of how 'Affirmative Action'- or as it is called, cloaked in it's new moniker, 'Diversity'- has had discriminatory effects on people like me who happen not to be 'a person of color'. His clear descriptive quote on Diversity and its subsequent effect is so full of self evident truth that the quote alone is worth buying AND reading the whole book:\\"Diversity is the most insidious and pernicious of all defenses of discrimination. The other justifications assume that discrimination is a necessary evil, a temporary expedient that is needed to produce a society in which race and ethnicity are irrelevant.

She was equally fascinated with the stories which are told from the point of view of Jimmy an English boy who joins the circus with his family. I recently read a biography of Enid Blyton which said she originally conceived wrote a version of this book as an adult book but noone would publish it so she subseqently rewrote it as a children's book. i think this is evident in the fact that the adult characters are much more developed in this book than in other Enid Blyton books and there are plenty of allusions to adult-type concerns (eg, Jimmy's father's unemployment and the family's poverty etc)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Schubert Complete Piano Sonatas: Walter Klien, pianist","review":"Volume 3, CD 2 is apparently identical to Volume 2, CD 1 according to the information my computer provided when I inserted the CDs.

I gave a copy to a friend of mine whose husband died of cancer and now I am sending it to my niece & her husband, who has cancer.This book has a good philosophy. Sometimes things happen for no reason. God is not sitting in heaven sending us bad things. God loves us and cares about us when bad things happen.Rabbi Kushner says that when bad things happen, we'll ask, \\"God, why did you let this happen to me?\\" when a better response is to say, \\"God, help me with this\\".This book helps the reader to remember that when we are dealing with any type of loss, e.g., loss of a loved one, loss of health, loss of home, God loves us and will help us deal with our loss."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad doctrine","review":"I was going through a horrible time in my life and really hoped this book would comfort and bring light.

The problem I have is with Kushner's solution to the problem of evil. He resorts to Aristotle's view of viewing God as impotent. This contradicts the Kalam Cosmological Argument as well as the Ontological Argument for the existence of God. It also contradicts many passages in the Tanakh.Jeremiah 32:27 \\"I am the LORD, the God of all mankind. Is anything too hard for me?Jeremiah 32:17 \\"Ah, Sovereign LORD, you have made the heavens and the earth by your great power and outstretched arm. Nothing is too hard for you.Genesis 18:13-14 Then the LORD said to Abraham, \\"Why did Sarah laugh and say, 'Will I really have a child, now that I am old?' (14) Is anything too hard for the LORD? I will return to you at the appointed time next year and Sarah will have a son.\\"The book may be comforting, but it is unbiblical, and it offers little hope that God will one day overcome evil."},{"rating":"1","title":"this book does more to hurt than to help","review":"It is the position of this author that the only explanation for pain in this world is that God is not in control. He portrays a limited God who would like to end our suffering, but cannot. His writing sounds comforting at first, and is written from his own personal pain, but in the end it spreads a very dangerous idea. God is not limited, he cannot be. People coming to Rabbi Kushner for explanation and understanding will be disapointed. Seek another explanation, do not swallow his. God has his reasons for pain, life in this world is based in suffering, as the Buddha says. It makes us worthy of heaven and able to enjoy it ever so much more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent resource for the bereaved","review":"I recently suffered a miscarriage after several rounds of extensive fertility treatments.

This book helps to put into perspective the existence of God amidst life's greatest tragedies while honoring your feelings of grief and injustice.

He has God down as an impotent being who has little control over his creation, and sits or stands by while chance or \\"luck\\" determines their miserable outcome; and this includes Kushners' own son to whom the book is dedicated. This book is according to the introduction, supposed to offer hope and peace to its readers; but all it seems to do is vilify God and His Word, on the one hand and then pats Him on the back and tells us now we can continue to love and serve Him, because He is not causing our suffering, just impotent to deal with it.

In the place where I was it made me feel like I was somehow to blame for having cancer, and if only I adopted the right attitude, things would get better.

Another reviewer criticized the book for not providing a logical and substantiated answer to the question, \\"Why do bad things happen?\\". I believe the \\"answer\\" he provides is simply this - we don't have the answers, and we probably never will. That being said, by wallowing in our own guilt, blaming others, or dwelling on the \\"why\\", I believe Rabbi Kushner suggests that we tend to forget that there are others suffering that just need our comfort and support - they don't want our answers, just our friendship, as he did with his tragedy. For oneself, don't dwell in anger, or in denial, or in blame, because sometimes things aren't your fault, and they're not God's either - let go, and move on to the healing. If this book helps people get to that stage quicker, then I think its served its purpose."},{"rating":"2","title":"A new perspective on God","review":"Rabbi Kushner describes a very different kind of god who does not cause suffering, who is not all powerful and who does not interfere in nature by pulling the strings of the world to make it fit into some master plan. He also explains why it is still proper to pray to a god who is not as commanding as one originally thought.This is a very short book which will be of value for both religious and atheist people who cannot accept the traditional view of an omnipotent god because of tragedy and misfortune which affect those who do not deserve it. For those who do hold a more orthodox view of God, this should provide an interesting alternative to grapple with."},{"rating":"2","title":"when bad things happen to good people","review":"I thought it was difficult for me to follow.

We do this through our own personal growth from the experience, and by continuing to live purposeful and meaningful lives. This book changed my life. I have read all of Rabbi Kushner's books and have found his philosophy to be among the most insightful and spiritually enlightening of our time.

Rabbi Kushner's thoughtful insights that God does not mete out punishments, especially to you for other people's actions, but is there to help you through with hope and possibility - that is powerful, healing, loving, and wonderful.

Keith Michell was multi married monarch from 18 to his death. He actually looked like the portraits come to life.As to the wives my absolute favorite is Dame Dorothy Tutin as the tragic Anne Boleyn then Elvi Hale as cunning Anne of Cleves .All of the actresses and actors are brilliant. Some have not been seen since this series others went on to become well known in their own right.The program was classic BBC/Masterpiece Theater in the old days. Along with such programs as I Claudius, Edward the King, and Elizabeth R.For younger viewers who do not remember these programs first run don't be put off by the soap opera appearance.

Just awful. The acting, the writing, even the LIGHTING was bad. I usually don't notice things like lighting, but the excessive shadows everywhere sort of made me take notice. The sets are virtually non-existent. All the walls are bare - they didn't even have the decency to hang up some tapestries. I only made it through Catherine and Anne but the actresses were WAY too old for their parts. Catherine looks at least 30 at the beginning when she is supposed to be 16. And the worst part was that this series was downright boring. I can live with all of the above so long as they tell a good story. The producers didn't even need to come up with a good story - they had one, right in front of them, and this is what they did with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Six Wives of Henry VIII","review":"I was extremely disapointed in this product. The pace was very slow moving and at times extremely boring. It was difficult to hold ones attention through out parts of the videos and it was definrtly not something you could watch in all one sitting. I had to take breaks in between just to get through it. However although the way the content was presented was much drearier than hoped for the content was more historically accurate than most films on the topic and it did pick up a little near the end. However having said that I would probably not recommend this product for the sole factor that it is very hard to get through without a loss of concentration, and becoming extremely bored."},{"rating":"1","title":"How could such an interesting period be so boring?","review":"Considering that few periods of history are as intriguing as the Tudor era, and that Henry's wives and his relationships with same are the stuff of which an entire library could be filled, the company which produced this series should receive a medal for originality. They managed what one would think impossible: reducing all and sundry to tiresome bores, with dialogue so banal that one would think the king and queens depicted were as lively as those one would find in a deck of cards."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I bought this based on other people's reviews on Amazon.

It takes one through his apprenticeship and various adventures in the silver mines of Idaho, until by the end of the book he is a competent silver miner. I would not call Mr. Dolph a great, or even a very good writer; in fact, I doubt if he would describe himself so. He writes with an honesty and a self-effacing wit that more than makes up for any stylistic shortcomings. This book delves into a lot of the minutiae in terms of tools and techniques that a miner needs to master, but I never found this to detract from the great tale he has to tell. And, in spite of, or perhaps because of, his slight shortcomings as a writer, this is a fascinating book. He writes like someone you might like to meet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but there could be more","review":"I wish there was more in this book about script formats and script notes then just what's funny and what's not. Many good points are made but the examples are outdated and focus on shows from the 70's and 80's, which may be tough for a younger reader to relate."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"please stop talking about 'Head of the class'\\"","review":"The structure in writing a script was very good, but everytime it starts to get interesting he starts breaking down scenes from head of the class.

While Jerry Rannows Writing Television Comedy gives a fairly accurate picture of the wellknown \\"spec-script/pitching\\" process that could land you a professional assignment, there is not much in here that would make you carry this assignment through. Stale, inadequate and set in a jokey, unbearably selfimportant prose.

Despite the lack of certain details (who wouldn't expect this?), this tells the ordinary interested person much about the unique history of this fighting unit that is the envy - yes, Paul, envy - of Delta Force et al. Paul Devine's knee-jerk reaction about Bastian's review misses the point: our special forces group have yet to claim such a track record as these guys, such as their takedown of the Iranians. We should start taking notes from these guys if we want Iraq not to be a repeat of our previous efforts. I, for one, am glad these guys are on our side."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reenacted, nothing new.","review":"Except for a few seconds on the second tape, all footage consists of re-enactments.

I've read the Andy McNab books (which are excellent by the way) and was looking for any dvd information. 'Special Air Service - The Soldiers Story' turned out to be several television programmes rolled into a dvd. The research into the topic feels very rushed and thrown together. The sound quality is poor and the content will probably only please those who have absolutely no prior information on the subject. In fairness, I had high expectations from this dvd but, with little more than McNab's books to go by, this provides very little further interest.Probably best to stick to publications on the subject, books or magazines.

A fantastic read, that goes into great depth of the special training, and most interestingly, the storming of the Iranian embassy.

After watching this dvd, I find I know as much now as I did before. Not terrible but then not very good either. It looks like they ran out of money half way through a History channel project, which may explain why I had not seen this \\"documentary\\" on TV.

Where do these \\"repressed\\" feelings the baby needs to express come from? The womb? What could a baby have possibly gone through that is so traumatic it just needs to cry?

At this point, they are all pretty much dashed.I cook every day and have for years. The best of these recipes is mediocre. On one occasion, I clearly recall preparing yet another of Justin's dishes and, just as it was nearing completion, my wife strolled into the kitchen with a wrinkled nose and said, \\"What stinks?\\" Sadly, she was right.I DID give the book an extra star here because I loved the homegrown photographs which were snapped by Justin's pretty wife. I thought that they were really good and quite reflective of his regional cooking.If you really want an outstanding cajun cookbook, grab a copy of Paul Prudhommes, \\"Chef Paul Prudhomme's Louisiana Kitchen\\":Chef Paul Prudhomme's Louisiana KitchenI actually did love old Justin and I think his cooking show was more fun than any other which ever aired on television -- but you can safely skip these recipes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good at all","review":"This is another example of an ego-maniacal 'Cajun' chef trying to cash in on an uneducated public. Justin Wilson's cooking belongs in a roadside taco stand. Granted, it's nowhere near as vile as the stuff Emeril Lagasse tries to pass off as food, but it still misses the mark. Justin Wilson's really bad fake Cajun accent just makes it all worse. Save yourself the money and other problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"raft","review":"I think this is a pretty good raft.

It did, however hold up pretty well, and it's so lightweight. If you have to portage a lot, this is the way to go. If you have a long way to go on nice open water, I would probably choose a canoe or something a bit faster.

Also, I turned on to a friend by collecting the black & gold type, which is almost absent from this book altogether.What i will say is that this book does touch on so many different items that the company did make that i had no idea, such as lamps and the many colorful birds, which are colorfully represented here.

I would recommend this frisbee to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Dog Disk","review":"I most often use a chuck-it and a tennis ball with my retrievers, but when the snow's deep I prefer the disks as they are easier to find. They are great, easy to throw, and, because of their flexibility, easy for the dogs to pick them up even on a flat surface. I don't know why these disks are not more generally available. I've only ever seen them on websites, never in stores. With most retrievers the disks will last a very long time, but, of course, there are always those dogs that will chew up anything. In any case, the disks are not meant to be a chew toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"JUNK","review":"This product lasted only hours with my 9 month old black lab and I made the mistake of buying two of them..what a waste of money !!!

I have an 8 month old working lines farmdog that needs ~2 hours of exercise a day. I play a LOT of frisbee. This one is my absolute favorite.The Ruff Dawg K9 Flyer flies the best. It's a durable rubber-like material. It's more lightweight than other frisbees (markedly, theWest Paw Design Zogoflex Dog Toy, Zisc, Colors Vary, which doesn't fly well). I throw in a very large field, if you have a smaller yard then the West Paw Zisc would be fine.This one is light enough that it flies beautifully, yet somehow it is quite durable. The toy isn't designed for tugging or chewing, and won't stand up to being left alone with a chewer for long, but it takes quite a bit of abuse. My dog is 60 pounds and likes to tug with this one, he puts all of his weight into it and jerks it about and they last fairly well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ruff Dawg K9 Flyer","review":"My dog Woody is a rambunctious, full of energy 24/7, 3 yr old Chocolate Lab and powerful chewer. Ruff Dawg Toys are the only toys that can withstand his wrath and the only toys that I will buy!! We have hours and hours of fun playing Frisbee with the K9 Flyer. If Woody is left alone with a frisbee, he will have it shredded within the hour....he doesn't even want to tear this one up....he just wants me to keep throwing so he can keep chasing and catching. There are times when he doesn't want to release and he wants to tug. I was afraid that if he tugged, it would tear or rip because the rubber is not as thick as the other Ruff Dawg toys...but it held up. I wouldn't recommend playing tug with the K9 Flyer or leaving your dog unattended with it...but so far, it's held up just as well as the stick, rock, and large bone. If you have a dog that will destroy most toys in seconds.....Ruff Dawg Toys are the way to go!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Our dogs alwys love these things!","review":"They fly straight, and because they are soft, our dogs love catching them.

This disc is perfect because she can't tear it up! It still flies well and you can even tug on it and play with it and it stretches just enough and it won't tear! It feels almost a little rubbery. I'm so impressed with the quality!! It's also nice because I can hose it off after and it dries quicker than the discs with any fabric on them from both the hose and the drool.

I don't think that they should have had so much stuff about the Hindu religion, I think that it should have been more centered on God, and actual events that happened, rather than on what they don't have proof of.

The sound quality was rubbish it kept going loud and soft I\`m Shore I wont be watching it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Operation Dumbo Drop rises to the occasion","review":"Operation Dumbo Drop is a movie with heart. Set during the Viet Nam War, the movie brings a group of soldiers together to deliver an elephant to a remote village. The soldiers vary in personality and motivation. But they all come together to succeed in completing the mission. The movie is drama & comedy with scenes of sweetness mixed in. I rate this movie quite \\"Family Friendly\\" with a few exceptions. Not for young children as there is some drinking (native alcohol rice drink that makes novices vomit), bathroom humour, and lying by our group of misfit soldiers. Violence is present but either off camera or slapstick (really, it IS an elephant, after all). These issues can be discussed by the parents. A fun movie to enjoy as a family."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE this movie!","review":"Caught the last hour of this movie on TV. Almost didn't watch it as thought from the description that it was a silly children's movie, but nothing else was on. Enjoyed it so much I waited for almost a year for it to be rerun so I could tape it. Never saw it again, then remembered I could probably get it on Amazon! Bought a used copy. It plays perfectly AND...it has subtitles for the Viet Cong scenes, contrary to the complaints from other reviewers. I feel very fortunate. I thought an important moral built into this script was keeping a promise no matter how inconvenient, or even dangerous, it may be for you. This film made me laugh, cry, hold my breath from tension and left me with a feeling of satisfaction at the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"4* for the Movie 1* for the DVD","review":"The movie itself was good clean fun with surprisingly accurate uniforms.

Not worth the money!","review":"My rating is for the dvd itself, not for the movie. The movie is delightful and heartwarming, but Disney trashed it by leaving out the subtitles which are so necessary here to get the full story. Even though I've seen the original version and can somewhat remember what was \\"said\\", anyone trying to watch this for the first time on DVD would be lost several times during the movie, and miss much of what happens.Shame on you Disney!

First, the voice over for the entire series is very drab and can even be desrcibed as nerve jarring. Second, the man cannot even pronounce half of the names correctly; nor does he ever develop any rhythm... It's not that this documentary gets too many facts wrong, it's that the production value is haphazard and lackadaisical. I recommend turning of the sound and relying on Closed Captioning if you must view."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent quality","review":"We purchased a combination of this product and the matching forks and spoons so we'd have handles on all of our kitchen cabinets. These handles are of great quality; they are thick, the metal is smooth, and they have a beautiful sheen. Since our home's cabinets did not have handles, we had to drill holes. If you're in a similar situation, both Lowe's and Home Depot sell templates for both cabinet doors and drawers that make placing the handles simple. Be aware that the Amazon price on these may be higher than you would pay through Lowe's special order (they're available at our Lowe's in the kitchen cabinet/appliances department, not with the rest of the cabinet knobs). At any rate, I highly recommend these handles. They have really impressed our guests, who seem to enjoy their whimsical nature."},{"rating":"2","title":"quality product","review":"The Rutland product does a great job.

The three videos I own in the series were educational (without being pedantic) and fast paced.

David Morrissey looks promising, but is uneven in this part. He's good playing innocent but I didn't buy his character's evil side. It may be the fault of the screen play. They managed to take an interesting (true) story and totally muddle it. I'd love to see this re-made for the big screen."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT a murder \\"mystery\\" as such","review":"If you are thinking about watching this movie, just be aware that it is NOT a murder \\"mystery\\" as such. Unfortunately, I got it thinking it was more of an Agatha Christie type story, and spent the entire time trying to figure out who really \\"done it.\\" I was very disappointed when the typical twists and turns of a true mystery didn't materialize.If my expectations had been different, I might have enjoyed this movie more. The set design was superb, as was most of the acting and the dialog (although, without subtitles, the British accent was a bit difficult for me to understand at times). But, on the other hand, I might have been disappointed anyway, since the story is somewhat disjointed and I never bought into the relationships between the characters (the two mismatched lovers, the husband and wife, the wife and 'companion' etc.)The story might have been true, but that doesn't necessarily make it a good movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Complete Schubert , well done, at a Great Value","review":"Franz Schubert's Piano Sonatas have had the great misfortune of being written about the same time as Beethoven's sonatas. Beethoven's are the ne plus ultra of the piano sonata and are justly esteemed by music lovers everywhere. Schubert's sonatas while lacking Beethoven's ruthless logic and frequent virtuosity are, if anything, more beautiful. They unfold at a serene and visionary pace. Walter Klien does a fine job here and this is one of only two complete sets of the Schubert sonatas available (The remaining sonatas are available in the VOX volumes 2 & 3). I prefer Alfred Brendel in this literature, but he has not recorded the complete set. If you like Schubert, then you will not be unhappy with these performances."},{"rating":"2","title":"Always a pleasure","review":"Although there may be better individual performances, for a coherent view of Schubert's piano sonatas, Klien is hard to beat, even though I would love to have a pianoforte set of the sonatas by Andreas Staier or Ronald Brautigam. These recordings were made between 1971 and 1973 from the original analogue tapes, which might explain the one reviewer's complaint about the dryness of the sound but has nothing to do with fine performances.One needs to maintain a sense of perspective when listening to recorded music. As one who started in the late 40's listening to classical music on 78s and then moved on to LPs (and I have heard LPs that sounded worse than many 78s), CDs and now SACDs, one has to overlook the mechanical elements and get to the heart of the matter--the music and the artistry of the performer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"I bought the complete set, so I could get familiar with all of Schubert's piano works. After a couple of weeks, I threw all the disks away. There are much finer artists who bring individuality, verve and style to some of the greatest piano music ever written.

If you can't understand the passage, move on to the next one fast and come back to the one you skipped after you've built some confidence with the others.good luck"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Nocturnes","review":"Okay, we've all heard Chopin played by about a million different perfomers. Simon's playing is simply the best. Period. Then look at the budget price. There is no need to waste your money on any other set of Chopin's Nocturnes (and there are some fine ones, admittedly).Simon is emotionally involved with every note of these pieces, yet he avoids the the temptation of hamming it up with lavish excesses of sentimentality. Neither does he subscribe to the robotic sewing-machine school of piano playing ala Horowitz.The sound is clean and warm, just like the playing. The collection is complete, including the posthumous Nocturnes not included in some editions.Buy this CD and study it well, for this is how Chopin should be played."},{"rating":"2","title":"My 640, More than I hoped for.","review":"I was hesitant to purchase this camera because I have a webtv and didn't know if the two items would be combatable.

Now Elke Summer- easy on the eyes, so she almost redeems the picture. But not quite. Oh, and did I tell you the sound is in mono, lol. Another interesting point taken away from this movie is you see where 2 1/2 men got it's ideas from and where Charlie Sheen got his comedic style from- Bob Hope.

However, I would never in a million years release one of my movies on videotape and expect other people to enjoy it! The acting is horrible, the old sheriff is annoying (he's always eating) the daughter is ugly and fat, the oriental cafeteria cook is, well, i don't know what the hell he is. The one good thing about this movie is probably the kill scenes, and the opening credits, which are not that bad for just a camcorder. Obviously, the worst acted, and most asinine scene in the movie has to be the one that takes place in the cafeteria.

The other smash bargain Liszt recording to buy is Cohen's selection of mostly later works in the Naxos series of Liszt piano music.

Also, book claims Python inspired comedian Richard Pryor. Huh? Pryor had his own succesful comedy routine in the 1960's before 1969.

I have been everywhere on Google trying to find evidence of Pryor being influenced by Python and could find none. RichardPryor.com shows no evidence of this alleged influence. I believe the writers of this book just included that in to make Python sound more influential than it really was and to appeal to african-americans more too.

While the material on MAJIK MIJITS is not of that same high calliber, there is much to enjoy here. While Lane's MS had made it impossible for him to play bass on these sessions, Lane is in fine voice on standout tracks like \\"Bombers Moon,\\" \\"That's the Way it Goes,\\" \\"Ruby Jack\\" and my favorite track, \\"Son of Stanley Lane.\\" Those four tracks alone are worth the price of admission. Marriott shines on the opener \\"Lonely No More\\" and does a wonderful Cockney vocal on \\"Toe Rag\\" along with some terrific guitar playing.

Worth the effort to track down..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mraz is best experienced LIVE!","review":"I'm a firm believer that Jason Mraz is best experienced in a live performance. The cd \\"Waiting for My Rocket to Come\\" just doesn't do him justice. He is amazing on stage. Yes, there are screams from fans on the cd, but I think that only adds because you can feel the excitement that he generates. You will hear how excited they get when those first few notes of The Remedy are played, and that makes me excited to hear it as well.There are some new songs on this cd that weren't on his first, and are really good. The other bonus is that you can actually watch the concert on the DVD, as well as a lot of 'behind the scenes' stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow, what a performer!!","review":"This is some of the best money I have ever spent. The DVD is entertaining from start to finish. I will look to go to a concert if he comes nearby. Jason is a very talented guy and should be around for a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this CD, the DVD is great!","review":"Jason Mraz is great, and it's even better to get to hear him improvise live. The DVD is great and definitely worth having even if I had to buy it separately."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"I bought this for my husband and I have to say I enjoy it too! I like Jason Mraz because he has such a unique style. This is a great CD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many screaming fangirls","review":"Don't know thing one about Jason Mraz but someone mentioned him in passing and I liked the samples well enough so I bought it. Interesting songs and instrumentation however...Live is one thing, hysterical screaming fangirls is quite another. I really could have done without this one. Too bad, it's probably turned me off from trying any other Jason Mraz albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST LIVE ALBUM","review":"This is yet my best live album (including John mayer's). It was given to me by my friend on my birthday. And man! really rocks! Jason mraz has once again proved to the whole wide world that music indeed is universal - the people who are diversed in terms of the genres of music they love. He has managed to fuse different tupes of music into one, much more in one album, and that it's even live. From hip-hop, pop, r&b, folk, country, you name it, he has it all. Jason has introduced news songs that were not included in his \\"waiting for my rocket to come\\". I love \\"not so usual\\", \\"1000 things\\", \\"common pleasure\\", and \\"sleeping to dream\\". I must say other \\"absolutely zero\\" was well performed. Very for a live album. A must have on your cd collection"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best live albums I've heard","review":"I loved Mraz's first album, so I immediately bought this one upon release. I was a little worried, seeing how most of the songs were already on the first album. However, Mraz has such amazing live performing skill shtat I was really impressed. It sounds completley diferent from WFMRTC, but in a good way. Mraz will be around for a long time, if for nothing else than his concert skills!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome album!","review":"I bought this as a birthday gift for my husband after we saw Jason on the Kennedy Center Honors for Ellen Degeneres. He said, \\"dang, the boy's got skills!\\" We absolutely love this album. I did a bit of research before buying it to make sure I would get an album with a style similar to the Kennedy Center performance - good thing because a lot of his recent songs (at least those on the radio) are a bit more watered-down. Still nice, but not with the break-neck musical pace and lyrical frenzy that is on this album. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No as good","review":"His last two records are much better than this one. Unless you really like Jason music I would not buy this one. One be better off buying the likeble songs thru mp3."},{"rating":"2","title":"A favorite. Inki","review":"I love most anything Steve Martin does and the little girl parts are adorable and show such talent. I watch it over and over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This movie was disappointing, especially since I normally like Steve Martin. The movie had some touching and funny moments, but all in all it was entirely unrealistic, and at times over-dramatic to the point of being corny. There was also a blatant stereotype of wealthy southerners, and the entire legal aspect of the movie was unbelievable to the point of becoming ridiculous. The child actress was noticeably less than convincing.Still, Steve Martin delivers a decent performance, and the film is \\"charming\\" in a strange sort of way. But this it definitely not a quality film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please enter a title for your review","review":"This movie is slow to start (Michael doesn't even meet the kid until 30 minutes in) and doesn't have a very strong narrative. I guess it's obviously more similar in tone to the classic novel it was based on than to what you would reasonably expect from a contemporary film. The real fault that made me feel like the whole thing was just a waste of my time was the incomprehensible ending. (Spoilers Alert?). The skeletal remains of the politicians brother are found with the gold he stole from Michael, and this apparently closes the custody battle, with absolutely no explanation of what possible relevence it has to it. If anyone has an explanation for that ending please post it."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of Martin's All Time Worst!","review":"A convoluted mess. Also, this movie was shelved as a comedy at my local video rental place, and it isn't a comedy, despite the presance of Steve Martin. Martin plays a lonely man (Michael) who is angry at the world and robbed of his wealth. A little girl winds up on his doorstep and he raises her, although we know that she is actually the daughter of the local mayor (Byrne). When the little girl, Matilda (Austin), is 11, the mayor sues for custody and a great battle ensues."},{"rating":"1","title":"LACKLUSTRE CONTEMPORIZATION OF A CLASSIC","review":"The modern interpretation of morality and guilt is different from George Eliott's times, which is why simply taking a captivating story outside of its context and plopping it down on the 20th century, as Steve Martin's script in \\"A Simple Twist of Fate\\" does, is bound to end up as an unaffecting effort.Almost every character in the film does things that are inexplicable unless you realize they're living according to the codes and cliches of the last century.Martin is into the skin of his role as usual, sure, especially as the role allows for a little comic relief. Problem is that the comedy simply does not gel with with the drama here. The tone is wobbly at best.'Silas Marner' is certainly worthy of an update; just not a disjointed one like this passable heart-tugger."},{"rating":"2","title":"Steve Martin is the best... and this one is among his best","review":"I really recommend that you see this movie without knowing anything about it - that is how I saw it, and I found it surprisingly delightful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Explanation for the ending","review":"The explanation is that in finding the long lost gold, he now has the means to care for his child, which was one of the primary reasons the judge was ruling against him - no visible means of support."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't expect comedy","review":"I saw this years ago and still can't forget how dismal and disappointing it was. While I understand actors want to stretch themselves and not always take on the same roles, anyone looking for a lighthearted comedy won't find it here. I don't agree it's gentle or heartwarming, although I'm obviously in the minority here. This isn't funny, it's merely drama and not especially quality drama either. I believe I donated it to Goodwill; hopefully someone with different tastes found it a good deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Old fashioned magic","review":"An old fashioned and very 'homey' movie that is a pleasure to watch ... over and over again. The 'good guy' wins in the end and all is well. No violence and considering what is offered in the market today, stands out among the videos. Steve Martin is truly remarkable in the role with a great supporting cast. One of my better choices, without a doubt.mmqc"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully funny family-oriented film","review":"This movie was a favorite of mine when I was younger, and I had forgotten how much fun it was until I found it in my recommendations from Amazon. When my husband and I watched it, he had never seen it before, and he loved it too. Fun, with one of my favorite performances by Steve Martin. Great dvd!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Simple Twist of Fate","review":"Simple Twist of Fate will tug at your heartstrings. It will make you feel good about human nature. Steve Martin is wonderful, he puts so much true feeling into this story, it will make you BELIEVE again.

How disappointing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wholesome, pleasant family story.","review":"Martin, famous for his wacky off-the wall comedy is highly watchable in this sensitive dramatic role. He plays a devoted single father determined to hold onto his little girl. Film has warmth, charm, pathos and simplcity. A small gem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet, endearing movie","review":"I need not repeat the plot, as the other reviewers seem to have done a fine job. But unlike the reviewer from England, I find this adaptation stirring, mostly because of the breathtaking acting from Steve Martin. He embodies the embittered, heartbroken cynic in the beginning, and to see his character come out of the shell the world placed around him is heart-wrenching and beautiful. I recommend this movie to anyone who wants a heartwarming, sweet movie to settle down with after a hard day facing the world."},{"rating":"1","title":"no games, few motivating, none exciting; some challenging","review":"I certainly read enough reviews to know I was not ordering a book of math games, but I thought it would be a book of interesting, motivating puzzles and challenges. There are a few of those in that book, but for the most part it is simply a book of practice worksheets on a variety of topics. Some of the worksheets have interesting twists, and a few more have an answer bank that will reveal an acrostic such as \\"All your answers are correct,\\" but too often a worksheet is simply a list of problems to solve.I would call none of these worksheets games, and less than a third of them puzzles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not games","review":"As previous reviewers have noted, this is a book of worksheets, not games. Those hoping for math games should look elsewhere, such asFamily Math : The Middle School Years, Algebraic Reasoning and Number Sense. That being said, this is a good book to use for extra practice and/or review of skills. It is well organized, so it is easy to find a worksheet on, for instance, the order of operations. I use it frequently in my tutoring of jr. high and high school students, a group for which it is often difficult to find materials."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Book I Wish I Had Written","review":"I have been intrigued with number bases ever since I learned about them in 6th grade. It gave me an entirely different and deeper understanding of our base 10 system and set my brain up for understanding the binary system of computers later on. I have been toying with ways to teach students about this concept ever since and this was also one of my ideas. In fact, I have collected rubber alien figures with differing numbers of fingers so I can use them as manipulative examples of how and why other number bases would work.The only thing I do differently is place less emphasis on the binary system, until students understand a higher base. But I have seen others teach binary first and other bases later and that has worked for them, too.OK, this book is not for everyone, but I do think it is a cute and interesting introduction to other number bases and, for students for whom concepts like this are actually fun and exciting, it is definitely worthwhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny and challenging","review":"This book presents a very clear exposition of other bases through the device of a spaceman travelling to worlds whose inhabitants have a different number of fingers from us. The traveler has to work through his number confusion to get needed supplies for his spaceship and return to earth. The story line is intriguing and humorous, and the exposition of number bases is clear and extensive, even going into converting base 8 to base 2 and providing practice in base 2 long division. My son loved it and could follow the early chapters even in early elementary school.This book could provide a great supplement in school, but it also provides an option for parents of kids who need more challenge in math. You can use this book with your child at home without tripping too much over the school curriculum. It is enrichment that will really solidify your child's understanding of the base 10 system through the exploration of alien math!"},{"rating":"1","title":"the average music of its time","review":"This disk doesn't offer a superior music to the average of its time, simply they are pleasant but not very outstanding works, maybe to exception of Dvorak. I consider that the sound of the disk is not very clean, it has some bottom noise, although it is not very annoying. It can be remitted better versions of the piano concerts of Dusek and Dvorak (Richter-Kleiber-Emi)."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Yet","review":"This is the best book Karin Kallmaker has written yet. In this romantic adventure mystery, Kallmaker weaves numerous plot threads, across gaps in centuries and geography, with a grace that transcends her usual brilliant storytelling. Her characters leap full blown from the pages, into your heart and mind. There is simply no way to describe the plot in the abbreviated manner necessary for this review without making a jumble of a cohesive, tightly-knit and dynamic tale. READ THE BOOK. Like me, you'll be watching the promised sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceptional Lesbian Fiction","review":"Someone once commented that you don't have to be a house to be haunted. You're not likely to meet a more haunted character in lesbian fiction than Autumn Bradley. When you first meet her, Autumn is struggling through life with little memory of her past. She makes ends meet as a magician in a small venue in Las Vegas. Her talent for \\"sleight of hand\\" also helps her beat the casinos at their own game. Autumn feels a profound, irredeemable loss - but doesn't understand why. She begins having vivid dreams that hint of a past life with echoes in the present. In particular, she dreams of freedom, love and challenge, realizing her own humanity in the process. Kallmaker skillfully blends past and present with a compelling love story and interesting forays into psychology and myth. Well done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mercedes Lackey, move over!","review":"It's mythic, it's poignant, it's tragic, it's magical. Those are the elements I love in Mercedes Lackey's work. Sleight of Hand is better, because it's also passionately, unreservedly, openly about lesbians. No teasing, no subtext. The writing is first rate -- lyrical and timeless in the parts placed in the distant past, contemporary and fitting for those parts in the present time. This is a great book, and engrossing. I want book 2, and I want it now!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I'd seen the previous review.","review":"Like the guy from Florida, I was enticed by the picture on the cover.

It's humour is only subtle, but the inuendo between Frank and Rita the two main characters is quite obvious. I guess what makes it funny is seeing how these two very different people interact with each other. And Rita, well she's just hilarious...and rude!"},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE","review":"Love it!!! Came quick and in great shape. I have always loved this book and it still remains my all time favorite children's book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Bear Getaway","review":"Here's a modern take on the traditional tale of the Three Bears. There's only one bear in this story, a cute cub named Somebody who invades what appears to be a two story brick colonial owned by the Blair family, Mother, Father, and Baby Blair. The bear samples thing in threes, food, chairs, closets, plumbing, and of course beds.The best part of the book is the return of the Blairs who find their home in cyclonic chaos. Baby Blair is amused by each discovery and his comments are dead on. Kids like stories that don't follow the rules like this one that doesn't follow the tried and true Three Bears formula. A good oral reader, especially one who likes doing voices, could have lots of fun with this book.The little bear's name is Somebody, a recurring joke used by the writer. The device reminds me of the Odyssey in which Ulysses tells the Cyclops that his name is Nobody, a funny turn when the blinded Cyclops tells his buddies that Nobody has blinded him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent survey of the genre (from my limited experience)","review":"All I know of Drum&Bass is from listening to NetRadio-- but I got really addicted to it. I picked up this compilation and truly enjoy listening to all of it -- it also has several of the tunes they play on the NetRadio channels. The first two discs are nearly full (70 or so minutes) of individual songs. The third disc is one fourty-minute mix. Truly worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great Film!","review":"Easily James Earl Jones' best performance, as he lives through tragedy after tragedy. The force of his faith and his love of his people as he shows us as the main character of the film are startling to see.The problem of injustice he must endure is Grecian in scope, and it all rests on the fact that these aparteid advocates and practitioners are still human beings.A film not to be missed, and indeed a book to read as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"South African tragedy,Justice and Enlightenment","review":"Excellent movie. A black preacher(Jones) and a white wealthy landowner(Harris) played their roles astoundingly.Living in an environment of apartheid or pending apartheid, both have experienced their own personal tragedies. Being complete strangers to each other, they eventually met face to face in a friendly atmosphere.Then as he was about to leave, the preacher turnd around and told the landowner, \\"My greatest sorrow is your greatest sorrow.\\"A definitely \\"must see\\" movie for everyone, young or old. Most certainly 5 stars for this DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent movie but neglects vital concepts from book","review":"I enjoyed the movie a lot. It even made me cry (and I rarely cry). But, I was dissapointed in the way it was written for the screen. The movie left out much of Book 3 as well as what I thought was one of the most important concepts from the book: repentance. Absalom's repentance was never portrayed. The fact that he prayed to God for forgiveness is vital. Had I not already read the book, I would have not had the same emotional reactions. It is absolutely terrific, but it does not quite do justice to Patton's Pre-Aparthied novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"CRy for the hate in the world","review":"i purchased this for classroom use, along with the reading of the novel. high school seniors enjoy talking about the universal themes in the book, but do not like the book. hoping the movie would elevate their interest, i showed it prior to finishing the book. they said that it just is NOT interesting. i, the teacher, love it!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"An epic failure","review":"Not only was it outlandishly boring, but more importantly, erroneous on various accounts.

There are too many adjectives for some tastes, and more will cringe at how the author treats servants and other sex objects. He is more honest than most of us dare to be--particularly about the marriage he permitted his family back in Pakistan to arrange for him. One friend who accommodates his homosexuality to marriage and family in Pakistan and one who cuts his cultural and family ties to live entirely in a New York gay world provide contrasts of other possible paths and a (rather coldly academic) afterword by the author of ISLAMIC HOMOSEXUALITIES draws out other comparisons of gay Muslim lifeways."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much sex and not enough substance","review":"But I guess that is what gay men want to read. As a Muslim, I was really hoping for more insight on Islam and homosexuality. Instead it's just the tales (many of which, the author notes in the introduction, are fake) of an oversexed man and his sex life. Probably most American gay men who have ethnic fetishes will find the book titilating, he does go into great detail of his sex life (ex. seducing the servents in his home, sex on vacation, when he moves to San Francisco). I on the other hand wish there was more to it than that."},{"rating":"2","title":"what a find!","review":"A friend suggested I read this book, and I must say it is one of the most interesting books I have read in a long while. My only complaint is, it should be longer, his style of writing is engaging and a pleasure to read, and the subject matter is handled from a wide range of perspectives. This is the first book written BY a gay Pakistani that I have read, and I hope Badrudding writes some more. The book is satisfying, entertaining, provocative, and just plain fun to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rocktron Utopia G-100","review":"I recently purchased this multieffect floor unit to use mainly at home with my amplifier and 2x12 cabinet. I liked the display and the solid housing. Nice blue display which is easy to read. The unit has an expression pedal which I never quite liked the action on. The unit has some very nice presets and some which I did not like. The noise reduction is very nice on this unit. The cd input did not work on the unit I bought. The biggest problem I had was the difficulty of creating presets on the unit. It would be much easier if there was included computer software to allow presets to be changed on a computer and transferred to the unit via a USB jack. The unit should also include stomp buttons to allow user to save 2-3 presets for instant changes on the fly. Digitech has such a system and I think Rocktron should do something similar. I ended up sending back the unit the online dealer I bought it from."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous","review":"Fabulous, fabulous, fabulous R&B CD!

There is almost nothing to the plot, and it is nearly devoid of action. Another point I disliked was Zifnab, who has appeared in other Weis-Hickman books like the Dragonlance (Fizban) and Starsheild (Zanfib) series. Sure he's funny, but he sticks out, and seperates from the plot. He spoils the mood of the series. Luckily, he dissapears from the 3rd and 4th books, but he returns in the later books, most unfortunatley. I wouldn't say that he spoils the sereis- it is still great. It's just that he is very distracting.Luckily, Weis and Hickman redeem themselves with Fire Sea, the next book in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"The least excellent of this stellar series,","review":"But that doesn't say much, the others are all so amazing. Elven Star introduces an almost entirely new cast of characters from Dragon Wing, (the first volume of the series), including Zifnab, the latest incarnation of Fizban, the lovable, loony wizard from Dragonlance. He is an enigmatic character, maintaining depth while still being a hysterically funny comic relief character. This book shows Weis and Hickman's sheer joy in writing, which they impart to the reader beautifully. This book is not as good as the others, the cast of characters is slightly less stellar than the first volume, though this mars the book only a little. Worth reading, and even if you don't like it as much as the first, get through it, and then you hit the real treat in the third volume, Fire Sea, which deserves more stars than are available to give."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great book, the best of it's series.","review":"I have never read a better book and yet, I see people giving it reviews like 0 stars.

HONEST AND TRUE."},{"rating":"2","title":"Realism and Magic can get too mixed up","review":"It is pure, classic Rushdie, and therefore a delight to read! However, in the middle of the story, the occasional prosaic references to the real can appear to be out of place, imposed. On the other hand, some of the mundane narratives (that are not too ridiculous to be untrue, especially in the context of the region's recent history) are not so easy to separate from pure fantasy, unless one is very familiar with all the characters and their personal histories. But perhaps that's where lies the author's trademark. Buyers should be aware of the fact that the recent Picador edition is annoyingly full of typographical/editorial errors. Hopefully these will be taken care of in future imprints."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pakistan - Myth and Disillusion","review":"If Salman Rushdie had written only this book, he would be remembered. Unfortunately, his reputation is colored by extra-literary considerations. I guess a Fatwah will do that.Another cloud over the success of this novel is the brilliance of the author's previous book \\"Midnight's Children.\\" Both texts mythologize a country - its history and culture. However, while \\"Midnight\\" is about India, \\"Shame\\" is about Pakistan. While the previous book's best insights are political, the former tome offers a unique look into the heart of religion - namely, Islam.So there are certainly similarities between the two books, but \\"Shame\\" holds its own admirably. From the first sentence, you know you're in the hands of a master. While this may not be the best point to enter the author's uniqiue world, it's a wonderful place to continue the journey."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good assigned reading","review":"I was required to get this book for my postcolonial literature class. Many of the characters serve as an allegory to Pakistani politicians. Rushdie's writing style is unlike any other's I have read. His sentences can run up to fourteen lines long. This book is also an example of metafiction; Rushdie will often interrupt the story to remind readers this book is fictional and the leaders fake. He calls attention to what is happening in the real world, saying changes don't come quite so easily as they do in a book, and he offers an intriguing glimpse into how and why he invented the characters. I like Rushdie, and intend to read more of his works."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Pakistan of the Mind","review":"This book is written with Rushdie's characteristic verbal precision and wry humor. The prose is not nearly as dense as in, say, Shalimar the Clown. It's hilarious and still tragic, with a narrative style that is joyfully exuberant. This modern fairytale of Pakistan was very sobering to read in the weeks after the assassination of Benazir Bhutto."},{"rating":"2","title":"A slightly inferior version of Midnight's Children","review":"I recommend this book only for the diehard Rushdie fans. It has a lot of similiarites to one of his other books, Midnight's Children,-the weaving between fantasy and reality, the slightly amused but occasionally serious tone, the scathing critique of real-life middle east/Pakistan/India politics. What it lacks is cohesion, I considered it a bit difficult to wade through. I do disagree with a previous reviewer, you really need to give this book one hundred pages to see if you like it, by then it's too late, might as well finish. Read Midnight's Children first, and if you hate or are lukewarm to that story, stay clear of this one. Otherwise, enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"really??????","review":"this is one of the absolutely worst books I've EVER read!! Shame on the folks who gave it a good or even decent review!.

He speaks of the great role Dictatorship has had in Latin America and his hope for a process of democratization there. He also speaks about his own writing and his involvement in the political and cultural realms. The interview is informative but Vargas Llosa speaks English in a quite pained and difficult way.

When you take the phone off the clip it is near impossible to know what orientation the phone is, if it was towards the top it would be easier to know that the phone is upright or upside down.3. The plastic that covers the phone is a trap for dirt and requires a regular cleaning.4. When the phone is opened the case can slide on the phone, it usually slid up and covered the ear speaker, making it hard to hear.

This case claims water resistance and is made of a rubberized material that seems to be very durable and protective. There is a plastic cover for both the internal and external display along with a plastic cover for the number part of the keypad. The belt clip for the case is well built and the case allows for normal closure of the phone flip lid. The slim profile of the RAZR is still preserved and only a little bit of bulk is added from the case. I won't lie... I gave the case a 4 star because the phone looks so much sweeter without the case... but I want my phone to be protected.

While the first book focused on the relationships, especially main character Marcus and dog George, this sequel was a bit more political-war heavy. The main characters interactions were less and they were often crabby to each other. It's hard enough to like your friends in real life for being crabby in extended amounts of time, and more difficult to read.

The film in many ways was like those great comedies from the 40's screwball comedy I think they were called. Fast pace dialog, pulled off very well. If you enjoy humor that can be found in good word play, this is a good movie to watch. It is one of those movies you put on when you need a laugh.

Stallone is hilarious as \\"Snaps\\" Provolone, big time gangster and future banker (due to a deathbed promise to his dying father, played by Kirk Douglas). His mob (including Peter Reigert and Chazz Palminteri) are far more inept than intimidating, bumbling along with their boss in his attempt to go straight.

Lead singer Dog Boy refers to it as one drop punk. This album has everything from straight up fast punk with The Distance and Got Nothing To Defend to the slower, reggae songs such as 421, Slow Burn, and Addict Like Me. But the best songs are the ones that are mixed perfectly with rock, punk and reggae. Good Day To Die is the best song on the album, with a story that you can't beat. Get this album today.

He knew he was nearing death; he writes about it as often as he wrote about the deaths of other things in his poetry. Of course, his is not the only death to mention in these pages; car accidents, a falling neighbor, etc.Other than death, Buk's diary talks a lot about horseplaying. Great for me. Perhaps not so great for others.Bukowski was always a better poet than he was a prose stylist, but The Captain Is Out to Lunch... is likely the most readable piece of Buk's prose I have ever come across. Probably because there was nothing to writing it; instead of coming up with characters, plot, theme, etc., they're sitting there at the track or in the neighborhood waiting for you.Worthwhile.

Your guess is as good as mine, but I'd have to say that it just sounded good to Prince at that particular moment in time. If this disc was softer, I'd use it in the restroom after going number two.

I've been a prince fan for years mainly because he refused to be placed in a mold. Many assume that if his music differs from what first attracted thier first listen then he is slipping. Each of princes albums has been a creation, a creation from the start, which means he took the time to recreate his mold for every album. To me that defines him as one of the greatist musical artists of our time. I will admit I have not felt all of his work but I respected it. As far as NEWS goes I've felt every note and believe me this ranks up the there with his top musical creations.

And that's all because they let God write it for them. Their book shows how God wrote the most romantic love story for them, and how He can and wants to do the same for you. Eric and Leslie's story has turned my whole world around; I don't think at all like I used to. They challenged me to let God be number one in my life, and to let Him invade my whole being, and since I've done that, He has done miraculous things in my life! If you are truly searching for ways you can please God and make Him not just a part of your life, but actually make HIM your life, you HAVE to read this book. It is very well written, you will never want to put it down once you start. It'll make you laugh, cry, and long for God's best for your life. Read it and see for yourself. :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"God is indeed the master of romance!!!","review":"Like Lesley I would have laughed if anybody had told me this a couple of years ago. Not that I don't think the Lord is capable of anything, but somehow I would never have put Him and romance in the same sentence. Until now that is. The story of Lesley and Eric's courtship is just so beautiful, and so obviously blessed by God. I read the book in one sitting, and again only a couple of weeks later (after a dear friend had bought it for me. I HAD to own it myself). Both times wishing I might someday encounter the same love, both times crying by the end of the book. Somehow the description of their engagement touched me more than the wedding itself though.This book has made me look at romance, dating and marriage in an entire new light. I want God to be in on it too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrid Recording","review":"I know this is inexpensive, but it's no bargain.

This is a god or goddess, along with perhaps an animal, plant, or iconic item. The meaning of the rune, on the other hand, is not to be seen.Rather silly, really. If I want to memorize the meanings of the runes, then I don't need the cards.Rune purists will be unhappy that there is a blank rune card. The accompanying book is heavy on pictures, light on text.

The true story - of a Polish baker in Pittsburgh who raised his orphaned grandson at the age of 70+ and put him through medical school - sounds like a formula for sentimentality and cliches. However, the movie transcends that to become a moving story of the strength of family, with many wonderful touches of humor. Peter Falk's portrayal of the irascible, curmudgeonly, and indomitable Rocky Holzcek dominates the movie. We are made to care about all the people portrayed. I don't understand the criticism about the movie \\"not having a story\\" to tie it together. The changing relationship of Rocky and his family as the years go by has plenty of elements of drama. This movie touched me deeply. It's a real sleeper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Splendid movie","review":"From the beginning, this movie will pull the viewer in.

A man hunting an 11-year-old boy, capturing him, and bragging to him about his crimes. The boy's psychological torment over not killing the criminal when he had the chance.I applaud this as a well-written and engrossing novel, but I question whether the subject matter is appropriate for the age range listed -- 8 to 12.

This book is a fine adventure, but for making someone opening their eyes to a real-world dilemna through fiction, there is nothing to be shown. It is just the typical Good versus Evil that is overly stereotypical. I would reccomend this for a reader in about the 4th - 6th grade, and even in 6th grade it's pushing it.

The villian, Weasel, is a government \\"injun hunter\\" gone rogue, who now kills whoever and whatever he comes into contact with.

The character Nathan never would have expected that this could happen to him, but it does. The dreams that haunt him of a killer named Weasel were true, until a man named Ezra came along.

It's also very short compared to the other \\"...and Philosopy\\" books. It could be an interesting read for people who get one or the other, like the earlier reviewer who understood philosophy but not poker. But if, like me, you already have read your share of both poker books and philosophy books, you won't learn much from this.

The author grossly over-simplifies or missates the views of others and then offers his own rebuttal. For example, he writes that since the views of Paul and Peter can be reconciled (the logic for reconciling the views is weak), then there was no significant divergence of theology in the first century, contrary to the \\"lost Christinities\\" view of Professor Bart Ehrman.

Bach es la creación de lo que conocemos como \\"concierto para teclado\\", ya que fue él quien primeramente dió a este tipo de instrumentos un rol protagónico en una obra musical tipo concierto (el legendario Concierto de Brandemburgo No. 5); al parecer le entusiasmó tanto el potencial de esta nueva forma musical, que posteriormente escribió múltiples conciertos para 1, 2, 3 y hasta 4 clavecines, y aunque algunos son definitivamente transcripciones de obras anteriores de otros autores (sobre todo de Vivaldi), en todos ellos se nota la mano maestra de Bach. La colección del sello Vox está a cargo de intérpretes no muy conocidos (aunque en lo personal poseo una obra bastante extensa en manos de Christianne Jacottet), pero su calidad es excelente, a pesar de tratarse de grabaciones ADD. Si a ello combinamos un precio realmente sensacional por 3 discos compactos, en realidad se estará llevando una ganga con esta adquisición."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible printer","review":"This is the second epson printer I have owned. Both printers have the same problem. The extremely annoying problem is printer head clog if you don't use it in 7 days. Then you need to clean it. Each clean cycle will use about 1/10th of ink. I usually can print seven 7x10 photos per set of cartrige. Rest of the ink is used for printer head cleaning. It is also very slow for photo printing. I don't know if all of the inkjet printers have the same problem!"},{"rating":"2","title":"terrific printer, terrific price","review":"this is the printer to get. as best as i can determine, there is no real difference between the quality of the prints from the various epson photo printers. the major difference lies in the bells and whistles. the 785epx cannot print bigger than an 8x10 while the 1200 can. however, this one has the ability to print without your computer, but directly from your memory card. set up was simple and the prints are absolutely fabulous. while i have read some complaints about it drinking ink, it does not seem excessive to me given the quality of the product. ritz camera is in trouble if a lot of people buy this or any other epson printer.i also have an epson scanner which is equally terrific."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome photots","review":"The Epson 785EPX does a fantastic job. I liked the results on regular photo inkjet paper. I was awestruck with the results when I put a sheet of the Premium Glossy Photo paper thru the printer. The results looked like my film prints. Excellent. The manuals and instructions actually work! I'm very satisfied with my initial trials. The film factory program is quite good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed with photo quality..........","review":"I did a great deal of research on printers before purchasing this one. I saw many good reviews of this model, however I was very disappointed in the results. I found that most of my photos are poor quality. They have little rows / tracks across them. I thought it might be the cartridge so I changed it out. This didn't help. I tried printing all different sizes of photos and got the same results. This is not what I expect from Epson and I am returning the printer to upgrade to the Epson 1280. This printer is fine for regular print jobs, just not photography."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch Out","review":"Brand new and a real significant problem, echoed by other reviewers. Watch out for vertical lines, white dots, that may appear on 3 out of 4 photos. They will be between 5/8\\" and aninch apart and, naturally, the darker the image, the more theyare apparent. Other folks spoke with the local Epson reps and they mentioned \\"tight rollers\\". This one unsatisfactoy for photo use. I'll return thisone and try another, wish me luck......PS. 2nd one had problems as well, not quite as severe,but still unacceptable. Also, the USB software can be real difficult. Bought a HP cp1700 and I'm in heaven, more $ but well worth it.

I had high hopes of getting photo-like print quality from it after reading technical print comparisons online. However, I now regret buying it and feel totally cheated! Here are a list of problems, right from the start. 1) All PHOTOS printed come out with a purple hue!!! I have yet to print a decent photograph from this printer; 2)It is forever clogged up and needs constant cleaning; 3)The print cartidges seem to run out all too frequently, even though we hardly use it; 4) It has this annoying pop-up window that pops up 10 seconds on the computer monitor after you turn off the printer.

I use it solely for digital photo prints. The color is OK (some shades better than others) and the resolution is outstanding (difficult to tell the photo was not professionally developed as long as you use the Epson photo quality paper and customized resolution settings).HOWEVER!

Unless you print something every day, expect to clean the print heads and replace cartridges frequently."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad ink jets","review":"The black jets for this printer get clogged way too often. I can print only 30-40 pages before I have to clean the jets. That equates to about twice a week if you use it often! And it goes through ink cartridges (which are WAY too expensive) quickly too. In general, only buy this printer if you're on a restricted budget and don't have to print often."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like whitewashed pictures","review":"We bought this printer because it came with $100 off with the purchase of a digital camera. That was mistake number one. I hooked it up (which was actually very quick and easy) to my computer and sat down to print out some of our Engagement pictures. The first picture made my cream colored sweater appear white and my face was fuzzy and had no depth in color, same with my fiance'. It appears as thought the black only decided to print on shadow portions of the picture. I tinkered as much as I dared with all of the settings, uninstalled, reinstalled, no change. I took it back and got a HP Deskjet 940C. The printed picture looks just as good as the original. Why would I ever stray from HP to begin with?

I was really looking forward to seeing the great photo quality that Epson is known for. Instead I was very disappointed. To start, the printer left very small marks across all the pictures. In rows about a couple of inches apart. Very evident on darker colors. It apeared to be some product of the feeding mechanism. You might say this was a factory defect but when I returned it I checked the floor model and it did the exact same thing. The Epson rep couldn't explain it away.I have since purchased a HP PSC 750 all-in-one and I can now say that the photo print quality suffered as well. When I compare the pictures from the old Epson to those on my new HP it's remarkable. The Epson has much more pixelation than the HP. I was shocked. It's rare you can compare the exact photograph off two different printers but it sure tells a story. I'm very happy with the HP."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a happy customer!","review":"I purchased the Epson 785 to replace a Lexmark Z53. I wanted better quality in my prints. I do not have a digital camera. Instead, I have had professional photos taken, and have scanned them to adjust the photos slightly. While the Epson's actual print quality is excellent, the colors are TERRIBLE! My little Lexmark was an EXACT match to the professional photos. I have spent all weekend, and used a full color cartridge and almost 50 sheets of photo paper, and can't even come close to the color matching that the Lexmark was capable of. This printer is going back. I have adjusted, and re-adjusted every setting and every color combination I can think of, and can't come close to an accurate complexion color. It is NOT my scanner, since the Lexmark printed the photo colors out perfectly...I'm going with HP!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"Like many other people, I've come to realize that this printer is an absolute piece of garbage.

I'd definitely buy a Canon next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute Piece of Junk","review":"The Epson 785 wastes gallons of ink when the ink cartridge nozzles dry out after a few days of disuse. Every cleaning cycle takes about 10% of the cartridge capacity and it winds up costing a lot to print very little. The photos do come out nicely though but it better when you go through a cartridge every ten sessions. Do not buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paper feeder jams","review":"I have had this for a few years and have found that it worked great the first year. However, as in the previous reviews, the paper feeder jams. I have also wasted a lot of paper and ink. I find that it doesn't seem to jam my cardstock as often as it jams the regular inkjet paper. I was convinced by the salesperson at CompUSA that this was the best printer to get. I initially paid about $200 for it and it has been a pain to deal with since.

The microphone generally picks up my voice and callers say they can hear me clearly. Occasionally, callers hear my voice fade, and I haven't figured out exactly where to clip the microphone for best reception.Call me old fashioned, but I still kinda like those old bulky headsets where a heavy wire projects the microphone outward from the earpiece for precise positioning just below the mouth."},{"rating":"2","title":"brilliant translation","review":"This is a very satisfying translation. It does not attempt rhyme so it can reproduce the rhythms of the original without distorting the meaning for the sake of English rhymes. The notes are breathtaking in their scope and thoroughness. It would probably be a good idea for readers new to Inferno to go through it once without the notes soas to be carried along by the poem, and then a second time reading the notes to examine closely the building blocks of Dante's genius.For all its scholarship, this book is pleasant to deal with physically -- nice typeface, well laid-out pages, not too heavy in the hand. You can actually read it in bed without crushing your abdomen."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you buy only one translation of the Inferno...","review":"If you buy only one translation of the Inferno, this one should be it.Of course, if you like Dante, this won't be the only translation that you buy, but you absolutely must buy it. It's a remarkable translation and you certainly won't regret it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A True Masterpiece","review":"My first experience with Inferno was a different translation a few years ago, and while I liked the story, the style didn't do much for me. I have since had the good fortune not only to read Hollander's translation, but to actually take his Inferno class at Princeton. He is an absolute master of the material, and that shows in this edition of the Inferno. Not only is the poetry very eloquent and readable, but the accompanying notes clarify all the obscure classical references, and sometimes hard-to-follow metaphors. This translation does a marvelous job of bringing a great classical Italian story to a modern English audience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great translation, but needs illustrations","review":"This translation is excellent: it follows the modern trend of direct, literal translations, eschewing rhyming or stilted language.The translation is accompanied by the original italian, as well as extensive annotations that shed light on all the allegories and personalities that are not familiar to 21st century english speakers.Personally, I would like some illustrations in the book. But the translation is fantastic, and for that alone I would recommend this over other editions.The Inferno, in any translation, is not for everyone: most of its content is steeped in middle ages allegory, and frankly, not very relevant to modern life. Back then, sin and salvation were the cornerstone of life, and exploring the nine levels of hell (with details like 10 different kinds of theft) was a meaningful exercise. But nowadays, the book appeals mostly to students of history and christiantity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very literal","review":"If you are buying this as a direct delivery of the meaning of Dante's lines then you are wasting your money. At every turn, the hollanders seem to favour their own stale paraphrasing and apish poetry over, of all people Dante Alighieri's. Small bits of sentences cut or added, new words not in the original used here and there. After a short while it all gets very irritating for the student looking for a work that delivers a literal translation of the original as promised in the introduction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Binding","review":"The binding is really bad.

You don't find the dry pretention of some art history professor magazine editor butting up against the subtle distrust of an artist for the establishment- it's just plain ol' artist on artist.

No longer do we stress about trying to put him to bed awake then rocking like crazy to get him to sleep. He cries in our arms when it all gets a bit much then he's off to sleep, sometimes we even get a smile before he nods off. Then we put him to bed asleep. Contrary to popular opinion, he doesn't get a fright when he wakes up in either his basinette or our bed. He is an alert and happy wee man (now 3months old).I thank Aletha Solter for her book which has allowed us to accept all his behaviour with love and to look at our own childhood issues.

She talks about letting the baby cry instead of nursing so he won't get into a \\"control\\" pattern. I'm sorry, but a 3 month old baby just needs comfort.

I recommend this book completely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best for action...","review":"To be honest, you learn A LOT from this DVD in the direction of where the Z soldiers are going.Piccolo decides to fuse with Kami-Sama, Gokou leaves his home so the androids won't track him, and Buruma learns of another Time Machine!However, like many DBZ episodes, there's a lot of 'wasting' time in the animation. Lots of panning out and panning in. If you're into animation, this is NOT for you. If you love the DBZ stories, then this MIGHT be for you... what I find quite annoying is that they have to have 3 episodes in order to get from one place to another, whereas they could've done it all in one episode!Kurirrin again proves to be the guy with all the knowledge! Which is great - I love this character. But then you've got Vegeta who's annoyed he isn't the strongest guy in the universe so he goes on his usual rant...nothing we haven't seen before."},{"rating":"2","title":"great dvd","review":"THIS DVD IS THE BEST DBZ DVD OUT.VEGETA THINKING HE IS THE BEST FIGHTER IN THE UNIVERSE.BUT AFTER A FIGHT WITH NO.18 HE GETS HIS ARM BROKEN.TRUNKS WNTING REVENGE BLINDLY RUSHES IN TO SAVE VEGETA BUT HE IS NOT MUCH HELP.AFTER,THE ANDRIODS SET OFF FOR GOKU.MEANWHILE,PICCOLO RELIZES HE NEEDS TO BECOME STRONGER SO HE DOES THE ONLY THING HE CAN DO TO INCREASE HIS POWER IS JOIN WITH KAMI.PICCOLO LEAVES TRUNKS AND KRILLIN TO GET GOKU OUT OF HIS HOUSE AND TO A SAFE PLACE.ON THE WAY TO GET GOKU A BIKER GANG TRYS TO GET 16,17 AND 18 OUT OF THE TRUCK THEY HAD JUST STOLEN.ON THIER WAY TO MASTER ROSHI'S(KAME HOUSE)KRILLIN AND THE OTHERS GET A CALL FROM BULMA SAYING THAT TRUNK'S TIME MACHINE IS THERE WITH A BALL LIKE THING SPLIT IN HALF.ONE WAY TO TELL IT IS TRUNK'S TIME MACHINE IS TO LOOK FOR THE WORD HOPE SCRATCHED INTO THE SIDE."},{"rating":"2","title":"androids attack","review":"I thought this video was cool but not as good as assassins.I love seeing Vegeta and Trunks as a super saiyans.I also liked the scene where Vegeta stood in the rain.Doesn't contain much fighting but still cool"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"Although I thouroughly enjoyed the 1st book in the series, Dragonsbane, I would have preferred that I had not bothered with the next 2, DragonShadow & this. I doubt I'll bother with the next and there has to be a next - this one stops with out even coming close to answering any of the questions it raises. I'm afraid I no longer even CARE if everyone dies as is implied. If you MUST read it, borrow it from the library & don't waste your money on this disjointed, painful half book. By the time it was finished (and I use that term only because there were no more pages) I was hoping they would just kill off all the people in the book to get the torture over with. I am (or should I say was) a fan of Ms. Hambly but doubt I will bother in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Half better than none?","review":"Warning! This is obviously a 600 page book that someone cut in half to generate sales and take advantage of Ms. Hambly's fans, of which I have been one for many years now. That said, it is still well worth reading. She has strayed quite a lot from the first book in the series, but John (our hero) is still recognizable and engaging.. Jenny isn't. If at all possible, borrow it from the library (I did) or wait a couple years until the SF Book Club comes out with a 'double' containing this book and its' inevitable sequel. Unless money is a minor concern for you (must be nice), in which case you should go ahead and buy it.. :-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hopeless Endings","review":"Barbara Hambly has a gritty style that I adore. Even this book's dreary Hell of Walls techno-world is an interesting addition and commentary on our lives. Her characters, John and Jenny, are regular people just trying to do the right thing in impossibly difficult situations. I admire their courage, their sense of humor, their will to do the right thing. I found myself swept up in their adventure and wanting to help.But at the end of Knight of the Demon Queen, Hambly leaves those characters in hopeless situations. I wish I had known there was another book in the series before I finished this one. As it was, this book left me horribly depressed and feeling it was a mistake to read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"sequel runs out of steam","review":"I enjoyed the previous book, but was terribly disappointed that this book does not bring the story to a conclusion. enough already!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"Frankly, the book is a wash. I am a huge fan of Hambly and this time she left us in limbo. No wrap up on this book and I ordered it as soon as it was available. Now I wait to see how the darn thing ends - if she ends it in the next one. This was a commercial ploy - leave everyone hanging so they have to buy the next book to complete the yarn. At ~$20/pop - lots of money for the publishers. We fans deserve better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"never buy a sequel without checking these reviews!","review":"I actually shelled out for a hardcover version of this book, but not before checking the last page for the dread phrase \\"Continued in XXXXX\\" which was absent. But the author and publisher LIED to me. A grotesquely disappointing and depressing sequel to a sequel and she still hasn't wrapped it up. I'm beginning to smell \\"Riverworld Syndrome\\" here. I admire Barbara Hambly's writing but publication of the last two books in this series, at least as they currently stand, was a Very Bad Idea."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Dragons","review":"This was a big disappointment. There are some series that need more books and never get written and then there are the series that the author should have left alone before they ruined the world. This is that kind. All the magic from the first book is was sucked out of the series by the second book leaving this one to be a rambling mediocre story of a quest involving demons. It had potential but the quest basically goes nowhere. Far, far too much time is spent in the strange \`modern' world and the book ends with out ending. If you liked Dragonsbane, do yourself a favor and don't read this one. It's not worth the time or the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enough already","review":"Dragonsbane was good. Dragonshadow was not. Knight of the Demon Queen is an unsatisfying litany of horrors committed by demons. This book could be the end of a trilogy (at least it doesn't say \\"to be continued\\" like Dragonshadow) or it could be the third portion of a tetrology. But, like its predecessor, it is depressing and has either a sad ending or an ambiguous ending that allows for another sequel. The series should have ended with Dragonsbane. Ms Hambly: Please do better. You have been on my preferred author list, but with the last two books in this series, that position is in danger..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not compare to Dragonsbane in any way","review":"It's one thing to give characters obstacles to face. It's another to torture them ad infinitum and then end the book without letting the readers have some sense of closure. Barbara Hambly's style and talent shine through now and then (I like the part about little Maggie wanting to be a spider when she grew up) but the rest of the book was very disappointing. Get rid of the demons already and bring back Morkeleb (as something other than a conveyance)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dragon's bane descends to the pits","review":"By the end of this book, I believed that was it. Hundreds of pages of dreadful led me to the conclusion that the end is the end. All the heroes are dead, good people and good deeds are wasted against an uncaring world."},{"rating":"1","title":"A tedius journey to destruction","review":"In this latest battle of our heroes, John and Jenny Aversin and the dragon Morkeleb vs. assorted really rotten demons, John finds himself in an alternate universe that resembles New York city taken to ridiculous extremes. The idea that a primitive man, even though brilliant, could function in such a strange environment seems farfetched. Close attention to detail is required in reading this work because things move so fast. The demons have the upper hand turning usual concepts on their heads. Don't expect a happy ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck!!!","review":"Having read both the previous books in this series I really wasn't looking for much but I did want to see if the characters were redeemed any this time around. What a mistake where Dragonsbane was great and Dragonshadow was mediocre this latest is the dregs. Not a good thing happened to any of the characters and I really feel that Ms. Hambly could have come up with some sort of ending. Being left hanging when all the main characters appear to be dead is just nonsense. I don't see any reason to stick around for a sequel. As another reviewer wrote. This is Hell how could it get any worse!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What will become of our heroes? Who cares?","review":"The first book in this series is a well-worn friend; \\"Dragonshadow\\" I returned to the store I purchased it from, disgruntled, but at least it was able to stand on its own as a novel. This boring bit of trash I left in the store, irritated that I'd wasted three hours of my life on it. It's basically character movement, getting them to where they need to be for the NEXT book, heaping further indignities on the main characters while using others (Gareth, Trey and Polycarp leap to mind) as throwaways (and using the magnificent Morkeleb the Black as a taxi, for the Lady's sake!). Hambly leaves them, with the cliffhanger, in a place where they cannot escape without violating the integrity of the situation as it stands. I NEVER thought I'd be writing this -- certainly Ms. Hambly may do as she pleases with her characters -- but I don't give a damn about what happens to anyone in this book, and I won't be bothered to look around for the sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid them all after Dragonsbane","review":"Each book in the series after Dragonsbane is bad. Not ok, not mediocre, bad. They stray from the things that made Dragonsbane so good, and the things that make the hambly fantasy novels in general good. These are bad books. Bad. Did I mention they aren't good?"},{"rating":"1","title":"More of the same","review":"Those who were disappointed by the exceedingly sombre tone of this book's predecessor, Dragonshadow, will find this book more of the same. The ending, a cliffhanger, is disappointing; I would advise waiting on this until the next one is out, and then reading them both.Hambly has handled breaks between books with more grace: the touch of hope at the end of The Silent Tower, where Joanna betrays Antryg believing him to be something other than he was, but then redeeming herself by guessing the right password to the computer, or the transitions between The Time of the Dark, or in the Rainbow Abyss, where Rhion leaps into the Void but at least the reader knows that he survives.This is just a grim little cliffhanger of an ending. Wait for the sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little less than I bargained for...","review":"Pros- include cards for you to use and is very easy to follow the instructions.Cons- only 6 cards are included and some of the recipes call for odd/hard to find items.I would recommend to anyone who likes giving homemade gifts and has access to \\"specialty\\" type of foods."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah","review":"This one falls short...it has alot of dessert type coffee cakes. i was hoping it would be as good as one dish meals or soups...but it's not.

The plastic insert if flexible and serves little function."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read, and you may learn a thing or two","review":"Erick Lindgren is a young agressive player that has some great insights into the game. The book is geared towards multi-table tournaments such as the WPT where you start out with a massive stack and very small blinds. Therefore, his early game strategy does not really apply to shorter tournaments such as single-table tournaments. However, his advice is still solid, and his late game strategy is good.One of the big things he stresses is knowing how much to bet. He advocates smaller bets a lot of the time, because often it isn't neccessary to risk many chips to obtain the information you want."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless","review":"I will not recommend this book to anyone as it doesn't have much content in it. For serious players, I recommend Dan Harrington's books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book","review":"This is a good book. Entertaining, as well as informative. A lot of good insights into the mind of an aggressive player. Some very good insights into the bubble effect, and lots of other nuances of a tournament that may be missing from a lower level player. Erick's personality really comes thru in this work, and you sense that you'd love to sit down and have a beverage with the guy. He also does have a lot of very keen observations about certain plays, when they work, when they don't, how to handle yourself... a worthwhile book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting and Informative","review":"Lindgren's \\"WPT Making the Final Table\\" provides in-depth insight into his style of tournament play. With many tournament strategy poker books out now, most of them provide very similar messages. Lindgren's book is no different. The message being: PLAY AGGRESSIVE!! and GATHER CHIPS EARLY ON! However, what makes this book special is not his ability to convey this message but with some of his additional sections, he helps prepare you for actually putting the money to good use and how to avoid paying more taxes than you need to. I recommend this book to any novice player getting ready for tournament play."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book","review":"If your goal is to play big money tournaments - take the first step and read this book! The tips in this book can save you A lot of heartach and time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good - worth reading but not definitive","review":"There aren't many good books on tournament Hold 'Em play. So considering the competition, this one is definitely worth having and worth perusing. It is certainly lighter and easier to read than many poker books with their tables of hands and intricate descriptions of specific situations. Erick writes mainly about his general style (stay aggressive) and how it relates to the different stages of a poker tourney.If you want to read only one book on tournament poker play, this isn't it. But as a matter of fact, none of the other books on tournament poker play are it either. So if you want to read just one book, I would LOVE to see you forkin' up some of your money at a poker table with me.There is some filler and propaganda about getting involved with the World Poker Tour and how not to blow your first million after you win, but that is a minor issue. Generally a good, enjoyable read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Field Guide to Pattern Glass","review":"I bought the book because I am doing research on the pressed glass.

The line drawings are clear and give a better sense of pattern than most photographs.

On it, French cellist Maurice Gendron delivers one of the most disappointing, and sometimes even laughable, performances I have heard to date. Instrumentalists in the early 1900s were in the habit of frequent glissandi, i.e. Heifetz and Primrose, but sliding to and from every shift, as Gendron does, is beyond poor taste. There is little music-making in this performance.

He presents a varied and well-executed selection of many of my favorite guitar pieces. His interpretations differ from some other guitarists, but that just adds interest to me. I would probably classify his style as more classic than romantic.It is interesting to juxtapose his interpretations with those of some of the romantics, such as Segovia or Parkening. I won't say one is better than the other, but both camps of interpretation bring something to the work. That's good.If you like classical music played on guitar, or need something good to put in the background, or just like well-played guitar music, you will not be sorry you bought this collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was expecting something a bit calmer.

Sure the voices are a little off. Because of this i really give the DVD a 4 and 1/2 stars. Though the voices are not terrible and awful like most people complain. Goku, Gohan, Frieza and Bulma all sound the same as on Cartoon Network. Although Vegeta and Krillin are off and since Vegeta is my favorite that is why i am most disappointed.

Alot of people give Bruce Faulconer (American DBZ composer) crap about his music, but I believe it fits perfectly well! The Japanese score was ok, but for the American audience, Faulconer's score is fantastic! Love how he used the \\"Ginyu Theme\\" and \\"Closing Credits\\" songs throughout the first episode.

I've bought their CDs but this is my first concert DVD. I've watched better concert DVDs though I still liked this one just didn't love it and I don't want to over sale it.

I've been to two of their shows which were both great but this particular show wasn't interesting, they just seemed to be going thru the motions. They are my favorite band so I had high hopes for this DVD but, alas, it was a waste of money. There weren't any backstage interactions or any commentary from the band; just a straight-forward taped performance, so if you've seen them live there is no point to buy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"I bought the Blu-Ray version hoping for a great performance with excellent audio and video quality.

No outstanding songwriting, bad chorusses, heavy guitars and songs that all look the same made this album not worthwhile buying it.

The pluses include the large number of works presented in a single collection, and at an unbeatable price. On the minus side, we are presented with performances which abound with wrong notes, some of which are very excessive and plain irritating (especially \\"The Union\\"). Alan Mandel is obviously a fine pianist, and he is well recorded, but either was not given the benefit of multiple takes, or the VOX company elected to release his recordings without editing. After listening to these discs you will agree there is a case to be made for \\"multiple takes/splicing/editing\\" to produce the best recording possible. I cannot understand why the VOX label would release these recordings in this manner."},{"rating":"2","title":"American Classical","review":"Unique set of American classical music. Several selections have a Latin flavor - all in good taste. A larger collection with a mix of greater and lesser works - disc one has the cream of this crop. Mandel plays with style and substance. As you listen, you can almost imagine yourself back in the 19th century. The liner notes are a nice complement."},{"rating":"1","title":"trying too hard to please","review":"This band wants too much to be all things. There are numerous other jam bands & newgrass bands who do a much better job at breaking down barriers between musical genres. The musicianship, while good, pales by comparison to some of the true giants in the field. At the risk of being cruel, suffice to say that there are no Bela Flecks, David Grismans or Tony Rices in this lineup. Neither do the vocals compare with a John Cowan. While they want to take on different styles, the rhythm section lacks the flexibility of, say, that of String Cheeese Incident, which can move fluidly from salsa to jazz to bluegrass & never miss a beat (literally & figuratively). As a long time newgrass fan, I looked forward to this much ballyhooed disk with some anticipation. Needless to say, I was disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"attractive, well made","review":"I installed these as part of a $25k bathroom remodeling project.

The grinder housing is aluminum and is held in place by a single screw which is supposed to lock into a small indent in the aluminum housing.After a few uses, the indent gets slightly enlarged, the housing of the holding screw also works loose and the grinder housing gets a little play.That wouldn't matter so much if it weren't for the fact that the hexagonal housing on the grinder only connects with the hexagonal nut on the motor shaft with about 1mm overlap.Thus, that little bit of play in the grinder housing allows the grinder to break loose from the motor shaft with even the lightest of loads, rendering the entire unit completely non-functional.What a piece of trash!"},{"rating":"2","title":"waring pro meat grinder","review":"A good price for the grinder, but was dissapointed that there was not any receipes included with the machine.

So the noise is acceptable.I am adding more comments now after using it for 5 weeks (about once a week)...The driving shaft and Feed Screw start to slip. The shaft is hex-shaped (instead of square-shaped), which is a not-long-lasting poor design for such a small size. Once it starts to slip, it can only become worse and worse.

The food cooks so much better in these pots and pans compared to my others. It cooks evenly with much less heat. I can't say enough about these! If you are contemplating buying this set I would say do it! I have had no real problems with food sticking to the pan that I couldn't get off with a soft sponge. I didn't have to use any more oil than usual, and the clean up was super easy.

I don't want to give away the ending, so let me just say that Josh Mandel's words are more than just guideful, helpful lessonfulls of stuff - his writing is prosaic and wise, at times almost mystical, philisophical.

Unfortunately, most of this recording is distorted and noisy when the playing gets loud. All of the Studies on CD 1 contain distortion well beyond any professional recording I've ever heard (the 2 sonatas don't suffer from the same fate -- they appear to be from a different session). The fact that Vox goes on about their 20-bit digital mastering on the back of the box sure looks like they are \\"protesting too much\\". This is all a real shame for Ives fans because Mandel's playing is some of the finest Ives piano performances I've ever heard, plus, here in one place at a great price, are arcane pieces well worth hearing.

The film is dated, of course, and may be a bit slow for modern tastes. The lead actors are mostly fine in their roles, although Robert Donat as Dr. Manson seems to be somewhat conflicted in his motivations. Rosalind Russell gives an excellent performance as Dr. Manson's highly-principled wife. Ralph Richardson does a great supporting turn as a flawed physician desperately trying to reclaim his humanity. His impassioned plea to Dr. Manson to join him in a preventative care group is one of the highlights of the film. A very young Rex Harrison does a nice job as a society doctor.

As a mother of two young children (2 years and 11 mos) I am so SICK of the 'experts' who tell us how to raise our children. Most new mothers are so overwhelmed with information that they are left completely helpless when the time comes to actually get down to business of being a parent. I know this because I felt this way when my first son was born.Thankfully I realized I needed to toss out all the idiot baby books (yeah, I'm talking about Dr. Sears) and trust my own judgement. I have two wonderful boys who are healthy, sweet, and happy. I'm not so cavalier to think that 'attachment parenting' doesn't work for some families, but it was destroying mine. You really need to decide what works for you and your child's temperment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing To Offer to the Genre","review":"Neither helpful nor insightful. That is how I would characterize this book. Where to start? It was simply dreadful, in my opinion. First and foremost, not a single opinion contained in this book was sourced from any reliable research. There was no analysis of current studies on children and parenting. In fact, there were no studies mentioned at all, to back up the author's opinion that most children out there are twits. There were a lot of anecdotes about how the author disliked what he saw children doing in restaurants or stores. Truthfully, I felt like these anecdotes revealed much more about the author and his own issues. His opinions about toilet training, breastfeeding, and other developmental stages revealed an ignorance of the most current evidence and studies about these stages. In general, this was just a pile of poorly reasoned opinions and conclusions drawn from incredibly shallow observations. A complete waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beauty & The Disaster","review":"What more can I say? The movie is absolutely hilarious as a comedy.

It leaves out her singing Stormy Weather, her last television appearance singing. And skips to the interview part. This is not an official DVD.

There is very little story here and what there is borders on being silly. I thought I was going to be reading about a woman discovering herself. That certainly isn't what happened. What you will get is a lesson in what a women's festival is supposed to be about (according to this author), the divisions among lesbians, racism, male bashing and some extended gnashing of teeth about daughters of Holocaust survivors. The main conclusion I came away with was that, if this is how women's festivals are conducted, I'm glad I haven't been to one. The \\"mystery\\" in this has a ridiculous conclusion. None of the characters are well developed. This book isn't worth the cost, even at the used price. It took me about two hours to read the whole thing.

Don't forget to buy a region-free DVD player first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Grim","review":"I saw this film for the first time recently and I think it is definitely more potently graphic than its American counterpart \\"The Day After\\". It is also much more pessimistic. In the American film, people were helping each other after the nuclear holocaust, but in this film, everyone is out for himself only. There is no compassion, empathy, caring or sharing - the U.K. turns immediately into a cruel, medieval, dog-eat-dog society. It is often difficult to find good things to say about humanity, but I don't believe all people will lose their hearts & souls over a nuclear war. There will always be some good people in this world- no matter what sort of calamity happens.This film features a nuclear exchange between the U.S. and the U.S.S.R after the latter moves into Iran. It was really sort of chilling to see Iran involved in this considering what is going on in Iran in 2006. Let's hope the makers of the film were not prescient on this matter!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"I am truely amazed to find this decades old British film still in production.

Not a chick flick, not a testosterone rollercoaster, but some where between. Like a lot of action movies, this one suffers from lack of character development at times, especially with Moore's milk toast boyfriend. Perhaps after being around all that testosterone, he's a relief.Moore took a lot of risks, and I think they were mostly successful, creating a woman warrior who makes Eowyn from LOTR look like a ninny.A romance between Moore and Mortensen would have been ridiculous in the context of this movie, and their Navy rank. It would be interesting to see them paired romantically in another movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"SEALs are Excellent Support for the First Team","review":"The Navy Seals get a lot of publicity, and they are extremely competent -- which likely is why they were chosen as the foil for political correctness in this film -- but if you analyze this plot carefully, the conclusion is unexpected though quite apparent.A woman trains with Seal candidates. While on a final qualification exercise, her group is activated for a live mission. They perform the mission successfully.So what was that mission? A U.S. satellite had crashed in an enemy country. A small unit of soldiers parachuted deep into enemy territory, avoided detection, located the satellite and carried it out, by hand and on foot, to the rendezvous point, where the Seals waited to assist their retrieval. So, who performed the REAL dirty work here? Answer: The U.S. Army Rangers.

Demi Moore, even to the most generous critic, has limited talent as an actress, and the movie stinks! I have no objection to a woman wanting to serve in a commando unit, but the plot line is laughable, unless you want to see how well Demi Moore fills out her tightly fitted t-shirt. And how any woman in the military managed to get such tight-fitting outfits is interesting, did she have a custom tailor? The business about seeing her as one of the 'guys' is a bit hard given her apparent choice of attire. Still, maybe that's why people watched it, it was good for a laugh.

How does one get uglier? Shave their head.I found the story lacking any intensity, especially for a Ridley Scott film. The only interesting part of the film is \\"Jane's\\" brutal fight/confrontation with her Master Chief played by Viggo Mortensen . That's it.

She is ripped and sexy as hell...Viggo Mortensen is amazing as the Master Chief. I watched this movie at least 5 times before I even realized that it was him and that shows how great an actor he is...The premise is cool also...A women in the Navy Seals...There is no doubt that women can kill just as well as men can...The question is, can they PULL THEIR WEIGHT??? Or another person's weight???This is a great flick for your collection.The best Viggo Mortensen movie in my opinion,A History of Violence (New Line Platinum Series)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Demi does a Jack Palance","review":"Feminists will unite to watch Demi Moore do one handed pushups for about a half an hour.

When Demi Moore visited Letterman."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible","review":"Cheesy, awful dialogue and a lame script sink the capabilities of Demi Moore and Viggo Mortensen, the stars who are unable to save this movie. Moore seems lost in her role as the movie's makeshift heroine: a woman let into the Navy SEALS training program under shady conditions, makes it very far and yet seems surprised to learn there were politics (gasp!) behind it. Even the usually sharp Mortensen appears to have a very choppy performance, probably due to poor editing. His performance as the evil military guy, the Master Chief, is not as sincerely evil as it could be and is not a winner. Predictable, boring, and typical would be the only ways to describe this one.

The charactors were unrealistic and over all poorly acted. It was a cookie cutter action/drama which has no value."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame movie","review":"The lamest movie ever. The whole movie is fake, of course. Aside from its anti-military MAN message, it's a catastrophe. What's all with the grey, filtered and dark scenes? It was like every scene was strangling me. Dark, grey, color-less and boring. The final scenes were horrible. First of all, the US Navy does not operate Eurocopter Super Puma helicopters (shown being used to rescue the stranded SEAL team) and it also does not operate AH-1 single engine Cobra attack helicopters. It never did. US Army for a while used them in Vietnam in mid 60s before switching to more modern versions of it. The last scene is horrible. Were they filming a disco dance? I think instead shaking the camera like idiots they should have really spent a few more bucks using high quality special effects. I can't give this junk movie any better rating. Zero! Horrible!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Demi Moore's career falls after this movie.","review":"This movie was catastrophically damaging to Demi Moore's career as a high paid female actress. The point here was that this movie gave an image of Demi Moore as being more masculine,and an image of a man,then her feminine public image. In plain English, she lost a lot of her male fans due to this image,and still haunts her career to this day. May have contributed to her divorse with her ex-husband Bruce Willis,and her fall as a highly paid female actress."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, please!","review":"I think Ridley Scott makes pretty good movies but this one was getting on my nerves. There is no way in hell any woman(unless she is 6 feet 200 pounds power lifter) could get through Navy Seal training. The makers want you to pretend that women are same as men in all ways imaginable and that any woman should be able to perform the tasks assigned to Seals. Oh, and women should be able to take shower with the guys who should act as if she is one of the them. Yeah, right.

My wife and I sat down and watched it and were annoyed at wasting good money on low-fare entertainment.The gung-ho portrayal of the navy is very typical of hollywood, unrealistic and extremely corny (I cringed when the characters all started saying \\"hoo-ya\\" ). After the torture scene we just felt annoyed that a possibly good story turned farcical and I watched the rest of the movie on fast-play out of mere curiosity. I would give this one star and no more.This was highly dissapointing, the only redeeming part was the opening scene with Anne Bancroft and the end-credits."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great underdog overcoming all movie.","review":"I do like this movie... the first time or the 5th time.

The story is believable and the action/suspense is pretty good."},{"rating":"1","title":"this movie blows, dont waste your time or brain cells","review":"The MP5 has a silencer but when one of the so called SEALS or CRTs?? or something fires it, it makes noise as if it does not have a silencer. And how about the training base in the movie. Last i checked the SEAL training base is in Coronado California and is called BUDs. Lets see what else... oh yeah i dont think that Navy SEAL recruits carry weapons during training the second week. The first couple of months or so is physical training culminating in hell week and if a recruit passes this, then they progress to the diving and land warfare phases. SO THEY DONT CARRY WEAPONS AT ALL DURING THE FIRST PHASE OF TRAINING!!!. Anyway obviously i dont recomend this movie because it is fake, stupid and boring and the action at the end is so confusing that i literally got up and left my apartment with the tv still on.

Why would a woman want to be a SEAL?No, I have nothing against women.And why have all the men in in the military be seen as arrogant jerks?I have never had anything against women, and I don't approve of Viggo beat Moore up and then trying to rape her.

Moore rocks as a Lt. in the U.S. Navy who gets to be the first woman ever allowed to train to be a S.E.A.L.

Donna McMahon makes character development appear effortless, no simple task in itself. She avoids sterotypes and plot formulas like the plague, no pun intended. Yes, you could say,\\"No stereotypes were harmed by the making of this book\\".The mix of easily recognizing the feeling of the characters first, then realistic dialogue, and then... detailed descriptions of a shattered environment (that many living on geological fault lines can uncomfortably imagine), works well.Once you turn the pages, you'll be in a not-so-impossible-after-all future, reminiscent of too many places and lives that have been destroyed and forgotten in our own world.Blade is a warrior that scares the hell out of me!

It immediately satisfied my questions about the bok choy family (try and figure out the difference between yu choy and choy sum if you're not an expert in Asian produce). I also made a recipe for broccoli raab (one of the four names she mentions) and found it very quick, easy, and relatively low fat.I admit, I haven't used it day-in and day-out like some of the reviewers, but upon immediate perusal it has clear pictures and descriptions and recipes that utilize the main ingredient in its 'natural habitat' i.e. Cuban vegies have Cuban recipes, etc.I'm saving the fifth star only because I am still working through the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, but why not complete?","review":"Just swell, but why leave out the basics?

As someone who has cooked in a lot of restaurants, and a personal chef now, I don't go in much for any kind of book of recipes I already know what works. So it either has to be encyclopedic or blow me away on new presentation ideas to suck me in. This one is the former. It describes and gives reference for vegetables in great detail and I just freakin' love it. Great book to pick up when your cooking with any vegetable and learn something that you didn't know about something you work with every day.

I love this set of recordings, which was my introduction to Schubert's masses.I have read many criticisms of these performances -- everything from their being overly Romanticized to their being too bland and void of drama. I've gone back to them again and again -- both to just listen because I enjoy these recordings so much, and to see if I could hear what the critics have such deep problems with. I've come away scratching my head and still enjoying them quite a lot.I would characterize them as hitting an excellent tone and interpretation for sacred works. Peace and tranquility are the words that come most readily to mind. I find the performances rich, warm and comforting.

What it does (and does very well) is tell you what you need to do to sell your work. And I see little point in writing if you don't plan to get your work read, and in the case of a movie script, filmed.

This is NOT \\"Everything you ever wanted to know about screenwriting\\", nor does it try to be. However, Skip does refer to some of the best books and web sites that will help expand your understanding of the topic. The tone of the book is light and breezy, and the information is broken up so you can read it in little chunks like a magazine. Don't take it too seriously.

We Keep On is this type of record.Out of the band's albums, this is one of thier most realized, with compelling melodies, ear-grabbing textures and detailed arranging.

The lids do not have the same quality as the rest of the set. I had ordered in all 18 pieces of All-Clad of which only 5 pieces were made in America.

My All-Clad is still the best though, and is really my \\"work horse\\" cookware that I use every day. The stainless steel is great for cooking just about anything and goes into the dishwasher without a problem. Occasionally I scrub them with Barkeepers Friend and they still look shiny and new hanging on my pot rack.

If you want to cook merely to get some mildly palatable food onto a plate and into the family, and want to expend as little effort as possible cleaning up afterward, then you should best look elsewhere. All-Clad stainless is not designed for the harried individual seeking the quick and easy cooking solution. If you take pleasure in crafting fine food with fine cookware that provides control and consistency, then look no further. Yes, the cost is a bit more effort afterward. The good things in life don't come cheaply or easily. A word of advice though: use Bar Keeper's Friend or Bon Ami to clean up. It makes cleaning so very much easier.

It's not as long as Walking w/Dinosaurs but they tried to keep this story on Big Al. It's the same look and feel as Walk w/ Dino , so if you liked it , you will like this one.

The Androids Saga climaxes here, when Trunks, Vegeta, Krillin, Piccolo, and Tien discover Dr. Gero's lab. Goku, who fell ill in previous episodes, was taken back home by Yamcha. Dr. Gero activates Androids 17 and 18, who proceed to kill Gero and activate the giant Android 16. The Androids fly off to a mountainside roadway, where Vegata challenges Android 18 to a fight and gets a little more than he bargoned for...Everything about this DVD is great. The sound quality and picture image are very good, and the episodes are 3 of the best in the series. Of course, it's best to see the earlier Android Saga episodes, but then watch this DVD. It's very entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"dragon ball the best","review":"I have a question.

He was one of two men -- the other being his longtime friend, the CIA's Bill Lair -- to put his personal stamp on the huge covert program in Laos, and had there been more Aderholts and Lairs, events might have turned out differently. As it was, Aderholt had to labor during his entire career under a military system that was not flexible enough, or responsive enough, for a man of his remarkable talents. But he did his duty, and then some. The Air Force historian Warren Trest has done Aderholt justice with this book; and there's some especially interesting material on Aderholt's loyal opposition, from within, to the way the Vietnam war was run."},{"rating":"2","title":"Air Commando One","review":"Everything the author said about General Aderholt described the man I knew and whom I worked for in 1967-68 while assigned to the 56th Air Commando Wing, 56th Security Police Squadron. He was one tough guy who had a heart as big as an ocean. Once while assigned to Town Patrol in Nakon Phanom ,the Colonel at that time, stopped in an asked how things were. He was told that the only gripe we had was that we never got breakfast because we didn't get back to the base until 3 or 4 AM and the mess hall wasn't open. The next day we were told that as long as we cooked the food the mess hall would have it there for us when we came in. He was a true American hero and a man who didn't know the word can't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Probably the best Schubert Piano collection","review":"I can't be happier with this CD set. It combines what, in my view, are Schubert's best piano works. The impromptus, and the Fantasias for piano and 2 pianos incl. Die Wanderer. What's more Brendel is perhaps the quintessential interpreter of early Romantic music (Beethoven, Schubert). I searched all over for a collection like this, and this is the only CD set that offers it. If you like Schubert get it, you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"First-rate compilation of popular Schubert piano pieces","review":"I am not comparing this disc to others or Brendel to other pianists. On its own merits, this is a first-rate compilation of popular Schubert piano pieces. They are actually much more difficult to play than they look on paper, as indeed is most Schubert. Schubert himself was not a piano virtuoso and probably couldn't play these pieces nearly as well as Brendel, who to me has their spirit down perfectly. I enjoy all these performances and play them frequently. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting recordings but with less peaks than lows !","review":"I must confess I am not a Brendel fan , but I must recognize the only composer he plays with interesting approach to my taste is Schubert and certain pieces .His Wanderer Fantasie is the best of the set . And notice we are talking Brendel in his thirties ,There are best Musical moments Paul Badura Skoda and Schnabel.The Fantasie at four hands with Schiff is by far too much better . And the set of Impromptus has in Artur Schnabel, Edwin Fisher, Dinu Lipatti and Badura Skoda better performers.Only recommendable for Brendel fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Poor Quality","review":"This is a cheap copy of a video.

At first I thought the version of \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\" was fun. Now all I can think of is that if Korn of Limp Bizket (of however those idiots spell their name) sang in Spanish, THIS is how they'd do \\"Bo Rhap\\".

She has just moved into an old house in a London neighborhood called Hound Hill. She starts seeing, hearing and even smalling things from the time of the Black Death. She was transported to 1665 several times. Then she begins getting stranhge symptoms.

In Firelord, Godwin demonstrated a real knack w/prose and a marked ability to tell a quick & convincing historical tale (set in legendary times) in a believable, yet contemporary-sounding, voice. Not so here. This Robin Hood character plods along, never leaping into life and burdened by the paces he must go through to advance a thumpingly dull plot. None of the characters, in fact, have much life and so there's not much to tell about them here -- so I won't bother. Suffice it to say that Robin and his companions had more fun in King Richard's time. Just ask Scott's Ivanhoe. -- Stuart W.

I couldn't even finish it. It is terrible, trite, and poorly written. Let me give you an example: \\"Will spoke an odd-sounding English. There was something sad about his lightest remark, a tinge of humor about the most serious, yet from the first Robin responded to that voice as animals to the sound of trusted masters.\\"Overall, though others appear to have enjoyed reading it, I personally find it to be absolutely awful."},{"rating":"2","title":"an interesting twist on the Robin Hood legend","review":"This version of Robin Hood is set at the time of the Norman Conquest rather than in the time of King Richard the Lion-hearted. The Sheriff of Nottingham is transformed into a Norman knight fighting for his own place in the world. The characters are well-drawn and memorable. I enjoyed the domestic portraits of William the Conqueror and his queen Matilda very much. Marian is no longer a ward of the king but a homeless refugee. Another strong female character, Judith was added. She is Robin Hood's cousin and speaks French and was educated on the Continent. Overall, I can recommend this book if you'd like to read another book about Robin Hood"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Masterpiece","review":"After reading the book, A Tale of Two Cities, I viewed this version with Ronald Colman.

The book begins with a brief but interesting assessment of recent scholarly discussions of ethics in the Old Testament. Dempsey then sets the next stage for the book by discussing creation, covenant, and Torah; all with an emphasis upon relationship as she heads toward embracing a biocentric ethic for humanity. Her focus is selective so the element of blessing is ignored in the discussion of the Abrahamic covenant. The book deals with many short sections from the classical prophets of the Hebrew Bible as Dempsey questions the ethics of the prophets and drives a wedge between the OT prophets (entire Bible) and modern ethics. In the end, Dempsey seems to be searching not only for new metahpors for God but a new God."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the deal? Were they trying to save money?","review":"I don't get it.

Add to all that a community of dedicated scientists eager for new ideas, as well as a scholarly atmosphere where the concept of evolution was already in the air. Even the religious orientation of the time helped to spur Dariwn along. Ruse does a masterful job of describing this milieu and showing how it affected Darwin's endeavors over three decades.

Good for classrooms or parental teach. A child centered tale, the book offers fun and entertaining with a moral in a renewed way and is a good collection of these series of stories in the library. A good Buy and gift for kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another graet classic","review":"The illustrations in this book are very similar to those of Jan Brett but darker tones used.

The volume controls are convenient and easy to use.Think not having a screen to select or see song titles is a problem? It's not. Think about this - when you fill the Shuffle with your favorite tracks, you KNOW the next song is going to be good!

It messed up the firmware on the device several times, it would complain constantly that it is not up to date and then try to update it which resuted in several crashes.The most horrible thing however was that it would mess up your MP3 music collection in a way that can never be undone. I had orgaized my collection in the file system nicely by genre, author, album etc, and this thing messed up everything. I have another mp3 player - iRiver - which I reccommend as a lot better than the iPod anyway - and I wanted to be able to copy things on it from my library.

Alas, having spent twice as much as my Mom paid for the shuffle and almost as many hours as it takes to get to her house trying to get the &%$# thing to work, and then being unable to get the repair request to go through on the apple.com website, my post-Christmas euphoria has been destroyed."},{"rating":"2","title":"I-Pod Review","review":"I know nothing about computers and downloading was easy!

I got no apology for the defective hardware. I was told that I should be happy that they were sending me a replacement as if the fact that the brand new one I bought being defective was somehow my fault.The replacement has worked fine so far. I am keeping my fingers crossed. I wish I had immediately sent it back instead of messing with it for hours. It was clearly bad hardwareIf you buy a Shuffle and have any issues with it, send it back right away! Don't follow their directions thinking that there may be software problems that can fixed.

I owned a 15gb Gen3 iPod, which I sold for 100 bucks because it didn't really work for me during my gym routine. I setup my playlist and migrated it to the iPod, of course, waiting longer that I would have for my firewire 15gb version. Transfer speed aside(I mean really, is it that slow...no) I think this is a great product. The size, weight and usability is top of the line, as I would expect from Apple. No screen huh? big deal. One less plastic coated surface for me to scratch up. I found that with this player, I'm more into listening to the music versus spinning my touch-wheel around looking for a song I like better on my older iPod.All in all, a great product. I would order through Apple's site because you'll receive it much faster, but hey, that's just me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to use - great sound","review":"We bought two of these for our daughters (11 and 14 years old). Very easy to use - plug in the software, load some music into iTunes, and transfer to the Shuffle. That's it. The kids love it. It holds more than enough tunes for their needs - they change the songs all the time anyway.The sound on these things is wonderful - I frequently use one when I go on a run, because it's so light. After years of running with a Walkman (or Diskman) that skipped everytime I took a step, the Shuffle is a delight.Before the Shuffle, we used Diskmans and had to contend with scratched CD's and a mountain of dead AA batteries. The Shuffle is a welcome change.My only problem is finding them - they're so small.

I could sit and download for hours. But, why would anyone buy this flash memory player when there are other ones with more features AND a display? I will stick to my Iriver any day. The inline recording feature that it has is remarkable. It really is cd quality. Not that I want to rip off the music industry, but with this feature you can record an album, for instance, off of AOL for nothing. It really is cd quality when you record like this. This IPod can't do that. I think the hard drive Ipod is a brilliant idea, and maybe someday I will get one. But for the money, you can buy another flash memory MP3 player, with a display, with a radio, with voice recording (some may find that useful, I don't) and the inline recording. And they look better.

I bought one with my money because I was replacing my dead 3rd Generation iPod. I liked how small it was, and since I only needed 512 MB, it was a good buy for $99 in May 2006. But then only a month later, I was listening to it on the bus and it died suddenly. It wouldn't turn on, but Apple gave me a new shuffle. Once again it died and it wouldn't come back to life.

It's so much nicer than carrying around my CD player and CDs. It doesn't matter to me that I don't have a drop-down window to select a song. If you don't mind not knowing what song will be played next, this is the MP3 player for you. Especially because you can get this at a great price.

I've heard that Apple is phasing out this model, which explains the reduced price.One of the main reasons is faulty firmware in the Shuffle. I've only had mine a little over a week and it's already dead. And believe me, I've tried everything. There's a bad habit in Shuffles to go into \\"blink\\" mode, which means bad medicine. Once a Shuffle unit goes into blink mode, it becomes next to impossible to get itunes or Windows to recognize it. That means no song downloads, no updates, not even any Windows based tech diagnosis.Apple is offering replacements, but the S&H; for the return is $[...], and even then there's no guarantee that the replacement will work any better. My 5 year old Intel audio player is more reliable than this.. thing.Stay far, far away from the ipod Shuffle.

It doesn't hurt to throw in a few broadway tunes or old timers to widen their horizons."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simplicity and quality in a tiny unit","review":"Good price, great sound quality, and an easy unit to figure out even if you've never before owned an Apple product. Yes it (and iTunes) will work fine if you have a Windows PC. Some of us don't have \\"thousands of CDs\\" or favorite songs, so if your favorite songs number more in the dozens (up to 250 in the 1GB shuffle) then this is an excellent choice. Also, it's good for younger kids, who tend to lose things. You won't go beserk if a $70 product disappears as you might if it was bye-bye video Nano. The only disadvantage may be that this product encourages introverted behavior--but as one of the people in the world with a distant expression and white earplugs attached to head, I now think sometimes that is a nice place to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome MP3 player for kids","review":"I bought the 1st generation shuffle when it was on sale for $48 for my 6 year old brother. It's a christmas present... It is by far the best music player for kids you can buy. It holds more than enough music for a kid, is small, durable, has a long battery life, and extremely easy to use. The main reason why I chose the 1st generation shuffle is b/c of its ease of use. It's as simple as it gets, on, play, louder, softer, and next song.

The sound quality is also excellent!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The iPod Shuffle","review":"You all may think the iPod Shuffle is boring because it only holds 120 songs well your wrong!

After reading all the discussion threads on the support site, it was clear that there was a design flaw, as nearly every post was a frustrated user with the same problem.

Of course, I had to work my way up the complaint ladder and roughly 4 phone calls to Tech \\"Support\\" - their word for it; not mine - before I found someone who said, \\"Oh, you can't do that on the Shuffle.\\" I'll tell you what - save yourself some medication and buy a Panasonic Shockwave CD player instead.

Comparably-priced players have a ton more features - a display, FM-tuner (great for the gym), voice recorder, replaceable battery, folders to organize tracks on the player, equalizers, shuffle functions, great ease of use, and on and on... And this player is plagued by the common Ipod problem - when the battery dies the player becomes a paperweight.

The Otter Box is great. If not for the Otter Box and my desire to be able to swim with it, I would choose something else. For the same money one can buy one from Creative. The Creative one has a display, uses standard AAA batteries, allows one to play music by album,skip albums or just find a particular song or album, which without a display the Shuffle is incapable of doing. The switch on the back does not have a good detent to allow choosing between shuffle and sequential play. If you only want to hear music in random order, do not desire to see what is playing, have to use one internal battery which needs a USB cord or special charger to charge, buy the Shuffle. Otherwise, think about a Nano or some other MP3 player."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ease of use","review":"I love the iPod shuffle for keeping me company on my long walks, but I found the instruction book incomplete.It's still a mystery on how to do operations like deletions in an efficient way.

I want the bigger, better iPod that can fit thousands of songs on it. I also want all the extra features. The iPod Shuffle has none of those things. However, I purchased one for my wife, and I must say that sometimes I'm actually jealous of it. That sleak, simple, little Shuffle just begs to be held and listened to. For what it is supposed to be, the Shuffle succeeds marvelously. And people might complain about the lack of a screen, but I believe that most who actually get a Shuffle find that they don't miss it much at all (mostly since we're only talking about a hundred or so songs here anyway). Highly recommended, even as a second MP3 player for those currently with hard-drive-based models."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this damn trendy Ipod!","review":"I am in graduate school and felt like a grandad when it came to the cell phones and ipod scene on my campus.

I could not be happier with my purchase. 120 songs is perfect for what I am looking for in terms of storage space. The software is easy to install and easy to navigate for those of us who are computer illiterate. The small and compact design allows it to be stored and carried easily. The buyer also might want to purchase the carrying case to keep it from being damaged by the elements or by basic wear and tear.

By the time i got there it was practically sold out. This Ipod Shuffle is great because it's super light, easy to carry around, and it's pretty cheap compared to other mp3 players that aren't as fashionable or convenient. I find it fascinating that to recharge the Shuffle all you really have to do is stick it in your computer. There's no confusing wires, docks or adapters, and basically all you need is a USB port to a computer. It comes with a nifty lanyard and a pair of headphones. They also provide you with the ITunes program that is really easy to use. And also, the uploading of the songs doesn't take much time at all. I would definately recommend this product, even though it's really hard to get because it just came out."},{"rating":"1","title":"doesn't work","review":"I got this product for Xmas and was completely disappointed. I followed the instructions word-for-word, and used my new HP to download songs. Several hours later I had an ipod that didn't play any music; all I heard was silence. The manual is a joke and therefore troubleshooting the ipod is worthless. I could see this happening if I used a PC that was outdated but that isn't the case. I picked up a Sony psyc cd walkman a year or so ago, and that was less than 1/3 of the price of the ipod and fired up right out of the box.I know that there are plenty of fans of the ipod out there, but I can honestly say that you might want to reconsider before spending money on this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've gone through 2 in a year","review":"A friend got me a shuffle last year.

Not hard, but an annoyance.- Fast forward and Rewind are very slow. So if you loose your place in the 8hr long audio book track (which happens often due to software glitches) it will take you a while to get back to that point.

But I have two complaints - warnings - for future purchasers:1. The earbuds provided simply do not stay in my ear -especially during exercise (my primary reason for buying the product). A solution that worked for me are EarJams made by Griffin Technology and sold by TigerDirect via Amazon for about $11. I have also used and recommend 'The Plug' earbuds by Koss. You can buy at Amazon for about $13. Also check out the 'Sparkplug' earbuds by Koss. Looks like it comes with a white cord and costs about $13 too.2. Could not get the Shuffle to work with the front USB ports on my Dell computer. Works fine with a rear USB port - but not as convenient. Ideal solution would be to buy the Apple Dock Connector - but feel it is overpriced at $30. For about $6 you can get a white 6' USB2 extension that will do the job for you (check out Eforcity.com)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome player, no-screen, no-problem!","review":"This is a really awesome player. Although it was a bit confusing at first, the iTunes iPod import software was very easy to use. Comes with a full charge so you don't need to wait 4 hours to use it when you get it. Extremely tiny! it's even tinier than the ones in the pictures on the web. I would say this is a little more than 2 inches tall. Lanyard cap is very secure. Left earbud doesn't fit very well, but still sounds great.Overall, this thing is great. The no screen is not a problem because unless you have thousands of songs, you should know all your song's titles. Also, the shuffle feature is great. It's full of surprises. You never know what will come next.A++ player. This will set the benchmark for all over flash players to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product, Have been using it for 2 weeks","review":"I've had it for 2 weeks now and I love the shuffle. Seems like most of it's critics are people that don't own it. This is my first apple product. The battery life is awesome. You get 12 hours and most importantly, it's rechargable so you never have to buy AAA or AA batteries. If you are the type of person that sits with your MP3 player to pick out each song, this is NOT for you. If you are a person that likes MP3s as background music to other activities, then this is a GREAT low cost solution. In some ways, it is actually superior to the original iPod. It's got a better battery life, is smaller and is lighter. Listen to people that have one, not other people that just seem to hate apple."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Playlist display- So what the heck??","review":"I had bought a flash drive based Sandisk mp3 player some days back and then bought this shuffle. Yes, it doesnt have a display to go to the exact song u want and this can deter some people going for it. But tell you what? The vote still goes to the shuffle coz of its stupendous sound quality and a really looooud volume.It doesnt feel shaky and brittle in your hands and makes you really rock when u turn the volume to the max.

Alas, things did not work out as I had hoped. I have been struggling with this piece of #@*$ since I took it out of the box. It causes my computer--which more than satisfies the hardware requirements outlined by Apple--to freeze.

Then when I tried to get the shuffle into the USB port (the top comes off the Shuffle and reveals a thing to go in a USB port) It could not go all the way into the port. I looked through the instruction manual for help, and one one page in the middle, in small print it mentioned that if I couldn't get the Shuffle into the USB port, I would need to purchase a Ipod Shuffle dock or a USB extension cable. My dad and I were angered beyond belief that something like this wasn't on the Shuffle box, and that we had to wait after we purchased the shuffle to learn about this.

The sound quality is better than my radio or discman. I have a PC with Windows XP and Itunes has not had any problems and it makes loading all my cds on to my computer a breeze. Many have complained that there is no screen, no FM tuner, no recorder. Well, if you want those things don't buy the Shuffle, that seems to be a fairly easy solution.

The iTunes software (included) is easy to use and the online store has an immense library.CONS: The only fault I can find with this player so far is that I find the on/off switch to be difficult to use. It's just a slider on the rear of the unit and I wish that some form of finger-grip was built into it.ALL-IN-ALL: I'm so impressed with the sound quality that I'm already thinking about the 1GB version (or a regular iPod).You can't beat the deal for the price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great iPod for movement","review":"The PERFECT iPod for the gym or exercise lovers, period.

I bought this thinking it was good because there where supposed to be good but it was a piece of garbage. Since u dont have a screen you dont know what the hell your listening to. This is extremely hard to use because it has no screen. I highly advise that you people out there shouldnt buy this. Apple made a huge mistake inventing this hunk of junk. I also have a sandisk sansa Mp3 player and its great and not too expensive. I highly advise you to but a Mp3 player instead of an Ipod."},{"rating":"1","title":"if tears could build...stone","review":"I recently ordered the \\"stone\\" for a friend who recently lost her husband in a terrible accident. I was a little disappointed when it came because it was a hard plastic and I was under the impression it was stone. I'm afraid that if she decides to place it outside in her flower garden it will either fade or roll away with a strong wind. Although the saying is beautiful, I probably won't buy that one again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Portrait Lens","review":"I own this lens and love it. It's relatively fast speed, coupled with it's perfect optics is ideal for anyone wanting to take great pictures - even in low light situations. Plus it's perfect for portraits where you can step back and give the subject a little room to relax; or for other types of photography where you need to get in a little closer for the details. I would not hesitate to recommend this to anyone - but first you have to get the camera it works with (i.e., the G1/G2) which has unfortunately been discontinued since the company has decided to no longer be in business."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the clumsy","review":"This is an excellent CD player, that is until you drop it. It works really well, the antiskip blocks out any skip that may be caused, and the remote is really handy. One problem I found was that when you turned it on, it starts from the track which you were playing last, which gets a little annoying. I dropped it from about a one foot height, and it split in two. I would personally go for a more sturdy cd player next time I and going to buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fact checking?","review":"Here's an example of how a book that was perfectly well written and probably well researched was ruined by poor fact checking. For example crediting Brian Eno with using an instrumement that came out in the early 80's vs. his extremely well known use of an instrument that came out in 1969.I tried to enjoy this book and did for the most part, possibly due to my not catching every flaw. I am tempted to believe that this book was killed by poor editing or fact checking. The type of mistakes are not likely to have been made by an author wh is as experieced and knowlegable as Mr. Kettlewell"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, Well Researched Book!","review":"The book provides excellent descriptions of historic electronic instruments as well as some terrific interviews with pioneering giants like Bob Moog, Tom Oberheim, Serge Teraphin, Don Buchla and Klaus Schulze. Meticulous attention is given to important historic information and the book includes a wonderful timeline going back over a hundred years to Elisha Gray and his electric telegraph. This is as close as you can get to personally being there when the instruments were first invented. Likely the best of eight electronic music books on my shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been so much more","review":"Summary: Disjoint and Superficial.The author had access to an outstanding group of individuals and in many cases squandered the opportunity with superficial questions. Instead of getting key insights, I felt like I was getting trivia. The interviews read more like something from People magazine (or maybe a sidebar in a Keyboard/Music magazine) than a highly rated book. Where is the depth that Kettlewell should be able to provide?I found it impossible to get through section two. The intent may have been to be exhaustive in its list of pioneers, but instead I found it exhausting - dry, dull, superficial and disjoint.In addition the book is poorly edited, as if rushed to publication."},{"rating":"2","title":"Isn't God Great!","review":"A picture book for toddlers examining the concept of the breadth and depth of God. The great of the title refers to the vastness and the bigness of God. God is higher than the highest mountain, deeper than the deepest ocean, stronger than the largest army yet gentler than a little chick. The book continues along this line and ends with God caring for a single blade of grass and asking the question, \\"Isn't God Great?\\" which in this case would refer to the awesomeness and wonderfulness of God's many qualities.This book was first printed in England by Hunt & Thorpe in 1992.

Get this tape."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"This has been by far, the best Dragonball Z Tape I have ever viewed. It has 4 episodes on it. The first episode is sorta boring untill yamcha gets a hole through him which was really cool. There was alot of fighting in this, unlike most tapes when they talk eachother to death for about 3 episodes. The batle between Goku and #19 was great. My favorite part was when Vegeta goes Super Sayjin but right before it I like his phrase: \\"Tell me... do androids such as yourselves ever experiance fear?\\" The he growles and then explodes with power. It was amazing. This is the tape to get!"},{"rating":"2","title":"android invasion","review":"This is wear everyone first meets the androids. But that is all I will tell you.

So if you want to find out more just buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is one you must see in Japanese","review":"This DVD contains a very cool scene with Goku going Super Saiya-jin in front of the two androids; I watch just this clip frequently. And, of course, this is where Vegeta first goes Super Saiya-jin himself, after 4.5 years of training in up to 450 times earth's gravity he achieves the goal he set, passing Goku in strength. Watching it in Japanese is worth the cost of the DVD.I have been collecting the DBZ tapes since the legal copies were made available. I have recently switched to collecting them in DVD format, and while converting my current tapes to DVD would cost too much, there are some key DVDs you must have whether you collect tapes, DVDs, or are just a Toonami fan. I would include on this list, Androids Invasion, Super Saiyan Goku, the two with Piccolo's fight with #17, and the one with Gohan going Super Saiya-jin level 2 (seeing that in Japanese is amazing). The list should be bigger, but I still have not seen the entire series."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Androids are Here!","review":"This 4-episode DVD is about the Androids arriving, but a few things are off about what Trunks said. Goku turns Super Saiyan and fights 19, but the heart virus kicks in and then Vegeta as a Super Saiyan takes over! You don't get to see Vegeta do anything though, that's on the next DVD. There are a few parts in this DVD that are tedius to sit through and you'll probably skip these parts after seeing them the first time. The first part is when Master Roshi is explaining to Marin who Dr. Gero is and why the androids were made and you are shown a flashback of Goku defeating the Red Ribbon Army back in Dragonball. Another Part that might get boring after the first time seeing it is when Vegeta explains how he became a super saiyan. The menu system is exactly the same throughout the Androids Saga and the extras aren't very good. I definitely reccomend this DVD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"FUNimation tapes worth their money?","review":"If you don't know anything about the Dragonball triology (DB, DBZ, DBGT,) and are a kid under 13, and you watch DBZ on Cartoon Network, I recommend this tape to you. Otherwise, the tape just plain sucks! Bad dubs, lame action sequences, and \\"uncut\\" my... Uncut to FUNimation means censoring everything, then add three drops of blood! I could understand the nudity and some hardcore violence, but censoring the names of the characters and the main points of the violence totally ruins the story plot. This tape shows a little bit of SSJ1, nothing beyond the first super sai-jin form. I recommend you not buy the tape for all the reasons above and about 5000 more and save your money, and not to watch it on Cartoon Network to save time, and to spend the money on the original Dragonball instead of this Funimation DBZ garbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"They're finally here","review":"We finally get to meet the Androids that Trunks warned Goku and his friends of. I was so excited to see this tape. It was great to have new characters, and the entrance music for Android 19 and 20 was awesome. The amazing power of these two androids are revealed and also, we get to see Vegeta living his dream of being a Super Saiyan. And we also get to see what he went through to get there. This is a must have video and I suggest getting it right away."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good replacement for my burnout light bulb","review":"Searching a replacement compact bulb does not appear to be simple as ABC.

It was not as white as that of the burnt out bulb; it was more on beige side of spectrum."},{"rating":"2","title":"A historical ride","review":"Rick Burns' production was incredibly enhanced by the music from Brian Keane. This album is a wonderful addition to anyone's collection that is interested in the conquest of the West and the mix of people that came to claim the land. Of course, the land was not vacant, and the West was lost to the native peoples of this continent. A companion to The Way West may be easily found in How The West Was Lost, recorded onto two individual albums, by Peter Kater. Every bit as emotionally capturing as Keane's music, but, from a decidely different perspective."},{"rating":"1","title":"just say no","review":"It is a soundtrack.

He had me completely mesmerized. This CD is nothing short of a masterpiece in Trance, and it is definately a must have for anyone interested in this style. All the songs on here are incredibly built. Then at various times on the album, the beat completely drops and then it slowly builds (layer by layer) to the most epic Trance you will ever hear. I could go on forever, but I'll stop now. In summary, the artists are top notch, and Taylor's mixing is absolutely flawless. Buy this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Over rated!","review":"This CD is over rated, the mix set is too repetitive and it sounds like the same thing over and over again on each track.

It is much shallower than a standard wok, and has a much larger flat portion on the bottom than a standard flat-bottom wok (it is more like a deep skillet with a lid than it is wok-like). Yes, one could stir-fry in it, but that means little (one could try to stir-fry in a skillet or sauce pan also).Stir-frying will certainly be easier and better in an actual wok that is deeper and more rounded; I have one made by Calphalon and it is great.

You get all the heat-conducting benefits of copper with their copper-core cookware, without the hassle of having to keep a fully copper pot clean. The pan is very forgiving if you take your eye off things for a moment - I accidentally let something cook dry and it didn't really burn. Non-plastic handles mean all their pots and pans can go in the oven. They're not too heavy, unlike my Le Creuset cookware (which will eventually be replaced by All Clad cookware), and have an all-around feel of quality.

Putting a little tuna fish under the trip seems to work best. I tried eggs too, but found that the animals were smart enought to avoid the trip.

AHH.. Also why does the lid stain so easily - I have never made anything that contains purple in my blender ans now my lid is permantly that color! The best thing I can say about this is that it is heavy so it stays put, and the lid has a really tight seal which is not good if you have limited mobility in your hands.

This book is as much a powerful work of sociology, which gazes into the souls-won, lost and in limbo, affected by the drug. Appropriately, it is an indictment of the drug, as any book worth its weight must be, but the indictment is based on facts and shows the shallow tendency of American and European media to sensationalize and misinform the public about the drug.

DRUPE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent, but could be much better","review":"The plot is pretty good and I like the quick pace. BUT... the typographical errors and confusing dialogue are enough to drive a person insane! Lines are occasionally ended in mid-sentence only to begin again in a new paragraph. Several times, the wrong term is used (example: \\"poll\\" instead of \\"pole\\"). Quotations marks are often in the wrong place or missing all together. And speaking of the dialogue, it's very hard to figure out who is saying what half the time because the conversation is lumped into a paragraph instead of being seperated by who is speaking. What this book needs is a good proofreader!..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great popcorn popper","review":"I bought this for my parents who were continuously shattering glass and plastic popcorn bowls and it works fantastically. From what I am told, it doesn't seem to leave a single kernel unpopped and they have been using the recommended amounts of oil/popcorn and said it's worked wonderfully. As far as using this as a nut roaster, I can't say because they haven't tried it yet, but I'm sure they will."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad if you have the right kind of popcorn!","review":"This popcorn popper is pretty decent, but my popcorn is always hard.

I would recommend this popper to others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Making Tallulah Dull","review":"Unexpectedly finding a new biography of Tallulah Bankhead was a joy. Reading it, however, proved arduous. The author manages to take one of the 20th century's most interesting lives and make it stultifyingly dull. Choosing to rehash play plots in detail and to death, the author takes the spotlight off of the woman while trying to illustrate her.It was a bad choice.The author has obvious affection for his subject, but at the clear cost of his objectivity. Not a chapter goes by where he doesn't sound like an apologist for her most outrageous behaviors or take umbrage with her most scathing reviews.This is a tough read, but a significant one. The author succeeds in an area I would have thought impossible.He makes Tallulah Bankhead boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Curse of the Black Widow on the Author","review":"If you're hoping for that \\"dishy,\\" tell-all, spicy account of Tallulah's life, this ISN'T it! That bio is still to be written. This attempt at capturing the essence of the grande dame suffers from two fatal diseases: tedium and barely tolerable--lethal combinations in any dose. And, there are glaring errors of fact. Someone fell asleep at the research table! Better to view some of la Bankhead's films than try to wade through these waters. Anyone got a Lifeboat?!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent story told in a very different format.","review":"This comic book formatted fantasy myth is based on sun phases that make summer and winter solistice. The Kurds, an ancient people who dwell in darkness, allowed humans to occupy their island (New York) if their power (housed in something small, like a token) is returned by 12/21 (winter solistice) so that days can become longer. The Kurds hide it again every year on 6/21 (summer solistice) so that days can become shorter. If the power is not returned by 12/21, total darkness will prevail. Move that idea through several generations to modern day, and you've got a very interesting story. It sounds confusing and bizarre, but Avi makes it work. His versatality astounds me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for church youth groups and leadership teams!","review":"I use this book all the time at church with my youth group and with the adult leaders. I have found great mixers in the front of the book to help people get to know one another and in the back of the book the chapter called Open Up has good activities to get people to share about themselves more easily. The middle is filled with tons of team-building activities and it is easy to find something that fits my needs, from a short table game challenge for our weekly dinner to more involved teamwork tasks for our weekend retreats. I also find useful activities for leadership meetings to build community among the adult leaders of the youth group as well. This is the most user friendly and comprehensive team-building book I have found!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best activity book","review":"I'm a peer facilitator, and this is definitely the best group activity book that I've used. I've always gotten the best response from the activities in this book...they seem to be the most fun for the kids to do, while still teaching important lessons. The book is also very easy to read and understand.My fellow Peer facilitators and I have about 25 different activity books to choose from, and this is always the one that we each try to grab every week before anyone else gets to it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What can I say I love this book!","review":"This book gave me a lot of useful ideas.

It is not just about theater, read my review for that book, but again, DO NOT GET THIS BOOK!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for High School Counselilng!","review":"I found this book the most creative of Alanna Jone's 3 team building activity books, although all have great ideas for working with groups of high school students. Although many activites were designed for team building, goal setting, etc., I was able to easily adapt them to other areas such as building trust, expressing feelings, resiliency, etc. I guarantee your students will find groups much more meaningful and enjoyable with this active approach."},{"rating":"1","title":"You Must Be Young to Have a Use for This Book","review":"This book does not contain any usefull team building exercises for adults.

It *might* be O.K. for elementary/jr high students, but adults will have to look elsewhere!"},{"rating":"2","title":"No more dripping!","review":"I don't know how this copper core line performs better than the other All Clad lines - I got this because of the flared lip along the rim and you know what, no more dripping from now on!I am not sure why All Clad doesn't make the flared lip available in the other All Clad lines."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful but ??","review":"This pan is great for searing a piece of protien, then deglazing.That said, I have several beautiful new All-Clad pans, including this one. They are almost works of art. Although they look spectacular and work great, they are very time consuming to clean well after use. They arrive almost jewel-like and it's tempting to try to keep them that way.Unless someone else is cleaning the pan for you, I'd seriously think about buying something in heavy nonstick aluminum that costs 25% as much but is 95% as functional. Think of those beaten-up, dull aluminum pots you see in restaurants, thrown around and stacked like the utensils they truly are."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deceived","review":"The title of this book is highly deceptive. If you are look for theory of ceremonial/ritual magic or even a book of rituals to perform this is not the one. I was completely put off by Waite's ridcule of much of what his own order (the Golden Dawn) teaches. I'm am not sure why he writes this book from the skeptic's point of view and like the Rider-Waite tarot he created, Waite leaves out critical information in every section, probably choosing to honor his vow of secrecy with the Golden Dawn. Maybe an advanced adept could fill in the blanks, but I don't have that kind of experience.In short if you are less then an adept and need accurate information without the secrecy/skeptic run around look somewhere else. The book is still interesting from a historic stand point earning him two star for the effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"ERRANOUS!","review":"If you take this book, and compare it to the works of Regardie, Crowley, or D.M. Kraig, you will see that it is riddled with errors. The information begoten by, and then expounded by, Waite in this book is what was fed to him in order to deter is efforts. Had he been given the real rituals, he wouldn't have slammed them so hard. Kinda' like his tarot deck, the symbolism is way off, why? He didn't know any better. 2 stars because it's a godd example of what NOT to do."},{"rating":"2","title":"WWE Classic Superstar: Brutus The Barber Beefcake","review":"As always, Jakks never cease to amaze us with yet another great classic superstar figure. To begin with, the best thing about this figure is the face and hair. Jakks could not have done a better job with that because this looks perfect with the big smile, and flat top looking hair. Another great feature on this figure is his pink and white jacket. This jacket comes with the fish net shapes cut out. His pants are the same color as his jacket. This figure is finally complete with a pair of scissors. I forgot to mention the this figure also comes witha little bow tie thing on his neck. Great figure, but I did not like Beefcake as a wrestler because he was always interested in cutting someones hair rather than concentrating on his opponent. Buy it, because it is the most complete figure out there (meaning it has everything)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adorable, but didn't keep my kids' attention","review":"My girls received this Abby Cadabby doll when they were 2.5 years old. It's such a cute doll and has a number of sayings and a fun song, but it didn't keep their attention. They played with it for the first day or two and has been sitting abandoned in a toy box since they (they're 3 now). They don't watch Sesame Street so that may explain why they weren't very interested. I think if your child watches Sesame Street, therefore is more familiar with the character, they may like the toy more. I rated \\"fun\\" a 3 because it didn't hold my girls' attention and \\"educational value\\" a 1, because I don't think there's many learning opportunities with this toy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute toy for a little girl!","review":"We have not watched the DVD yet, but the toy itself is very cute. It's a toy I don't mind my 2 1/2 year old playing with because it's not so annoying! Some of her toys (especially ones from her grandmother) are very loud - with no volume control - and it's enough to drive you crazy. This isn't so bad, plus it's very detailed and cute! Another plus for her and I is that it's small/medium in size, so it's easy for her to hold and play with, sometimes fall asleep in the car with. Storing the toy is easy as well, since it's small. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"very cute!","review":"We got this Abby Cadabby for our daugther for Valentine's Day. She liked it immediately! (Most new things she has to warm up to.) She hugs her and can now squeeze her enough to get her to sing. The doll's voice is a little annoying, but she's still cute. I wish that it didn't have to cycle through to get to a new phrase. She does say several things, but always starts with the same one. She is a little smaller than I thought, but that makes her easier for my 13 month old to carry. The DVD is pretty cute too. It was worth the $ to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"I ordered the Abby Cadabby doll as a gift for my niece for Christmas and thankfully I ordered it early. It came in a Fiber One Brownie box for starters and the box was damaged. I opened the box to find a used doll that has numerous rips and tears in it and there was no DVD with it. The images on the site of a doll in a box is not what you will receive. I have ordered various items from Amazon over the years and have never had a poor experience until now. I contacted Amazon and the seller and am waiting to hear back from them as to how they will handle the situation. This was a very disappointing experience and I do not recommend this seller to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"A glimpse into the last days of the GDR","review":"This is a great movie that offers a fascinating glimpse into the last days of the GDR regime. The DVD also contains a lot of very informative documentaries and interviews on this historical period."},{"rating":"1","title":"slow and boring","review":"This movie was interesting for the first 15-30 minutes. After that, I began to wonder why I should care about these characters. It was so-oo-oo slow!!I will say that it did provide some insight into what life in East Germany was like. But it was one view, only. There was no attempt to provide any variation or a larger view outside of the main character's life.The most interesting part of the movie for me was the disintegration of the main character's marriage. To me, that made the most sense since I found the ranting angst of the architects to be rather thin and repetitive."},{"rating":"1","title":"lid will burn your fingers","review":"I received this pan as a Christmas gift. It is just the size I needed and I've used it several times. It's a nice pan, but I can't imagine why All-Clad used a metal lid handle with no effort to insulate it. It WILL burn your fingers when you open the lid to stir. My Farberware and Revereware pans, purchased in 1977, have insulated lid handles. For the price of this pan, I would not expect to LOSE a significant feature.I researched a solution and ended up purchasing some silicon lid handles. They are big, and detract from the nice look of this pan. I think that if All-Clad couldn't find a way to properly engineer their lids, it would cost them maybe a dollar to include a silicon handle cover that looks better on the pan than the oversized ones I was able to find.I did call All-Clad about this, they told me that the lids are metal so of course they will get hot. They took my information 'for the files'."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coppercore","review":"I at first thought Coppercore was just a gimmick, with the gratuitous rim of exposed copper around the base, but I was wrong--this line is great: much heavier than their other lines, and, for what it's worth, attractive too.

The author clearly had a point he wanted to prove, and he was willing to bend his data in whatever way was necessary in order to make that point. Unless you're a fan of propaganda masquerading as analysis, avoid this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"magnifique","review":"The story is well done, beautifully portrayed by the 2 leading actresses. I loved the background music, and I thought it added to the sensuality of the film. I could not keep my eyes away from the 2 actresses, one for her sheer beauty, and the other for enigmatic and playful presence. Just beautiful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very romantic!","review":"The actors were great in this film. There were many moments where the characters displayed their emotions through body language and facial expressions without a lot of dialogue. It's not often that movies of this genre challenge traditional paradigms and I think the movie does a good job of dealing with various issues. Great film!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good . . . but the sound track was sooo distracting.","review":"This is a good movie. The plot can be summarized as: married woman meets lesbian leading to a romantic love affair followed by difficult decisions and a happy ending, at least for the women. Problem: the music is soooooo distracting. I was watching this with my partner and the music would make us giggle and wonder aloud \\"Do French people truly have such bad taste in music, or is it just this film?\\" The problem is that this movie is supposed to be a drama, and we were giggling half the time at the sound track. The movie would have a bigger impact if the dramatic tone wasn't constantly interrupted by horrible Euro Pop music."},{"rating":"1","title":"i want my money back","review":"i bought this after reading everyone elses reviews and i was greatly disappointed. the subtitles didn't bother me as much as the BAD acting.

The pictures have been redone and are brighter and clearer.Plus there are many new toothpicks and pictures for some that were just drawings in the first book. There is also a new contempory toothpick section and a section on foreign toothpicks.I think the authors would have a grandslam if they would of expanded the section on newer reprodutions by the newer companiesand included information on how to rate the condition and how the condition affects value. Great must own for toothpick collectors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Toothpick Mecca!","review":"This is a very exciting book for anyone who collects glass toothpick holders. I was impressed by how easy it is to look things up and the pictures are plentiful and good quality. It is a definitely MUST have for anyone who collects glass items. When purchasing this book, the one thing you do have to keep in mind is that there is not a lot of coverage of repros and new toothpick holders (such as the ones frequently found on eBay for lower prices) Mainly, this is a reference for true antique pieces from the late 19th and early 20th century. Keep that in mind and enjoy this fabulous book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing but problems","review":"I received this iPod shuffle for Valentine's Day. By mid-March, I was experiencing problems charging it (it would no longer charge). This was purchased with a warranty, so I was able to get a replacement shuffle by late March. In mid-April, my second shuffle broke as well; if I attempted to use the forward or backward buttons, it would turn the iPod off completely. Or, it would play a song for about 20 seconds, then turn off completely. Highly annoying and frustrating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excelent, while it works","review":"Lasted less than a year. I really enjoyed it, due to it's low weight. There is lots of people complaining and no answer from Apple.

It's small, can be charged directly on the USB of my computer, and it holds a lot of songs.The only thing we don't like is that you can only download songs from one source (library).

I don't think this is operator error, but I could be wrong.All in all, it's fabulous - great sound quality!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It is like part of me!","review":"Ok, I got this as gift so I got nothing to lose right! Well, this little gadget will be my first open door to the ipod world and i gotta say that it really gives me an awsome impression toward what apple has accomplished for ipod shuffle.Ever since I unpacked this little thing, it has been with me everywhere! On the go, exercise, sleeping....anywhere you have pockets to put it, ipod shuffle is always with me whenever I needed some kick of tunes, its ultra light and portability has really achieved what it meant to accomplish in the first place and talking about 1 GB of stores mp3 for about 16 hrs of playtime, it is just too hard not to fall in love with this little part of me...lol! Sound quality is decent too and it is quite easy to charge and transfer/update tunes on the go.

The fact that Apple licenses the hell out of this fact is sickening. People don't want to hear some random song. They want to have an mp3 player that let's you choose a song from a menu. Every mp3 player has a shuffle feature. You don't buy an mp3 player specifically to use a shuffle feature.The Creative MUVO on the other hand has a screen, supports WMA's and works with more than one music program, FM radio and recording, cooler looking, and cheaper.Anyone who actually praises this over the MUVO is an idiot, plain and simple."},{"rating":"1","title":"This thing is crap","review":"No LCD, no ability to pick what you want to listen to and an crazy high price for something so feature devoid.

They are actually advertising and using the fact that you don't know what you are going to hear next as a selling point. Oh, the revolution of shuffle.Granted, this is a product oriented for people looking for a non hard drive/ flash based player, but in the end, it's just another way for apple to grab your money.

I'd even go so far as to say I loved the shuffle. Up until the day it stopped working...13 months of bliss only to reside in a landfill. There appears to be a defect with this product that Apple doesn't seem to acknowledge. Basically it stops playing music, computers refuse to recognize the USB device, and any button pressed on the shuffle results in blinking green/amber lights. For more information on the problem see: discussions.apple.com/forum.jspa?forumID=823. 400+ complaints of broken shuffles.Luckily I had an extended warrenty on the device and replaced it with a 1G nano.It was quite the utilitarian product.

Sport training, metro and much more.The lack of a LCD screen ? It is disturbing for about 10 seconds. Think about it : a one line LCD screen (about all you could fit on this tiny tiny iPod) would only show the current song, and I'm sure you know you library song when you hear them.iPod 'classic' idea is to bring your entire music library with you.

Despite the obvious visual design flair of the shuffle form factor for which Apple is famous, this is also an example of form over function. The lack of visual feedback (screen)is a stunningly poor ergonomic design choice...and one that is completely unnecessary. Potential buyers need to be aware that there are superior light weight flash memory mp3 players with screens, tactile buttons, and other features. And they are from mature companies who started making such players before the iPod was a gleam in Apple's eye. Somebody needs to say it. Despite Apple's legendary marketing hype, this is a very poor showing for their first generation flash memory player.

Weight is nothing.Using it as a USB flash disk works good too.The only things that annoy me about this are as follows:-Transfering music to it in iTunes is slow.-I can't play the music on the device when it's connect to another computer's USB port (playing off the device, not copying to the hard drive)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible design!","review":"Thank goodness for Apple they made a product designed well enough to get you just past a year (1-year warrenty) and then die.

The iMac's round mouse went against all we knew about ergonomics but it \\"looked cool\\". The ipod shufffle does it again: 240 songs that you will have to guess their name/artist/album because this little devil ain't telling you. Hey Steve, one thing is to \\"think out of the box\\" and come up with really clever solutions as you guys have done in the past, but selling a blind 1GB monster is going to go down the same alley that the eMate and the Cube went.

Don't buy this one.. keep looking. This player REQUIRES the use of iTunes meaning that one can't just drag and drop music into the player. This means installing this bulky virus/software and waiting for it load each time you want to monkey with your music. Also, you'll be forced to use only one computer to manage you music. This concept is completely dim-witted and annoying.My iPod Shuffle irreparably died after one year and one month - just one month after the warranty ended. I've heard similar horror stories so I know that I'm not the only one to have experienced this.Also, the player does not have simple, but vital, functions like \\"hold\\" or any kind of on-the-fly file management.Get something else that has drag-and-drop file management (sorry, that means non-Apple) and last longer than a year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vastly inferior to the Creative Zen Nano","review":"At the same $99 price point, the Creative Zen Nano has twice as much storage; a display screen; the ability to record via built-in microphone; the ability to play protected WMA files without converting to Apple's crappy AAC format, the ability to load MP3s directly into the machine without having to install Itunes, and the ability to tune in to FM broadcasts.

Its has no desplay, and has about 4 buttons. It's not worth it.This is perfect if you have a big ipod already, and need somthing alot more portable, for sports or somthing. But You should DEFINETLY NOT get this for your only mp3 player.I would suggest saving only $50 more to get an ipod mini, to hold 4 times that space, have a display, and a touch wheel. Cummon, they are only $200 bucks,(amazon is actually having a sale for even cheaper,) they look cooler, and you still don't even know it are in your pocket.Unless you are using this for sprts and have a big iPod already, dont get this.

I wore the shuffle around my next with headsets in my pocket and they never set up the myriad of security alarms and the batteries lasted forever! On the return trip I discovered I hadn't shut if off, charged it from my laptop and still managed to use it 99% (watched a movies the other 1%) of the flight and there was still battery left for the additional 3 hours to get home from JFK. I let Itunes pick the songs and then eyeballed the ones it selected and changed the ones I knew I didn't want.

My device, for no apparent reason started blinking orange and green and would not play. Apple recommends resetting and or updating to restore. Go to Google and see for yourself the growing number of complaints of cases where the latest iPod Updater will not restore the Shuffle, and although the device will charge, it fails to mount. I strongly recommend checking the return policy before purchasing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible value, a piece of garbage","review":"I got my first iPod Shuffle about a year ago (8/05). It lasted til the following May, and then started to act weird. The lights would flash, and it would crash my computer, but wouldn't play music. Took it to the Apple store, they said bad flash memory was the culprit and replaced it under warranty. The new unit lasted a few months, and then it also bit the dust, in the exact same fashion as the first one. I'm gentle on my iPod, never dropped it, left in the hot car, etc...and yet they both have died on me.I'd recommend the Creative Zen Nano. It's cheaper, much easier to add songs to (no iTunes required), and has a small screen that makes it more navigable, not to mention an integrated voice recorder and FM tuner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome, but not Grand","review":"The fact that it can hold data like a jump drive was one of the main reasons I bought this thing.The only con I have about the suffle is that it has a small pause between songs which ruines the flow of my \\"en concert\\" type of albums i put in this thing.

At that appointment, the \\"genius\\" said he couldn't fix it, and because he said he didn't know anything about engineering he couldn't say whether the shuffle was not working because of a software or a hardware problem or both. Apparently being an Apple \\"genius\\" doesn't involve understanding how things work, though it does appear to require having a trendy haircut.

I borrowed a copy from a friend, excited to hear the music alone that accompanied one of the best films ever made.Unfortunately, this soundtrack did not hold up to the magic of the film. This CD made me want to throw out my copies of my favorite film, just so that I wouldn't have to hear that horrible noise again. It didn't compliment the highs and lows of the film and listening to this score, I really couldn't recall the perfection and beauty of the film.I do NOT recommend this soundtrack... if you want to hear the music, just watch the film.

This book is just god-awful. His summary that this book has the soul of a PowerPoint presentation is perfect.It's clumsy and boring. It's packed with errors and suppositions.It has no detail for the Hobbit timeline, which might have been worthwhile.It has a ridiculous preface claiming that the book will \\"become a \`must have' for all serious Tolkien fans.\\" The kicker is that this preface is written by the author himself. Laughable. (The Amazon page for this book actually includes this entire preface as part of the book description. Check it out. Note too the author's pleading of the book's various supposed virtues.

Then there was Peter Jackson's epic retelling of the story on the big screen, yet another master at work. Which all leads to Michael Perry's painstaking and well thought out chronology of Tolkien's works. A difficult task to be sure but accomplished all the same. As the author mentions in his preface, this book is a reference book first and foremost but it truly does \\"untangle\\" the time line of the story.

It was the old product which uses different ingredients than this new one for the same thing.Anyway, I got the newer version of the product, which I did not care for.

Nonetheless, I can read and the overt problem with this book is that it's just a mishmash of factoids here / there, which is not the basic ingredients for a lucid / coherent book. Thus although many may be impressed with all of the minutia of detail, it rather has the opposite effect on me; If I'm going to put in the time to read/ learn about a certain topic, I think it's reasonable to expect that the author the present a coherent / logical narrative rather than million bits of information.2.

Second, they are so blemished and uneven that they don't even look like real pearls. Third, there is no clasp in the back. The pearls are strung on a rigid wire that will hold itself closed unless the necklace is tugged on by children, pets, etc.I gave the necklace two stars instead of one because it appears to be well constructed and could conceivably be worn for an occasion that calls for tacky orange pearls. Maybe a Marge Simpson costume?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mellow Yellow","review":"This choker seems well made, but there is a lot of inconsistency in the color and shape of the pearls.

Finally, when their CD came out, I was anxious to hear what other sounds they bring. I bought it and was amazed by how talented they were! I couldn't stop listening to it! The first song on their CD is called \\"One Time\\". This song gets you hooked on Earthsuit and introduces you to their sound.

I first heard of them in 7-ball magazine and loved reading about their stories of ministry on Bourbon Street. Their music is hard to describe. It was like DcTalk and POD infused. The balance of styles are great. There is some hard vocals but melodic choruses and smooth vocals combined with varied styles makes Earthsuit a stand apart pick. Their lyrics reflect a genuine walk with Christ and those who do not care about lyrics, Earthsuit will plainly say, \\"..you are what you behold\\". They are straight forward without being cheesy with cliches. If you are a fan of pop or hardcore and are willing to be stretched in your musical style pick up earthsuit. And continue to let the Father, \\" fill you \\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Who says Christian music doesn't compare with secular?","review":"This CD is incredible. I got a chance to see them live at Cornerstone and immediately fell in love with their music. They have a unique style that testifies with their outstanding faith.

The best description I can muster is techno-electronica rapcore with reggae influences.Earthsuit is a Christian band, although depending on the song you might never know. Knowing that does bring out the deeper meaning of many of the songs, but truly the music can be enjoyed for itself.This CD is one of my favorites - one of the best music purchases I've made in a long time. This would make a great soundtrack for a party. It is easily as good musically as anything in the mainstream market. I have no reservations - buy this CD now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Earthsuit has a Sound All Their Own","review":"Kaleidoscope Superior, the debut album from New Orleans band Earthsuit, is a virtual melting pot of musical styles. Combining, reggae, rap, rock and techno, the band achieves a sound that is very original. The five members of Earthsuit rock on tracks like \\"One Time\\",\\"Against the Grain\\", and \\"Schizophreniac\\"; but also show a softer side with \\"Whitehorse\\", \\"Do You Enjoy the Distortion\\", and \\"Said the Sun to the Shine\\".Altogether an impressive debut, Earthsuit looks to shake up the mold of contemporary christian music. Highly recommended CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Refreshing Difference from Boring Tradition","review":"Earthsuit breaks barriers that most bands falsely boast of breaking.

Si A toda esa gente cerraba un ciclo del grupo, Tánger hace que comience uno nuevo.Grabado a caballo entre Madrid y la propia ciudad magrebí, este nuevo trabajo es fruto de la investigación y estudio de las diferentes culturas musicales que, desde sus comienzos, ha centrado la base de la trayectoria musical de Medina Azahara. Son las raíces árabes, andaluzas y magrebíes las que, en mezcla perfecta con la vanguardia del rock, conforman la base de la música de fusión que siempre ha caracterizado al grupo. Estos son los temas del álbum:Danza al Viento, Como un sueño, Un instante junto a ti, Solo un camino, Regalarte una estrella, El lento atardecer, Confusión y realidad, Cuando se pierde el amor, Loco por ti, Deja de llorar, Tiempo de Abril, Solamente mía y Miénteme.El álbum ha sido disco de oro."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute and squishy.","review":"The fabric it's made out of is nice, furry and soft like a Korean Mink blanket. It's head is squishy which makes it very huggable. I love the way it's arms all curl up and it has a cute, little beak too.The only compliant, I guess you could say, about the product is there are some weird melted pieces of plastic stuck on the fabric that you have to pull out.

The lid is not heavy enough to contain the boiling water. It spewed starchy water a foot from the cooker, creating an awful mess. And the rice was gummy and burned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Large Quantities Only","review":"The cooker works well for me, even with Basmati rice, but the smallest unit it is set up for is four cups... which is a lot of rice for one person. Since they use a proprietary \\"cup\\" to measure things with (you put in 4 of their unit cups and then fill it the rest of the way up with water to the 4-cup line) it ends up making me a lot more rice than I need. It would've been nice if they'd provided some standard equivalency charts so we'd know what the ratio is. So I'm going to have to go through the hassle of measuring the water by straining it back out, then figuring out what ratio they're employing. Wouldn't it have been easier to just SAY the ratio? Maybe it won't work right with 2 cups? I dunno, I just know that I bought it because I tend to forget and leave it on too long. This was supposed to make things easier. If I was cooking for a family, maybe... If it's just 1 or 2 people, get a smaller one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to the Farberware reputation!","review":"I have owned this product for just over a year now. I bought it to simplify cooking rice. This product did not help. The rice always seems to burn. Today I used shortening on the bottom of the pan before adding the rice and water. It worked. The rice did not stick to the bottom... first time for this. It still started to burn. I caught it at just the right time to save it. Also as others have noted the cover is not heavy enough to prevent starchy water from spewing all over. I've conquered this by placing an upside down coffee mug over the handle. It adds enough weight to keep it from splashing everywhere. All in all I would suggest you look for a better made product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great planted aquarium reference","review":"I think this is one of the most useful books I have seen on aquarium plants and the planted aquarium. It is well organized, offers great planting and maintenance advice, and I refer to it frequently.

The cleanup is so easy and since NOTHING sticks to it, you don't have those little crusty black things that refuse to come out, sticking to the bottom of the pan. (I think those are scratches in the teflon.) Anyway, after getting rid of QVC's Cook's Essentials because of the Teflon flaking off after 2 months, I decided to get something that was worth my money.

You basically have choice between too green or too red. I had to really soften and minus the colors and tint so I could have a picture that doesn't make all the programs look like animated cartoons. There is no temperature control and the blue is very intense and looks like it's separate from the rest of the image.On top of that the remote is very unpleasant in your hand, non-intuitive and have some of the important buttons in subtle orange.

Shattered lands is just as playable as it was when it first came out. In comparison it looks and plays alot like the more modern baldur's gate PC games.Another big plus is that compatibility with newer PCs doesn't seem to be a problem.

The next morning at 6:00 am, the bed shook violently like a motel's magic fingures and was accompanied by the loudest alarm I have ever heard. Thank the gods that I was already out of bed because the girl had jumped out of bed screaming and throwing things.

Of course, Paul (who wrote the review below) is correct: atrocities were committed by both sides. However, now in South Korea there is a trend to emphasize the crimes of the \`UN' side, while the similar deeds of the Communist side are seldom if ever mentioned. The book brings balance. I wonder whether it is going to be translated to Korean. Perhaps, not: the nationalist and increasingly anti-American Left which dominates the Korean politics now, does not want this part of the truth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Information, but Too Bias","review":"Good information and the general feeling felt during the Korean War, but I found it too bias. War crimes wasn't only on the part of China and North Korean, Americans made war crimes too. Like one incident couple of American troops slaughtered South Korean civillians under a bridge. This author has comfortably forgotten the misdeeds of Americans."},{"rating":"1","title":"War crime???","review":"A couple of million Korean people (civilians) were killed during the war mostly by US bombing. What would you call this killing? Those Korean killed are as precious as those American and UN soldiers who perished in Korea to their parents, brothers and friends.

Ma's treatment of Bach's cello suite no. 2 is emotional; Piranesi's drawing are cerebral. The combination is moving and thought-provoking. The video, like the others in this interesting series, is best viewed as a part of the series. Viewers will inevitably like some of Ma's ideas, and the execution of those ideas, better than others--but this is one of my favorites from the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Sound of Reverb","review":"This film tackles the no-so-intriguing question of how Bach's Second Cello Suite would sound in the physical context of Piranesi's Carceri (prison), assuming that it had been built in the first place. The \\"deeper\\" questions, as hinted in the film, probe the philosophical nature of experience and perception. Regrettably, such questions are never clearly framed, let alone answered. The video brims with pseudo-intellectual musings which, in practice, boil down to the central issue of how much reverberation to use for the final take.For what it's worth, some of the computer graphics are interesting. You get to see Yo-Yo playing in a digitally realized 18th-century building, all nicely done in black and white. Just don't expect too much more than that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inspired by Piranesi, not by Bach","review":"This film is inspired by Piranesi, who left us with etchings of the Carceri (prison). The inspiration is: if we build a virtual Carceri based on the etchings, and record a piece of music (in this case, it is Ma playing Bach's Second Suite for Unaccompanied Cello) there, what would the sonic effect be?The important thing here is the virtual realisation of 2-D drawings into a 3D structure and the recording of music there. Who plays who's what music is relatively unimportant. For example, there is no reason why Ma can't instead play the Third Suite or a Piazolla tango piece in the prison!I can't see what the film has got to do with \\"inspired by Bach\\".Actually, a viewer can ask even more critical questions: Why Piranesi? What's so special about the Carceri etchings? I don't think the film offers convincing answers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a bad figure","review":"A nice figure to have next to the Iron Shiek figure if you had gotten him as well.

The book opens up with exquisite beauty. Bradfield is a world-class writer possessing a full array of literary talent. I'm talking Denis Johnson-esque here.2. There are moments of dialogue between the main character and one of his friends (I think it was a girl) that's just totally whacked out. Their conversation is very high-leveled -- philosophical and highly intellectual. Totally out of sync with the real world as we know it, yet totally in sync within Brafield's world.I recommend this book wholeheartedly.

The hot plate peeled and therefore the pot always stuck to the burner. Within a year it just stopped working. We thought that it was a fluke and bought another and had the EXACT SAME PROBLEMS AGAIN!! Again, it leaked immediatly, constantly. This one did not even last 6 months! At $60.00 a pop I will not buy this brand again. I hope someone else comes out with one. Don't waste your money.

I really liked the machine because it brewed delicious coffee, (and I already had holes in my cabinets from mounting it), so I went out and bought another. (No, I didn't save the original receipt.) My second pot lasted six months before it too began leaking all over the counter.

His world is fascinating and incredible.Being a fine-arts person, I would like to sat a few words about the books themselves. They are laid out beautifully, with a quick synopsis of each canto before it starts, followed by the text itself in Italian and English on facing pages, followed by copious notes on the text (including alternative interpretations on occasion).

Also, the menu bars are poorly done as they are not word based, but picture based, which is confusing as the pictures do not always make sense and watch out if you don't immediately know what a picture is supposed to mean, you'll spend the next half hour trying to find what you were really looking for.

I found it narrow-minded and boring. Johnson seems bent on interpreting all of philosophy according to his lame, psuedo-scientific theory of metaphor, and the result leaves much to be desired in the way of actual explanation.

Thankfully, I got my money back for the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simplistic and over-burdened by reification of Science","review":"Johnson's attempt to \\"turn philosophy on its face\\" is little more than the return of a very old argument, only now with the benefit of new discoveries in cognitive-science which, we are to believe, give this disguised argument new cogency and import. Johnson's argument is based on a reification of science, where the principles derived from empirical evidence shall color our ethics, philosophy, etc. The problem is that the principles don't necessarily flow from the data. Johnson, in an effort to establish himself , has jumped, and now must hold on, whatever the truth. The book is pretentious, overbearing, and shallow, and its overarching treatment and recasting of all philosophy, from Kant to Chomsky, reeks of sophistication (in the older Greek sense, i.e., sophistry)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Omission of Nietzsche","review":"It is not possible to deal properly with such a subject by using Kant, leaving out Nietzsche and the selfish gene of Dawkins.

This fulfills what was promised in those earlier works. My only disappointment so far (I've skipped around)was the short shrift they gave to the later Wittgenstein. What Lakoff and Johnson have in breadth, I think Wittgenstein will add much depth. As a matter of fact, I plan to use this book to organize ideas about Wittgenstein's later work. I understand why the authors may not have wished to say much about Wittgenstein, as everybody sees a different Wittgenstein: Mind and World by McDowell, Truth and Objectivity by Crispin Wright, etc. I still feel an authentic Wittgenstein can be found, and the Lakoff and Johnson will be a great help in finding him. If anyone is interested in exchanging insights, I am thirsty for conversation.

But I think the biggest omission is the late Freud, whose concept of a \\"bodily ego\\" is remarkably similar to the views presented here.

Before these authors, the father of psychoanalysis was the only thinker to take seriously the metaphorical nature of thought.

I found the authors making strong claims with little academic skill at supporting them. There are no footnotes. It is an easy read and simple presentation that, to me, greatly lacks the necessary clarifications and references to consider this a scholarly work of merit. It is full of great ideas, yes. But, throughout most the book you must either take their word for it or find another book. I would love to see this book and their ideas presented in a more careful and convincing manner."},{"rating":"1","title":"An adventerous journey in the world of imagination","review":"The book is very well written and it presents the topic in extreme clarity with only one problem; it doesn't relate what it says to reality. The author keeps mentioning research findings without referencing any particular findings and arrives at conclusions without informing the reader of how these conclusions have been arrived at. The author doesn't even he justify how credible or well established are the research findings on which it is based. This makes the book seem closer to science fiction than science in other words too perfect to be believable; simply the closer a science is to reality the more uncertain it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wee Sing Animal Songs","review":"My son loves all the animal songs on this tape.

I think Ms. Brown should just write a book on foxhunting, as such, and get it out of her system.The story, presumably being the murder mystery, is ho-hum.

I also thought that if she was going to have dialogue from the animals, they should have at least played a part in solving the mystery."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Fox is not killed!","review":"Read the entire series.

Interaction between animals is, of course, quite enlightening."},{"rating":"2","title":"A refreshing read","review":"There's been a lengthy review, so I'll keep it short. This book was a pleasure to read, with a casual air that pulls one along. As a beginning fencer, the presentation of a knowledgeable fencer speaking to a non-fencing group, providing a simple (but progressively deeper) overview of the art/sport/skill over a series of evening talks, met my needs wonderfully. Even so, it is clear that some of the topics (this book was written almost 150 years ago) are apparently still being debated in contemporary fencing. This book was a clever and refreshing break from some of the \\"heavier\\" fencing literature I have been reading. I would have to believe that the more you know of fencing, the more you will get from this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great watch, but not enough diamonds!","review":"Not enough diamonds!

It wasn't worth the effort to return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Too Informative...","review":"I feel as though this book could have given more information about JK Rowling. Only about two of the chapters were about her life in general, the rest of the book was basically about the Harry Potter series and the fame the books are reciving. These other chapters really are of no use to people who want to learn about Rowling's life, it's basically about her writing. Maybe someone who hasn't read the Harry Potter books would find the entire book interesting.

The powder is super fine and dissolves instantly. It has a faint grassy taste. I don't get why people complain about the taste because it's very mild compared to fresh wheatgrass, almost refreshing. Just add more water if it's too strong for you. It has wheatgrass, barleygrass and kelp to boot, so you're really getting all the nutrients the body needs. Wheatgrass has more chlorophyll while barley has more vitamins so you're getting the best of both worlds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yummy seaweed greens are really good for you!","review":"Awesome product for energy and all around wellness.

Focusing primarily on cultural mores, he delves into subject matter that is by nature impossible to review objectively. Buruma's gift is his ability to write candidly and artfully about cultural generalizations that his trained eye has noticed. Certainly the sexual culture of any nation is difficult to fully discuss in a slim volume, but Buruma's discussions of pop culture and myths is always intriguing. He offers few judgements and challenges the reader with provocative observations. David R. Bannon, Ph.D.; author \\"Race Against Evil.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Missy","review":"Very disappointed.

The reader who does not have any idea about the levels of heroic achievements that the Wehrmacht individuals made, will be surprised to say the least. The Germans had a different view toward medals, prefering to honor the great scores or the unique records in order to produce idols for the youth, in a similar way that modern athletes do their utmost for medals and victories. Germans also had the habit to wear their decorations all the time, even in the heat of battle! In the process they produced the most specatcular fighter, submarine and tank aces, as well as scores of daring commandos, paratroopers and brave officers.

This song showcases the power of Andy Stewart's voice. It also shows his talent at staging a drama that sounds raw and inescapable, yet is somehow made bearable through the use of strikingly telling metaphors.Other songs on this album are worth their salt: If I Was a Blackbird is a classic of Celtic music and a favorite of mine. I like the rendition here. Hame,Hame,Hame is a wonderful song, followed by a lovely melody (Tha Mi Sgith=I'm tired) that speaks less of green fields than it does of introspection and internal landscapes, as the title suggests.The other instrumentals are also very good. A little less daring/modern than in 'A Gling of Silver,' but still masterfully executed. A powerful album, just as illustrated by the sun setting on the loch (on the cover) and the name it sports."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"I feel like I just heard real Scottish music for the first time. The singer has an incredible voice and when he sings you can't help but feel like this is what the real songs of the highlands sound like.

Pretty expensive, but it may be worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Basil Is No Miserable Here!!","review":"When original composer Gabriel Yared went out of the picture, Basil Poledouris stepped in. Probably he had little time to compose the score for Bille August's film adaptation of Victor Hugo's masterpiece \\"Les Miserables\\", but Poledouris managed to create what in my opinion is one of his best works.The main theme -as heard first on 'Valjean's Journey' -is truly inspiring in spite that it's reminiscent of the main march from \\"Starship Troopers\\". However, in here, it has much more dramatic impact as it is very touching. There is also a secondary theme heard in the final minutes of 'Vigau', but widely used in 'The Barricades'; this piece of music sounds very minimalist as seven notes are repeated a lot, but it is truly epic in fashion.This is perhaps one of Basil Poledouris' classics, at the same level of \\"Conan The Barbarian\\", \\"Robocop\\", and \\"The Hunt For Red October\\". A true gem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Underrated & Enjoyable score","review":"I received this score when for my birthday several years ago, and I enjoyed it from the beginning. There are only 7 tracks on this cd, but most are over 10 minutes in length, which gives this cd an almost 50 minute run time. From the dark sweeping melody of the first track to the poingnant finale, Les Miserables is a fine score. It is probably my favorite Basil Polodouris score. I don't always like his music, but this is one that I totally enjoy. Perhaps because the movie was not a big commercial success or because there were other incredible scores in 1998, Les Miserables has been overlooked, but it is a must have for any soundtrack collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful CD, with a bad track layout","review":"This is one of the better CDs in my collection. I bought it specifically because I like Basil Poledouris's music, and haven't actually seen the film it was written for. I feel that this warrants a higher rating than four stars, but less than five, due to the way the tracks are organized.If you like Basil's prior works, then you will almost certainly like this one. It's not as good as Conan the Barbarian, but what is?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Try listening to Glasgow Peggy","review":"Glasgow Peggy is just a great song, and reason enough to buy the CD so I suggest giving it a try.

All the traps concerning the performance of these symphonies, including structure, tempi, balance, orchestration, phrasing and articulation are all discussed. Humorous anecdotes are also included.

That's my advice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only for collectors and/ or Poe fans","review":"I got more than 35 Lou/VU albums and have been listening to Lou for 15 years now, so I bought the long version of this new album, featuring all the text read out by W.Dafoe etc.. Unfortunately, based on magazine reviews I had thought the album contained one CD with music, one CD with readings - this is not the case. My resume is that if you're not a collector or a Poe fan, go fo the single CD, which contains all the songs without the poetry readings. I have never read Poe and do not like listening to poetry or literature being read out - don't misunderstand me, I love poetry and literature, but I prefer reading it myself. It is annyoing waiting for the songs in between the poetry readings, and the skip button is the first thing you'll use.As usual, the songs, the lyrics and the crystal clear sound are great... but if you want these, go for the single CD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Lou's Best Work","review":"The second track is about the only good one... but it consists mostly of repetition of the lyric \\"Edgar *** Allen *** Poe .......not exactly the boy next door\\". Which is actually kind of cool- just don't expect a normal thematic, story-like Lou Reed experience. You have to be able to go waay out there to really love this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Lou Reed guy is pretty good, but he talks too much!","review":"My butcher told me to get this new Lou Reed album. It's all right, but the guy (Lou Reed, not my butcher) talks a lot instead of singing. I'd never heard a Lou Reed album before, but he was great in the cool 80's movie \\"Get Crazy\\" and those moped commercials, so I was surprised it wasn't more...you know, rockin.' It's almost like he's afraid to sing or something. He has a couple of famous people guest-starring, kind of like Santana, except Reed's guests, like their host, just talk a lot and don't even try to carry a tune. David Bowie is on here, but if you're expecting \\"Modern Love\\" or \\"Blue Jean,\\" you will be disappointed. Apparently this album is all about Edgar Allan Poe, which is all right if you're into literature and whatnot, but I would have preferred a little less PBS, and a little more rock and roll. I don't know why my butcher is so into this talky stuff. More singing next time, Mr. Reed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ooo my head","review":"Lou Reed's genius, in my opinion, is his ability to make music of his emotional honesty and humility. His demon is his pretension to be otherwise, as in \\"literary,\\" \\"theatrical,\\" andwhateveradjectivegoeswith \\"film.\\" The more words you hear coming out of his mouth, the more words he uses to describe his album, the more abstract the album will invariably be--and the less listenable. Ergo the ridiculousness of \\"Magic & Loss\\" and the failures of \\"New York\\" (amid the successes), on one hand, and the grandness of \\"Coney Island Baby,\\" the openness of \\"The Blue Mask\\" and \\"Legendary Hearts,\\" and the poignancy of individual songs like 'Billy' (\\"Sally Can't Dance\\") and 'Lisa Says' (\\"Lou Reed\\"), on the other. \\"The Raven\\" commits every error in the Lou Reed handbook and offers nothing compensatory, as far as I can tell. Two stars for craft? Yet there's not one memorable song on the thing . . . And what's with the sword??"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lou Reed is very cool","review":"Much of this panoramic record comes from collaboration with Robert Wilson. So it's much like those Tom Waits dual records from a year ago. But this combines dramatic readings by actors like Willem Dafoe and Amanda Plummer, and music inspired by Edgar Allen Poe, which Reed calls \\"the most classical of American Writers\\" and sees him in a tradition with William Burroughs and Hubert Selby. Even David Bowie and Ornette Coleman make appearances here, and Julian Schnabel does the artwork. Reed had to scour NYC for any notable figures with a Poe [prejudice]. Some highlights include Antony singing \\"Perfect Day\\" and Reed himself on \\"Who Am I?\\" Musically it's all over the place, combining jazz, rock and roll, and folk music. One of Reed's most listenable albums for a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great ambition, but the overflow of guests kill overall flow","review":"As an artist I totally respect Reed's decision in his career to create something so ambitious and full of various feeling. But really theres barely any vocal appearance of Reed on this album, and though Defoe, Anderson and Mr Pink do excellent dramatic readings i find myself wanting more out of Mr Reed's mouth. Plus the new version of \\"Perfect Day\\" took a full point off my review, there's no reason to stage a Poe-esque murder on your own creation, and I swore Tiny Tim passed away years ago-he seemingly posthumously appears here! overall an excellent idea, just that it leaves me a little empty..."},{"rating":"1","title":"an atrocity","review":"I don't even know where to begin.

I do wish I could confront him and just ask what exactly he thinks he is doing - maybe that would serve to explain this pap. Mediocre, dirge-like tunes offset by hideously pretentious lyrics and now and then disturbingly hammy readings by notable actors.

Highly, warmly and enthusiastically recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Throw in the sewer....","review":"When I first heard this CD I just could not stop laughing. Novaes plays the first etude about 1/4th of the speed and technique that Pollini does PLUS hits HUNDREDS of wrong notes, makes up some notes..... all with atrocious pedalling.Great so she can play a few nice slow nocturnes (this is all her technique could LET her play).... and even these she plays not entirely even. If she can't play these pieces evenly than I don't think she would have the technique to play chopsticks either.How she even got recorded is something I don't understand.This is an example of a fourth rate pianist somehow getting lucky (I suppose through networking, connections, legacy... though I could be wrong) and getting recorded.She desperately needs about 100 master classes from Pollini.Don't mistake listening to new pianists to \\"broadening your horizons.\\" This is not worthy of the rats in the New York subway system."},{"rating":"2","title":"Antidepressant","review":"I've had this album since I heard the group at the Frog Island Festival in Ypsilanti, MI. It's fabulous and timeless. I've worn out my tape and bought the CD today.The harmonies are breathtaking. The beat is compellingly dance-able. Fascinating accents. We know music effects mood. This album bestows an infectious sense of \\"All is well with the world, never mind whatever you're going through, come dance!\\" (which is amazing considering that Apartheid seemed an insurmountable evil during the height of this group's popularity in South Africa). My children even think this album is cool.It's a jewel in my music collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"VHS doesn't have host segments or end credits","review":"It's apples and oranges to compare the live version with the feature film. The narrative here is different - the main character is sober and telling his story in flashbacks at an AA meeting. I think it has less impact than the film, but no less interesting.The VHS tape looks good, and has 10 minutes of contemporary interviews. However, it's very disappointing that the VHS producers decided to edit the show and not include the Sterling Hayden host segments and end credits."},{"rating":"2","title":"Abstract Art's Virgil","review":"Motherwell was a superb writer in addition to being a painter. This anthology spans 1941-1988. It's a great read, not only for it's insights into art but also for capturing the flavour of the time. In a sense it let's you stand behind Motherwell's shoulder and peer into his thoughts and see how he viewed modern art both from a philosophical view point as well as aesthetic.A lot of it is drawn from his public writings and speeches but a lot is fairly personal in nature, taken from his journals.It's well annotated and useful if you're interested in the abstract movement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reality","review":"Been a fan since 1972, Have seen over 50 concerts.

Courtney Act is a \\"gender illusionist\\" who didn't make the top 12 of Australia Idol 1. Courtney Act as a visual experience is excellent but unforunately the visual energy he/she provides does not transfer to CD. Vocally it is weak, sounds over produced and is just another pop/dance track that anyone could do (and have probably have already done). As for the AC/DC cover version, You Shook Me All Night Long this is a song that again requires the visual aspect to appreciate the vocal performance.

The sponge twists off when you use it in a counter-clockwise direction, as lefties are apt to do, so I really can't use it.The description says that all you have to do to refill it is to twist the sponge. That's true, but to actually get more detergent into the handle, you also have to remove the sponge. So once you twist it, it comes away from the handle. For lefties like me this means a waste of time and detergent as well as a lot of annoyance.I emailed Oxo about this a month or so ago and never even received an acknowledgement. It's not an expensive item, so I'm ok with having spent the money, but I am very disappointed in Oxo's lack of response.So if you're right-handed, go for it. It's a nice kitchen tool.

Lee's final years","review":"It is good that someone write about Robert E. Lee's final years after the U.S. Civil War. Charles B. Flood has written a fitting summary of Lee's final years (1865-1870) from the surrender at Appomatax to his final years at Lexington, VA. Lee is portrayed as a silent, thoughtful, regretful, gentleman who may have chosen to rebel against his former army, but still is a proud and dignified man. Flood is to be commended in bringing out the characteristics of the private, distinguished gentleman that Lee was. From his dealings with his family to the students at Washington University, his thoughts, motivations and insights are given with honesty and clarity. This is the definitive work of the last quiet years of Robert E. Lee, and is highly recommended for all U.S. History/U.S. Civil War History enthusiasts."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fresh View of Lee","review":"This is a very interesting perspective on Robert E.

It features different combinations of groups from quartets to fourteen-piece esembles. The music cooking and hard-driving (Rosewood, Rashaan's Run), modal (Theme For Maxine), light-hearted (Every Time I See You). Woody was a brilliant composer and improviser. This album demonstrates that emphatically. Woody was the best trumpet player of his generation and he left us too soon. The solo from Joe Henderson on 'Theme for Maxine' is one his all-time greats - an added treat. On the CD, couple of bonus cuts are added from Woody III which are fine, but the material on Rosewood is definitely stronger."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding music from the late Woody Shaw","review":"As I wrote a few weeks ago Woody Shaw was in my opinion one the top ten trumpet players of all time.The musicians on this album were top rate veterans of the jazz scene at that time.The engineering in terms of refreshing the analog to digital was also first class.It's too bad that we lost Mr.Shaw at a young age.The great thing is we can buy all of the cds that he made over this relatively short time period as a leader and sideman.Of special note is the outstanding interplay between the bassists and percussionists on this album.Bottom line buy this cd.You won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Book is RIGHT ON","review":"You will not be disappointed in this resource.

Enough articulate comment has been made about Cordelia's Honor, so I will just add that I am ordering a new hardcover copy today, because my first paperback copy is now in tatters, and pages have gone missing from so many readings. The rest my Vorkosigan paperback collection is likewise in tatters, so they will also be replaced one-by-one with hardcover editions."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Read and A Great Beginning","review":"Lois McMaster Bujold sets us up with a kick ass heroine in Cordelia Naismith who is trying to survey what she thought was an uninhabited planet. Next thing we know, she is plunged into a battle with the forces of Barrayar and her life is completely changed. This is an excellent book that starts the reader down the path to the later Miles Vorkosigian novels. Bujold is a maaster of both love and war and this novel shows why science fiction when done right can rise to the level of the finest literature. Highly recommended. Read this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book","review":"Though it doesn't involve Miles directly (it's his parents this book is about), it doesn't lessen the experience at all. I was recommended to first read some books with Miles (in written chrono order) but I think it would be much better to read it in internal chronological order. It has recognizable style for those who already read Bujold, very interesting and non pretentious."},{"rating":"1","title":"Product of the times","review":"I didn't find this book very enjoyable. The romance seems quite forced, and the archaic gender roles are insufficiently self-aware. I understand this may simply be a factor of how old the book is, but regardless, I couldn't get into it. The plot is also fairly confusing after everyone leaves the first planet. Read to about 75% of the way through then put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"well written","review":"shards of honor is a very well written book i found while reading it that it pulls you in and makes you really feel for the characters. the use of imagery was excellent. all in all a good start to the saga."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, and worth it for the history","review":"Get this straight. This is not Miles's story. Thisis not Mark's story. This is the story of howtheir parents Arel & Cordelia met. More than anything, this is Cordelia's story.Shards of Honor is not written as well as the later books in the series. Surprise! The author is capable of improvement. It is, however a good space opera, a good love story, and a good read with a very appealing, tough, heroine. Knowing the character of Cordelia explains a lot about her influence on Barryarran society as it shows up in the later books in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great characters make a wonderful read.","review":"Prepare to be seduced by the fascinating characters and the wonderful writing in this highly recommended book. The quality worsmithing makes you want to reread every line, but the rapidly and easily flowing plot drags you madly along. If you have never read this writer (I hadn't) she is one of the gifted ones where you are drawn in the story and stay in the world till the end. This is an interesting universe, but you learn by seeing it, not being lectured about it. I have to admit I fell in love with both protagonists early on. If this was a movie, there would be clapping in the theater at the end.I gave it a 9 instead of 10 because there is much about the universe I did not find out, and also because the climax of the characters' lives is obviously still to come."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"I really do not understand all the rave reviews. I'm a sci-fi fan, and an avid reader. I am continually frustrated by seeing good reviews on sci-fi books that don't hold water. And this is a typical example. Maybe if sci-fi is all you read, then you seen things through a different lens than I do. I really tried to give this book a chance, but about half way through I kept thinking of a word---booooooring. My idea of good sci-fi? Orson Scott Card or Larry Niven. I see parallels between this series and the Twilight series. Big sellers, but one dimensional."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best, The First","review":"I was lucky in that when I discovered the writings of Lois McMaster Bujold, I read the first book in the Vorcosigan Series. For me it will always be the best. It needs to be read first to really understand the Vorcosigans and Barrayar itself. It is highly readable, the characters are \\"human\\" and personable. I was delighted when I realized that this was the first of a series of books and have eagerly awaited each edition to the family."},{"rating":"1","title":"SOME GOOD SONGS - NOT A KEEPER","review":"Humour Me is one of those cd's that you debate about keeping in your cd collection. Humour Me is, for the most part, a pleasant listening experience. The cd includes songs with a variety of tempos. Thus Humour Me does not have an overall sad theme, as some of Jesse's cds do. The artists who provide back-up instrumentation on this cd do an excellent job. Jesse's voice is stong and clear on Humour Me. Humour Me is a good choice if you are looking for background music. My personal preference is to only keep and listen to cd's that in some way continue to fascinate me. Humour Me does not provide me with the necessary fascination. Humour Me is best described as \\"mundane\\". Thus I'm not keeping Humour Me.John"},{"rating":"2","title":"Everyone should see this!","review":"It is completely unfathomable to me that this can happen in the United States. Very informative. The failure of the media to report without bias is disturbing to say the least."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of The Greatest Albums of the 1980s","review":"Andy Partridge of the seminal British Alternative rock band 'XTC' once said of the album \\"English Roundabout\\" that the songs were all \\"either too dark, too long, or unfinished\\". I truly believe that he was being far too critical of himself and this masterpiece of Alternative Rock.When I first bought the Import version of this album in 1982, it honestly did not leave my turntable for the next month! I had, to that point, only experienced a small handful of albums that moved me on so many different emotional levels. I could not get enough of it! To this day, some 29 years later, when I play this collection the songs sound just a fresh, polished, and unique today. These songs, in my humble opinion, have stood up very nicely to the test of time and is, perhaps, THE quintessential XTC album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"If Black Sea hooked me, this one secured me on the hook.

It's also one of those rare double-albums (though it fits on one CD) that doesn't feel bloated and self-indulgent. Pop/rock music doesn't get much better than this.And to whoever said, \\"Thank God they didn't become big stars,\\" I say, I agree, but I do wish they had had a bit more success and recognition; they deserved it, then and now. Too bad Andy couldn't get over his stage fright; if they had toured for just a few more years, they could have reached a wider audience . . . After all, it's not like they were Sonic Youth. XTC's music is almost all quite accessible; there's no reason it couldn't have made a much bigger splash on the radio."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best early XTC albums","review":"This is one of the finest early(or midperiod might be more accurate)XTC albums. Partridge & Moulding came into their own on this album. Almost all the songs are terrfic--there are a few clunkers from Andy, but they are redeemed by melody, arrangement, Andy's singing or all three.Hugh Padgham's production is a little dated sounding and, perhaps, a bit monochromatic in its overall tone. THE BIG EXPRESS would rectify this with a brighter sound and arrangements that would compliment the songs vs. hemming them in.Still, a terrific album--this is, for all intends and purposes, where Partridge & Moulding found their voices as songwriters and the band solidfied their sound.This sprawling 16 track collection would be their most comprehensive statement and most consistent work until THE BIG EXPRESS(a more varied album in terms of production and sound than this)."},{"rating":"2","title":"The masterpiece often overlooked.","review":"Forget that this recording contains one of the great pop singles of all time (\\"Senses Working Overtime\\"). Its hear that you'll find the richest examples of Andy Partridge's singing voice. He gives this recording his most hard-edged but gentle, warmly soaring and passionate singing that is never more heartfelt on any other XTC work. Listen to \\"No Thugs in Our House\\" and try to imagine it without Andy's whispers and growls. Hear the pleading, desperate crys in \\"Melt the Guns.\\" Listen to him create waves in \\"Yacht Dance.\\" You'll see. Get this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Pillar of Their Career","review":"Without a doubt this is XTC's finest release. A close second would be Black Sea. From their early days with Complicated Game and Scissorman, to their latest mild mannered Wasp Series, I think you will always come back to this as the finest work. A definate buy for the person looking for a taste of XTC or to fill up on that 80's music genre. It will make you a fan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"XTC as it should be","review":"English Settlement is just what long-time fans of XTC should expect: well-written and usually socially-meaningful songs with arrangements that only XTC can create. Not every song is a catchy \\"Senses Working Overtime\\", that makes you say \\"One-Two-Three-Four-Five\\" in a certain cadence, but they all please at their own level.While Apple Venus #1 and Skylarking remain my favorite XTC discs, English Settlement hits a close third."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best album NOT in your collection","review":"This is the seminal XTC album. The one that came after Andy Partridge got an acoustic guitar but before he had his nervous breakdown. It's a truly amazing piece of work that belongs in the collection of anyone who likes any kind of rock music. Songs range from mellow and pensive (All Of A Sudden (It's Too Late)) to kick-out-the-stops, rock the house (No Thugs In Our House), from pure pop mastery (Senses Working Overtime) to a melding of worldwide influences (It's Nearly Africa, English Roundabout).

Buy it now."},{"rating":"2","title":"English Settlement","review":"The first time I heard this band \\"Senses Working Overtime\\" I was stunned!

Still, the rest of the material offsets the weaker material. This is the band in top form. One of the two or three great double albums and one of the best albums of the 1980's.The import sounds a little better (less sharp) and has the lyrics in a booklet. Why Geffen didn't spring for this is beyond me ($$$).No bonus tracks to speak of (this has the original double album on one cd), but, then this is one of the albums that really doesn't need it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spotty reception","review":"This system didn't work well in our house. But, we don't get good reception with phones either. There were very few areas we could put the monitor and get good reception from the cameras.

Her CD contains smooth pop and awesome R&B. The only song not worth listenig to is if you only knew. The best songs are daydreamin, through life alone, boy you knock me out and everytime. It had fun, cool crushin-on-you romance and deep, dramatic intimacy minus the Madonna crap. The only bummer is there are only two kinda dancy, bouncy songs and she has a way to go before she reaches say, Mariah's level but she's pretty close to Monica.

She has an angelic voice that is complements each track in a wonderful fashion and the infectious pop hooks just keep you coming back for more. It's one of those CDs you listen to driving down the highway after a hard day at work or on the weekends when you're with your friends and the sun is out. It's just a real happy, joyous type of CD.

She's got a beautiful voice and she really feels the song. I love all the songs, but \\"yesterday\\" is my favorite. I know people compair her with Brandy and Monica, but so what?

Daydreamin'I love this song and she deliver a good vocal range in this song, Boy You Knock Me Out, I was a little dissapointed when I first heard this version off it and I thought: WHERE IS THE PART WHIT WILL SMITH, a little sad I think.Some say that her lyrics are sugar sweet love songs, it's true but she does it whit class and a style.

Going back to musical roots, a spiritual renewal, is an attractive idea and sometimes it works in these songs. I love the backup musicians and the country sound. But in going back to a simpler, more downhome style, too often Dolly ends up sounding inhibited and studied. I'd really prefer to hear the outtakes and jam sessions where I'll bet Dolly was just being Dolly and having a great time doin what she does best -- playing around with the music and enjoying the heck out of it -- and just being Dolly. Of which there is only one."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Jed and Granny Only","review":"I guess if you love country this cd is ok, but for those of us that came to Dolly durning her \\"9 To 5\\" peroid..this is really horriable music.

This cd is an excellent authentic and a real soulful recording. Dolly is at her best when she sings roots music from the hills of Tennessee. Dolly Parton is one of the greatest songwriters of all times and she penned all of these songs herself.Some of my favorite are the driving song \\"The Salt In My Tears,\\" The high lonesome lullaby \\"Blue Valley Songbird,\\" the poetic gospel song \\"When Jesus Comes Calling For Me, and \\"Paradise Road\\" and \\"Shine On.\\" A few of the songs do not really stand out like \\"I Still Lost You\\" or \\"Honky Tonk Songs,\\" but most of the album is wonderfully written and sung. Dolly Parton has a magical, unique, and soulful voice, there is no doubt about that. If you like country music and you like Dolly Parton this is a pretty dang good album to own. I love the honesty, simplicity, and depth of her words and voice. She is definitely a national treasure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dolly's Hungry Again for her roots!","review":"This is the album that kicked off Dolly's return to her roots. This spectacular collection of all Dolly written songs proves to be one of her best releases ever. All songs for the album were written by Dolly while she was fasting in her childhood home in the summer of 1997. The album features classic country and bluegrass tunes as well as a couple songs that were made to be radio friendly. Although the singles from the album \\"Honky Tonk Songs\\" and \\"The Salt In My Tears\\" didnt fare well on the charts, due to the thick-headed DJ's who refuse to play any artist over 40, the album is pure magic. \\"Paradise Road\\" an autobiographical song was used in a stage production of Dolly's life at her theme park DollyWood. STANDOUT TRACKS -- Hungry Again, I Still Lost You, I'll Never Say Goodbye, I Wanna Go Back There, When Jesus Comes Callin For Me, Paradise Road."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite Dolly Parton album ever!","review":"Hungry Again is the best Dolly Parton album she has released, in my opinion. It has very traditional country music mixed with some gospel. I can't seem to stop playing the album whenever I have a free moment. Shine On is probably my most favorite song ever. Paradise Road is very uplifting. Honkey Tonk songs is a great song, and the list goes on and on.

Unfortunately, though I was expecting a good new translated edition of the originals with all the expected academic material (footnotes and a helpful introduction), rather I was greeted by William Caxton's (at points, lamentably poor) translation, \\"rendered into Modern English\\" and given a flouncy pseudo-medieval \\"Olde Englishe\\" font.The text is, perhaps, fine for someone just getting familiarized with the material, but really isn't suitable for use in academic writing, and should, in my opinion, be avoided. The Caxton translation is pretty widely available online and for free."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the 1st!","review":"The first book was touching, helpful, and inspirational.

The lack of freedom, the drab monotony, the deathly sapping of life these regimes have on their inhabitants are clearly delinated by Dalrymple who visits a range of countries where the Marxist experiment has been tried, and found severely wanting.Highlights include a visit to a North Korea department store: fascinating in its depiction of a socio-economic system that has long taken leave of basic human needs and occpuies a surreal hyper-reality well along the 'wilder shores of Marx'.Those brave pioneers of the Russian revolution, not to mention Marx himself, have a lot to answer for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seminal Performances from a Master","review":"Coming of age in the sixties with a guitar in your hand, it was impossible to ignore Bert's work. Solo, with John Renbourne, in Pentangle, or reflected in the work of early Paul Simon (covering Anji) or Jimmy Page (appropriating Black Waterside), his influence was enormous. Sparkling fingerwork, an authentic vocal sound, and brilliant, eclectic compositions make this a must-have CD for anyone who wants to know about the roots of the late 20th century popular acoustic guitar sound. If only we could get rid of those drums....without them this would be a 5 star album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bah-Humbug","review":"I bought this album on the basis of a review in Sterophile Magazine.

I drove to Caribou, ME in August of '78, met my five companions, drove to Sept Isle, flew to Lac Opacopa, and did the Moisie. Boom! Just like that. It was my first big adventure, and it was awesome. We could not and would not have done it had it not been for this book.... which was written with talent, respect, awe and love.

Spencer Shops is a legend in many old time songs, and the wreck of the old 97, Spencer was the destination the train was headed before the fateful wreck.Doc is joined by many talented musicians, and Merle's picking is outstanding.

In the 70's, you could trust a union of musicians of this magnitude to produce scorching, jaw dropping prog rock. But in the 80's it only amounted to overproduced, manufactured for mass consumption, calculated FM corporate rock. There is nothing prog about Asia. Anyone who thinks this is prog needs to listen to these musicians in their better days of glory with UK, Yes, ELP,King Crimson. My opinion on this one will never change with time. File with GTR under 80's bad idea supergroups."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great musicians making poor music","review":"I remember when this cd was released in the 80's...the supergroup made of some great musicians of prog music....this album got immediate success, everybody liked it. Now listen to this cd again and realize how this was a poor cd. I did and I can say that this album is really poor and I won't listen to it for the rest of my life, this is the kind of pop prog for the mass and has nothing to do with real prog music. Instead, look for what these guys has made in the 70's with their respective bands and you'll see the difference...."},{"rating":"1","title":"The \\"Heat of the Moment\\" Explains Why This Album Was a Hit","review":"Asia was one of the first supergroups to achieve massive chart success, as this album topped the US Album charts for 7 straight weeks. Listening to the album now, it's hard to imagine how a thing like that happened. The album opens strong with the one-two punch of the singles \\"Heat of the Moment\\" and \\"Only Time Will Tell\\". And the rest of the album actually holds up fairly well, but as a whole the songs are so bombastic that it overwhelms what would have been an otherwise good album. In other words, even though everything on the album is actually quite good, it adds up to less than the sum of its parts. Cool cover, though.Worth noting: Six of the nine songs on this album can also be found on their Greatest Hits collection, so if you're looking for your first Asia album, you might want to pick that up instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much like an 80's hair band!","review":"A very dissapointing recording.

Most of the 70's supergroups had either disbanded or faded into obscurity, and Asia looked to be the heirs of the format and the band that would continue the glories of FM rock into the 80's. Alas, after this first LP, Asia descended into mediocrity, turning out many more albums, none of which equalled this outstanding debut. This record is a document of What Might Have Been, simply put. Well worth owning, and a fitting coda to the great rock albums of the 70's."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Was the Hea(r)t of the Moment","review":"Asia's debut album has sold many millions...and not least for the song \\"The Heat of the Moment\\" which you probably have heard sometimes even haven't heard the name \\"Asia\\".

John Wetton's voice is very soft and sensitive...just great for this kind of soft progressive rock.Stars: Wildest Dreams, Heat of the Moment, Without You"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Great Start!","review":"There's no doubt that the 1st album is most complicated work of Asia,the solid example of sound of 70's(in the 80's),which afterwards was lost.This amusing Dragon is one of my favourite images.For certain this enigmatic good-natured monster hitherto playing the ball somewhere in Yellow Sea of China...I saw Him there, really!..Well, in this set the great spirit of art-rock is flying over from theme to theme. Only the last song insufficienty developed and looks rather simply & gloomy.Ah, but what delightful is the concluding part of \\"Cutting It Fine\\".In my opinion, this tiny delicios titbit they should have turned into complete renaissance-like soft ballad or instrumental.To my regret CD-version hasn't musicians fotos & lyrics...."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best Albums of all time.","review":"I can't believe this is 20 years old! When Asia first came out with this package it really shook up the music world. Every song on this CD can be listened to over and over. It's rare when 4 \\"superstars\\" can get together and produce a sound this good. It's rarer still when they can keep doing it. Asia didn't. After this album they tried to \\"cookie-cut\\" their songs and they became trite and boring. But for one sweet summer this was the music that the world was loving. Do yourself a favor. BUY THIS CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One-Great-Album Wonder","review":"What a great start! This album earned Asia 3 hits (\\"Heat of the Moment\\", \\"Only Time Will Tell\\", and \\"Sole Survivor\\"). It featured the experimental side of the band members' \\"alma matters\\" Yes(Steve Howe and Geoff Downes, sorry, I only heard 1 song from the Buggles!), ELP (Carl Palmer, who would comment that he preferred playing shorter songs like on this album), and King Crimson (John Wetton). That, combined with the techno-pop sound, this band had potential! The chenistry worked, at least for this album (on the next album, the potential was greater than the execution, and personell changes such as Greg Lake temporarily replacing Wetton in the midst of the tour and Howe leaving shortly after). But let's remember this 1 great moment for the band! And most of this album sounds as good as did when we found ourselves in '82!

So why are they still going on today? Simple-they were ahead of their time. Four great musicians from three of the greatest and most influential rock bands of the seventies form a supergroup that evolves over the next seventeen years to the point where their success is not the kind you hear about on MTV or VH-1 but the kind you read about in Spin and Pulse magazine. But whatever, they're still making great music after almost two decades and God knows how many line-ups."},{"rating":"2","title":"Was it almost 20 years?","review":"As a teen of the '80s, I loved classic rock (still do), including many of the bands that the members of ASIA were alumni of ie ELP, Yes, King Crimson, UK, and others.

Prog rock never sounded better or more accessible."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best albums of the decade","review":"Yes, it was trashed by critics, and yes, it was a departure from its members previous prog-rock roots. But, you know what? I could care less - this is one good album, all the way through. There isn't a throwaway track on this album, and I dare say some of its less known tracks - \\"Without You\\" and \\"Here Comes the Feeling\\" - are just as good as the hits. The album that introduced the (sadly short-lived) songwriting team of Wetton and Downes, the performances of all - especially Steve Howe and Carl Palmer - make this one of the best albums to emerge from the 1980s."},{"rating":"1","title":"no me gusto.","review":"no me gusto para nada, tal vez si la hubiera escuchado 25 años atras hubiera estado buena."},{"rating":"1","title":"This album stunk","review":"Next to ABACAB, this had to be my biggest musical disappointment, ever. Never had I expected so much from a group of top-flight musicians (though Palmer has always been overrated - knows his rudaments, but can't keep time). Though some may like this album on its own merits, I can't help but put it in the context it deserves, which is former Progressive guys going after crying teenage girls who have pictures of Kieth Partridge in their bedrooms. This Album is so sickeningly sweet in some spots that its like drinking a bottle of log cabin. The only redeeming song amongst the drivel is 'Wildest dreams', and even then, Palmer's drumming is so unimaginative and forced that it takes away from the effect of the music. I have no problem with someone wanting to make a buck, but Tolstoy wouldn't go from writing 'War and Peace' to writing Harlequin Romances."},{"rating":"2","title":"good sounds","review":"Why did I like it?

This musical instrument (glass armonica) was invented by Benjamin Franklin during Colonial American times. It's been brought back to life in contemporary Williamsburg, VA thanks to artists such as Mr. Shostak.The music is based on the idea of rubbing fingertips over wet glass but the sound is ethereal in quality. No other modern instrument comes close to achieving the depth of tone as the glass armonica.

(Screamed that is) More annoying and distracting than the girls are the, \\"awwww, get its!\\" and \\"awww yeahs!\\" and \\"one mo time's\\" of his band while Elvis is singing. I wish there were a way to delete or muffle them. If that were possible, this would be a truly outstanding album because NO ONE can sing like THE KING.

It truly is one of the simplest to understand and straightforward in its approach. It can be specific and complex IF IT NEEDS TO BE, but you don't have to START with a complex system.Honestly, this is the only system I've seen where you can watch the hour video and immediately apply it.Note: I DID also purchase the book to help with those complex questions, and it was very helpful for those.

The only redeeming thing about her was her friendship with her mentor; she couldn't even muster some empathy for her hubby once he stopped being a toolbag. We were very disappointed at the lack of plot resolution, and the adolescent melodramatic ending, despite the promise of the trailer. Plus, there was a nearly-rape scene. Eew.Next time, we'll just watch Jane Eyre again."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Princess of Doom and Gloom","review":"I tried really hard to like this movie. I read the review of it in the New York Times, I saw the promos and waited eagerly for it to come to theaters. Then I saw the film and I could not believe I wasted eleven dollars to see a boring fluffy costume piece.This movie is completely overrated. I spent most of the film looking at my cell phone to see what time it was and how much longer the movie could possibly go on. The main character is exceptionally infuriating. She's exquisite to watch on screen but you don't care two smidgens about her. All of the male characters are pathetic and womanizers. The costumes and the sets are beautiful, as is the cinematography.If the movie were shorter and had more character development it would be worth watching. Skip this one. The trailer tells you everything and shows off the best parts of the film."},{"rating":"1","title":"beware of exaggerated reviews","review":"I am a fan of french movies and epic tales. This movie however, bored me to no end. Usual tale of love longing and lost when fulfilled. There is little romance, and the kind of passion it portrayed deserves its sad endings. If you enjoy it purely from the costume and location, you may find it worth while to see it once, but no more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Old fashioned movie making","review":"I'm a sucker for historical dramas. I was expecting more when I came across this movie.I'm not sure where I saw this, but there was an interview with the director and he talked about how most period pieces tend to have a very traditional filmmaking approach, and he wanted something modern and vibrant for this story about young people in love. I thought that sounded like a great idea. Too bad he didn't do that.Sure, there are some hand-held shots every now and then, I suppose... but this movie looks and feels like it was made in the 80's...I've watched plenty of modern french films, and their innovation in movie making is unrivaled (past and present) but this is not one of them. The story is also noticeably rushed, expecting the audience to accept that relationships have formed with what we're told, rather than seeing those relationships grow on screen.Unless you are REALLY looking for a sad, french, historical romance, I'd look somewhere else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"I am so glad I somehow discovered this movie. Princess of Montpensier is a historical romantic drama that's heavy on the passion. It's like a sophisticated French romance novel in motion. Do NOT skip this because it's subtitled, the language is so lovely that the subtitles didn't bother me at all, and I'm generally not a foreign film fan. The costumes, scenery, and people are simply gorgeous, and if you're a fan of period movies, you will likely love this one.FYI parents, it's inappropriate for children due to nudity and sexual content."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh!","review":"I grow weary of tales of twisty turny love, of wishing to marry one, and forced to marry another, but still loving the first, who marries someone else, and still hanging on, forgetting who you're married too, and their devotion, and having an affair that ends nowhere, blah blah blah blah!!!!!

The motion of extending/retracting it and sliding/pulling the washers off repeatedly throughout the evening left them both broken before the night as done. Note that I was not being aggressive with it and these washers could not weigh more than 1 lbs. There were two very small pieces of copper that held each part of the extender in place.

It is NOT a firm mattress by any means, but I felt it was firm enough for my baby. However, over time, the mattress started to get mushy in the middle. It became so mushy that my baby (who's now 15 months and about 20 pounds) could not even pull herself up and stand on the mattress; she immediately sunk back in on her tushy. So, I decided to return it in favor of a thinner, firmer mattress. My baby's been sleeping on that one now for a week and seems to love it. I'd be careful purchasing this mattress. It seemed good at first, but did not wear well after a few months."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT FIRM","review":"This is not even a little firm. I returned it right away.

We purchased a mini crib to keep in our room so as not to wake our other daughter while we are sleep training our infant. We received this mattress today and I didn't even unpack it and just printed the return label. The mattress is so incredibly soft that just pinching it with my fingers caused it to go completely flat. I can't imagine this would safely support a sleeping baby, let alone be at all comfortable, as it is definitely too soft to meet pediatrician recommended firmness standards. Very disappointed and will keep searching for a better solution."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"Sent this back as soon as I received it. The rounded corners left huge gaps in my crib - (Babyletto Grayson Mini-Crib). I also was unimpressed by the construction. It was rather bouncy, and I thought that could be unsafe when my son starts standing in his crib. I didn't like the noisiness of it either; seemed like the coils creaked and the outer cover was really stiff and \\"crinkly\\" sounding. Anyway, I am pretty picky, so these are just my opinions based on what I personally expect of products I buy. I ended up ordering a Simmons 4\\" foam mattress instead, and it is PERFECT for the Grayson mini. Also, $15 cheaper and the quality is excellent. Bottom line, this coil mattress was not for me. Big dislike."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap Mattress","review":"I bought this mattress for a mini crib and it ripped at the seam the first day. It isn't very firm and it is very thin.

I also ordered the recommended fitted sheet - yeah I should have listened to the other reviews...it does NOT fit. :("},{"rating":"1","title":"Great while it lasted","review":"We bought this mattress in 2008 for our DaVinci Anabelle minicrib. It was great while our daughter was small, but after about a year, the outer shell started to crack. At this point we also started to notice indentations where she slept, and it became rather lumpy. It's not that she was a heavy baby either - she was a preemie, and at the age of 18 months (when we stopped using it), she was 23lb.While it was a good investment at the time, in hindsight it would have been better to spend an extra $40 and get a higher quality mattress.Unless you're looking to save some $$, or you're using a minicrib as short term/not every night for 2 years sleeping arrangement, I wouldn't recommend this mattress."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recommendation for sheets","review":"The mattress itself is great. Perfect fit for the Kalani mini-crib and adequate firmness for baby, though I wish it had more coils--like at least 80. However, buyers looking for fitted sheets for this mattresses will have a VERY hard time finding bedding. There've been many recommendations for American Baby Company but their sheets are designed for 3 inch mattresses giving 2 inches of a secure fit at the bottom. The \\"barely-there\\" stretch to 5 inches for the cotton sheets (jersey fabric might be different) is just too unsafe for baby--too much of a risk that the sheets will ride up. After some random web searching, I must suggest Carousel Designs at babybedding.com as having the perfect-sized sheets--made specifically for either a 3\\" or 5\\" standard mini-crib mattress. No need to get 'custom' sheets. You get the exact depth you want and the designs are plentiful. A little pricey, yes, but no getting around that anywhere for this special-sized mini-crib mattress."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mattress is great, sheets can be a pain","review":"The mattress itself is great.

I'm surprised by the number of favorable ratings. It is way too soft for an infant mattress, in my opinion. It is not remotely firm and I think the quality is lacking, especially compared to the Serta mattress we have for our traditional crib. I really would not feel comfortable letting my infant sleep on it. She is 18 lbs. and sinks into it. I also agree with others that it's somewhat noisy, it makes a crinkly sound with any movement.

Even when I put him in there completely sleep he will sometimes wake up.

I bought Davinci mini rib since they have the safest rating for cribs and the size was great for my mom’s house. Downsize, it is not the standard size of a portable crib. This mattress did not fit my min crib without bending, cupping, wrinkling, and providing a semi-unsafe mattress surface. This mattress was okay. It is light, not very dense so it did not give the kind of support I was looking for since it was for a crib. With the baby test, there were indentations left from her head and body. It was loud. I did not care for the materials. I think if it was for a portable crib that was used for short trips it would be an okay choice.

He also helpfully reminds parents that children can succeed in breaking habits if we have confidence in them. While at first his advice to use your children's actual names rather than pet names seemed unnecessarily serious to me, I do agree that overuse of pet names can diminish a child's feelings of competence. The reason I found the book helpful is that it offers multiple suggestions for helping a child get rid of the pacifier/thumb/bottle habit, and then recognizes, with an open mind, that parents may choose to \\"let it be\\" and let children give up when they tire of the habit.

The album a very polished mix of synth-pop songs, impeccable produced, and well written. Baumann turned most of the vocals over to Eli Holland here, with good results, but the synth arrangements are still excellent, if dated.

(Since this device does not actually perform any refrigeration, you provide a mixture of water and ice which it cascades over the spinning container. The ice melts completely after only a few chilled cans, or one bottle of wine.)Another caveat, which may not have mattered to those in the engineering lab, is that this thing is hell on paper labels, what with the constant water, and the traction from the rubber wheels.

I thought this would be a big \\"win\\" with my husband. The first one I got didn't rotate the bottle/can as advertised. I sent it back and Amazon quickly got me a replacement. I opened my replacement today and the front was scratched up and the wine setting wouldn't select and the other settings didn't work. I'm so sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beverage Chiller...","review":"This thing is a complete waste of technology. Essentially the chiller just uses re-circulating water and user provided ice to chill your beverage. You can most likely achieve the same results by filling a pitcher with ice and water. For the cost of this product it should chill its own water bath. It does have blinking LED's though... I guess that deserves a star......"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like this, you will love the pet rock.","review":"Bottomline, it works. BUT it needs ice! What is the point? I thought this thing would cool without ice, thus eliminating the need for a fridge in say a workshop. Nope. I don't own it, but a friend of mine does and I was impressed when he told me about it. THEN! I saw the ice. I am amazed that very few of us think this is a complete hose job.

Sadly, it doesn't last long. I went through two of them. Used each an average of 2-3 times/week, chilling soda cans. First one lasted about two years. Company sold me a replacement for about $40. Replacement lasted about the same length of time. I contacted them again. After the cost of sending my unit in to examine, and their 'discounted' cost to replace it, I decided it wasn't worth it. Too bad, because the thing works great. They just flat aren't built to last, however. Back to the cubed ice and water to chill the cans.

Unfortunately, this gift to my wife was a dud.We tried it for the first time and it did not even spray any water. The motor sounded like it was attempting to pump water but never spun.The only thing this Cooper Cooler did was waste our time and ice.Amazon was great with the return and it is currently on its way back to them.Decided on chilling wine with no moving parts would be best so I ordered a wine chilling carafe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Severly overpriced","review":"There is no advantage to the ball over the lesssor priced ones.

Hard and metal fused together in marvellous and catchy songs like \\"LOVE AIN'T NO STRANGER\\", \\"GUILTY OF LOVE\\" and \\"SLOW AND EASY\\". John Sykes playing is fresh here, along with the late Cozy Powell usual competent drumming. So, if I gave this album so much credence, why I rated it only two stars ? Simple. Because, good as it is, this album was clearly the first step to the complete sell out by Whitesnake, which granted their multi-platinum success ( Whitesnake - 1987 ), but which was also responsible for the band loose any identity ( if it ever had one ). Proof of that: WHITESNAKE was progressively going through countless changes in band line-up, until the point that Coverdale finished the band, going totally mainstream with albuns that make you almost forget that this guy once sang in DEEP PURPLE..."},{"rating":"2","title":"If your on a Deserted Island take this one with you!","review":"The Slide It In Album is one of Whitesnakes' best! Every song is good and is easy listening. Highlights are \\"Love Ain't No Stranger, the title track, \\"Slow 'An Easy\\", \\"Guilty Of Love\\" and \\"Give Me More Time\\". They say that David Coverdale and Whitesnake are a knock off of Zepplin, well I don't hear that at all, and frankly he was in Deep Purple at the same time Zepplin was rocking the world. David Coverdale is a original who has gotten better with time. I wish they got their due in America earlier because their songs are timeless. Slide It In is one of the best rock records of the mid 80's."},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST Whitesnake Band!!","review":"One name: COZY POWELL!! The driving force behind every song. This is the surefire best Whitesnake album. There is not a bad song or even a mediocre song. EVERY song is great. Neil Murray kicks it on Bass and John Sikes rips it out on guitar. Lyrically, you can't play this album for Grandma, but David Coverdale really sounds good. Especially if you are a drummer or you just love good drumming, this album is a MUST!!! If you like Cozy, you might want to check out Rainbow Rising, Rainbow's Long Live Rock and Roll, and Yngwie Malmsteen's Facing the Animal. Some of his best work. The Best of Cozy Powell also includes his best solo work. RIP bro!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Whitesnake Album, Best Whitesnake Lineup","review":"Of the many incarnations of Whitesnake during their 15-year existence, \\"Slide It In\\" featured by far their best lineup. Along with band leader and vocalist David Coverdale, it also featured guitarist John Sykes, drummer Cozy Powell (my favorite drummer of all time) and bassist Neil Murray.The result is the band's best album, even better than their also great mega-hit 1987 CD \\"Whitesnake\\". It is also their most musically genuine. It is straight up, hard and heavy Rock-And-Roll with a good amount of Blues and swagger.The best Whitesnake album and lineup also yielded their best song, \\"Slow And Easy\\", a bluesy six-minute plus heavy stomper with really good hooks and excellent drumming by Cozy Powell.Other more than notable tracks on this collection are the title track, the catchy \\"Give Me More Time\\", the hard and heavy ballad \\"Love Ain't No Stranger\\", the anthemic \\"Gambler\\" and \\"Spit It Out\\". Absloutely essential 'Snake."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slide it in (Deluxe Edition) - Whitesnake","review":"What a fantastic album. A beautiful package, superb bonus tracks and a gorgeous DVD.

Admittedly. But the original, British mix, including Colin Hodgkinson (instead of Neil Murray) and Mel Galley (instead of John Sykes)is far, far superior. The music haad far more balls and less flash. The mix, with Cozy's drumming, was like atomic blast after atomic blast on my stereo. I remember that well 20-something years later! Release the British mix. American releases always suck by comparison."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great rock of highest quality","review":"When I first heard \\"Slide it in\\" back in 1984 I was unfamiliar with Whitesnake, but as the opening song \\"Gambler\\" (European release) hit my ears I was hooked! Whitesnake gave me exactly what I had been looking for - great songs with excellent vocals. Many of the bands that were around at the time seemed to be more or less amateurs in comparison to David Coverdale's Whitesnake. The music is melodic and catchy - it's traditional blues based hard rock. \\"Slide it in\\" can be seen as the bridge between the earlier rhythm & blues approach to the later heavy metal direction. As a dedicated Whitesnake fan I think \\"Slide it in\\" is the best album alongside with \\"Ready an' willing\\".Let yourself be blown away by songs like \\"Gambler\\", \\"Guilty of love\\", \\"Love ain't no stranger\\", \\"Standing in the shadow\\"!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hear the difference","review":"This is the version of Slide It In that was released in Europe & Canada only, prior to the US release. This release features Mel Galley & Mickey Moody on guitar with the US version including John Sykes & combinations of Moody & Galley. This version has a more blusey sound with John Lord's organ more prominent than on the US version. Listen to some of the solos as they differ from the one's recorded on the US release. A great hard rock album without all the overproduction. This is what a hard rock album should sound like not the pretty boy bands that call themselves rockers today!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Whitesnake Album \\".\\"","review":"From what I have read in a couple of rock guides this album was finished in 1983 with Mick Moody and Mel Galley on guitars. It was later re-mixed for America, at which point Moody left and former Tygers Of Pan Tang/Thin Lizzy guitarist John Sykes joined the band. Sykes had recorded the excellent Thunder And Lighting with Thin Lizzy in 1983. I am not sure how much input he had on SIN but I remember he was the only guitarist to appear in the Slow N Easy video. Anyways, I have heard every Whitesnake album and this one is their best. The riffs are good, the solos are melodic, the choruses are catchy, and the rhythm section is tight. The production by the one and only Martin Birch is very clear and robust. I like every song with the exception of just a couple tracks so I won't bother going into each one. Just get the album if you don't already have it and enjoy good early 80s hard rock. Four and a half stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product!","review":"Great Product!

Better yet, it cooks wonderfully. Very little gas flame or electric heat is necessary to heat it to desired temperatures.

The monsters come from an old monster movie - literally. They come out of the film while two kids are watching an old film they found in the basement. The house is owned by a retired movie producer who made the film. Unfortunately, the kids lose the last reel which tells them how to get rid of the monsters. The movie is played just right between laughs and mayhem. It's great for anyone into the old 1950s B movies. The kids (a boy and girl about 12)deal with the usual crop of bullies, unbelieving adults, and Mom. This is worth watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Halloween Movie for the Family","review":"This is great flick for those that want a fun horror movie that kids and parents can enjoy. There's no gore, no offensive language, or any sexual content. The lead actor, which is a boy, is not the greatest actor, but he's surrounded by a pretty good cast with George Kennedy, Linda Blair, and Adam Baldwin. This is a made for TV movie, so don't expect a Hollywood budget where Roland Emmerich is blowing up the world."},{"rating":"1","title":"For kids","review":"I'm sorry for such a low star rating, but this movie is basically 'just' for kids.

As a matter of fact I sort of put that movie at the top of the rating chart for 'all' children movies. Monster Makers draws two stars at best. Sorry.To put it in short form, it is boring. At the same time, I don't think there is anything in it a 'real' mother would not want her kids to see. It's just, boring--and it's not because I'm one of those jaded movie watchers.

For the REAL deal, I recommend: \\"Superfly\\" and \\"Hot Buttered Soul\\" by Curtis Mayfield and Issac Hayes, respectively; these two invented wah-wah driven soul. Steve Winwood's Hammond work on Hendrix' \\"Electric Ladyland\\", and Vanilla Fudge's self-titled first release; TRUE psychedelic organ.

As if we didn't have enough I-Spy books, pop-up books, and Dora the Explora books. Her kids did enjoy the book however, and even learned a bit of Egyptian culture. The ends do not justify the means. I would much rather have my child look up Egyptian history and culture for a fraction of the cost on the internet. Please save your money and invest it in a more productive manner.

And, when investing in a cooking item, one should think high quality, and long term. For those reasons we have opted with Al-Clad because we know the high means less headache down the road. When replacing our former Teflon skillet, we baulked at getting something with a 14 inch diameter, thinking it may be too much. However, now we are glad we went 'jumby' because there is no more need to constantly feed in the swiss chard, spinach, or other greens when before this took at least 3 skillets full.

But I am only giving this set a 1 star rating as I already own JFC-S1 and nowhere in the description was it mentioned that this is the same program.

The grinding compartment becomes very soiled after use but I am willing to live with this because the resulting brew is outstanding."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak coffee","review":"There are a lot of parts to disassemble and clean with every use, but my main complaint is that it seems to use coffee very inefficiently. I have to put in 10 or 12 measures of beans to get six cups of coffee (which translates to a little over three mugs). It won't hold any more beans than that, so if I'm making coffee for a group I have to hope they like it weaker than I do.Mechanically, it's a remarkable contraption, though.

It works great, I don't mind cleaning out the grinder every day, it's worthwhile ritual. My only complaint is that, if you like strong coffee, you can only make 1/2 a pot at a time. The grinder doesn't hold enough beans for a full pot of high octane fuel. I never drink a whole pot anyway, so that's not a big deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect accessory for your kitchen","review":"I purchased one for myself a little over a year ago and it's been great. I get my perfect cup of coffee when I wake up. I love this product because I am always running late and don't always have time to grind the beans, measure the water and wait for it to brew. With this product, prepare everything the night before, set it on my timer and it does everything for me. I just have to step into the kitchen, pour my coffee and head out of the house. With this being said, I purchased a second one for my boyfriend's place thinking that it would be just the same. After using his a few times, the whole machine gave out it's power and stopped working. I had to call the manufacture and tried to get it replaced under it's 90 day warranty. So I've had good and bad experiences with this machine. But over all, I still love it and recommend it. Just make sure if anything is wrong, call the manufacture right away and get it replaced."},{"rating":"1","title":"So So","review":"The lack of an external water level indicator means that you have to lean over and look down into the tank. Placing this under the cabinets doesn't work well. The steam from the heating water condenses in the grinder so you have to rinse it out and dry it every time you use it. A bit of a pain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good coffee but a lot of work","review":"I bought this unit, when our old unit died (different brand). The coffee this unit makes is good. The problem is you have clean it after ever brew.

We have had it for just over two years, so maybe we shouldn't expect much more. But I would think it would last for longer than it has (my simple grinder is many years old).I'm going to buy the Melitta MEMB1B Mill & Brew which is much cheaper and seems to have gotten really good reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work.

Their championing of any group with an attitude, irrespective of the group's actual talent, is becoming pathetic - and a disgrace to the memory of the groups they dare invoke in their comparisons. This particular bunch of Northerners, with their sneering vocals and tales of drinking and clubbing, are being compared to Oasis, Franz Ferdinand, and even the Beatles. But even the worst of that trio - Oasis (by far) - occasionally wrote and recorded a tune or two. There isn't a single track on this album that's memorable for anything other than the words.

The second time I listened to Arctic Monkeys, I finally understood the hype. Now they are probably one of my favorite bands ever, especially after seeing them live. Whatever People Say I Am That's What I Am Not is probably one of the greatest debut albums of all time. The majority of the songs are hard hitting, but never cross the line of being too hard or loud. I don't think I can necessarily pick a favorite song on the album, but all the released singles are a great place to start if discovering them for the first time.The vinyl transfer is really good too. There is a lot more depth to the recording than there is on the standard mp3. I wouldn't say it's the best modern transfer to vinyl, but not the best. There is only so much that can be done with digitally engineered music when moving it to an analog medium."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cold climbers","review":"The Artic Monkeys deliver layered sound that entices the ears.

I'm confident saying that I will buy it because it every Arctic Monkeys song I've heard so far was good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Noisy, Raw Fun","review":"I debated whether to give this album the full five stars--I like it that much. It has a great, raw post-punk feel that was subsequently lost in Favorite Worst Nightmare, and that is not a good thing in my view. I think Arctic Monkeys, all of the hype surrounding them aside, are the best of the new British bands. They have a great tongue-in-cheek style and aren't as monotonous as bands like Franz Ferdinand. I highly recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay, then you guys are \\"Awesome. Talented. Deserving of the Hype\\"","review":"Man, what a total disappointment - this album is STONE DULL. Once again, just because you think you can play a guitar / drums / bass does NOT mean you have talent. This stuff might work if I heard it played live in a warehouse, but I doubt it. This album is nothing but a paltry Strokes imitation. Even FIOE is better than THIS, and that's saying something. After all the press, I thought I was going to hear something exciting. That wasn't the case. I kept looking at the time remaining on the cd player, sorely waiting for it to end.

I took off all of my clothes, opened a can of Jiffy, covered myself in peanut butter and then wrapped myself in saran wrap. Poured a nice glass of white cooking wine and turned on the tunes. First up, Arctic Monkeys. Wow, I was appalled and ashamed. These songs, besides all sounding alike, sound like they're written and performed by a group of hooligans who can't strum their wee wees. As an appreciator of the finer things in life, I cannot be amused by the antics of a bunch of fraternity rejects attempting to amaze the music industry.

So people Arctic Monkeys are just an ok band the hype should have not come so fast but they are selling albums and for Rock in today's music world that is good to report.

But I'm glad I heard the album, because now I can truthfully say that the Arctic Monkeys explosively stink. I knew they couldn't be that good because none of the mebers collaborated with Britney. As we all know, in this business, you have to be just as good, if not better, than Britney to make it as a rock star. But these guys have a LONG way to go if they want to be as good as her.

Q magazine picked it as the best album of the year, and mojo magazine selected it as number 3. it took me three or four listens to really get into, but now i'm there. these are modern urban english folk songs played out on frantic electric guitars and sung by a singer with boat loads of vocal personality. the music has the driving rush of punk, the power chords and guitar solo's of classic rock, and the quirky rhythms of post-punk. explosive stuff that i highly recommend to all rock fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"surprsingly over hyped and overrated. the worst of contemporary british rock","review":"i feel compelled to write this review because i just read a \\"Top ten albums of 2006\\" list and this LP was #1. i just don't get it.I love the new wave of British rock bands. I visited england in april (2006) and i fell in love with the alt rock scene over there. Kaiser Chiefs and Maximo Park are okay. Art Brut and the Rakes are pretty cool. Editors and especially Dirty Pretty Things are amazing.The Arctic Monkeys are second rate. they are children and their lyrics and lack of artistry reflect that.perhaps the monkeys are getting too much credit over here because they sound so much more exciting than any American pop/rock bands. i don't know. i just know that you really should check out \\"Dirty Pretty Things\\"'s 'waterloo' or \\"Editors\\"'s Interpol-esque 'the back room' before you even think of buying this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"good rocking album regardless of the UK press","review":"I am old enough not to be moved by the current trends in music journalism. I am not going to jump on the band wagon only to find out that I do not like the music. I found this cd in a used pile and thought that I might give it a try. I have to admit that for once the music press is correct and this is good. It has more of a bar band feel to it than one would expect. The songs are not overproduced (which is itself unusual for a UK band). The band makes so good observations about life but still manage to have hard hooks and good music. All and all a good rocking(how I hate that term) album. A good time for all."},{"rating":"2","title":"The voice of experience...","review":"Is the appreciation of SWEET rock, age related? I've been discovering musical gems for around 40 years, including the best of the Beatles and the Stones, as they were released... but it's as simple as this: I know what I like. And this CD is extraordinary! As a reference point, I also love Spoon's, \\"Gimme Fiction\\". That, and this, are probably the two best CDs I've heard in the last 5 years. These days, when EVERY SONG is worth your time, you know you have something special. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best CD of 2006","review":"This Cd was stuck in my player for a long time. The Artic Monkeys, as you should be aware through song samples and YouTube, play fast rock. You've got one distorted guitar, and one clean guitar. The music is catchy, and yet deceptively simple. The singer paints a great picture of what it's like to be a teenager in a British city. This is Joe Jackson's \\"Look Sharp\\" updated, a classic disc."},{"rating":"1","title":"What they are not","review":"I managed to miss the hype. Maybe it has something to do with not living in England, or not being that interested in MP3 file sharing. Instead, I bought this CD based largely on reviews comparing the Arctic Monkeys to bands like Oasis, or Franz Ferdinand.Maybe that was a mistake? This band doesn't remind me at all of those bands. Rather than the Beatles-inspired hard rock melodies of Oasis, Arctic Monkeys are nearly all rythmn section outside of the musical bridges, which are closer to Gang of Four, but lack the sparceness and originality that made that band interesting to me. Occasionally the singing will stumble near a pleasing tune, but then the vocalist seems to get bored, and he's off on some improvisation.The saving grace of this band are the lyrics, which I find to be quite witty. But to me it's not enough. Folks interested in the \\"not quite singing clever lyrics\\" genre would do better with Art Brut."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Debut Album","review":"This album is an excellent debut album with a great mixture of good lyrics and great instrumentals with killer basslines."},{"rating":"1","title":"ok&Catchy","review":"I saw these cats recently on saturday Night Live&Enjoyed there Playing Live,but after hearing the Album I wasn't feeling the Album on a whole.

The record throws out bruiser after bruiser, and each one never sounds the same as its predecessor. All the songs have the typical British influences (Beatles excitement, Kinks cleverness, Oasis energy, and a thick Northern accent.) The highlights of the record include the riotous \\"Fake Tales of San Francisco\\", the surprise epic \\"I Bet You Look Good on the Dance Floor\\", and the monumental closer \\"A Certain Romance.\\" Check this record out, its worth the buy.

Are they as great as The Beatles as one reviewer said? Oh my god no. But the lyrics are indisputably fun, the drum work is great and the occasional change-ups in the tunes give a live dynamic quality to most of the tracks. The band certainly deserves 4 stars for such a fun CD. The singer does not have the annoying high pitched voice that almost all male singers are singing with nowadays.Note that their are about 10 demo tracks and B-sides (not on this CD) that are quite excellent that are floating around in the UK. Hard to find right now in the USA but the demo tracks really make a case for this band having actual talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"meh","review":"a bit boring, really.i don't see what all the hype is about at all.i only gave it a two because it isnt, horrible, and there is *some* talent there. they just don't hold my attention in the slightest."},{"rating":"1","title":"This band blows...","review":"This is a bad album, poorly conceived, not thought out, and a blatant copy of good musicians like Jack White. If you get all your new music from the radio, hipster magazines, or indie pop websites, then you might like this band. If you actually have musical taste (or talent), you will likely be offended at how crappy this retread album is. I give it negative one star for being embarassingly bad, insultingly derivative, and nothing more than young brits (who can barely play their instruments) getting famous for rehashing all the indie pop garbage of the last 2 years. Hey, maybe my no-talent \\"wouldn't-be-famous-if-they-weren't-handsome\\" garbage is exactly what you're looking for.

It is rare to find an album where you don't skip over any tracks, I.E. both Franz Ferdinand CDs. True, there are some songs that are catchier than others, but none of them are \\"putrid\\" as some people have referred to them as. Bad words are used, but its not like every other word is \\"f*ck\\". People just need to calm down and stop bashing on them.

I heard that the arctic monkeys had the fastest selling debut album in the UK ever. Thats a lot of hype, and I eagerly waited to get this cd when it came out in the US. I've been listening to it for a couple of days now, and honestly, they are catchy and upbeat, but the songs are just unmemorable. I prefer Franz, the strokes, even the hives over these guys. The songs are too short and sweet. The music is average. The lyrics are good, but the lead singer is weak, and sounds bored singing the songs. Overall, I expected more. This album goes by fast, with no really stand out tracks. Even the ultra hit, \\"I bet you look good on the dancefloor isnt that great. After it was all done, I said to myself, \\"thats it?\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"The Next Big Thing?","review":"The Arctic Monkeys are four 20 year old Englishmen who have exploded on the British music scene. Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I Am Not became the fastest selling debut album in British music history. The album is very Anglo-centric and the question is will it play well in America. It should as it is a smart, tight collection of songs that draws on everyone from the Jam to The Kinks to The Strokes to The Libertines while sounding quite original in its own right. \\"I Bet You Look Good On The Dancefloor\\" is a high powered single while \\"When The Sun Goes Down\\" is a smart and strong track. \\"Fake Tales of San Francisco\\" and \\"Maybe Vampires Is a Bit Strong\\" both take on the music press with a scathing tone. \\"A Certain Romance\\" is a more restrained song compared to the barrel straight ahead style of the rest of the album. The band's motto is don't believe the hype, but thanks to this sterling debut, they come pretty close to doing just that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome album but overexposure killed them","review":"I first heard the Arctic Monkeys in December of 2005. I found them to be a super exciting band with incredibly catchy songs. In February, I became obsessed after watching them do a show (at a small venue!!) where I rocked out really, really hard.Then I tuned into the radio and noticed they were on every minute of the day. Then on television, they were on every minute of the day. Then a member quit. At this point, I was getting tired of them. I listen to the album now, and it's not the same anymore.Maybe it's the overexposure, maybe I've matured since February (??). I'm not going to rate the album low, because it was initially a really great album (A Certain Romance being my favourite). But now, I can't listen to it anymore.

It was said that they would be bigger than when Oasis first came out but I don't see that at all. They're more like a Stone Roses, a very good album and will probably never be heard again. That may be harsh to say but it is what it is. Needless to say, I think it is a great album.

There's maybe one or two slow songs on it that are pretty good, but the rest of it is gas pedal stomping, glass shattering rock.

It's got an absolutely gorgeous finish, stays in tune, and sounds beautiful. This mandolin is a pretty good deal at $50 and I'm so glad I got it. When I received it, one of the screws on the pick guard came off but I removed the guard anyways and kept it just in case I decide that I want it on in the future. Having known next to nothing about mandolins prior to purchasing this, I had it tuned and was learning basic chords in about 5-10 minutes after unboxing it, which I was very pleased with. This mandolin is great for people who want to learn but don't feel like investing a ton of money or are on the fence about it. I'm very happy with my purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Sound for Cheap Price","review":"Obviously this mandolin is not going to perform at levels of higher quality instruments, but I am still amazed at how well it sounds and plays.

If you are just starting to play this is a great investment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank you!","review":"Dude this is awesome! I myself am 12 years old, a good piano player and a decent guitar player and I decided to learn mandolin. When I saw the price I was shocked I thought $50 yeah right!

The only problom I had with this magnificint insrument was it was a little out of tune but I managed to fix it with a little tuning and fidgeting. Other than that, Awesome! I want to get all of my instruments from you! Very well done five stars! * * * * *"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth more than the price","review":"Really such a nice little instrument for the money!

I can't get over that part. :)Day 2 of learning chords and my fingers are killing me!!! lol yeah, this will go away, but ouch! But so happy that my short fingers can reach!I was able to tune it myself with an electric tuner. Came nicely packaged and wrapped in padding too. The case I ordered should be here tomorrow. Meanwhile it sits nicely in the box it came in.I am VERY happy with this. I'm a novice so I can't compare to some $$$$$ model. But for a first timer I am pleased.

I gave it 4 stars for the price and ease of improving it to something decent enough to learn on."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's Defective","review":"My mandolin looked fine when I got it, but the strings started breaking when I tried to tune it.

Keep your paperwork and packing materials until you're sure it's okay."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT Mandolin","review":"At first i was not expecting much for a 50 dollar mandolin considering the prices for similar mandolins. When it came in it just needed a quick tuning and was playing great however it may need a bridge adjustment which is not difficult. I began using it for a few days and the strings started to buzz so i just bought some new Martin Strings and the buzzing went away. Now it plays great, sounds great, looks great and fun to play! I would recommend this to anyone wanting to learn how to play mandolin great starter and for the price it was a good buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Value","review":"I read many reviews before choosing this product. It arrived earlier than expected and was packed very well. No scratches noted. The only instrument I have every played is flute, so I didn't know quite what to expect. I took it to the local guitar shop and they said it good and needed only minor adjusting of the bridge. It tuned easily and sounds great. I think this mandolin would be good for a beginner or more advanced player."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice beginner's instrument","review":"This mandolin has an overall nice tone and was in great condition when it arrived. The bridge didn't contain notches in the correct spots, so had to do some very minor adjustments to move the strings into the correct spacing. However, it does have an adjustable action via the bridge which I was not expecting. The strings were a little dirty, but that's what a cleaning cloth is for. Overall I'm happy with this purchase!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty solid instrument","review":"I was slightly concerned purchasing an instrument in this price range but I went out on a limb because of the stellar reviews. My mandolin came on time and was packaged well. First off, your going to need to restring it. I felt that the factory strings were to heavy and dead. I swapped for a set of 38s and it sings now. Also, plan on doing some bridge adjustments as it will probably be out of whack. The bottom line is once I got the new strings and set this baby up she plays beautifully. Can't beat it for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceeded my expectations.","review":"The Rogue RM-100A Mandolin is a great instrument to start. Good finish, good sound.

So one day while shopping I spotted a mandolin. It was quite expensive but my hands fit it well. So after some debate I decided to give it a shot. I looked around and found this model to be fairly priced. Also I was able to snap this model up on Black Friday at a nice discount. Now I'm in the process of learning scales and killing my finger tips in the process. It's not easy but I hope after a few weeks it will get a little easier. I plan to stick with it but if all else fails it will look pretty on my wall."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Instrument","review":"I bought this mandolin as a first one for my 18 year old son. he plays guitar and bass already, absolutely loved this when he got it. Knowing him he will want a more high end Mandolin soon, but this one sounds great and was perfect for him to use to get the feel of the instrument. I would recommend this mandolin if you want to learn or are just a casual player."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a 5 for value","review":"I took a chance on this after reading the other reviews for this item. I was looking for a starter instrument and didn't want to spend a few hundred on something I wouldn't like in a few months if I liked the mandolin. I also didn't want to spend a ton on an instrument before I knew if I was going to stick with playing it. My main concern was not the look, but whether it would stay in tune. You have to follow the advice of others and change the strings when you get it, but out of the box with the new strings it sounds fine, and after the string break-in period stays in tune wonderfully.I'm really happy with the value for the money. I could have paid 3 or 4 times this and still been pleased, but for $50 it's a really great deal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Probably get what you paid for","review":"I am new to the mandolin and haven't played any instrument for 30 years so I wouldn't comment on the musical aspects of this mandolin. There are a couple of manufacturing quality defect in the one I purchased. The plating on the tail piece peeled off in the first week. It seemed really thick which is probably what made it start cracking but the copper layer under the nickel is where it delaminated. The other item was that some of the tuning gears are not fully inserted into the headstock. So far neither of these defects has stopped it from functioning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Beginers Mandolin","review":"I had a guitar and ukulele before this and have always wanted to play the mandolin.

Overall I would recommend this to anyone who wants to try out the mandolin"},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid for the price","review":"I got this mandolin after i visited a friend who had recently purchased one. I tested his out for the weekend i was there and really liked the feel of it. I had never played mandolin before, but i have 9 years of experience on guitar and most of it translated over. As far as the action is concerned, both my mandolin, and the one my friend purchased, were fine. In fact its feel was fairly comparable to a $1500 mandolin i played at a music store, and im not missing a decimal point there. Obviously the expensive one had a slightly better feel to it, and a nicer sound, but for 30 times the cost, i would expect that. I rarely cheap out when it comes to instruments, i play a gibson les paul, but this one really holds up for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mandolin","review":"My husband play with his and for this it's great. If you're a musician you will need something better made but for the price it is an unbelievable deal : )"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great mandolin for the price","review":"Obviously, this isn't a top of the line mandolin, but it is a decent one for beginners and practicing. Either the shipping isn't very kind to the instrument or the factory doesn't make it at the highest quality, but one of the high e strings' loop broke as soon as I started tuning it. That said, the bridge and the seven other strings were in decent shape. In short, if you want a cheap mandolin that might need only a small amount of work, go for this."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Addition to a Musician's Arsenal","review":"As a musician with guitar, piano, bass, ukulele, and harmonica in my repetoire, I was looking for the next step musically. I was looking for something to play bluegrass music, to expand my horizons, so I looked at the mandolin. Being a music student, I wanted something I do buy with a VERY limited income, and this mandolin fit the bill. I decided to give it a shot, and realize that starter instruments are ok for me. (I have a $30 dollar ukulele, no complaints)If you are like me, you'll want something you can learn on, you wouldn't give a new driver a Cadillac, why give a beginning mandolin player a Gibson? This instrument is perfect for the avid musician looking to expand on your talents."},{"rating":"1","title":"Falls Flat","review":"I appreciate the good work that Michael Harner has done in the realm of anthropology and shamanic studies, but this drumming CD falls flat.

I found the material just a bit weaker this time, however (despite ranging well out of the folk tradition), and the singers perhaps a little less involved. The instrumental backing on this album is quite different from the first album, moreover, with more of a 'New Age' feel to it, in part due to the very interesting guitar work of Dan Ar Braz. If you liked the first album, you'll probably like this one as well--but be forewarned: the lp version of this title was *very* short, timewise (one side being hardly over ten minutes in length), and the addition of two new cuts only brings the project up to being describable as \\"short.\\" Perhaps someone might contemplate releasing *both* Silly Sister projects on one cd?--there's room."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as earlier releases of Cookson's stories","review":"These two movies are dark and unhappy.....not something you want to look at to cheer you up, but they are well done and I guess life did turn out like that in the 19th century UK and those that survived just made the best of a bad situation....but I swear I don't think this is one I will want to view a second time.

The playing and arrangments scream good-time rock and roll, but the poetry of Mssr. Carples would suggest otherwise. It's a mixture that resonates well with me. I hear their old drummer ain't half bad either. 12th Hour matures a few light years in mere weeks (most bands take years to develop like this), so if this is their third release, look out for Album No. 5 - it will alter your perception of the working band in the early twenty-first century. Much like Interpol, Placebo, The Strokes and the stronger bands of recent memory, this band pinches and borrows from every band they've ever loved and somehow come out with a finished product that speaks it's own truth with this new compelling language they've forged from the melodies of their childhood.

Just to give you an idea of the common phrases we use that are dealt with in the book : cat got your tongue, stormed out of the room, be a fly on the wall, get your goat, tough as nails, etc. Hope you get the idea. enjoy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite De Danann CD","review":"It is unfortunate that, as of writing this, \\"Song for Ireland\\" has been discontinued by the manufacturer.

The format was hard to follow, and although it had good aspects of WW II when it came to some of the characters, too many facts were jumbled together in a paragraphs of small capacity. It was hard to understand. The main character, 'Katinka', was a young girl that was hard for me, as a young adult, to be on the same level with. I cannot truly say that this is a good book for avid readers of Holocaust/World War II material."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"I began reading this book as an assignment for my history class but fell in love with it.

After reading it she insisted I read it and so I did. I was quite taken by the tragedy this young child endured and the sophisticated way in which she handled herself. A jewish child raised as a christian due to the danger she faced during WWII. Her confusion of her own religion and the fact that she actually saw herself as a catholic before turning toward the love of the protestant orphanage in which she was placed only to find their love guiding her to learn more of her jewish background. A very ironic situation. The atrocities of this era are still burnt on our hearts and I see this book as a very important account of a child ripped apart by WWII."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cutest Thing","review":"THis is the cutest thing.

There are lots of photos also. You can easily find a number - every page number is written in Spanish. The book contains some words and phrases for a tourist or casual student of Spanish. You will not learn lots of substantive grammar here, but, in a worst-case scenario, if you are in a store with a number of Spanish-speaking employees, you can always point to a picture!

The price seemed too good to be true BECAUSE IT WAS. Only a couple of episodes are the HBO versions. The rest are syndicated television versions. Based on the added laugh track, inappropriate trumpet flourishes and cutaways, I'd guess the syndicated versions in the set weren't even intended for American audiences (they seem like Mexican sit-coms, but do Mexicans care about USA Football?). Even the adult content is cut on all but three episodes from the first season. THIS IS NOT THE 1ST AND 10 YOU REMEMBER unless you watched it second hand on basic cable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yes, these ARE the edited versions","review":"OK. HBO, in the mid-80's, sold the syndicated rights to this show to NBC, which preceded to badly edit the show, removing all nudity and dubbing in a horrible laugh track. This happens on the first 3 seasons.However, NBC cancelled the show after the 3rd season. The last 3 seasons are COMPLETELY unedited and air the way HBO originally intended them to be aired.Because this package is so inexpensive, I'm planning on picking it up, along with the first 3 seasons as they are individually released, and then substituting the unedited DVD's for the edited ones (assuming they'll fit)."},{"rating":"1","title":"It Didn't Take Long","review":"Picked up my copy of the complete series at Big Lots for $6.

Not because its actually good, but rather because its so godawful. Honestly, i think of this show like the bizarro version of Friday Night Lights, where that show had a great plot, but basically all the football scenes/facts were made with just the vaguest information. This show has an awful plot, its not interesting, the acting is bad and the jokes are bad. However, everything about the inner-workings of a football team is surprisingly accurate (its funny how much effort they put into making sure the football related parts of the plot are accurate)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I enjoyed the show when it first aired but time has been unkind to this series. First of all the editing from the HBO original is even worse than desctibed in other posts. The episodes were shortened and the laughtrack is very noticeable and annoying.

First, the oven temperatures run about 25 degrees too low. I installed a separate oven thermometer to verify this. If I need the oven to heat up to 400, then I have to set the temperature to 425. Second, when using both ovens at the same time, the temperature in both ovens runs even lower than 25 degrees. It just plain doesn't work. Additionally, I had to pay over $200 to have the igniter replaced in the top oven, which went bad after only 2 years. Don't buy this product! It will give you nothing but problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less than satisfied","review":"This oven was in the home we recently purchased and we were really excited about having a double oven. With young kids I liked having the controls on top but you lose cooking surface. The top oven heated unevenly so I wouldn't bake in it and had to watch things closely while broiling but it could be used for cooking other items fine. Loved the convection oven on the bottom unfortunately after self cleaning it stopped working shortly after. Seemed to be an electrical issue but the repairman said both the burner and ignitor would need to be replaced. Luckily the home warranty was still in effect from our purchase so they opted to replace it instead of repair. A nice oven like this should last much longer than just a couple years.

Everyone should read this book to see how fragile, even the strongest, social ties are when a society is beset by catastrophic changes. The drought like conditions produced a famine where nobody had enough food. In prosperous times, an Ik family gave a feast when one of the family died. In the famine situation, families buried their dead secretly at night in order to avoid the necessity of giving a feast. Instead of sharing everything communally it became a matter of individual survival: when someone found some food he would eat it immediately.

Soling, who not only directed but narrates the film, also interviews a few village elders about what they remember of the visit decades ago by a Brit detractor who might have had an agenda.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Disturbing and thought-provoking...","review":"Colin Turnbull's, Mountain People, is a study and commentary on the dark side of human nature. Easily readable, and at times humorous, this account of Turnbull's fieldwork with the Ik will not produce warm fuzzies, or reestablish one's faith in the innate goodness of mankind. Anyone with an interest in anthropology, psychology, or sociology will appreciate the observations made by Turnbull. He takes a controversial stand in the book, advocating the separation and relocation of the Ik people. His reasons for making such a shocking suggestion are fully developed in the text. It is also of interest to note that Turnbull's fieldwork was done in the 60's, and much water has passed under the bridge since then... for the Ik, and the world in general."},{"rating":"1","title":"FBI P.R.","review":"Reader beware: this book is told shamelessly from the law enforcement point of view, and therefore lacks credibility.

We actually don't know how they well they were getting along in a totalitarian society, and 50 years isn't even enough for one lifetime.He also tries to say that anti-abortion sentiment might be natural, ignoring the fact that we have had ways of getting rid of unwanted children since at least the start of written history.If it wasn't for the conclusion I would give it a 5."},{"rating":"2","title":"Making Sense of Our Times","review":"This title is currently being recommended by the McLaughlin Group, the award winning public affairs televison program."},{"rating":"2","title":"Twin-study incomplete: Oversight: Non-related look-alikes!","review":"The study on monozygotic twins separated at birth is incomplete, since it totally disregards THE WHOLE PICTURE.

The 2 live sessions are very relaxed....more like a group of familiar friends having an enjoyable time in a party type atmosphere.You will hear such diverse musical personalities as Goodman, Doc Cheatham, Herbie Hancock, Zoot Sims, Joe Newman and Bernie Leighton. Most of it is thoroughly enjoyable swing interspersed with some terrific danceable selections (why not....since this was the Rainbow Grill). There are even a couple of fine vocals by a previously unknown singer to me, Annette Saunders.You will enjoy this disk if you like small group jazz in a live setting or Benny Goodman or any of the personnel I have mentioned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even works on cast-iron pots!","review":"Like everyone else who has reviewed these, I've been amazed by what they can do. I'm still discovering new uses for them, and yesterday I used one on my favorite cast-iron dutch oven. I try not to use water on it, but the oil and salt I usually scour with just wasn't working. The Magic Eraser cleaned the burned-on residue in a flash, and I didn't have to soak the pan in water. Then I just resealed with a little cooking oil and it was ready to put away. Took about 5 minutes!Last summer, before spending the $$ to replace some plastic patio furniture, I tried using Magic Erasers to clean that nasty oxidation/dirt coating that develops over time, and they worked!I was afraid they would damage the new stone tiles we put on our kitchen counters, or the enamel in the new sink, but I've been using them for several months and have seen no problems at all.They're GREAT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Product - EVER!","review":"I tried everything on our old tub to get off the hard water stains and soap scum.

If you like that classic west coast sound then this is a great CD. I only give it 4 stars because it doesnt all really flow like I feel an album should.

I also checked out his previous material, which is also garbage. While most music out of the West Coast is whack, there are a few quality artists like Snoop (in his hey day), some of the Game stuff, classic Ice Cube, etc. This simply isn't in the same league as the material I just mentioned; not even close. This stuff might be good if you're a corny LA gang-banger who does cowardly drive by shootings (as oppossed to in New York where they walk up to you and shoot you in the face), otherwise I say stay away from this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"ASTONISHING !","review":"I was astonished when I found this book in a bookstore here in Brazil.

I might even order another for future use. It's attractive and does not, so far, seem to scratch up easily. It will hold quite a few bills, but in my case it holds one credit card, two licenses, phone card, phone numbers card for work, shopping card, etc. Nine cards total with the credit card probably being the thickest. I can still add about five to six bills and the clip will lock down securely, which I really like. A good purchase. Quite satisfied. Love the lock down snap feature--your stuff doesn't all of a sudden start floating around in your pocket."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't last for us","review":"This clip was a replacement of a money clip that my husband had for years that gave out on him.

It looked nice but the quality didn't hold up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has Potential","review":"This device has some potential, but it's not close to being a professional tool. Don't plan on taking this thing on the road. One small bump and you'll hear loose screws shaking inside. The play/cue buttons are terrible too, so mixing and blending can be a pain when you have to press the button repeatedly for it to play. I can't seem to get a scratch effect either, though it's supposed to be capable of it. If that sound it makes when you spin the wheel is what they are calling scratch, then the effect needs some work. If you're just doing house parties and/or want a DJ toy, get this. Otherwise get turn tables (CD or Vinyl) and Final Scratch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Think very carefully","review":"1, The buttons are VERY poor leading to many miss-cues.2, The \\"full Professional\\" software IMO isn't, it's a cut down version and has many fundamental unresolved flaws (BPM detection, sound quality, no id3 tags, poor eq, etc).3, Early hardware versions may need returning to manufacturer for upgrade/fix before the console is usable.4, Current Problems with Win's stand-by & Hibanate may mean frequent unpluging of USB to fix lock-ups.An amusing toy, i kept mine but i will not buy from Hercules or Atomix again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken by car wash","review":"This product broken when I went through the car wash.

As a huge fan of K's Choice, I was unsure what to expect from the sound of Sarah's voice on her own. But I should not have feared, as the album is equally as strong but in a unique way. Songs like \\"Come Over Here\\" strays from the typical K's Choice song, yet is a pleasant change. Her lyrics are captivating and beautiful, and I highly recommend this CD. \\"Stay\\", \\"Turn Around\\", \\"Go\\", \\"Sister\\" and \\"I'm Okay\\" are my favorites :) Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"lee","review":"Honest fast service with a very good productI ordered the wrong board the first no problem Deal Stop made it easy and paid for the return of the product. outstanding customer service"},{"rating":"1","title":"Scooby Doo, Where are you?","review":"Good grief, this is one of the worst books I have ever read and I had an extremely tough time finishing it. The whole searching for the ghost part was absolutely ridiculous and read more like the Scooby Doo novels that I read to my son with perhaps a couple of poorly written romance scenes thrown in. I prefer to have a building attraction in my stories, not a man punishing the woman during 3/4 of the book and then suddenly realizes that his wife is not so bad after all. I kept reading it hoping that it would get better but by the time they solved the mystery at the end I actually said, \\"I would have gotten away with it too if it wasn't for you meddling kids and that dog of yours!\\".

My favorite songs are track 1, Point of difference, 3 Desperate people, 4 Devotion, and 12 Never let me go. This cd is really balanced, it has good upbeat tracks like break free and some amazing melodies like lead me to the cross. It's unique from other Hillsong cd's but I just truly love and appreciate this cd!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Album is AMAZING!!!","review":"I bought the import one straight from Hillsong Australia, but its the same cd. The tracks are amazing. Solution is the best praise song and Saviour King is one of the best worship songs that hillsong has ever done (ive heard their cds for 10 years). Point of Difference reminds me of The Time Has Come from the United We Stand cd but its different of course. Break Free is more punk, Desperate People is a good worship song, Lead Me to the Cross reminds me of the None But Jesus song a little bit. Found is the same song from Mighty to Save. My Future Decided is more of a youth punk song Never Let Me Go is a good worship song You is slower could be good for meditation Saviour King is amazing though - revolutionary powerful WOW!!!!!!!!!! I first thought of it like came to the rescue but its not - its completely new. If youre mixed about my review, buy it for Saviour King - its the new anthem Hillsong church is singing in Australia SIMPLY THE BEST!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Distorted Sound!","review":"This is the second disc we've gotten in the United set - and this one, like the last, every song is distorted.

Very fast. The book arrived in brand new condition, and I noticed that our hotel in Rome 'The Lancelot' is now listed in the directory of places to stay in Rome. There is so much information in this travel guide. Each tourist sight description is short and sweet and to the point. No pages and pages of details that might otherwise put you to sleep, as other tour books can do. And the pictures are just as wonderful.

First we tried the Skip Hop whale thing, but that was a flop - it wouldn't stay on at all. I ordered the Hippo and installed it. My son immediately loved it and deemed it \\"perfect\\". However, there was one major problem. It totally blocked the valve that switches our tub to the shower. Well my dad had a great idea - using a sharp blade he cut a small hole in the Hippo's head over the valve allowing us total access to the valve. Perfect! The Hippo stays on great and definitely fully covers the hard metal spout. After its \\"plastic surgery\\" it became a great product for us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but hard to put on.. I had to make a hole for the valve","review":"It fits very well, however, I had to make a hole to be able to use the valve. The easiest way to put it on was to take the spout out of the tub and push it hard until the cover (hippo) was on. Our daughter likes it and it looks nice. I'd probably have to keep it there until we move out of the house, to take it off is probably as hard as to put it on. I think it is safe as the rubber is thick enough to protect well in case the baby hits her head on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost there","review":"I read a review for this that states it slides off of their faucet. It does this to mine as well. How ever, I am moving to a new place soon and I hope it will fit there. What happens is that it squeezes itself off of the faucet. It is possible to cut a larger hole reducing the strain on the fit so if it slides at the new place I will just make it fit. That's what a real man does anyways when his little one wants a bubble bath."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for my project.","review":"Bought these knobs for my furniture restore project and they are just perfect.

Good stories and great history."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite lyrical rhyming Child's book","review":"Kellogg does an amazing job of illustrating this book. Each page progresses you to a different perspective, and tells a story in itself. The lyrical rhymes make it a quick, delightful read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome CD","review":"This CD is the epitome of \\"That High Lonesome Sound\\" (Track number one). Peter Rowan's voice is just awesome. The way his voice blends with Pat Enright and Alan O'Bryant gives me goose bumps.While all the songs are great, my favorite is \\"Trail of Tears\\" which just gives my goose bumps goose bumps. The harmonies are unbelievable. And the song is just well written. No matter how many times I hear this song, I still marvel at its strength.There are other great songs on the CD as well, such as \\"Like Moth to a Flame\\" and \\"Jesus Made the Wine from the Water\\" which goes along with the gospel tradition of THe Nashville Bluegrass Band.I strongly recommend this CD to anyone who enjoys awesome music, especially with strong vocals. But Stuart Duncan's sweet fiddling surely brings up the instrumental side.Awesome, awesome CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing. nothing new here in a \\"Me Too\\" Buk Book.","review":"I was not impressed with this thin book of anecdotes of Charles Bukowski. You get very little content here as the author's short time spent with Bukowski is just a glossing over of the mans life.The book covers a very short time period where the author and photographer/friend Claude Powell spent drinking and talking about Buk's life.Basically, you get some accounts of his past experiences and some pictures of Bukowski drunk.I gave two stars because the pictures by Claude Powell were good and kind of funny. There is much more thorough material out there than this short book. I recommend you try the Howard Sounes biography \\"Locked in the arms of a crazy life\\" or \\"Bukowski in Pictures\\" which is a supplement by Sounes with many good pictures and text that didn't make the biography."},{"rating":"1","title":"The buk book: musings on charles bukowski","review":"A shallow treatment, written by what must be a graduate school reject. Somebody who--though he makes it a point to say he corresponded with Bukowski favorably--Bukowski would have hated. A phoney. I ordered it for a class I teach and found it completely unusable. A series of anecdotes--rehashes of autobiograhpical short stories--strung together by half baked theroies. The lesson is that just because somebody loves to read an author doesn't mean they can write well at all about that author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Coy and claustrophoba-inducing","review":"Based on the jacket blurb, I was hoping this would be a fun, literate romantic comedy. After the first two chapters, however, I found myself wishing Helen had a richer inner life, since Schine spends almost all her time detailing Helen's thoughts and feelings. Helen is too complacent and sold on her own charm and flirtatiousness to be interesting as a character we're supposed to identify with wholeheartedly. Jane Austen or Barbara Pym would know how to use irony to give us a larger perspective on Helen, but Schine really seems to expect us to fall in love with Helen. The references to books and reading (Helen owns a bookshop) end up feeling dropped in, since Helen never seems convincing as a reader and lover of books. The cutesy quality of the plot and some of the language, along with Helen's self-obsession, end up giving the novel a claustrophobic feeling."},{"rating":"1","title":"a chore to finish","review":"I will not give a synopsis of the book because it has already been provided. However, I will caution, do not read this book if you are a reader who likes a heavy plotline. There is minimal plot in this book. One would therefore expect more character development. But, alas, there is minimal character development as well. Characters start off selfish and superficial, and remain so throughout the book. I wish I could say that the writing was good, but I felt it was bloated and repetitive. Phrase embedded within phrase simply slowed the pace of the already-slow story for me. Somewhere in this book, however, was the promise of a good story.(hence the two stars.) Tighter writing, a heavy editing hand, and perhaps more likable characters would have brought out the essential story question...how can a romance between an older woman bookseller and a younger college guy survive? (WARNING: SPOILER) Unfortunately, however, the ending is not resolved and the author drops the ball."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and Pointless","review":"I struggled to read this book....It was a waste of time......The characters were very superficial and the story had very little depth.....what a disappointment.......and I'm a reader who can find pleasure in reading a milk carton......."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring.","review":"This book really tries too hard. I read through the first several chapters, and was so bored with it, I accidentally left it on a plane. Now I have to buy a copy to replace my library's, although I do not wish this book on anyone. There are better novels out there worthy of your time & money. Maybe the end gets better, but I don't think you should have to suffer through the first part of a book just for a happy ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big disappointment for those seeking romance","review":"I bought The Love Letter because of all the positive press. I'd just finished reading Wally Lamb's I Know This Much Is True, a fairly weighty 900-page saga, and was looking for something light, fresh and romantic. Unfortunately, I did not find what I was looking for in The Love Letter; every character was embellished beyond belief - no one had a simple thought or action. I put the book down before reaching the halfway mark and consider it a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"At least I won't waste time seeing the movie!!","review":"My friend and I were intrigued by the write-up on the back of the cover and we decided to read it together. Hard to say which one of us liked the novel least. There were no sympathetic characters, the writing style is completely unsophisiticated and the \\"mystery\\" didn't hold our interest. We're still blaming each other for picking it out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING!!! The best part of the book is the cover design.","review":"I managed to read this through to the end and I thanked God it was a short book. I kept waiting for something to happen to spark my interest. Halfway through I figured it was a lost cause, but then I wondered how the author was going to finish this \\"banal\\" little story. I would not even recommend this book as a summer vacation book. Not worth your time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother reading this book!!!!","review":"When I first started seeing the hype for this book,I thought it would be good. But, it isn't. I was extremely dissapointed. It's so boring and dull that I didn't even bother finishing it. If I could, I'd give this book a zero. I got myself 3/4 read, but was so digusted by the story and characters I couldn't finish. Helen is a self-absorbed, sef-centered women. Is Johnny 20 or 10? I couldn't tell. If I were you, don't read it. It's a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointing Read","review":"I had purchased this book awhile ago but decided to read it when I heard that Kate Capshaw had optioned it for a movie. What a disappointment. It's boring. The love story is banal. Helen is obnoxious. There's not much of a plot. This is what Hollywood thinks would make an interesting movie? Which underwritten character is Tom Selleck playing?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious and Condescending","review":"This is only slightly better than The Evolution of Jane. The female characters are shallow, arragant and bitchy. Frankly, the characterizations of the women seem to be written by a bitter man instead of a woman. I've thrown good money after bad on this author and won't make the same mistake again. I sincerely hope that the forthcoming screenplay left out 95% of the book and rewrote the rest."},{"rating":"1","title":"PURE FLUFF!","review":"Maybe it's only a matter of taste, but this book was one step above Danielle Steel! Perfect Helen with her perfect relationship with her perfect daughter was annoying and boring, and the whole story would have been a waste if not for the atmosphere of the bookstore and some of the characters who both worked and shopped there. The only likeable character was Johnny, and of course, he falls in love with Perfect Helen, ignoring the two nineteen year old college students he is working with! I do think, however, that this book will make a cute movie (which is currently being filmed in Rockport, MA starring Kate Capshaw as Helen)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every woman's Fantasy","review":"I am wondering, had I read this book before I saw the movie, would I have enjoyed it as much?? And I did enjoy it!! But I think I kept visualizing scences from the movie as I read, which gave the book more depth. I found Helen terribily unlikeable and arrogant(or was I just jealous). It made me long to live beside the sea, surrounded by books in my own bookshop, and fall passionately in love!! It was the sort of book that had a lingering effect upon me. Although, I felt the ending to be absurd, it was none the less a warm, feel-good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"superb!!","review":"I just had to write and tell everyone how much I enjoyed this book. It stays with me still, though I read it weeks and weeks ago. It is very well written, witty, surprising, and above all, refreshing. Thank you Ms. Schine!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the time","review":"I have never read a book with such shallow and silly characters. The plot would be probable if the characters were stronger and better developed. I tried to find sympathy for the main characters, but they have no redeeming qualities that the reader can admire. The plot and point of view seems to jump without warning or reason, and it is difficult to keep track of what is happening. I tried to focus on the book, but I skimmed through the last 150 pages, not even caring how it ended."},{"rating":"1","title":"the\\"love letter\\" was the best part then....","review":"I thought this book would be a good summer read, something to remember vicariously the love affair I recently had with a lover 13 years younger than me. I was so disappointed, and have put this book down and picked it up so many times I can't count, each time hoping for some redemption of the plot, the shallow characters, and the frustrating tone of the book. I needed to cheat sheet to keep track of the names of the characters because they were each so forgettable and uninteresting. Nowhere could I connect with any of them, nor feel anything with them. When I read a book I want to go there and be part of the story as it unfolds. I found I didn't want to be in Pequot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredible--incredibly bad, that is.","review":"Like many other readers of this book, I bought this book after hearing that it was optioned for a movie. I find that movie-books are often fun, atmospheric, and plot-driven. Good beach reading, I thought. Wrong! The characters and the plot are alternately uninteresting and repellent. I got halfway through the book and was about to give up, when I read that the author's husband was David Denby on the book jacket. I thought, \\"Her husband is a great writer and movie reviewer, this book must have some redeeming qualities.\\" Wrong again! I actually think that the book got worse after the halfway mark. This is one of the worst books I have ever read from start to finish."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I wouldn't have wasted my money!!!","review":"There's a difference between making love and what she said. There was no romance or sensuality.

I thought I read a good review of it somewhere, or maybe I just read the reviews in the book itself, but after I made the mistake of buying it, there was no way I could read more than a few pages. It was so trite. I was able to resell it at a used book store, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"If only you have a zero star rating...","review":"This book ranks at the top of my Most Boring book list. I finished it only because I couldn't admit I have made such a poor selection. I bought the book based on the critic's praises at the front of the book. Now I know better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Fun","review":"For me, this was a painful read. Pages upon pages of description - definitely enough adjectives to slow the pace, muck up the flow, and irritate the reader. And for what, I'm not quite sure. Because there were no themes in the book that warranted such detail, really. The story line is for lack of a better term - boring. The main character - unlikeable. And while I recognize many enjoy this book, I was never so glad to finish a novel and move on to something better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible...I couldn't finish.","review":"By mid-way nothing had happened that was remotely interesting. The character of Helen came across as a domineering 40ish woman who had no friends (although everyone was supposedly in love with her for whatever reason) who hung out with her teenaged employees and obsessed over a ridiculous letter. I couldn't care less who wrote the letter or what happened to Helen so I gave up before wasting more of my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected ...","review":"Though I persevered to the end, the book was a sleeper. It went in circles the whole way through. The basis seemed good but I thought it needed a lot more substance. The movie has to be better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrid.","review":"I picked up this book because I heard the movie was coming out and wanted to see that. It was a torturous read to say the least. I thought it was very boring and the characters seemed flimsy for lack of a better word. The last 50 pages or so are alright but it's not really worth reading through the first 200 to get to them. Wouldn't recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Reader","review":"My book club read this book. All of us in the group thought the book was boring and dull. The whole book seemed liked an introduction. Never getting to the story. Nothing ever gets going. We didnt even like the main character. Nor could we even get into the other characters. I havent seen the movie yet so I dont know if thats like the book or if its any good. But dont waste your time with this book......Boring!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"I tried to like this book, but by page 61, I had to put it down. The main charachter, Helen, is a self-absorbed tramp and an unfit mother. She kisses people on a whim. She flirts and sleeps with anyone in town. She talks about how much she misses her daughter, who is away at camp, but I don't believe that she thinks of anyone by herself. She drops the F-bomb casually, as if that were speech becoming of a lady...which she is not. The plot is absurd. That she could be as callous and crude as she is represented to be and as popular as she is also purported to be, is impossible. This character is lewd, obstinant, selfish, childish, and impetuous. Do not pick this book up unless you admire loose women who are horrible mothers. Disgusting, and not a very funny book, either."},{"rating":"1","title":"A huge disappointment","review":"I enjoyed Alice in Bed years ago and thought I'd like this one -- I had to force myself to finish it.

The sisters become closer, in spite of their detached father and younger-than-all-of-them new stepmother.

That is not the case, it only plays mp3s according to the company's website, despite the fact that the box bears the 'Plays Windows Media' logo and it is advertised as having a 'Windows Media Plugin'. The reason it is important that a player utilize wma files is because they take up half the space of a mp3 file so you are able to fit twice as many songs on the player.The case of the player feels very weak and the button that is used to skip tracks is very cheap, it feels as if it is going to break when you touch it.If you are looking for a quality mp3 player I would recommend the iRiver T180 or the Creative MuVo.

But still, I can use it to go running with the arm strap, or hang it around my neck when I'm walking. So, I'm overall very happy with my purchase and have no regrets."},{"rating":"1","title":"run away from this product","review":"this product stinks. i recieved one for my 21 birthday and im returning it . all it is is a hastle okay ya sure the player has style but downloading music is a task in itself i would not reccomend this product to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped working","review":"This MP3 player worked for only a few weeks. The second time I tried to add music to it my relatively new Windows XP computer would not recognize the device when it was attached via USB. The MPIO website had several fixes, none of which worked. Their final recommendation was to use another operating system such as Windows 2000 or ME. It is nice and small and had good sound when it did work. It seems to be a very unreliable device based on comments on the manufacturer's website and my experience. I would not recommend it; it has been a big disappointment. The manual was very brief and offered no solutions to my problem. The website was full of grammatical errors and looked like it was translated from Korean by a translating program. I am returning it and finding another well known product instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT PURCHASE THIS DEVICE","review":"It plays music just fine- it's getting music to download to this MP3 player that's the problem.I am a computer programmer, builder and consultant. I know computers. This device fails to recognize when you plug it into the USB port. When you do locate drivers, it then fails to recognize in windows media player. Necesitating the download of their MPIO Manager 2 from their website, or from the CD.Now - your problems are just starting.When you actually do get it to connect, expect multiple hangs, failures, and other problems.Downloading songs will be a trial of hit and miss. It's almost like this thing can't take more than 2 or 3 megs of data before hanging. I'll get 1 or 2 songs loaded, and then it will just stop.I have (after much trial and failed uploads to the MP3 player) updated to the latest firmware, and I have downloaded and installed the latest software and plug-ins.None seem to get this MP3 player working.RUN- don't walk away from this player."},{"rating":"1","title":"No reason to buy this","review":"I bought this player a year and a half ago, and it's really not worth getting. I had serious compatibility issues uploading songs onto the thing, it got so bad that only one in about ten tries would successfully work, and sometimes if you were uploading one song it would freeze and corrupt the entire memory. As long as you weren't changing songs it worked ok, but that's hardly a justification for it's flaws. It's possible this was just a compatibility problem with my pc, but I wouldn't tell anybody to risk that anyway. I personally won't ever risk buying a digital way product for a while.For the same price as this you can get a Samsung YP-MT6X 512 mb mp3 player, that is better than this one in ever way:- it plays OGG and WMV files- it has 4 times the memory- it has 4 times the battery life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't get a MPIO","review":"1.

The size is amazingly small but the sound quality is great!The software that comes with the player is a little difficult to understand, but I took their advice and downloaded the plug-in for Real One Player. I find it easier to use and with many more features. I do save my favorite cds as mp3 and the sound quality does not diminish.I agree with the previous reveiwer about the headphones...the ones provided, though great sound, are very short. Great if clipped to shirt pocket or armband, but not to your shorts or even holding it at arm length. I bought another good quality earbud and am using that instead.Overall....good quality, good features, great sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good product","review":"This is a great product. The sound quality is very good. It is easy to transfer songs to it. It is compact and very comfortable to run with. The only minus that I have found is that its battery level gauge is misleading. You would expect that 2 out 3 lines on the battery scale means that you have quite a lot of battery power left, but this is not the case and 2 out of 3 should be actually interpreted as close to empty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dishonest seller, this is not a Denman brush","review":"The brush is advertised as the D6 Denman brush but this is a dishonest description on the part of the seller.

There are many others out there just like it that won't.I've had several of these. They break. I guess glue will fix it but they should just make them properly in the first place.

Aside from agreeing with the other reviewers who say it falls apart and is basically useless as a \\"garage\\", our particular toy came out of the box already broken. It doesn't make any sound. Unfortunately the receipt is long gone and I cannot return it to the store. Such a disappointment for my boys, too, because they were so excited by the picture on the box. But I absolutely refuse to spend money on a replacement.If you're like me and feel the urge to buy this toy despite the bad reviews, do your homework and find the lowest possible price first.

Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total POS","review":"We saw this toy on our way out of Toys R Us, it was at the customer service counter because somebody had returned it. That alone should have been reason enough not to buy it. We came home and put it together only to discover what a total piece of junk it was. However, once we ditched the ramps my son really enjoyed the main portion of the toy that has all the buttons and stuff. We kept it for that reason alone. He does play with it, so it wasn't a complete waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment","review":"We bought this toy for our son Christmas of 2007. I always like to unpack the toys before we wrap them and I couldn't even get the toy to stay together. I returned it and picked up another one, and it stayed together so I wrapped it. When my little boy, then 1 1/2 played with it on Christmas, it fell apart. The ramps do not stay on, and the support legs are virtually useless. This was the same problem for both toys.

Save your money and pass this thing by."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this!","review":"Trust me - do not waste your time buying this toy. The cars are too wide for the ramps so they get stuck at the top. Surely they tested this toy before putting it out on the market but apparently didn't care that it doesn't work properly.

However, I soon found out that the cars don't fit properly on the ramps so they only move an inch or so before you have to give them another push. It also has a very poorly constructed frame - I find that the entire garage falls apart easily if moved a lot (which of course is what kids do). Just walking through the house makes the garage start talking which is pretty annoying. I inquired at Fisher Price whether this item was suppose to function this poorly or if maybe I had gotten a defective model and they couldn't give me any information on how it was \\"suppose\\" to work. I would definitely suggest finding another garage."},{"rating":"1","title":"No good!","review":"I also had trouble with the ramps. Everytime you attempt to move the garage, it falls apart.

The frame was horribly constructed, it says \\"no tools required\\" yet when you put it together, nothing pops or snaps into place. The support legs under the ramp don't even stand flush to the ground, they sort of dangle. Like someone else said, this is supposed to be for a toddler yet falls apart at the slightest touch.

Do not purchase this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Add a B to Garage, and you get GARBAGE","review":"This was one of the toys we most looked forward to our 18 month-old son opening. We could NOT believe how shoddy the workmanship was. I would much rather use tools to construct something worthwhile than be seduced by the easy to set up, no tools necessary, claim of Fisher Price. We considered taking it back to the store in exchange for another one (on the off chance that the one we got was simply defective), but after reading the reviews here, we know our problems are not ours alone.

The slower pace is very relaxing and it is nice being able to relax knowing there WON'T be any bad, dirty humor/curse words/or adult sense. ***In Season 2, however, the very last epsiode, Misfits and Miracles, has Sarah helping Janet King ( Lally Cadeau ) to deliver her baby without any other adults present.

So many times when I read books that are in a series I find that the previous characters may be mentioned but there is no real connection between them and the new characters. I realize authors do not want to take away from the main characters in the new story however this series is a fantastic example of how to bring them together without down playing the plot of the new story.I first discovered this author in the anthology \\"Out of This World\\" and enjoyed her story so much that I immediately began searching for more.

This book contains the first three of this series: \\"Twilight Phantasies,\\" \\"Twilight Memories,\\" and Twilight Illusions.\\" The first two I didn't like as much as the others I read. They were too tamed and reminded me too much of Christine Freehan. The vampires are so overly nice. Also, the plot centers only around the romance. The third, I found was much, much better. Probably because there was a mystery to solve and it was not all sex. I think there was only two sex scenes in all.

That concept also irked me; that only certain people could be made into vampires because they had the Belladonna angtigen in their blood. It was a bit too discriminating for my tastes. Also, the characters themselves were not that intriguing, and i found the stories boring and slow. it was a fight just to finish the book.

Brennan Manning is a Franciscan priest who attempted to marry without being dispensed from his vow of celibacy in 1982. He has since peddled a false gospel that is built around the idea that God's pardon is unconditional - a euphemism for saying that you can be forgiven for your sins without repenting and amending your life. This is a lie, and a defense mechanism Fr. Manning has evolved to assuage his guilty conscience. If you really want to seek the Mercy of God, I suggest you read \\"Divine Mercy in my soul\\", the diary of St. Faustina, avaulable here on Amazon.com. God's Mercy is endless, but you cannot be pardoned if you are not sorry; Fr. Manning's false gospel will do you no more spiritual good than it has done him. He needs your prayers and your pity - not your money or your reading time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Total straight-shooter","review":"This guy dares to speak the truth, even at the risk of offending the \\"church\\" or many in the church who want to skate by without experiencing the true person of Jesus and what he wants of us. I have never read a book so blunt, honest and profound when it comes to how Jesus loves us and wants the same kind of love to eminate from us. But, I warn, this is not a simple feel-good \\"God is love\\" kind of book; it is challenging, thought-provoking and very convicting. If you have ever been burned by the church or just feel uncomfortable about church, but still are seeking God, I highly recommend this book because it takes everything back to the basics (without being basic or overly-simplistic), which is who Jesus really is. Highly recommend to everyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Judge the fruit","review":"One sentence in the book changed my life. \\"God's love is base on no thing.\\" I can't tell you how much I needed to hear that. God loves me for no reason other then love itself. Manning writes in a way that brings peace to my soul. If you are in a dry place and needing a love letter from Jesus, then The Relentless Tenderness of Jesus is a good choice. While some have difficulty with Manning's message of God's grace, I have found nothing in his writings that contradicts solid biblical theology. Obviously, as you can see from the small amount of negative critiques, Manning does have his detractors, but all his writings have ever done for me is to allow me to experience God's love and share it with others.Pastor Adam Stadtmiller Author:Give Your Kids the Keys: Navigating Your Child to a Personal and Sustainable Faith"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Resource","review":"This book has been helpful in completing our rebuild project.

Also, they tell you to use lubricants that are not common, which can be substituted with a more common lubricant.If you have the money to blow, it probably is good to have this guide, as it is the \\"official\\" one, but I would recommend the Haynes guide above this one any day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most important book for beetle repair!!","review":"The only way to go is factory information.

But at least we get to see the seamy underbelly of an American city (New Orleans), Charlie's acting at his best (as \\"Jeff Heston\\"), and some really first-rate cinematography. What does he say about the violent city to Jill Ireland? Something like, \\"It's always there, you just only see it when you're with me.\\" The rest of the movie, at least for me, was not up to the same level. But still Bronson in his prime.

To spend money on a set that features 15-minute cartoons to find that it has a useless \\"play all\\" function is really a returnable flaw -- Anyone who likes this show is usually inclined to sit back and chill with friends and watch the episodes one on top of the other. Here, when you hit \\"play all\\" the screen breaks into 15 or so picture in picture boxes in which all the episodes begin playing simultaneously to a cacophony of sounds, rendering it of course useless. So, one has to go bakc to the menus every ten minutes to cue up another episode.

There is no way to play episodes consecutively automatically. You have to select each individual episode AND choose whether or not to have commentary on or off.It would be a nice joke if there was actually a way to play all episodes normally.

All formal flair...and very little else. Clover DOES experiment wonderfully and fascinatingly with the surface shimmer of his subjects, but this kind of willed approach to the making of poems results, too often I think, in work that borders on the offensive. (A meditation on the Holocaust, for example, becomes a light-hearted, witty exercise in form.) This is a major award--the Whitman--and likely to make Clover's career.

However, the book offers insights on how people behave during war, good and bad. I felt that the best chapter was the conclusion, where it was pointed out that there is a difference between a violent population and a population that is subjected to continued disruptive violent incursions.

'Always' is the highlight here, a rare weezer ballad (the only other one I know of is 'Butterfly') with a McCartney-ish melody and some Harrison-ish guitar work a-la 'Here Comes the Sun'. It's also a green album leftover, and would have been good on the album to cut down on the monotony.

But under their long time guest conductor Wolfgang Sawallisch, this is a Mozart orchestra par excellence. Sawallisch always has been convincing in the standard German repertoire, and never more so than here. Symphonies 38 and 39 are brimming with vitality, as every subordinate feature comes to life in Sawallisch's strong but flexible interpretations. His tempo for the first movement of No. 40 may be on the fast side, but he never skimps on the music's details and always has a strong sense of structure. His Jupiter is large and commanding, building up momentum all the way along. With very good late analogue sound (from 1978 and 1980), these are central recommendations in the Mozart discography."},{"rating":"2","title":"Got the dream job","review":"This is an excellent book for military retirees and others who have not interviewed for jobs in recent times.

If you belong to the first school, DON'T BUY THIS BOOK! The book is poorly documented and as such, asks you to make an incredible leap of faith based solely on the author's personal experience. If you are of the second school, BUY THIS BOOK! As a former distance runner, I was already a believer in the inherent power of the changes the book promotes.

And its ending (punchline would be too big a word) is far from unpredictable - you figure out who the bad guy is about ten minutes after he appears for the first time.

The DVD version has great quality video and surround sound, but at parts background sounds may block out dialogue."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must","review":"I think this movie was one of the best new cop movies around.

Unlike many of the earlier reviews, therefore, I did not have The Fugitive in mind as a comparison with this one. From that perspective, it is not a distinctive nor a distinguished film but is a good one to occupy a couple of hours. Predictable or not, the action is plentiful, the suspense not intense but present, the lead characters well played and the movement rapid enough so as to to make you wait for some action to interrupt the talk. Jones is a bit more irritating than when in a top vehicle but plays his part well, Snipes is not given much time to develop his character but also does well, the others are up to par with a couple coming through with more impact. All in all watchable and forgettable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie, but a repeat of \\"The Fugitive\\"","review":"This movie was awesome, but it was a repeat of The Fugitive.

Why did the studio bother to put out a mediocre film that is a semi-sequel to the first, much better film? To make money, obviously. Studios do it all the time, but this film isn't a full fledged sequel, like I said before, it's a semi-sequel. In a way it almost redoes the first film but not in a good way. Jones, as always, is good here but is not given much to work with here and Snipes turns in a rather bland performance.

Don't worry, I'm the only one) and because it was a sequal to my most favourite of movies.But if you're not considering this movie because of your fantatical devotion to a single actor or series, then take your time deciding. The director was a first-timer, the plot is almost completely identical to the Fugitive (except...Tommy Lee Jones and Wesley Snipes aren't as cool together as Tommy and Harrison) and there are a fair number of awkwardly done 'funny bits'.

It is truly plug and play via the USB port - it doesn't require separate software or drivers, or even a system restart for that matter. I just hooked it up and was using it in less than half a minute. Both buttons and the scroll wheel perform admirably. The self-winding cord works like a charm too.

Maybe it's just the particular mouse I bought, though.On the POSITIVE side, it's still pretty neat, fits well in my small but clumsy hands, and IS definitely handy when space is an issue.

It retracts and saves room in the Targus bag that I carry everything in. What I like the most is if I have the mouse right next to the netbook, I only unreel a couple inches of cord instead of having to have a long cord getting in the way.

The tiny size is no hardship and it was efficient and otherwise awesome. For six weeks. I woke up today to discover it no longer allows you to open pages with a scroll wheel click.

Any surface that has any sort of red tint or any kind of dark surface it seems to dislike. The pointer will jump around randomly because of this.2) The mouse will occasionally click twice when you only click once. This causes you to accidentally close windows you didn't want to and open files that you dont want to. It is very frustrating.Other than that, I like the design.

Ruthless militarists with a habit of striking before they're quite ready, they have been defeated several times in Niven's own work. Since he has opened up the Man-Kzin war period of his future history to other writers,we now have a chance to see the Kzin as he sees himself. Kzinti society is very social-darwinist, but easy to understand in some ways, and lacks the built-in tension in our own culture between the ideals we set for ourselves and our deeper, predatory instincts. Chuut-Riit, the main character, is a talented leader trying to ensure his race's eventual victory over those monkeys from Earth.

Recycling old plots is an honored sci-fi tradition, but here Pournelle and Stirling combine at least two or three and can't really make a unified whole out of them. I found the \\"Casablanca\\" references distracting, the Kzinti childrens' quarters irrelevant, and the Thrint subplot extraneous, and (as in \\"The Stone Dogs\\") even Stirling couldn't give me a believable, comprehensible war in space.

A doctor, in effect, tells him that he is a hopeless case. Another doctor refers him to a Pain Unit, where he embarks on an arduous road to recovery. The staff there consists of experts in the techniques of physical and psychological therapies. The reader gets an insider's view of the way these treatments are carried out, along with Ed's emotional reactions to them. He works hard under the staff's direction, and the results are dramatic.As a physician, specializing in psychiatry, I found this book clear and fascinating. It gives an inside-out view of psychosomatic medicine. It should be read by all health professionals as well as by all who suffer from chronic pain."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you suffer from chronic pain","review":"I met the author of this book at a writers' club where he read a few pages from his book. I decided to buy it right then because I come across many people with chronic pain. I have never seen a book about someone's personal experience with this problem before. I just finished the book. Reading it you live through his stay at the Pain Unit with him. It is very easy to read and picture the events. There are no long-winded discussions of theories. Just the facts. I think this is a worthwhile book for anyone who works with or suffers from chronic pain, especially low back pain. It shows you that there is hope."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite Dreadful","review":"This game was quite dreadful, as RPGs go. First of all they couldn't even put enough effort into it to make the graphics even half that of the original Diablo. The game-play is decent enough and simple, which I believe to be a plus, but the story-line far too generic and has no real substance. I suggest you go play the original Diablo or Diablo II before you waste time on this game. You may possibly wish to go ahead and play the demo first, just google search for it, to see how horrible it is for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good So Far","review":"I bought this game after having been extremely disappointed with Dungeon Lords.

It actually works, you can customize your character, and you don't have to spend hours traipsing from village to village without an automap or even a teleport spell. Woohoo!The graphics don't suck, there is actual music in the background, and the voice effects actually work.If you're tired of crappy games and are looking for a fantasy RPG that actually does work as advertised, pick this up.

We got this boat for me, which is a little bigger, and the very similar smaller boat for her. Once you get the hang of it, the setup is easy, though breaking it down to fit in the bag is a little more challenging. It performs very well and is a lot of fun. Though it rides higher than our tandem, and therefore catches more wind, it also takes on less water in chop (without a spray skirt). It's maneuverable and tracks fairly well. It's also very comfortable, as I had no pain in my low back like I get in my tandem and similar boats I've tried. The construction seems durable, though I've only used it for a week at Long Pond on Cape Cod.

At Target, one can purchase a whole manicure set for less than the price of these.These are not as good of a quality as the ones I was replacing - I had inherited my previous nippers from my grandmother and they were probably manufactured decades ago. In particular, the metal seems way too soft. When I was initially opening the package, the nippers fell out of the package and onto my tile floor and one of the tips got smashed in. The result is that they only work well on one side (when the good tip is closest to what I am trying to cut).

I can only speculate as to why this is so. I have read numerous books about the Jewish experience and most all of them have been superior to The Ladies Auxiliary. This book is a pedestrian exploration of the Orthodox Jewish community of Memphis. None of the characters emerge in any compelling way. Batsheva is the convert/outsider who becomes the fulcrum of acrimony among the Ladies Auxiliary. But the ladies who consider her a threat are burdened with cartoonish characterizations. The plot crawls along at a not very compelling pace. By the time I slogged my way to the end of this book I was relieved to be rid of Batsheva and her cohorts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sophomoric and Saccharine","review":"A positive view of the Orthodox community? Come on! These women -- even Batsheva, the \\"heroine,\\" the iconoclastic outsider, convert who dares to dress and think a little differently and who maybe even sinned once or twice in her almost forgotten past -- are narrow, petty, nosy, gossiping, lamebrained. As characters in a novel they are predictable and banal. If I lived in a \\"community\\" like the one depicted I would run away, too. The writing is childlike and plodding and overly saccharine; hardly a biting satire. And the plot? A teenager leaves the community and so does the rabbi's son, and finally some people realize it's not the fault of the iconoclastic outsider. Spare me. Find another creative writing program. I wonder sometimes: with all the good writing going on, how does something like this get published?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A book that aspires to be lackluster.","review":"This book has all the depth of a petri dish. There are no fresh insights into the human condition. The characters are flat, uninteresting and unsympathetic. The dialogue is trite. I was so frustrated with the book that I was hoping that the ladies of Memphis would succeed in driving Batsheva from their midst. I found her character to be insipid and uninspired. Don't be mislead by all the other positive reviews. This is not quality fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"A light and entertaining read!","review":"\\"The Ladies...\\" was pretty good. It had its good points and its bad points. I was a bit shocked at how kosher Jewish people are, but after a while it sort of blended together.

However, there was nothing really driving the story and it was tedious to finish because there was nothing to look forward to. The characters showed the flaws of us all but they were unrealistic in many ways. I found it hard to believe that a communty like this really exists."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting depiction of place but plodding storyline","review":"I am afraid I have to agree with those who thought this novel was lackluster. While I enjoyed the foray into the Orthodox Jewish community of Memphis, which I did not even know existed, I found the story line to be plodding and not very innovative. The characterization was sterotypical and I found Batsheva to be too \\"perfect\\" in many ways. There was also too much foreshadowing with little to anticipate. The moral of the story was nothing new and the inability of the Jewish women to see the reality around them was a bit unbelievable. Really couldn't wait for the novel to end after the first half of the book. I enjoyed the descriptions of Jewish holidays and rituals, however. It was informative and interesting and added to the story immeasurably. Without the southern-influenced Jewish food, I don't think I could have made it to the end!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly enjoyable","review":"I was pleasantly surprised by this book. I hadn't heard anything about it before picking it up so I didn't have any expectations about what I might find. The insight given to the lives of Orthodox Jews was fascinating. The characters were fully formed and real. There were many thought provoking themes regarding religion, spirituality, friendship, judging others, expectations, independence, family, etc. that I've continued to think about since finishing the book. The unique narrative style worked well and I really enjoyed Mirvis's writing style. She made me feel like I was a part of the community instead of just a distant observer."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Ladies Auxiliary","review":"This book is amazing! You really get swept into the characters lives and feel for the main characters. As a Jew working with Jews-by-Choice and interfaith couples, I find the response of the \\"Ladies\\" to be realistic and unfortunate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't live up to its promise","review":"After a fascinating prologue, this book falls flatter and flatter with each succeeding chapter. The characters become two-dimensional stereotypes, the plot slows to a crawl, the humor degenerates into preachiness. This book starts out with great promise but ultimately devolves into mediocrity. Such a shame!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry to be a wet blanket, but...!","review":"So many people seem enthusiastic about this book, but I can't help wondering how much actual literature (as opposed to pulp novels) these \\"Ladies' Auxiliary\\" aficianados have read.

I can't figure out what the reviewers in the front of the book are raving about. Reading this book was like trudging through mud up to my knees. In fact, I put it down when I was about one-quarter through, and read 3 other books before I picked it up again. I kept hoping it would get better. It didn't. I found the use of the first-person plural pronoun for the narrative voice very annoying. Although, I don't think any voice could overcome the slow-moving and boring story."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Unkindest Cut of All","review":"The monthly book club selection sounded like a real find. I looked forward to reading this crosscultural award winning selection about my Hebrew brethren. I plunged in with great enthusiasm. Like a swim through whipped cream.

I cried at the book's climax when the women reach a new level of spiritual understanding. I think the struggles of all the characters to find a place for themselves in a tradition and maintain that tradition, speak to all people who are challenged to find spiritual meaning among the mundane."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a letdown!","review":"The blurb on this book sounded terrific. The actual book was bad! The writing was stilted, the characters shadowy and unreal. The heroine whas too much just that, a heroine. I expected her to appear in a Wonder Woman outfit at any moment, except that it wouldn't have been modest enough for her Orthodox Jewish persona. There were no shades of gray in the characters - either all good or all bad. And are we really expected to believe that such stereotyped characters really exist? Ms. Mirvis paints the small, tight Orthodox Jewish community as not only small town, but small minded, and not only ready but eager to destroy anyone who isn't like them. As a Jew, it made me uncomfortable. I'm sure there really are women such as these, but do they really need to be Jewish? The author makes some good points about needless gossip, about jumping to conclusions, etc. However, I think she felt she had to bludgeon the reader with her opinions. A little subtlety would have been nice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better than root canal","review":"This book was selected by a local community group for a review session.Prior to attending the review, I thought it was one of the most poorly written books I had ever read. The characters seemed unreal, the plot contrived and the writing tedious at best. The book provoked an intense range of emotional responses from the women in the book club.They clearly saw aspects of themselves and their neighbors in the characters. The confrontation between tradition and modernity, as well as the duplicitous face of communal kindness, are strong thematic tensions in the book. Based on information shared at the book review,these tensions mirrored people's own experiences. Reluctantly, I admit the book is useful in touching on truths that would otherwise remain unexplored."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't quite work","review":"It's all a little too pat, Tova Mirvis' debut novel -- the free spirit, the gossipping yentas, a world turned upside down. The characters rarely emerge from two dimensions, and the Memphis setting could be any city with a small Jewish community -- or small ethnic community. The one attempt at experimentation, the first-person-plural viewpoint, should have been put aside. Mirvis has talent, but this novel should have been left in a drawer as a guidebook for the next project."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT FISH BASKET","review":"Excellent! LOVE IT.

Meaning once a a fish cooks and becomes tender, it will very easily begin to fall apart. Maybe this works on giant fish, but anything under 2lbs and it won't work.

Otherwise you need a basket that will hold it securely as it cooks."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK for large pieces","review":"I bought this product because it got a great review on America's Test Kitchen. I liked the idea that you could remove the handle and \\"shut\\" the grill cover - instead of having the handle stick out.

It helps a lot to spray the baskets w/ Pam before grilling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slips thru","review":"Unfortunately, anything less than a whole fish will slip thru the slots in this cage.

The All-Clad cookware has the most amazingly cool handles so I expected the same. The maximum fill line for water is 1/3 down from the top, making the kettle a larger size than it needs to be for the recommended capacity. The balance point when pouring is not optimum and the handle flexes with the weight of the kettle and water. The whistle needs to be removed by hand when pouring then reinserted afterwards. The spring detent is stiff and makes this operation potentially risky. On the positive side, it does boil water rapidly, the whistle sounds good, and the spout doesn't drip."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look somewhere else","review":"After many years of using Magnalite I bought new AllClad LTD cookware, including this teapot.

It was almost identical to this one. My original developed a leak at the weld around the spout, and I took it back under warranty and received this style as a replacement. I HATE IT. It's not as pretty, because the spout lines are different (they fixed the weld issue which elongated the base of the spout in an awkward flat spot) and they added plastic to the underside of the handle. The new spout shape causes the kettle to spit water all over the place when pouring. Also, water leaks out of the lid when you pour. So it's difficult to not get burned, while also not making a mess, and never mind actually putting water in the cup where you want it. Plus, the plastic handle gets very hot. I am really, horribly disappointed and see this as the end to my loyalty as an All Clad customer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big All-Clad fan","review":"Love the stainless All-Clad line, and I have many pieces.

The \\"stay cool\\" handle gets very hot and if you want to use the whistle feature, you need to pull the piping hot whistle from the pour spout in order to pour out the water and put it back in after each use. Not worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice, quality product.","review":"PROS: Fit very well. Great color match. Seem to be constructed well. CONS: Obviously, price. Website did not specify with or WITHOUT manual, floor mounted 4x4 lever(so I have a gap). The 'mounting system' is rediculous. The 'trim caps' dont fit well and they CERTAINLY wont stay put if anyone ever actually USES the mats. All obvious issues simply inherent of such a design. Most any other mats would have the same issues."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Woman Scorned, Betty Brodrick story","review":"I saw this movie on tv, was telling my Mom about it then I found it on Amazon. It is a story of how a woman can be verbally abusive to her husband and then keep doing things to him and not get help for herself that she really needs. She really needed to seek professional help after the divorce to get her life in order so she can be out in the world alone again, but she didnt, she kept trying to make his life miserable when he remarried. She was such a mess and instead of getting help she made the whole family suffer for it. She verbally abused her ex husband and then she talked bad about him to the kids, telling them that his second wife was a whore and child herself. She used her daughters key to get into the house when the kids were with her in the middle of the night and went and shot them both, but then kept telling all the lawyers that she was the victim. It is a really good story and Marideth Baxter did a very good job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Had To Have It!!!","review":"Meridith Baxter Burney plays Betty Broderick in this disturbing and sad movie. She is wonderful for the part. Great Movie. Didn't want to pay quite so much for it, but I had to have it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nail-Biting Drama/Thiller","review":"The fact that this movie was a true story makes it more thrilling than fictional dramas and thrillers. Betty Broderick (Meredith Baxter) had the perfect life. A wonderful family, a successful buisnessman husband, a humorous personality, and many friends. But she is pushed over the edge when her selfish husband divorced her for a much younger woman. Betty's enjoyable personality suddenly turns into a borderline personality as she repeatedly tries to get back at him in destructive ways. But this only results in restraining orders, charges, and Betty losing custody of her kids. But this dosen't stop Betty from terrorizing him and his new wife. Her extreme anger and jealousy turns violent as she watches her once perfect life being taken by another woman. It has a very progressive plot and shocking ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong Item Received","review":"I order A Woman Scorned and assumed I would get the entire movie. On the dvd it indicates Her Final Fury as if it is a part of the dvd. Once you play you only get the first half. Where is the rest. I paid almost $30 for this item. Will never order from these folks again!!!!Rip Off!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hell Hath No Fury","review":"Okay -- I admit it. Docudrama's are my guilty fascination and this one is especially compelling. A psychological thriller of the first order we are taken into the mind of Betty Broderick, a woman who, like some, is completely identified with being a wife and mother. Exit the husband for a younger woman, and with it goes her sense of self. Desperate to get it back, she embarks on a campaign to sabatoge ex and his new wife. When that doesn't work, she kills him. Of course even that doesn't restore her identity. But, to protect the any fragile hold on functionality she has to believe that what she did was right and she was the victim. I would recommend this because it gets inside the mind (to the degree that any Lifetime docudrama can) of a female killer. Nice switch from the glut of male sociopaths that normally inundates prime time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Falls short on so many levels","review":"While one can appreciate the idea that Mr. Cantor puts forward in the sort of thesis of this book, his ideas of what causes this cynical outlook is sadly skewed by political ideology. While I was very much enthralled by the catchy title and wonderful cover art, I was disappointed that Mr. Cantor was just another standard bearer of the culture wars. I wouldn't recommend this book. TryAffluenza: The All-Consuming Epidemic (Bk Currents)if you are looking for a better social critique on modern pop culture."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Pacific Northwest does wonders for this old rhyme!","review":"I'm not a big fan of the song/rhyme \\"There Was an Old Woman Who Swallowed a Fly\\", but I do like this quirky book. The old woman is now an old lady, and she no longer swallows flies, cats, and dogs. Instead, she swallows, trout, salmon, otters, and other animals indigenous to the Pacific Northwest. She no longer dies, either--although she does become dangerously large after swallowing the ocean. This book is a lot of fun. The change of venue does wonders for the old rhyme, and Reynold Ruffins' colorful, folk-artsy illustrations are a pleasure. Sure, it's a cross-cultural gimmick, but it works. My two-year-old and I love singing this book together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this book","review":"I love this book.

Many scenes have been removed from this DVD version, unknowingly, as sad as that is. Laguna doesn't know what they are putting out. Sad... Find an old VHS version and you will get to see the film the way it was intended to be seen. Sexy and Funny. This version is just a waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh Come ON!!","review":"I've never read this book. At the prices being asked, I wouldn't buy it if Alice Cooper himself delivered to my house. What gives sellers?"},{"rating":"2","title":"What's it worth to you?","review":"I read this book in high school in the mid eighties, having been a fan since I was about nine years old.After seeing the prices wanted, I wonder if I would pay that amount.You have to be a hard core Alice fan , and if you are it may be worth it! It gave me a glimpse into the inner workings of my favorite showman at that time. Great stories that will make you laugh and cringe! P.S., the prices are steep because it's an out of print book that probably has only a handful of readable copies left in the world, and it probably won't get a re-print.Remember the Coop!"},{"rating":"1","title":"bet it's a great book. FOR $2.00","review":"Give me a break ! while I would love to read Alice , you gotta be sh%$ing me. $5.00 tops in the bargin bin at most.I love Alice Cooper , And it aint worth it...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as educational as I'd hoped","review":"I had ordered this book as a companion to the Insect Lore Ladybug Land, mainly because the Ladybug Land page had a \\"buy together\\" link. Since the Ladybug Land seems fairly educational, I figured the book would be too. I was wrong. The book is very, very simple. If you \\"look inside\\" the book, you see a page with some interesting facts on it. I was hoping the whole book would be more like that. Instead, it was one basic sentence per page. We actually learned more from the one-page paper/care instructions that came with our Ladybug Land than we did from this book. I will continue to look for a companion book for our next batch of ladybugs that we order for our Ladybug Land."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a Wonderful Book!!!!!","review":"This book is so cute and accurately shows how ladybugs grow from eggs to adult beetles. My kindergarten class loved this story, especially the part at the end that compares children and ladybugs. I love, love, loved this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Antoine et Colette great for French classrooms","review":"OK, so I've only seen Antoine et Colette, the second (& shortest) of the films on this collection, but I thought it was great. At 30 minutes and with nothing scandalous or taboo, it is perfect for a French high school or college classroom. The story is timeless - boy falls in love with girl, girl says \\"lets be friends\\" - and charmingly understated. I think today's students will relate. In addition to being a well-told story, the 60s experimental music interest Antoine & Colette share & the classic Paris setting make for intersting sub-fodder."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lanyard","review":"It's a present from Santa and can't image there will be anything wrong with it.

Although I had done well in law school, I felt completely overwhelmed by the amount of material BarBri handed out. I happened to be wandering through the store one day when I ran into an alum of the school. When I told him my woes he suggested t he book and I ran down to t he bookstore to get it.It is true that you get the basic attack plans and some common sense approaches to the exam writing, but when you've been inundated with information this can actually be quite helpful and comforting. I used the attack plans to come up with my own spin and memorized the hell out of them for the essay section. This proved crucial because of the 6 essays I had not taken classes in 3 of the subjects.I also got the books on essay writing and found them to be helpful and more useful/insightful than the feedback I received from BarBri."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great help when in Italy!","review":"I borrowed this book from a friend for a recent trip to Tuscany and found it extremely helpful. when in doubt, all I had to do was point to a picture and was able to get my point across.

I bought it to make smoothies and it doesn't blend very well. It leaves large chunks of fruit and ice all the time. I hate it. The spout does work good surprisingly.

Let me tell you, I taught myself front handspring from SCRATCH on my carpeting.Anyway...this book is worthless. All it does is list and rank various gymnastic tricks based on category and difficulty. You can't derive anything useful out of it. MAYBE if you're a coach, and you want to organize your gymnastics course, this could be a reference. But with just a simple diagram per stunt (just to show what it is), there is nothing here that will TEACH you how to do this.
