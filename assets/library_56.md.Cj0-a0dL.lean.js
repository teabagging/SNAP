The cover blurb about generation J Jews who name their children Tiffany and eat kasha varnishkes is, far and away, the most entertaining part of the book - and you can read that for free. Beyond that, the book has no core, no serious thought, no reflections, observations or assessments worth reading. I easily believe that the author does something or other on the web...web blathering is about as deep, as thoughtful and as significant as this book gets. Browse it and reject it. It's worth several minutes of your time, at best. Pass on to something better and more profound - like, for example, any of the \\"Rabbi\\" mysteries popular years ago.

From the jacket, it appeared to answer all of our questions about why our generation grew up in non-religious homes but we seem to be lingering back to our parents/grandparents Judaism.

Sorry Lisa, but I have better things to read than your life story!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointless Journey","review":"While I admire the author for undertaking a journey to find her spiritual roots, and publishing an account of that journey, I find her methods utterly laughable. She goes to everyone but Jews to validate her Judaism. When a person tries to learn about something and their place in it, its best to go to the source of that thing. She generally ignores the idea of talking to and interacting with other Jews, is very uncomfortable with her own heritage, and regards any steps which she makes as little prizes to be shown off and complimented on. It's also a very misleading cover- the book does not talk about our generation and our attempts to examine our Judaism, only hers. The book is readable, but just barely."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth reading","review":"The cover of this book suggests that the author was going to write an in-depth book about people living in this post- holocaust generation of Jews.

HOWEVER, the vacuum has an incredibly bad design. To clean up, you have to remove the hepa filter and \\"tap\\" it clean. Yeah rite -- the dust gets all over the place when you do that. And since you have to gently \\"tap\\", you never get the thing clean, and if you accidentally tap something against it, once again, all of the dirt is all over the place.

My husband (very handy) tried his best to fix the problem and no luck. We returned it to Costco thinkig it was just a defective model. We got another one, AND IT DID THE SAME EXACT THING. We even read all the paper work to make sure we were doing it right! I then looked up reviews all over the web, and Amazon is actually the only place that gives this vacuum a good review.Finally, we returned the vacuum and we're now trying the Eureka Altima, which I've yet to hear any bad reviews online (and not just from the Amazon site).

It still runs, but there is no suction and the level adjuster for the beater doesn't work so the beater never touches the low carpet in several rooms. We've completely taken it apart and put it back together...there are no blockages, no slipped belts, no obvious reasons why it doesn't work.

I do not have my receipt anymore, so unfortunately I will not be able to get it fixed under warranty. For what I paid I was expecting a lot more out of this vacuum. It does an okay job but I was definitely not impressed with the vacuum hose and the mini attachment that came with it. They were virtually useless. I thought maybe I just got a lemon of a vacuum, but when I spoke to a repair man, he said the majority of vacuums they get in are Hoovers because 6 years ago they started manufacturing them in Mexico and their quality went way down. He also quoted me $150.00 to replace the motor, almost as much as I paid for the vacuum! I might as well of bought a Dyson.

I listened to Fairy Rings over and over again. I recently decided while I was looking for some similar music to help with meditation to see if his music was out there anywhere. I downloaded Fairy Rings without even listening to it. I was heart broken to find the sound quality is so poor I cannot enjoy Mr Rowlands wonderful music. Maybe the cd would be better but the mp3 download was bad. I tried listening to some of his others and the quality was bad on them too. It is so sad because his is some of the greatest meditation music there is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe you should look elsewhere","review":"As the liner indicates, Rowland recorded this is in his home, and maybe that's where the tape should have stayed.

If you want to move up a few notches in meditative enjoyment try something like Liquid Mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very peaceful, but sound quality could be better","review":"I bought the tape of this about 15 years ago, and found it to be quite moving. The music is very peaceful. I can actually imagine this playing for someone on their deathbed (not to be too morbid). The music is uncomplicated and yet emotionally engaging. But even outside of a hospice setting, it can bring a sense of letting go of day-to-day stress. I recently bought the CD and I just wish that the sound quality of the recording were better. Highly recommended, nevertheless!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Smooth meditation music","review":"This is the perfect CD for meditation. The melodies are soft, \\"fairy\\" light, and spiritual, with uplifting emotional tones. My pet peeve is a CD which starts out soft and melodic, then becomes bouncy or harsh (sharp flutes) or loud (bagpipes) just as I am getting deep into meditation. Rowland has a gift for creating a variety in his different pieces without destroying the mood. I can almost see the faries dancing around the ring with their spiritual lights flickering and glimmering in the soft moonlight. Wonderful for meditation or drifting off to sleep."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best \\"New Age\\" CD I've heard.","review":"I'm a classical music lover who hasn't been impressed very much by most New Age music.

The man who remastered the recording however (if anyone did at all), must have been deaf. The CD sounds as bad as(if not worse than) my worn-out tape cassete.

I can't imagine the effort exuded to package this thing. All the little album jackets are incredible, except one...What the heck is up with the incorrect picture on the cover of \\"The Game\\"?? It is not only the wrong picture, but it is extremely blurry! With the quality of the other covers (embossing, etc.), you would think they could at least use the correct picture! Other than that, my only complaint is the lack of material in the accompanying book. It would have been nice to have some rare pics and stories, other than Matt Pinfield's boring essay on the band.

The packaging is nothing special, nor is the accompanying \\"book.\\" Instead, I'd recommend you buy the REAL crown jewels--the first four albums--and flesh those out with the hits discs for most of the tracks you'll miss.

That's just a history lesson. Honestly, you can hear much BETTER Sabu Martinez playing on some other Blue Note records, where he appears as a side-man, such as J.J. Johnson's lp's. This...it just gets a little tired, very quickly. It's noticeable and rather sad.At any rate back to the disc at hand, it's very much in the tradition of conga that was popular at the time of this recording. But, there are far, far, far superior recordings available that deserve your fanbase and $$, rather than this. Pick up anything by Patato or Candido, or even Francisco Aguabella. It will be money better spent. All in all, to be a bit more accurate, I'd probably give this a 1.5 to 2 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"I don't believe a word of it, but what a hoot!","review":"I don't buy any of it, not for a minute.

This is really very delightful and easy to read, once you start, you can't really stop for longer than a food break until you're done!

You'll get a first-hand look into what it's like to be recruited and trained as a spy, then go on your first assignment, mingling with the highest Spanish society while secretly risking your life to uncover essential Axis secrets. The characters in the novel are rich and compelling, and you never know what's going to happen next to the protagonist/ingenue Aline.I read this book in the '80s and have remembered it ever since. I finally found it again and reread it. It's just as fascinating now as it was then.The only drawback: If you read at night, you won't get much sleep because this book is nearly impossible to put down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intriguing!","review":"THE SPY WORE RED is a first hand account of WWII espionage set in Spain and told by Countess Aline.

His arrangements save this from becoming a really dull excursion. Honig plays like he's heavily burdened by something...no excitement to these ears, and nerves could have been the issue. The real disappointment is the drummer who plays so heavy-handed without complimentary dynamics, no bounce, like he was having lots of trouble following the charts and dared not add anything at all to the pieces. Maybe nerves also contributed to his conservative approach. I wonder if Mendoza in this context would have a choice in contracting the musicians?Anything with Vince arranging, though, is worth a listen, so 2 stars for him and the nice mastering."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pet blinkers","review":"I really needed a light for walking my dogs early in the morning and at night.

I have always been a fan of 60's music but i never realize the amazing talent, which brought the Temptations together and put them above the rest. I had never even heard of this movie until my music teacher brought it up and said we would be watching it in class.

I remember renting \\"The Jacksons\\" and there being 10 minutes cut out of that 5 hour long series. I just hope that some tv station will air \\"The Temptations\\" again so that I can tape the WHOLE thing. Anyway, I absolutely love that miniseries. All of the actors were so talented, especially my favorite Terron Brooks (Eddie Kendricks). Five star rating!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!!","review":"I can watch this film over and over again.

Get the video, folks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could have been in the theater!","review":"The television movie was excellent, probably would have done very well on the big screen.

The entire cast is amazing and really makes the story come alive! if you're a huge Tempts fan, you can see how close these guys sound to the real Temptations, as both origional and new voices can be heard in the movie. This movie is so great that you will forget how long it is, i watch it all the time and have not gotten tired of it. If you're looking to see a good movie, hear some good tunes, or get a re-creation of the Temptations- this movie will hit the spot!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!!","review":"This is a story of one of the groups that formed what we call music today.

I'm 49 years old, and grew up with their music....from their 1st appearance on the Ed Sullivan Show till the end of this remarkable era of the BEST Group ever!! My favorite Temptation was David Ruffin, and the actor LEON portrays him remarkably. I wish I could find the UNCUT version of this movie, because it is A MUST for anyone's video collection.

They were a blues sensation , five singers that nowbody would ever believe would make it. Of course along the way egos flared. For example , David Ruffin was a very great singer , but behind closed doors he was a drug addick. The group thought that giving him a sheet of paper and telling him he was fired would get rid of him , but out of know where he strolls on stage and takes the mike. He then introduces himself by saying\\", I am David Ruffin and these are the Temptations\\". But through it all , from tragedy to triumph , The Temptations forged a musical legacy that brought a country together-and audiences to their feet. If you have not seen it , go to your nearest store now and get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"Before I saw this movie, my all time favorite was Gone With The Wind. Now, I cannot get enough of The Temptations. I have watched this movie over and over. I cannot get enough of it. It will make you laugh and it will make you cry.

I bet he has some interesting stories to tell. dvilla@gte.net"},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie is simply tempting!!!","review":"I've watched this movie so many times and it just gets better and better each time I watch it.

You won't be disappointed if you purchase this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Talented Temptations","review":"This is my favorite movie yet! Not only is it an interesting concept, it's based on a true story, which makes it even more refreshing for audiences. The movie presents tribulations and triumphs, and redefines the term, brotherhood. This is truly an inspirational movie that takes place around the 1970s, and captures the hearts of millions as they take us through life,lies,and love!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I thoroughly loved the Mini-Series that aired on NBC. I ordered the tape from NBC and it is a good thing that I did. The tape that is being sold now is edited horribly, leaving out key parts. The DVD was a dissappointment for me. Smokey's song, \\"Be Careful What You Wish For\\" is not on it, and the sound is no better than the VHS version. The special features are pitiful. A discography is one of the features. I could write that myself. If you have the NBC version, don't bother with the DVD. If you don't then the DVD is the better choice over the VHS, as the DVD has most of the original scenes in it. The movie itself is five stars, what is being sold now, is four."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved this movie!","review":"I saw and taped this movie when it originally aired and absolutely loved it. My children damaged my copy of the movie(horror of horrors!)so that's why I am now ordering a copy. Leon's portrayal of David Ruffin was excellent. The choreography was sharp and I loved seeing the story from an insiders point of view, considering that this is my favorite Motown group. I anxiously await it's arrival!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Family Movie","review":"Mothers everywhere! At last a wonderful movie filled with lessons in life. First of all, if any person can sit still without wanting to dance, he has no sense of music! Secondly, the lessons taught, i.e. honesty, loyalty, fidelity,love of family, the evils of drug use, suicide, the rewards of hard work and more are all there. You can watch this film with your grandmother or your grandchild and both will love it as much.But to those of you, like me, who were brought up listening to and loving Temptations music, I warn you--it's addictive. You'll even give up time on the Internet to watch it for the tenth time. In fact, as I write this, I'm \\"listening\\" to it upstairs for probably the 40th time.I know you'll enjoy it as much as my family has."},{"rating":"1","title":"temptations","review":"I enjoyed the movie but the movie has a second disc that I was not aware so I only got to enjoy half the movie very disappointed.

It may be a show about broken up marriges, a bountiful of sex capades but in our home, we don't see it as crude. It's just very funny. The characters (Charlie, Jake and Alan) play off each other perfectly, along with the rest of the cast. Great writers. We dvr the episodes and look forward to watching them at night with dinner, a glass of wine and great laughter after a grueling 1/2 hour of the ever so horroric stories on news and politics.

Judging by the cover of the album I thought it was going to be contemporary gospel, that's why I bought it. I was wrong. Upon listening to it, I discovered that it was traditional gospel. But I still enjoyed it. This CD is impressive. All the songs are well put together and sound great. My favorites were, Where the Praises Are, Dreams, Destiny, Good News, Clap Your Hands, and Your Tears Have Paid Off. I was just blown away of how good this CD is. The songs were just awesome and usher in praise and worship. He can definately be in the same ranks as Hezekiah Walker or Donald Lawrence.Overall this is a very good gospel CD. Vashawn Mitchell did a very good job with this one (he wrote and produced most of the songs. It's nice to see new talent. I did not regret purchasing this CD and glad I bought it.

My first VR-357 deteriorated right from the beginning, eventually losing the ability to record onto dvd altogether. Samsung was unable to repair that machine, so they sent me a reconditioned recorder, same model - and right away it was clear that it had the same exact problems as my first recorder!

I just did my first VCR-DVD direct transfer. The quality was exceptional. After that first success the DVD recorder is suddenly toast. I can no longer format or initialize my DVD-RWs or DVD-RAMs. DVD-RWs become corrupt and DVD-RAMs cause the machine to POWER OFF!!!I am purchasing a replacement from a well known retailer, refurbished.

This is part of Samsung's \\"Stay Active at Home\\" program. Sometimes you will be unable to elicit any response at all from this device. Think of it as a DVD piggy bank! In fact, I as well as several friends have given up trying to record onto DVD and have taken up hiking in the woods whilst pounding large stones together to work off the residual frustration and anger resulting from spending $160 on a very large object that only serves to collect dust and provide extra weight on my entertainment center. *Note to Amazon: why can't we rate something zero stars?"},{"rating":"1","title":"VCR stopped working","review":"* VCR stopped working after 3.5 years or so* VCR: Sometimes the cassette tapes get ejected* VCR: Sometimes they play, but the magnetic tape gets stuck* DVD: still plays, occasionally there's a region or format issue"},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of junk - Bought several and all had same problem","review":"I bought 2 of these recorders - one for upstairs and one for downstairs.

About as painful, stupid and empty as My Date with the President's Daughter (UGH!), the only redeeming thing about this vapid little teen chick flick is Anjelica Houston.

I also think that they are absolutely fitting the roles of Tanzie Marchetta and Ava Marchetta. For the direction, they are quite logical. For the visuals, it is perfect. It is because for the DVD, this movie is made with 2:40.1 widescreen formats, which is a good surprise for me. Therefore, it is always a good visual effect to see in this kind of widescreen version.

I listen to it almost every week, so that's saying something."},{"rating":"2","title":"great cd","review":"after listening to this albem you almost forget your not in orange county california. sunny upbeat lyrics, mixed with westcoast punk/ska guitar licks adds up to a well made albem. If you like Sublime you should definatly pick this albem up being as the ziggens were one of sublimes major influences. a few of sublime's tracks are accually ziggens covers, and they played together often at local bars in california. the second cd in this albem is all instromental and is great backround music at summer parties.*****Highly recommended*****"},{"rating":"1","title":"THEY MAY SAY ITS \\"NEW\\" from AMAZON BUT ITS NOT","review":"I purchased this book from amazon with the free shipping, the book is suppose to be NEW but the corner of this hardcover book was torn off, some \\"new\\" book.

Unfortunately the sound on these recordings is abominable. After listening for more than a couple of minutes I give up. I think it is the fault of the original recording in an over reverberant acoustic but there is a constant \\"aura\\" which really gets in the way. There is a far better and consistently more exciting version recorded in Innsbruck in the early 70s but it is only available in a CD version on \\"Polo\\" which is published in China. Presumably RCA Victor has problems with the dissemination of this version in the West!

It looks like a piece of modern art sitting in your living room, and the weight and feel of the wood panels and marbles is top-notch. One enhancement I would like to see with the game is having the rotating square panels be on some kind of pivot/shaft kind of device so you could pull them out and rotate them without them becoming completely detached. I just think that would be cool and easy to develop. Great product and nice packaging."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stilted writing","review":"The premise of this book is good, but the writing style is choppy and the characters are unappealing. Despite Bailey saying she's not ready for a relationship she seems desperate to jump into bed with the detective and her ex-boyfriend. And for a journalist, her questioning definitely lacks finesse. The characters aren't portrayed in a sympathetic manner so it's hard to care who killed the victims or that the spa owner's business is being destroyed by the murders.

She should go back to Cosmo."},{"rating":"2","title":"A worthy follow-up","review":"A Body to Die For is, quite simply, great fun. I had been reading some heavier books, and put them aside to read this. I was a fan of If Looks Could Kill and was hoping that this book would fulfill the promise that White had shown in her first novel. She does. I, for opne, was glad to see Bailey taken out of New York and put in a New England setting ... we know this was only temporary for Bailey is a real New Yorker. White is very good at introducing multiple characters and red herrings and she really keeps you guessing until the end. The most refreshing thing about this book is how everybody at this spa seems to have a secret and nobody is squeaky clean. This book is a fun read, and White's prose is intelligent and cleverly written so you don't have to worry about mediocre writing.

Each section has about ten pages of explanation followed by a bunch of problems. Unfortunately the explanations do anything but explain to people that are trying to learn math. If you're a math wiz you might be able to decrypt what they're talking about, but as a student I had no idea. In the examples the authors often use explanations such as \\"it is obvious that...\\" and \\"we remember from...\\" The lack of explanation (mainly laziness on the authors' part) makes it very hard to follow what they're talking about, and the problems afterwards often expect the reader to know things that weren't discussed or appeared as a one-sentence blurp in the margin. So unless you're a massochist or already know this stuff like the back of your hand and need a reference guide, spend your money someplace else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Craptacular","review":"Unless you use this book straight away after taking an intensive Calculus II course, you're going to have absolutely no clue how they are doing any of the problems.

Nada."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm certainly glad I'll never have to take another calc class after dealing with this crap","review":"This is by far the absolute worst math book I have ever had the misfortune of using. The discussions teach everything using either completely abstract formulae or by using the absolute easiest example of that problem type. Then you get to the questions, which expect you to have mastered the concept of the preceding 10 pgs or so and be able to extrapolate these concepts to other topics (which the book offers no explanation of how to do). Overall, I would say you're better off learning this material from your cat's litter box, as it will probably make more sense.

Attack of the killer tomatoes which has been voted the world worst movie is an A grade blockbuster compared to this film. Think of the worst film you have ever seen then multiply how bad it is by 100 and you might get close to how bad this film is. The plot of this film was weak and the acting even weaker. The script of this film should have been used to beat the writer about the head and shoulders as a fitting punishment for what he has inflicted on the world. Apart from a few of the characters looking good semi naked this film offers nothing to anyone who loves not just a good horror film but any film, ever! I'm sorry to those who are trying to sell this DVD but, I can highly recommend that you DON'T waist you money on the film as you will be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grade A garbage","review":"I just watched this cinematic abortion and while I wasn't expecting much, I was expecting more than this. I've seen a lot of slasher films and usually you get an idea for all the characters and their stories, even the ones that get killed, but this one left me cold. The violence was cartoonish and over embelished. They must have bought the fake blood by the tanker load. The acting across the board was typical of most low budget gay films. Some were better than others, but I won't expect any of them to see an Oscar in their future. It felt like the film was straddling between horror and camp and it couldn't get the balance right. The director really should have chose a clear path and gone with it instead of trying to please everyone. I could see it redone as a real horror film or as a clever comedy. I have to admit I did laugh once and I jumped a bit once, but that's it. I would strongly urge everyone involved with this movie to go back to film school and try again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even a good romance novel","review":"I am not a romance reader, but I have read a few good romance novels over the years. Some of them were even half way decent techno-novels. Ms. Saintcrow is telling us she is a paranormal romance writer, but she falls short in both categories. There are too many short cuts, glossing over high action details, long time gaps where the reader is expected to fill in the details. For the romance side, I thought I was reading a story of two angst filled teenagers. The character of Delgado was completely non-believable. He is supposed to be this ultra tough operative, but only swoons at Price's presence. I guess he is the perfect man, super bad boy, but like totally in touch with his feelings. She comes up with some good plot starts and themes, but never follows through, that silly angst thing keeps getting in the way.Sorry, but two stars is the best I can give this story."},{"rating":"1","title":"OMG, I am falling for her ...

OMG, I must not fall for her. OMG, OMG, OMG. Not so heroic and really 2-dimensional. Thankfully, the heroine Rowan, whilst guilt-ridden and a little mopey, is not so downright silly.Having said that, the story idea is good and overall the book is better than just sufferable. I'll just ignore the torn and ultimately whiny hero. ;)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Had SOME good moments.","review":"Well, this book had a good idea but... the writing was not what I would have expected from an experienced author. It was extremely frustrating reading so many \\"sorry this, sorry that\\". I enjoy reading about strong characters with some backbone, even if they start off weak but grow throughout the couse of the story. The character development was weak and didn't end up being believable. So, bottom line, if you like characters that are constantly saying sorry, crying, and gonna vomit all the time. Well, this book is for you.

If you can't believe, compare this performance with Sofronitsky's towering account of Scriabin's Fantasie -Chopin: Polonaises No6; Waltz in Df Op64/1, B164/1.

It is useful for the physicist, the engineer, and the biometeorologist.The text is well written and friendly and with lots of figures and graphs showing real world data.

Playing these CDs in one's car would be the best way to develop this ear for French. The CD-ROM, with the videos of the conversations, is also excellent. It has beginning to advanced and a person can arrange the learning style to suit himself (watch, listen, read, or....jump around, etc). I highly recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent CDs","review":"If you already had some French previously, and like to brush up on speaking/listening skills, this is an excellent addition. The program uses snapshots (with common daily vocabulary) of real life interviews with French people to tune up your listening as well as speaking skills. The lessons starts with going slowly, reading the written text, and ends with the normal speed of French people speaking. Practice in your car for a couple of weeks, and you'll be amazed how much your pronunciation improves.The accompany text is just the translation of the interviews. At this level, you should have a solid background of French vocabulary and grammar, and probably don't need a detail text on the translation, except for looking up a word here and there.

Profound yet funny. Dark yet compassionate. Engaging and provocative. I loved that the length of the stories were short and easy to read. But when I say easy to read, I don't mean simple. Each one is truly engaging. There are many layers to each story and I found myself reading a story or two each each night and then waking up to many new ideas about the story and my own life!! I even found myself enjoying the characters throughout the day and thinking about the metaphors that were inherent in each tale. I am excited because I think this Author is a budding new literary star and I can't wait to share this book with my family and friends. I'm very well read and five stars do not come easily from my personal rating system. Enjoy!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A cool CD to have in your collection","review":"I remember listening to the Stranglers as a teen in the '80's and loving them (I think I had \\"Dreamtime\\" on cassette). Then I kind of forgot about them until a few years ago when I was at a record store in Berkeley and decided to buy this CD to take a little walk down memory lane. I think the Stranglers were a very underrated and misunderstood band with loads of talent that never really caught on here in the U.S., for reasons that are unclear to me. Anyway, I LOVE the song \\"Peaches\\" which was featured in the recent film \\"Sexy Beast\\" (that blew me away) and I also love \\"No Mercy\\". I never tire of listening to this. These guys have great lyrics and a cool sound. Everyone should have this in their collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT COLLECTION","review":"A welcome retrospective stretching from their punk heyday (Something Better Change & No More Heroes -- lovely Doors-like organ) down to the more mellow and experimental 80s classics (Golden Brown & the amazing Skin Deep). Somehow the album is not entirely satisfying. Songs like Walk On By and 96 Tears didn't age at all well and where's that anthem of aggro Five Minutes? Gripes aside, this I still a proud collection of songs from one of Britain's finest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ripped off!","review":"The ad on Amazon stated this was the 2008 release of this cd. However, the catalog # on the spine itself is for the 1991 pressing. Not impressed.

Disco punk for brainless people ..i never got the Stranglers..this greatest hits comp didn't impress me either.

But what I wasn't expecting was poor quality mastering. This has obviously been mastered on someone's home computer and they haven't even bothered to deselect the 2-second pause option between each track. This is not usually a big problem, except this compilation is two CDs of live music. So 2-seconds of silence between each track sounds pretty awful! ...And they also haven't managed to put the track markers at the beginning of each track. Instead, each track starts about 3 seconds into the song. The CDs are basically un-listenable and whichever way you try to package it, you can't blame this mess on punk rock!!!Get Sid Sings instead. They did a bit of a cut and paste job with the set list running order but it's a far superior package."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Christmas CD I own","review":"Put this CD in a Christmas shuffle, and you are guaranteed to be asked for the title and artist.

It was a huge hit. Though later when I brought it to a scout function (where I was in charge of coordinating the food and drinks), it didn't have enough force to pump the punch all the way to the top of the fountain. Without the trays on it, boys thought that it looked like a red bubbling volcano. Not quite the elegant look I was going for."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Time Use Only","review":"Out of the box, everything went great as expected. One year later, I used water to test the fountain...no dice. It appears the pump is shot or is not providing enough power. The warranty is already expired.

IF you are interested in Donna's life then read Ordinary Life and leave it at that. Donna truly is one of the sweetest people in \\"celebrity life\\" that I have encountered. And its really upsets me when these kinds of books are written as a informational book.

What's better, is that I began perusing this book on the subway--somewhere in the middle--but when I sat down to read it from the beginning, I simply could not put it down! If you are a fan of Donna Summer, this book is a must. I look forward to more from Josiah Howard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Running for Cover...running from this book.","review":"Perhaps having been a fan of Donna Summer's for 25 years and having met her twice now, the information provided has revealed nothing new in this book. One major feeling generated though was how determined and driven she was to be heard and how creative she was to reach millions a whole decade before Madonna. The last few chapters seemed to condense the recent past two decades cheating the readers of how much Donna Summers' voice and music has grown and how it continues to get stronger and better like a fine wine over time. The major criticism is the authors subjective opinions and attack on Donna Summer's image and physical appearance as well as her appearance in print, film/television,and album covers. I felt it inappropriate and offensive to it's readers and fans. I know Donna's fans young and mature look forward to her own story due out later this year...perhaps readers should wait for that book than waste money on such a limited read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Errors, errors, and more errors!","review":"This book at one time was good I am told, but the 8th edition (2002) is now outdated with many errors. The CD on heart sounds which is included is insulting to medical students. The book has terrible photographs which make the patients look jaundiced or cyanotic. I am sorry I bought it. There is no question that Swartz's book on physical diagnosis is the best. Swartz has a great free CD on the complete physical exam which is included with the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still looking for a good physical exam book","review":"This book was written for no one in mind. It reads as a single run-on sentence from page one to the end. You cannot learn physical exam from it (or from any other book -- you simply have to practice) and Bates is a rather mediocre reference if you need to find out how to examine this or that.Physical exam is a dying art and I'm yet to find a semi-decent modern text on the subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"Errors in book, lacking correct information","review":"I would not recommend this book. On techniques of examination of the Nose and Sinuses this book shows and tells you to use an otoscope with an ear speculum to examine the nose. This is wrong. The correct way to examine the nose is with a bivalve nasal speculum and a penlight or a headlight. Also an ear speculum should only be used to examine the external auditory canal of the ear. When Dr. Barbara Bates was the author of this book this correct information on the nasal examination was in the book. Dr. Bickley should not have taken correct information out of this book and inserted wrong information. Also this book does not have posterior rhinoscopy(examination of the nasopharynx with a nasopharyngeal mirror), indirect laryngoscopy with a laryngeal mirror, anoscopy, and sigmoidoscopy. I recommend Textbook of Physical Diagnosis 4th ed. by Mark Swartz, M.D. for Physical Diagnosis courses not Bickley's book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good resource","review":"I purchased this book for a course I was taking to supplement the lecture.

What does this have to do with anything in the movie?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing and One Sided","review":"I'm sympathetic to this film's point of view but it fails on multiple levels. First and foremost it's completely one-side and is therefore basically propoganda. This leads to it's second flaw - the one-side rant become tiresome. Instead of an interesting debate you're left with a \\"we know we're right\\" smugness. It's a shame because I was fascinated, educated and alarmed by how secret the MPAA is and how powerful it is - but by failing to let the other side speak, their points lack legitimacy. Since clearly someone could have been found to intelligently articulate the other side, we're left to wonder why we're not allowed to make up our own minds. As a liberal myself, I find this the movie is one of those indicators that proves - if you follow the political spectrum far enough in either direction, you discover the spectrum is circular."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed in documentary","review":"I was expecting more then this documentary delivered. After viewing the documentary I was not persuaded by it. While the current rating board is not perfect, it is still a guide. In every situation in life we can always find examples that may show an inconstant behavior in judgment. We can use the Baseball Hall Of Fame as an example. One player may gain entrance while another, with similar life time stats does not. So I am not surprised we find the same situation in movie ratings. Ratings are important and I am sure that rating a film is not always easy. Those that want a more friendly movie knows what they have to do, yet we find them complaining in this, so called, documentary. They would rather change the system then change their movie. While some may have valid complaints displayed in this movie, the system as a whole, does do an effective and difficult job. Any system replacing it would also receive criticism."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Industry's Secret Society","review":"I saw This Movie Is Not Yet Rated. It's a documentary about the MPAA and how it rates movies in a fascist way and is biased. It was really good for any film student, producer or movie buff. It had great interviews with independent directors and even some ex-MPAA members. It was really eye opening to see just how much pull the MPAA really has in Hollywood. Basicly, the MPAA can make you or break you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Always good when a documentary entertains and informs","review":"Amazing documentary about the MPAA, how it operates in secrecy, and what that means for movie consumers - mainly, a board of people with dubious credentials and experience make decisions about what you and I can and cannot see in a movie theater. For a serious topic, the documentary is hilarious and takes a light-hearted approach. If, like me, you believe that adults should be allowed to make their own informed decisions about what they can and can't watch, this is a great expose on just how much power the MPAA raters have to change the content of what you and I watch. If you love movies, don't miss this DVD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting......","review":"Very interesting documentary about how corrupt the ratings bureau is. Too bad they don't do a documentary about how they can change the way the Papparazi are allowed to operate as insurgents and terrorists to the hollywood stars. That is more disturbing than the ratings system."},{"rating":"1","title":"Creeps denouncing creeps","review":"As a parent (with a challenging task of raising kids who will grow up to be moral and productive citizens of this country) ... I find this movie's tilt towards the sort of artistic freedom that celebrates perversion and offensive behavior ... to be very alarming.I am an atheist ... so this has nothing to do with some stupid religion. I have nothing against nudity ... its when they make it graphic in-your-face nudity for shock value that makes it offensive.As a parent of a very intelligent 14 yr old (two of his favorite shows are Frontline and 60 minutes) ... we are always struggling to find entertainment that conveys a positive message. That liberal envelope has been pushed far enough to make it a close to impossible task.I find the MPAA to be very incompetent ... they just are not doing enough. Some of the movies that get through with a PG-13 rating ... can make adults (at least the responsible ones) cringe.I wish I could give this zero stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"To Rate Or Not To Rate","review":"Wonderful production! I found the efforts of the producer most admirable. He did a great job. This film should be rated \\"E\\" (Excellent)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Critique of MPAA film rating system","review":"this documentary provides a critical analysis of the present film rating system in Hollywood. While it makes some valid points in its criticism, the film unfortunately leaves the impression that the solution is to eliminate the classification system itself. The film never explores the possibility of reforming the system rather than destroying it. Viewers should turn to chapter 4 in my book, HERE'S LOOKING AT YOU: HOLLYWOOD, FILM & POLITICS (Peter Lang, 2nd ed., 2005) for the argument to revise the film ratings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hypocrisy unmasked","review":"This documentary is at its acidic best in pointing out the hypocrisy of the MPAA in its relative treatment of sex vs. violence (hatchets in heads and bodies dismembered by chainsaws are ok, female pubic hair is a definite no-no), male vs. female sexuality, and straight vs. gay encounters. Unfortunately, the film meanders into sidelines such as video piracy and McCarthyism without ever suitably tying them to the central theme, and too much time is spent with the rather boring private investigator trying to identify the anonymous members of the MPAA's secret cabal. Overall, however, a strong indictment of the MPAA and, on a broader level, of those who would limit all society's access to artistic expression to what fits within their own personal moral views."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timely ! Overall, this is the best available.","review":"I have spent quite a bit of time working on databases that involve time issues. I've looked at much of the published material available, including Date's recent book, dozens of articles, conference proceedings, etc. Overall this is the best available.After I absorbed a lot of this book, I felt there could have been a more concise version of the concepts. Maybe someone will come out with a concise, well illustrated 100 pp. tutorial that is dramatically better, but it hasn't happened yet. Even though there are a lot of code samples, there is still a BIG leap to get to a production system. It is too bad that something like SQL/Temporal won't be coming out as a standard anytime soon. However, with conventional SQL you can still go a long way in developing databases just by using the Bitemporal design principles.Overall, if you work with time history, etc. in databases, you can't afford to not be studying this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Theoretical,takes work to translate it into something useful","review":"One can tell that this work stems from the research of the author but he fails to translate it into something useful. It took a lot of effort to translate the concepts into something that my students would use in the database real world. I got sick of the little sidebars that had interesting but useless tidbits concerning notions of time. This is not for the developer but it might be useful for someone that is SQL knowledgeable that wants to check out some variations on time and temporal specifications."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a case of 6 kits","review":"This ad is misleading.

I rarely write reviews but wanted to give my opinion on the actual product. The wand makes toilet cleaning a breeze, my favorite part being that after each use, you dispose of the sponge without having to touch it. It alwalys freaked me out to have to clean the brush that cleaned the toilet, and this product solved the problem for me. It's well designed and well made."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading","review":"As other reviewers have stated, the title for this product is very misleading, the product itself is excellent, the issue in play is the expected quantity. I expected 6 kits, 6 handles + 6 cleaning pads in each kit or 36 pads. What I got was two handles and 6 pads...a far cry from the $70+ value implied in the write up.Furthermore, I could never get any response from the company regarding additional pads, or return information.

In Belgium, they serve one or two cookies with every cup of coffee or tea. When my stash from Belgium ran out, I remembered enjoying Biscoff on USAir, and found them online.

I knew about the missing tapes for decades, and was really excited to learn they'd turned up. That said, \\"Stages\\" is really good, but as a follow-up to \\"Blue River\\" it's a bit of a let-down. Some of the songs were done better on \\"Be True to You\\" (though it's great to have \\"Time Run Like A Freight Train\\" without tympani, and \\"Can't Get You Out of My Life\\" as a country song instead of an imitation of \\"Court & Spark\\").

The included literature describes the \\"new and improved\\" valve- I don't know what it was like before they improved it, but this valve is terrible. I inflated it- there's no one-way flap on it, so as soon as you try to plug it up much of the air escapes- and inserted the plug on the valve. Ten seconds later the plug popped out and the ring deflated. I repeatedly tried to inflate it, but each time the plug would pop out. It's going back to the store this afternoon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great pool; bad valve","review":"My son received this pool as a birthday present. We loved how quick it was to set up and easy to store. After a few uses, the air valve came completely out of the socket, so it will not hold air, making it useless.

The author manages to be both informal and informative, providing an easily accessible yet highly comprehensive body of work that avoids the overly jocular tones that often crop up in this sort of publication. The first few chapters will drag for all but the total beginner. However these are essential in providing a solid foundation and lead you with ease in to later, more complicated territories. From hear, the authors take you effortlessly in to the less accessible areas of web development. Definitely worth the investment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible as an HTML companion book","review":"Although this book covers pretty much all the elements of HTML, I discovered a significant number of incomplete syntax specifications. I was especially disappointed in its coverage of forms.

After awhile, I got annoyed by the author's overly-conversational tone when describing how things work (e.g. interjections of \\"Cool.\\")Reading straight through I found the examples too repetive. For instance: a 10 line excerpt is repeated twice within a paragraph, where only the first line differs. This happens again and again. In longer examples the waste of space gets much worse.I think the text and examples would be both easier to follow and more compact had there been more thoughful use of font and color.On the good side, the text does a good job of warning where incompatibilities exist between browsers.

The first one is a two parter of \\"The Hound of the Baskervilles\\". It is a good adaptation of the novel and worthy to stand up against adaptation of the Holmes' novel.

But they're all here, and the videotape transfer looks good.The rest is a mixed bag. The acting is good, especially Cushing's very fine interpretation of Holmes. However, the production value is a trifle lacking. From being shot on video instead of film, to the occasional flub (microphone hanging down in Hound of the Baskervilles -- oops!), these episodes have the feel of watching a play instead of a TV series. That said, the rest is pretty strong. This series is often pointed out as the blueprint for the excellent Jeremy Brett series, and honestly there are a few shots in here, particularly in A Study in Scarlet, that bear an uncanny resemblance to the latter series. In spite of its few shortcomings, this set is highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"I warned you.","review":"Ridiculous stories. Dreadful acting.

Nothing about planning, training, people he met along the way, adaptions for the hike, feelings, how he teamed with his dog, Orient.

Bittersweet is a very apt description for this slow paced movie. Abe goes to the big city to find his wife Kitty. He hires a detective, Jack to find her. During the movie we find out that she dumped Abe because his life was as boring as this film. Kitty is living with a rock star. During the course of the week Abe and Jack become friends and come to terms with their life in its current state (yawn). The guy who printed \\"comedy\\" on the cover owes me $2.00. The acting was acceptable and even good at times, but didn't compensate for a very dull script."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Ed Burns Classic","review":"If you love New York...and love the craziness that goes along with daily life in NY....then you will absolutely adore this movie. I have watched it so many times now. It will make you laugh and there are some parts that will just tear at your heart strings (Ed Burns tearful scene is just heartbreaking). I have all Ed Burns movies for I was born and raised in NY and now live in Georgia. Burns' movies portray the REAL NYC, which allows me to relive my life as a New Yorker. Each movie always has me laughing and crying.....just as I was when living in NY. GREAT MOVIE.....you will adore the story and of course, Ed Burns."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looking for Ed","review":"Ed Burns broke into the New York film world with a bang, but it seems he didn't have much to say after his first movie. Looking for Kitty might just be the weakest of his films. The male bonding is clich��d and a little unbelievable; goody-two-shoes Abe is never a compelling character, so you spend most of the movie not giving a damn whether he finds his wife - and understanding why she left him in the first place. Understated, yet powerful and moving, the end is the only thing that's of value in this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Random Assemblage of Tracks","review":"The best part of the CD is the case--a metal, round CD case with a painting of Ella.

I've owned it for quite sometime, as well as both Generation T books which i highly recommend. I surf the net for recon ideas all the time. I've shown this to my teen daughters and their friends, and the consensus is summed up in this actual quote from one of them: \\"THIS BOOK IS SOOOOOO INAPPROPRIATE.\\" I suppose if you have a perfect body and are looking for new ways to expose it, you would love this book. For the rest of us, not so much.The authors are clearly creative, so it is not for a lack of talent.

They're great for skinny juniors who don't mind (and whose parents don't mind) if they show a little skin - or even for folks like ME in my 30's - who would probably layer the look with a tank or another tee.There's even a purse design and a skirt design included - the skirt uses the arms, sews them up and turns them into pockets. How creative is THAT?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great in theory--not in practice.","review":"If you look at the pictures in this book, you'll see that they're completely enchanting. Unfortunately, however, they really don't work in practice. In order for the draping of most of these shirts to work, you need to be working with a very fine jersey, which most tee shirts are NOT made of (particularly cheap event tees, concert shirts, etc). It seems to me that the people who put together this book did not actually MAKE any of the shirts themselves, which is why there are no photographs and only these very enchanting drawings.Plus, the instructions are convoluted and glossed over--a lot of the patterns would benefit from eight- or ten-step instructions, while we are only ever given four or five. Overall, if you're looking for a book like this, I'd recommend the much more comprehensive and comprehensively-photographed Generation T by Megan Nicolay instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of mid-drifts and backless","review":"This book wasn't quite what I expected it to be. There were a LOT of backless and mid-drift models. Which is great if you're thin and don't need to wear a bra, and not much else.I also found the instructions to be very sparse, depending on diagrams almost exclusively to indicate where to cut or sew without explaining anything. I wanted to know if cutting a tshirt like that would cause it to unravel and what the longevity of the new fashions would be but there was nothing there that really addressed that.It wasn't really what I was looking for but there were some pretty clever fashions there for someone young enough and skinny enough to really enjoy them."},{"rating":"2","title":"good for a momma","review":"This book is great.

I thought that this might be a good guide for her, but I was pretty disappointed when I received it. Although spiral bound, which is nice, it lacks clear, concise instructions on how to create the t-shirts. There isn't a single \\"classic\\" design, the designs are too similar, and there are no actual photos of the designs, either. Not recommended (and especially not for beginners)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Risque designs with little instruction","review":"Most of the t-shirt designs in this book are just plain bizarre... A lot of large holes cut out of the t-shirt or jagged edges cut through it. Not something I would ever, ever wear (ok, I would maybe wear three of the 99, honestly...). A previous reviewer had it right when she commented the designs are made for skinny women who like to show off. This targeted demographic isn't a problem, but this is definitely not a book for every woman, and (if I had children) I wouldn't give it to my daughters as inspiration for art projects.Also, there are zero actual pictures in the book and relatively little instruction. There is one color drawing of each design (so of course it looks great) and a cursory explanation of how it was created.I think this book might be more appropriate for someone who has some creative sewing juices but needs a little extra help thinking of unique designs to create and someone who is not afraid to show off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad designs, few instructions","review":"The WORST t-shirt restyle book I've seen. There are a lot of ideas here, but many are unwearable if you are over 25 or weigh over 100 pounds or need to wear a bra, and some would be awkward even then. Part of the problem is the concept doesn't lend itself to so many designs; The only materials they allow for each project are one tee, scissors, thread & needle. I understand not everyone has vintage brooches or silk ties lying around to revamp a tee, but I think adding a second tee or ribbon or shoestrings would help a lot. The problem is that they have to cut these items out of the shirt in one place to add them in another, so you wind up with things that are heavily layered in the front and have no back, drawstrings cut in a spiral from a circular cutout, etc., which is what makes some designs awkward. Some of the designs cannot be saved by adding materials-they're simply unattractive. I'd look elsewhere for inspiration."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the Mutton, For the Lamb","review":"These are really, really youthful designs.

Please read the reviews especially in the original cover edition. What I would like to say that this reissue is a cheaper version than the original black cover without compromising quality and cover.

The prose is so dry so as to dessicate the history it purports to record. They are bogged down (no Irish pun intended) in tribal minutiae so arcane and irrelevant that the books could almost be spoofs. Judging from its prevalence in these books, it must have been the style of that format at that time, but it is still deadly. Most buy these books because of a family affiliation. I am confident that the vast majority of these books end up on shelves unread past the fifth page. If you want to own this book so you can have a complete collection of annals from your part of Ireland do so, but don't even think about reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Howdigeburned?","review":"I had watched the original and honestly found it a little too British - slow, not all that mysterious and hard to sympathize with the main character. But this version - awful, just awful. Cage's hysterical overacting and the just plain weirdness - the bear suit scene has to be seen to be believed - make it sort of tolerable, but only once you've completely given up on seeing a straight horror/mystery and just sit back and wonder what paranoid misogynistic thing will happen next. Taken with that attitude, you get a lot of \\"huh - didn't expect *that*\\", but that's hardly worth making a movie. The youtube highlights video shows you everything \\"good\\" about the film and is short and free."},{"rating":"1","title":"some movies shouldn't be remade","review":"The original wicker man is a classic b horror movie. With outstanding performances and a good story. This is like a pale shadow of that movie and they didn't even get the stuggle of the lead characters relgious faith against the older and sometimes more dangerous celtic faith , at least on the island he's on. Nick Cage is a excellent actor but he can't even begin to save this movie as it's lost the point of what the original wickerman film focus was. Buy that one. This is a hoot though for people who like bad horror films as it's a really bad horror movie with a higher budget, still the original is a great horror classic so that's not a good thing in this case."},{"rating":"1","title":"It gets one star only because there is no option for zero stars","review":"Who ever heard of anything like this?A town in which the men are afraid of the women?People who actually live in reality and no one else knows that they are there?

This movie went *straight* into the trash after I viewed it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Vision Gone Wrong","review":"I have saw both versions of \\"Wicker Man.\\" I never really cared for the first installment, although I am a fan of Christopher Lee. I thought this movie would be an improvement after decades to build and improve upon the original story.Sadly, it was an incredibly unrealistic and, well, stupid movie. Naturally, Cage finds himself on an island where all men are bad. Bad, man, bad. Fine. That was expected. But the series of events is unbelievably asinine.Somehow, a cop goes to this island, his coworkers know where he is, and yet the events happen to him and he is forgotten. As if the state wouldn't become involved. Of course, the all powerful women emerge victorious.The best thing about this movie is the music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Very Good!","review":"We had seen the original Wicker Man so we knew what the storyline was about, however this version left so much to be desired. First, let me say, that I truly enjoy Nicolas Cage and think he is a wonderful actor, but he should have passed this movie up. He did the best job he could do with what he was given, but the movie...well! As you know he is searching for his ex-girlfriends daughter who turns out to be his own.Determined he insults everyone on this weird island and is totally clueless to what is about to happen to him. Which might I add waS totally gross. I was bored and I had some questions that I wanted him to find out the answers for....why did the men stay there (the few that they showed,) and why didn't they fight these woman? Did they for sure kill any male children born?? The answers to these questions would have made the movie at least a little bit more interesting. Anyway, I'll still enjoy Nicolas in other movies I'm sure, but this one needs to be put to sleep."},{"rating":"2","title":"why all the negative reviews?","review":"I had to double check the version of this movie that I own after seeing the overwhelmingly negative reviews on Amazon. Yep, this is the right version with Nick Cage etc. I realize I am a minority here, but I enjoyed the movie--not the best I have every seen but FAR from being the worst, as many reviewers claim. I never saw the original, so I had nothing to compare it to. I found the plot to be somewhat predictable, although the ending did have a twist to it. The acting was average; I have never thought of Cage as being a \\"good\\" actor, but he does OK. The plot and acting were not THAT bad, seriously. The island scenery was beautiful. The bee keeping/feminist/goddess/sacrifice aspect was a bit of a off, but not to the point where I could not enjoy the movie. I don't know why there are so many reviews absolutely trashing this movie, I would encourage anyone to give it a chance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst movie ever","review":"OMG! This movie sucked. The movie had no point and the plot was horrible. The characters were so cheesy. I can't believe I watched it to the end because the ending was very disappointing. There was absolutely no moral, no point, no issue at hand, no overtones whatsoever. The movie was sooopoorly directed. I have no opinion about the original, but the revised version is horrible! It's so bad, I don't want to even give it 1 star, but I had to in order to rate it. Don't waste your time with this pitifully written and directed movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just awful","review":"Gave it two stars because all of the cast actually did a good job. The costuming was fabulous. The sets and locations they used were terrific. But the changes made to the characters and the plot watch like the work of several different people who couldn't be made to agree. Beyond the details that were tweaked, as a thriller it doesn't work. The original cop never saw it coming."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst movie ever","review":"I guess I should have researched to see that this was a remake of an original, but I didn't. The previews looked decent, the posters & dvd cover looked interesting; the actual movie was an extreme disappointment. Never have I been so glad I didn't see a movie in the theater. Perhaps a die hard feminist might like this movie, perhaps because I'm a male is why I hated it; all I know is that I can't remember the last time I was so ticked off to see credits roll. This movie had potential to be good, but the odds of a decent ending got worse and worse and could only have happened if a frickin' nuke had landed on the island and killed all inhabitants. In summation, don't pay more than $2 to watch this movie, it's not worth much more than that."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would give this a Negative 5 Stars if I could!","review":"My hubby and I just watched this film last night.

I will say that I much preferred Edward Woodwards deadpan serious performance over Cage's silly, obnoxious and way too familiar over-the-top portrayal of the lead. This \\"remake \\" is just too silly to be believed. It is sad that fine actors like Burstyn and and Sobieski wasted their time on this film.

Daughter is missing and he is trying to save her.Other than that, often in places it's word for word dialogue (wonder who got credit for this. By the time it was done I didn't care enough to find out). Whomever did the screenplay, most of it is the original.

I had to add my two cents: I actually saw this movie in the theater. My comments:1. How does Nicholas Cage get such a close shave (you could see his pores)2. Was this movie shot on someone's cell phone (looked like video tape)3. Did they deliberately choose cast members from the bottom of the pile, or were these the only ones that showed up for auditions?4. Does anyone remember \\"The Producers\\"? Can you MAKE money by producing a terrible movie? (anyone know?)5. Did Cage have at least some inkling that he was making a huge bomb?

Dear God WHY!?!?\\"","review":"This was pretty much a straight forward remake of a pretty damn thrilling movie. The original, while as slow moving as this remake, somehow managed to be enthralling and suspenseful. Cage's acting was pretty laughable - and the rest of the cast seemed a bit TOO \\"spooky\\" to be believeable.There were also too many wild goose chases that never fully wrapped up.I really want to know WHY someone thought it would be a good idea to remake this movie...and WHY this movie needed to be remade?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrific waste of time","review":"Terrific as in terrible. The photography was nice. I can handle an odd story line and unconventional ending as long as there is an actual plot -- which this movie lacked.

After seeing this movie, I learned this was a re-make, the original came out in 1973. Overall, the movie was lousy.The scenes of scariness from the movie's TV commercials have little relevence to the plot. Several critics have given this movie bad reviews. While there are some believable aspects, (e.g. cell phone not working on a distant island), there are still plot holes. While Nicholas Cage has done some great movies in the past, his acting in this one is not up to par. There are a few decent moments, but the movie is rather pathetic.Overall, save your money.

It defies explanation how someone adapted that movie after presumably watching it and then ended up with this.

Past bad movies like Plan 9 From Outer Space at least had bad actors and a bad director to excuse them. This movie has an Academy Award winner in the lead and a director that has done some great films but this is an absolute mess.

It is an insult to the original movie, but even were it to stand alone it could only be described as meandering, trite and totally incredible. What on earth were the directors and producers thinking of?The movie flits between stealing sequences and lines verbatim from the original and introducing utterly pointless, meaningless sequences that have nothing to do with the original story. The directing, acting and bizarre distortions of the storyline combine to turn every scene into a complete mess. Cage's acting is always crap, but William Shatner could have done a better job of this.Lazy, cheap and nasty.

You really get the impression that the writer, director, or whoever has enormous issues with women, and I am not a guy who likes to go around attacking everyone's gender politics.

I thoroughly enjoyed the plot but I feel the end ruined the movie. The main character has visions and flash backs which, as far as most people will be concerned, are totally pointless.

Maybe I should give it more than two stars, but the ending was horrible. This movie reminded me of the Tom Tryon book Harvest Home. Very well acted, I must say. Ellen Burstyn gave me the creeps. Nicholas Cage gave a flawless performance, as always. Don't know why he is never given more credit than he gets. He should have more than just one OSCAR win to his credit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Burn, Nicholas, Burn!","review":"What is it with Nicholas Cage and fire lately? Between this and Ghost Rider, Nick up in smoke does seem a pretty fair metaphor for his career these days. It's hard to imagine what anyone was thinking as they put this together. It's beyond bad on so many different levels and never really tries to make much sense of anything. But Nick himself couldn't have been worse if he'd been filmed while reading the script for the first time. It's hard to imagine while watching this mess that these folks are professional actors, and pretty good ones, too, given half a chance. The only thing that would have made this hideously botched remake more bearable would have been to immolate the director in the final scene."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsettling and pointless","review":"I didn't know anything about this movie or that it originated as a novel, so this is soemone's take who is basing the review soley on this version.1 Build that gets old and slow at times2 plot holes and loose ends galore (ie; What was the deal with his visions??)3 this reminded me a lot of the Village which was a much better movie - better acting and more creepiness, too.4 Left me feeling unsettled due to the brutality near the end. If there was more history given, this might have added to the movie instead of just letting you wonder \\"Why?\\"Two stars because I actually made it to the end - though I don't know that this is a good thing. I wouldn't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor remake....","review":"When I had read they were remaking the wicker man and saw some of thetrailers I was mildly interested. I rented it on DVD last evening andwas surprised at how tame this version was considering all the wackinessof the original could have made for an interesting remake but not here.Wooden performances all over, just not enough of anything to make thiseither scarey, thrilling or memorable.

Right away when he gets to the stupid island you know he was intended to be there by the ramblings on of the bad actors. Cage is sacrificed at the end. He's the stupid wicker man!

I just tried to think how he was going to overcome all those \\"forces\\" against him, but to no avail. This movie does not have a happy ending. Unlike a lot of other horror movies, the hero just doesn't survive this one. If you're the type who roots for the \\"good guy(s)\\" in horror movies, this one isn't for you. Cage, as police officer Edward Malus is out of his league (an in definite need of a SWAT team) against this island of matriarchal pagan zealots; in the search for his missing daughter."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Wicker Man","review":"I do not own the movie and will not own it. I saw the movie in the theater. Even though it is based on a true ritual it was still a very bizzare movie. If the reviews could give minus stars then I would give it a negative 1.

I think Nicholas Cage could have made better time of doing another movie and not wasting his acting experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get out the gas masks","review":"I'd give this movie half of a half of a star (if I could).I was watching it on HBO, and I was laughing too much to turn it off. Reading some of these reviews, I laughed even more. This movie deserves every bad review it gets.Nicolas Cage looks like a fool in this. Anyone in their right mind would have been on the island for a few hours and take off running. He acts like a one-man army, and all of the actors in The Wicker Man should be wondering if they just needed the money.So many scenes in this movie are so lame that it is embarassing. Often, it can make you crack up instead of sitting on the edge of your seat.Like most of the other bad reviews here, I would agree--don't bother. I say don't bother with this movie unless you want to see an accidental comedy (instead of good thriller)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another boring mystery movie..","review":"Let's not have anymore of this kind of so called mystery movies! Wicker Man will give you a very hard time trying to stay focused as hardly any exciting events take place. Could this movie by any chance secretly be another M. Night Shalyman movie? The way the story is being told reminded me of the Village, that other boring creepy story. Nicholas Cage stars once again as a police officer who needs to investigate the disappearance of a little girl and ends up in a place that is dominated by women. Without giving away the plot it is fair to inform you, that Cage boring performance is illustrating the lack of credibility of The Wicker Man.He looks just as if he already realizes, that this movie, will not interest anyone.(SARR)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Movie","review":"This is by far one of the worst movies I have ever seen.

Not the bees! AAAAAHHHHH!!\\"One curious side note though: This DVD advertises that it contains an alternate \\"shocking\\" ending. Great. Now where the heck is the original theatrical ending?!

To compare this in any way to the classic movie of 1973 is an insult and to call this film a remake is an insult to all halfway decent remakes. This is the only movie Cage stars in that I have to go with the majority and say that he is not a good actor. Most of the time with Cage movies even if the story isn't very good he is at least passionate about the role.That just never arrives here.

It's unwatchable. Everything about it is bad. The acting, cast, story, script, directing, and even the soundtrack are all horrible. This has to be Nicholas Cage's worst performance ever, and that's saying something. I always thought he was the most overrated actor in Hollywood. The story and script are so bad, that I could not finish it.I'll save you the horror of watching this trash by telling you what it's about. In a nutshell, Cage is lured/tricked to an island by a secret \\"religous\\" cult, of women, in order to sacrifice him via burning in the Wicker Man. They had a bad harvest of honey, so they felt a sacrifice was needed to improve next years harvest. I found out the ending through a coworker who obviously had a stronger stomach than I did. Even the thought of watching Nick Cage burn to death, is still not enough to get me to ever watch this piece of garbage again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh C'mon","review":"I mean seriously C'mon.

Seriously have anyone of you seen the caliber of horror movies latley? 99% are casted with what seems like talentless nobodies or wannabe porn stars needing to pay for breast implants. The horror genre has been in a pretty bad place the last 10 years with very few good titles. Even the the longly anticipated Trick 'r Treat was a dissapointment.

Yeah, not this movie either!","review":"The 2006 edition of THE WICKER MAN is, without a doubt in my mind, the very worst remake in cinematic history. It is also dangerously close to being one of the worst films ever made. I think that Robin Hardy, Ed Woodward, Christopher Lee, Britt Ekland and all that were a part of the 1973 version (a great film everyone should see) should get a free kick to the nuts of \\"George Lucas Look-alike Contest\\" runner up Neil LaBute and Nicolas Cage. I couldn't believe how awful Cage was in this pile of llama dung! I wanted to turn the movie off so many times, but I was frozen in awe of how utterly atrocious it was.

Nicholas Cage gives a bizarre, unconvincing, pointless and uninteresting performance in the midst of laughable dialog and story.

No paganism theme, no Christopher Lee, no Ingrid Pitt, no Britt Ekland serenade, and no sexual tension. All the things that made the original so great have been excised for the sake of commercialism (and to avoid offending religious people who can't bear to have their beliefs questioned).I won't say it's the worst movie of all time, or even the worst one I've seen this year, but I had to see how it compared to the original (not well).

Laughable, incoherent, digusting, insulting, there aren't enough adjectives to accurately portray the extent of this movie's failure. I've never seen the original, and I went into this movie having never even read a plot summary. Afterwards I wish nothing more than to purge this utter nonsense from my mind.

This is largely because (as I have now seen the previous version) the islanders are turned into a bunch of vicious maneating feminazis. The second mistake was the switch in setting from Britain to the U.S. You can't turn Pagans into Puritans. Yes, they made reference to Celtic ancestors, but they seemed much more as if they were from Salem. It is as if the original has been sanitized of its nudity and religion, and made into an empty shell of a movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid like the plague!","review":"This film is awful! It has got to be one of the worst remakes in recent memory. The acting is awful (was Nicolas Cage short on cash or drunk when he read this script and agreed to be in this film?) It lacks just about everything of the original, the inhabitants of the island have suddenly become some sort of Celtic feminist fundamentalists, Nicolas Cage is so anoying throughout the film by the end of it you are almost siding with the locals to having him burned at the stake. This film is awful in every way.Do yourself a favour and buy/rent the original, block this one out of your mind and pretend it was never made."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE worst movie I have EVER seen","review":"I've never been more sorry that I wasted my time watching such a pathetic movie in my life.

The movie is just horrible. I bought it used off of E-bay, and the previous owner hated it so much, it appears to have been purposely scratched. I almost understand. That's not easy to do with blu-rays scratch-resistant coating, but there is a wavy scratch going all of the way around the disc (human-made, obviously). Despite this, the disc worked in my PS3.Avoid this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Village meets 8mm","review":"It seems Nicolas Cage is in a movie every other month nowadays, so they can't all be good. This movie falls squarely (and flatly) in the \\"not good\\" category. Having not seen the original, all I can say is that throughout this flick (it seemed much longer than it was), I had the underlying, horrific feeling that it was supposed to be deeper than it was - that it hasd some \\"message\\" that I was somehow missing. Now having read the reviews of this version and the original 70s version, I understand why this movie had the ending it had. But otherwise, the ending definitely leaves you with a \\"what the hell was the point of all that?\\" feeling; that is never a sign of a good movie. It fact, it is usually the sign of a bad one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worth a rental","review":"Let me start off by saying, I have not seen the orignal Wicker Man. This movie kept me guessing all the way through, which earns it one star. I couldn't tell if Willow was intentionally mysterious or a victim of bad acting. I did enjoy Ellen Burstyn's performance as the \\"Queen Bee\\" so to speak. So many unanswered questions or things that didn't add up stop this from being a 4 or 5 star movie. I am generally not a fan of neat, tidy, happy endings, so that wasn't a problem for me, but the numerous loose ends were. Worth a rental, but probably not worth purchasing."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I could give it a half a star, I would","review":"This movie was a total waste of my money and time.

It has a nice heft and quality feel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sharpened Only on One Side","review":"This knife does not work well for slicing cheese. It is sharpened only on one side, so there is a bevel to the blade that forces the knife into or out of the cheese you are slicing, biasing towards one direction. This makes it nearly impossible to get a uniform slice of cheese, and often I get only a few shreds while the knife fights against me. It is of high quality construction and is quite sturdy. It has little teeth on the blade that help it bite into the cheese, but will prevent later re-sharpening. Even after much practice I cannot get it to work to reliably slice uniform slices of cheese."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get the Cutco cheese knife instead","review":"Bought as a gift - because I love my Cutco cheese knife (Cutco #1764) but was too cheap to fork out the $50 as a present. Thought this one would be similar - but it wasn't. It's passable for a cheese knife - but the Cutco cheese knife is by far superior - I use it several times a week to slice thin even slices off Tillamook cheddar bricks and it works like a dream - perfect and easily sliced pieces every time - I've never had a cheese slicer or knife that was half as good and I've tried half a dozen or more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleased with product","review":"I wanted this seasons set, its the one where the waltons took in the brother and sister from england, during the ww2."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Series, had one bad disk","review":"I watched this entire series, but when I watched season six, there was one warped disk that would not play, I had to reorder the entire season six just for that one bad disk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!

But her courage is remarkable and her acting ability, through her eyes and facial expressions, is still Emmy-worthy. Her scene with Michael Learned, trying to prepare the string beans, and then the final scene ever with Will Geer, who died unexpectedly two months after the filming of this episode, are unforgettable."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Walton's Legacy","review":"Season 6 is enjoyable, but the absence of \\"John Boy\\" is keenly felt. As well, the show employs a large cast so maintaining storyline quality/consistency is challenging.

Finally, a decent copy of George Cukor's final film.

The decades long friendship between a writer of highbrow elitist woman's fiction(Jacqueline Bisset) and one of lowbrow pop romances (Candice Bergen) is not only uninteresting it's unbelievable. Bisset makes her character palatable but the makers of this dreck villify Bergen's character making her an unbearably shrill shrew. A more accomplished actress could have engendered sympathy for their character but marginally talented actress like Bergen is not up to the task. \\"Rich and Famous\\" commits the cardinal sin of not being quite bad enough but only being mediocre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cherchez la Femme","review":"My opinion of films (other than horror or sci-fi category) is worthless since based upon the category of the hottie involved (and whether I would like to record or obtain for subsequent viewing).

It's neither. It's just plain awful. The two women, Candace Bergen and Jacqueline Bisset have zero chemistry, so why they are lifelong friends is a mystery here.

Jackie Bisset shines as a cynical gorgeous jealous writer who can't quite top the mouth of the south, Bergen, although she could have had her husband several times. i think it's a hoot with every cliche in the book but what fun, even thirty one years later, it still holds up as well as its stars do."},{"rating":"2","title":"What version is the real one?

This book takes a very multifaceted approach and looks beyond the automobile as its cause. The title is a little misleading. The book covers the downfall of public transpiration in California and how the car impacted life in southern California. There is actually very little urban analysis done here but it covers the public policy of early 1900's very well. You get a sense for how the municipalities and federal government responded in California and see the way in which the auto shaped those policies. The auto was very influential in the downfall of public transportation and I was surprised to see how many auto related interests owned stakes in public transport companies. For those just getting started on urban history this is a good book to start with and he sites the great source on suburbs Crabgrass Frontier (well worth the time to read).

It is so inconsistent. Sometimes it has a cast list, sometimes it only lists actors names but not the roles they play. If one wanted to find a certain Chan quote, there are only a few scatterd within the text. If one wanted to find in which film all the Chan family appears, there is no way to do so. If one wanted to freshen one's memory about the identity of the killer in any one film, Hanke fails you again. Then there are the errors...Keye Luke is listed as playing a dual role in The Feathered Serpent and this is untrue. It even gets the language wrong of the alternate version of Chan Carries on. In conclusion, there are now much better Chan books out there. Treat yourself to one of them. I like A Guide to Charlie Chan Films which is so much more complete and includes every clever Chan saying. All cast lists are complete. This is a much better book, more useful for Chan readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyed Reading","review":"I read the earlier version of this book and enjoyed it, mainly because the author took time to describe the Earl Derr Biggers Chan novels, which existed before the movies.

I don't get it. I didn't care about Frank's little narrow life with his pretentious tone. He was insincere with everyone he related to. He fit the realtor stereotype quite well (nothing against realtors). His son was a typical weird 15 year old with no depth to him. His daughter was contrived and Frank didn't seem to really care much about her--though he tried to make it seem he did (same with his son, for that matter). Cliche plot with predictable, shallow characters. Blech."},{"rating":"1","title":"One D Thing After Another","review":"Line by line the writing is superb.

There have been some great ones like Empire Falls, A Confederacy of Dunces, Shipping News, and A Thousand Acres, but the list has also become over populated with some stinkers, like Independence Day. The endless contemplation of nothing takes a toll and I felt like my life force was ebbing down with each page. Then I fell into depression by page 200. When did good story telling go out the window? Who lost the plot, or even something as simple as a purpose for the story? When did endless droning about nothing become publishable? I'm all for free-form writing, but, come on, have you ever seen so many run-on sentences that say absolutely nothing? Enough of the rant. This was a bad read for me.

It is dreadful. It is massively overrated: the book is a bundle of literary cliches. Are we this desperate for good literature that we have to make believe this is acceptable? The dialogue is horrendous, no one, and I mean no one, speaks like these characters. Worst of all is that this book is like a first draft, there are so many stupid errors it is insulting. Very, very sloppy. And the plot, and nearly every line, is utterly predictable; I was left with the sense that I've seen all of this someplace before, and done much better the first time.

I liked a lot about the book: the poetic writing, the description (Ford's top talent, in my opinion) and the journey into Frank's head. Sometimes, however, Frank's detached narration (characteristic of his striving for normalcy in the \\"Existence Period,\\" I suppose) is off-putting and overly languorous. Dialog is not Ford's strength, either.If you've read other reviews of this book, you know that many people love Ford and almost as many hate him. Whether you are at one of these poles or in between depends upon what you value and where you are in life. If you like character-driven fiction that paints scenes slowly and examines inner lives rather than following a strong plot, check out first The Sportswriter then Independence Day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wordy","review":"Arduous reading. And wordy-lordy! Maybe I just missed the comedy that is referenced in the reviews, but I didn't smile once. That's ok, but neither did I see any redemption. I'll grant you that it has insight, but it's bleak and depressing. Maybe I am at the wrong stage of my life (mid 30's, one 2 yr old) to sufficiently appreciate it. Also, I read it immediately after a Vonnegut novel (Bluebeard, which was pretty good), which is kind of anti-wordy and has more obvious humor, and so on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring.","review":"Yes, Richard Ford can construct a nice sentence and he has a fine command of the English language. However, if this book is an example of his story-telling abilities, he's missing the boat. Other reviewers have gone into depth, describing the plot and characters, why they liked or disliked them. I'm not interested enough to do that. Basically, this book was boring. I cared nothing about any of the characters and there was NO plot.

Imagine your most boring relative telling you the same story over and over and over like their opinion on everything is so deep that you should be in awe. Now imagine you paid them to tell it to you...egads...there you have my opinion of this book. Great for insomnia."},{"rating":"1","title":"Emotionally threadbare account of a non-pivotal moment.","review":"The book lacks any of the richness we associate with fine novels.One character dominates the book, and everyone else is filtered through his self deluded know-all understand- all sensibility. The great moment which is supposed to signal the end of Frank's existence period is underwhelming. Some good descriptions of small-town ambience may be the best part of what is otherwise the portrait of a remarkably passive and uninteresting person. There had better be a better novel on contemporary life being written out there"},{"rating":"1","title":"A long, weary slog.","review":"Tedious, overwritten and overlong, Independence Day tackles one great theme; the existential human predicament of 'being in the world in time' and misses the mark by miles. To centre one man's crisis around two or three relatively mundane situations is risk enough, and Ford is no E.M. Forster. He lacks the subtle judgement that Forster used to sustain the narrative structure and his use of language, though often clever and evocative disappears in a mire of inaction. This is a hard book to get through, partly because of backward nods in the direction of experimental fiction but mainly because of its length and lack of narrative pointers. Ford's descriptive talents are good and his characterization excellent, but character development over 450 pages isn't much of a challenge if that's all you're doing. Where's the novel?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Independence Day was a Chore to Read","review":"Tiresome and uninspiring reading. The plodding characterizations and descriptions become very predictable after the first two or three chapters. What was the point of the book? That there is no point and one can simply drift through life amid countless observations and canny remarks?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Who are these \\"Judges\\" that hand out the Pulitzer?","review":"I admit it. I read a mere hundred and fifty pages of this book which I feel is as heroic a gesture as I'm capable of. A hundred and fifty pages of epilogue. A novel in which the major events have already taken place, leaving one the feeling of getting to the ball park just after the last pitch is thrown. Reading this gobbler is like listening to a lousy comic explain why his mirthless jokes are funny. Dull events, lifeless people. Another middle aged man's apology for the boredom and confusion he inflicts on himself and others.Humorless and filled with pointless observations. Life is too short for this kind of \\"literature\\". I quit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wish I could give it 10 stars","review":"This is a book that is fit to win the Nobel as well as the Pulitzer. I read it and heard it on tape and was mesmerized (Recorded Books, Inc. has it and the reader, Richard Poe, is brilliant). It made me feel wonderful - peaceful - that a great book could be written about a good, good man. It's funny, sweet, sad - Richard Ford has given me a gift and I thank him. I love that a lot of his \\"good intentions\\" go to hell, but that doesn't change his sense of humor or his basic love of life. His characters are priceless: the pathetic couple excited to buy a home in New Jersey only to find that they can't really afford it; Frank's hinky son; his kooky (and ungrateful) tenants. I love Frank Bascombe - hope there's going to be more about him - long may he wave."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much pathos","review":"By the time I was half-way through with this book I no longer cared about the main character Frank Bascome. He seemed so self-absorbed and frankly whiny. The writing is excellent but I don't understand how I am supposed to relate to this person who seems so out of touch with every other person he comes in contact with. He doesn't understand his clients, his ex-wife, his maybe-girlfriend, his son. I just don't find the writing to be Pulitzer Prize material unless, like some modern art, it was meant to be above all of us plebeian readers. If this is my problem, I accept that but I read to be entertained, not to have to analyze each sentence."},{"rating":"1","title":"S Riden claims this is JUST NOT ENOUGH","review":"I read Ford because he's the son of our 38th president, my personal favorite. But Ford (the author) just not up there with the Clancies and the Krytons. Firstly, this is no companion piece to Born on the Fourth of July (Kovacs), whatever anyone says. That's misleading. That's just a lot of chin music, nothing else. Ford gets compared to Hemingway sometimes, but Independence Day is nowhere near as good as The Sun Rises, too. Just hooey with a capital H. Absolute hooey."},{"rating":"1","title":"OMG this book sux","review":"I had to read this book and it made me so bored i fell asleep at the wheel just thinking about it.

One character dominates the whole story line whereas the other characters are just nobody's.

However, the question persists: have I missed something? Am I simply too young to understand what is going on? Was I supposed to identify with Bascomb? Could anybody? To compare such a cliche-ridden, tired piece of calculated Americana with the works of Updike and Irving seems to me nothing short of heresy. Great American Novel my left foot. Hmmph."},{"rating":"1","title":"This won a Pulitzer?","review":"With 100 pages to go, I was thinking, \\"how's this guy going to pull a Pulitzer out of this one?\\". Having made the arduous trek through those pages, I still can't figure it out. How can this work stack up with past winners such as Breathing Lessons, Beloved, Ironweed, and many more? After finishing the book my immediate thought was that the award committee must be stacked with middle-aged, divorced white men with delusions of their physical attractiveness, and sexual prowess. I won't belabor the point. I think most of the reviews in the under 5 category summarize my feelings. Except for some college text books, I've never read a novel that disinterested me more"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd rather walk than drive this Ford","review":"\\"Independence Day\\" is the worst. Just atrocious. And here's the reason why: Ford is a phony. His work, as a whole, is a boring, New Age post-Hemingway dress-up party thrown by a host who's more interested in retreading better, more original writers' ideas than in being a wayfarer himself. And for his fans who feel they're getting a more \\"authentic\\" writer over the \\"fast food fiction\\" of today should read their Kurt Vonnegut and Donald Barthelme again to see that you can indeed write a text that moves quickly without sacrificing any depth or lack of big ideas.So I totally concur with the other readers who don't \\"get\\" Richard Ford. Here's the thing: they're getting him just fine. And there's nothing there. \\"The Sportswriter\\" was as humorless as they come, and \\"Independence Day\\" falls right into line."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zzzzzz...","review":"I tried with this one too, I really did, but I couldn't get through the first one hundred pages of this book for the life of me. After two different tries I must say that this is the most boring novel I have ever read, and that's a difficult thing for me to say. I have always been able to hold my own with literature, past and present. I waded through \\"War and Peace\\" with relative ease. I LOVED the heavily-interior \\"The Scarlet Letter\\" and other older, canonical works, but this one didn't have anything interesting whatsoever in it. Only invest your time in something you could get insight, entertainment and pleasure from, not this 450-page snoozefest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did I miss something?","review":"I like reading. I am a literature snob. I put down poorly written novels (even though I can't write well myself!). But, I think I've met my match in this novel. I recognize the style is something unique, but I just couldn't grasp the rhythm. I'm afraid I'm going to have to side with those who gave this book thumbs down. I really want to be in the group that appreciates this Plitzer Prize novel, but I don't make the cut.HOwever, I'd love to read more from reviewers on what they saw in this book because I just couldn't find much other than the rambling thoughts of a very whiny and boring 40-something man whom I would't enjoy spending a 3-day-weekend with at all.I've persistantly struggled through 180 pages, but now will surrender!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A pleasant surprise","review":"I read Independence Day only because the bookstore didn't have The Sportswriter, and I was eager to see what Richard Ford was like. This was a laugh out loud book for me, but also one that I still think about frequently, over a year and a half after I read it. Until I read the other on-line reviews of Independence Day, I would have recommended it to anyone. I assumed everyone would love it as much as I did. Far from boring, I enjoyed reading it, did not find it too wordy, and really enjoyed the narrator's interaction with his son. Remember the basketball hall of fame museum? How about the batting cages? I also loved his interaction with his new girlfriend, the one he may or may not love. This novel was realistic and hopeful. I have yet to read The Sportswriter, but I am sure I will enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"My fifth \\"reading\\"...eek","review":"I am on my fifth \\"reading\\" of Independence Day. To clarify:I keep getting the Recorded Books, Inc. version out of thelibrary, read spectacularly, artfully, sympathetically,sensitively by the great reader, Richard Poe. I identify with the reviewer below who said that his writing was influenced by this book. I keep wanting to hear Ford'swords, his rhythms, because they give rise to my own\\"voice\\" and they are so natural.I think I love books like this because they have a sort ofintimacy you don't get anywhere else. It's as if Frank Bascombe is confiding in you, and that is so charming.Charming is the word for this book, and I am a sucker forit. Can't get enough of it. It's my \\"book of choice\\" for life,along with a handful of others.

And I will certainly buy more when the time and the money are right."},{"rating":"2","title":"A definitive performance","review":"Aside from flowery descriptions of music and sunshine, there are a few points that make this recording so important:1. Casals was the first cellist to perform all of Bach's Cello Suites--he brought this music to the public's attention when nobody knew about it.2. Casals worked on his interpretations of these pieces for years before recording them. He loved these pieces (and was in awe of them) and wanted to make sure that his recording would do them justice.Casals' recordings must be considered the benchmark--they set the standard for how Bach's Cello Suites would be thought of and played. Many other cellists have made great recordings, but they are all indebted to Casals because he probably inspired each of them by his superb example. For these reasons, anyone who really cares about this music should have Casals' recordings."},{"rating":"2","title":"A timeless classic","review":"After years of telling myself \\"sometime I will get a recording of Casals playing the Bach suites\\" I finally did. His rendition is flawless, at least to my ears. The liner notes explain that he found the music in a dusty shop when he was in his early teens, and devoted years and years of study to their performance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pau Casals, the Universal Catalan Cello Player","review":"It is sad that the universal Catalan PAU CASALS is remembered with the Spanish name 'Pablo'.

She teaches not only how to draw and paint animals, trees, clouds and people, but includes such esoteric subjects as aboriginal design and islamic architecture!

So it lives up to that part of its promise.The Bad:It's hard to keep pencils from spinning as I hold them in the sharpener. The motor and blades aggressively shake the pencil from side to side, and you need a Kung-Fu grip to hold on. I could deal with that, since the powerful motor and sharp blades at least work quickly. However, every pencil that goes in this machine comes out with one side of the point still covered with wood and the other side very deeply exposing the lead. I have another pencil sharpener that never does this, and I tried the same pencils on both my regular sharpener and this one, so I know it's the machine and not the pencil.

It took too long to sharpen, and when it was finally sharpen one side of the tip still had wood around it. You kinda had to twist it around so it can get all the sides. but still it was not all that good, pencil lead would break offwhile writing. I think because the way it was sharpening (or maybe cause I had to twist it around while sharpening) but the point is that it didn't sharpen the way a sharpener is suppose too.

I tried this sharpener on my pencils right away and the point it produces is perfect. Not only that, compared to other pencil sharpeners I have from Staples for example, it is extremely quiet. I sharpened a dozen or so of my colored pencils without mishap. The machine is heavy so it stays put when the pencil is inserted. It does vibrate as it runs, but nothing serious. It tries to rotate the pencil in a rather odd manner as it sharpens but it works so who cares about that.A very good pencil sharpener.AD2"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Design - Stay Away","review":"As other reviewers have noted, this sharpener has all sorts of problems - noisy, slow, jams a lot. The worst part, though, is that it only sharpens one side of the pencil, which results in a pencil that is largely unusable when sharpened.

In fact, had it not arrived IN an Amazon box I would've thought that's exactly what had happened!The only use I've found for it -- since I'm certainly not going to wear such a poorly made item -- is to keep a set of washcloths neatly rolled.

Malzberg keeps threatening 2 write something called \\"The True, Terrible History of Science Fiction,\\" & I wish he would do it. I think the essay is the form he was meant 2 Xpress himself in. This is an intense, screaming book of criticism, suffused by Malzberg's deep love 4 SF. He tops the book off with a short story called \\"Corridors\\" that sums up many of the essays collected here.

Yeah, it's about self-discovery, but it's not a self-help book. It's about mountain biking, but not how-to. It's about spirituality, but not religious. It's funny, but not .... well, you get the picture. The BikePath deserves its own kiosk, because it is, simply, like nothing you've read before. The BikePath is about the metamorphosis of a man, a soul, a writer. The author begins as a two pack smoker, 6 pack drinker - out of shape, out of control. In fact, the author's writing style very closely parallels his mountain biking skills. Awkward and slow at first, but by mid-book, the biker is becoming a master of the trail, while the writer is becoming gifted artist. It's really fun to watch the evolution of both.

The Masons even add that the Holy Scripture is the one true Word, offering Holy Bibles to their Master Masons. Ask how secretive the Elks are. You can't even get into their building.

From her beginnings in the south to making it big in hollywood and international marriage to roald dahl, her life had it's share of ups and downs. Neal's book is an honest look at how to overcome adversity, (of which she had plenty)taking responsibility for your choices and then ordering meaning from those choices. Most interesting is her affair with Gary Cooper, marriage to the difficult Roald Dahl and recovery from her stroke. I particularly liked her reasons for writing this book. It grew out of the anguish which ensued from her husband's affair and subsequent divorce. She felt that the act of remembering would be an act of salvation.

We're always expecting a Worlds Apart, A Behavior, or A House of Cards. But this is a good one for us! It's worth the buy. Share with newbies to Saga, they may like it.20/20 and Human Condition CD's need to be heard too. Those 2 are outstanding. Human Condition has an interim lead singer and he is great!

Many people may not give this religion its due respect, but this book goes a long way of showing where the true faith of Islam is and where the modern issues regarding it have come from.

Aslan has done a good job by encapsulating the past 1400 years of islamic history in 300 pages or so.

He presents the background, the origins, and the developments very clearly. He is able to see both sides of the current unrest and and terrorism in the Middle East. My only negative is that the history of the leaders after Muhammad gets rather tedious. He discusses the major sects and some of the more recent fundamentalist ones in a way that is understandable.

Thus, one should not expect Islam to resolve its differences quickly - so says Reza Aslan. On the other hand, with the exception of Northern Ireland, Christianity put this behind it long, long ago.Because of the variability of the Arabic language, wildly different translations of the Quran exist. This problem has been compounded by additions and changes imposed by those with high religious status among his successors.

The author's major problem is that he grew up in America, and understanably, sees the Islamic world and history from that Christianized perspective. The Koran is written in an old fashioned language and script that is not easily accessible to the modern arabic reader. Couple that with the fact that illiteracy rates are very high in many Islamic-dominant countries, except his home country of Iran, and they are at the mercy of the mullahs who preach and teach whatever they interpret as \\"holy writ\\". With over 240 admonitions to control, convert, or kill the infidel, and only one or two mentions of Love in a Christian sense, it's no wonder the Islamic fundamentalist have won the reformation battle. Game over. Anyone who espouses a modernistic reform agenda will be be rooted out, and struck down. It's dangerous wishful thinking otherwise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ashamed of Islam","review":"Good writer. Poor exposure of Islam. My overall impression was that the author is ashamed of Islam. He's trying hard (maybe subconsciently) to justify his religion and to make it suitable for an evolved life in the 2000's .It must be painful for an educated, cultured muslim to lower himself to accept and follow(!) such primitive doctrines. Mr. Aslan MUST follow Mohammed's example no matter what school of thought he subscribes to. He does not seem to know precisely what school would that be."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Dead by James Joyce","review":"This, of course, is a classic. It is a small, intense description of a private party in Dublin in the early 1900's in wintertime. It describes the characters, the events, the atmosphere of the evening and the relationships (sometimes strained) between the different parties at the event. It captures the mood perfectly. The version I purchased from Kindle was annotated which was very helpful from the viewpoint of the famous people of the time who are mentioned throughout and who have since been forgotten. It is a simple story, drawn very much from Joyce's own life, wife, friends and relations. Well worth reading, especially for the last few pages which really capture the moment. There was also a marvellous film adaptation of this story starring Angelica Houston, directed by John Houston which is well worth watching.

The tension builds and builds, but it can't be sustained and it collapses. The last half gets to be tedious and trite. Perhaps it is inevitable, after building up the monster it has to be disposed of.

If you liked Goldsmith's film score to \\"Under Fire\\", this may give you the same feelings.Electronics, keyboards, flutes, percussion. Although the rhythms are strong here, it is primarily focused on very strong melodies, but no vocals, these are all instrumentals.

First of all, it's difficult to shine in this role when the soprano who gave its best rendition ever (Gheorghiu's 1994 ROH with Solti conducting) is still well and alive and performs it even now in her late forties. Second, there are issues of affinity, fit, and match, and Fleming and Violetta do not go well together. Third, she tends to be mannered, a problem that undermines her portrayal especially in the crucial act II. Fourth, not much of a chemistry with Villazon...I like Fleming in Strauss and Mozart, but Verdi in general and Traviata in particular are not her thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"La Traviata with renovated airs","review":"Excellent production. Excellent singing by Renee Fleming a very convincing Violeta projected through her magnific dramatic capabilities. Her beautiful voice recreates the suffering and happiness of this poor soul in Paris. Fleming shows once again her top star colors.

The magnificently detailed production and the ideal cast of singers, including in a small role Daniel Montenegro (one of the American Tenors from the 2003 PBS concert), is a performance to treasure. Ms Fleming has instinctively chosen this as the right time for her to take on the role of the courageous and tragic Verdi courtesan and she is on point every step of the way. Maestro Villazon is brilliant and touching and his interaction with Ms Fleming could have set off the fire sprinklers in the theatre. A not-to-be-missed pairing in a finely crafted production.

At first listen, it seems homogenous and almost uniformly low-key. Repeated listening delineates the songs, which are understated jewels. There are some subtle, deft and very adventurous musical touches throughout, and Natalie Merchant's vocals are nothing short of exquisite. \\"Golden Boy,\\" \\"The Worst Thing\\" and \\"Tell Yourself\\" are impeccably written songs that benefit from pristine production, but don't suffer from the cold detachment found in the work of other artists who use understatement (Suzanne Vega, for example) because Merchant's vocals contain a depth of emotion that is found in virtually no one else's.

I must say that I am one of Natalie's biggest fans, but I also have to be honest in saying that I was very disappointed with this new CD. Every song is depressing and melancholy. I think the reason she went solo was to actually make music that she was limited in making with the 10,000 Maniacs. Tigerlily captured it. Unfortunately, it looks like Natalie has run out of things to say that would make a solo effort worthwhile.

When Natalie Merchant left the group, I was skeptical about either's ability to continue creating good music. I've been proven wrong in most cases -- Tigerlilly and Ophelia were both strong records. More than the sound of any particular song or the instrumentation or the vocals, the thing that ties all of the music together (and the thing that makes it good), is that it is interesting. There's a cool riff, or a cool groove, or something, in each and every one of the songs on each and every one of the albums. Motherland is another story.

With Tigerlily and Ophelia, you kick your shoes off, close your eyes, and relax instantly. With Motherland, you are painfully aware of the music.... Natalie deepens her voice in this CD -- so much so that you can't relax.

The good stuff is worth it though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Opulent follow-up","review":"Recording for this album finished in New York on 9 September 2001, two days before the World Trade Center, Pentagon and Shanksville PA attacks, and it is dedicated to all the victims. Some of the songs seem to allude to the event, especially the song Motherland, although obviously they could not without a very uncanny prescience. Perhaps it is the overall mood of wistful melancholia that captures something of the zeitgeist.Motherland continues in the opulent style of its 1998 predecessor Ophelia, with an exemplary team of supporting musicians. The inimitable Mavis Staples helps out on the ironic gospel-flavoured St Judas and on the devil-banishing Build A Levee, while the beautiful song Henry Darger benefits from a full-scale orchestra, arranged and conducted by Stephen Barber.A work of true quality, although a couple of tracks lack don't go that extra mile in inspiration"},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceptional third album from Natalie","review":"It's so disheartening to know that Britney Spears, rap, Usher, etc, are ruling the charts when an immensely talented artist like Natalie can barely sell 500,000 copies anymore. Motherland is, as far as I'm concerned, Natalie's best work to date. The music doesn't follow her traditional piano ballad formula. The songs are all unique and have some amazing lyrics. My favourite songs are This House is on Fire, Saint Judas, Golden Boy, Just Can't Last and I'm Not Gonna Beg."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best ever--perfect craftmanship","review":"Although I've often enjoyed her music, I have never found myself checking in for the release date for the next work. That changes with this CD. The lyrics, the musicianship, the perfect production make this her best CD ever. Do not miss it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Terrible, Self-Indulgent Bore","review":"I have been a fan of Natalie since 1988. Her intelligent, quirky lyrics and delivery were consistently spellbinding. Her solo efforts have been spotty at best, while still yielding the occasional gems like \\"Ophelia,\\" and \\"7 Years.\\" This album, however, seems to have been written and recorded in about an hour. The observations are pat, the lyrics paint-by-numbers, and the music? It all sounds like one big long bad song. Natalie would do well to collaborate musically. Think of all the interesting and engaging covers she does live! The reason they are interesting is that they were written by someone with different sensibilities. \\"Build A Levee?\\" C'mon. Even Mavis Staples can't save that one. Save your money and give \\"In My Tribe\\" and \\"Natalie Live\\" another listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sexy and soulful","review":"The album seems a bit more down and dirty than some of her other works and I love it. T-Bone Burnett's influence is felt heavily here, but it only flavors Merchant's voice - not overpowering it. This album was worth the wait for we, the die-hard fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get the Grammy ready...","review":"As much as I loved Tigerlily & Ophelia (as well as her 10,000 Maniacs work), MOTHERLAND is the CD that I've always hoped Natalie Merchant would make. It's the perfect combination of soulful songs that make her concerts first rate and the poppy, but meaningful songs that have become her trademark.If there is any justice in the world, the Grammy voters will FINALLY take notice of Natalie Merchant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful, mysterious,rich","review":"Motherland is the first CD I have bought from Ms. Merchant. And I must say, I adore it. Rich with rythym and smooth groove, it combines that richness with gorgeous, thought provoking lyrics delivered by her exquisite vocals.I would like to add that I am a fan of R&B, so the fact that I bought a Natalie Merchant CD may boggle the mind. But not really if you think about her wonderful, full-bodied use of instruments. (Mavis Staples makes a brief guest appearance on a track! Now THAT'S fantastic! Their voices melt into one another perfectly.) I definitely prefer this work to alot of the other CDs I have purchased high on sounds, but low on intellectual content. She is not pretentious in her lyrics (to some critics, anyone singing with substantial lyrics is considered \\"pretentious\\"), but poetic and clear. Each song stands solidly on its own, and yet the entire CD is an experience.Beautiful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ignore the bad reviews!","review":"Natalie's voice has NEVER been better and her song-writing is amazing. I guess people expect her to release another Tigerlily but Motherland is MUCH, MUCH better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rich Musical Landscape","review":"I first became a Natalie Merchant convert after purchasing \\"Ophelia\\" my junior year of high school. That album's resounding, poetic and inherently painful ballads were instantly absorbed into my personal soundtrack for that year, and hearing them still evokes a myriad of emotions and memories specific to that time. I've eagerly awaited Natalie's follow-up.\\"Motherland\\" both meets and confounds all expectations. Though the songs are, for the most part, melacholy-tinged ballads, they are also wildly versatile and courageously experimental.Natalie's vocals -- as appealingly distinctive as ever -- explore a wide variety of new terrain, from blues to Latin to middle-eastern. The result is a richly intriguing landscape of voices and sounds -- a Motherland meant to be explored, enjoyed and nurtured.This album is an experience, and one worth having.TIM"},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible","review":"As amazing as she always has been, this is, by far, Natalie's best. It is sensual, genuine, deep, and empowering."},{"rating":"2","title":"Motherland ~ Natalie Merchant","review":"Natalie Merchant's soulful new CD will help you to relax and unwind after a long & tiring day.

I've got just about all her albums...great stuff...and love the few times I've seen her \\"live\\" on television...but what is wrong with her voice? I've listened to this album several times over the years I've had it here, and just keep thinking that she sounds like someone who was advised to smoke a lot of cheap cigars, in an effort to lower or deepen her voice...and possibly a daily ration of scotch to go with that. She sounds tired, gray, and as if someone has slowed down the record...like someone trudging through a foggy day. I suppose it could be that her overflowing social conscience has her thinking she's a woman of color now, and she's trying to emulate the sound of a black woman blues singer...I don't know...but it's sad."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Juicy Peach of an Album","review":"This saleswoman is one of my favorite singers on the planet. She writes beautiful lyrics, is easy on the eye--her lips and her legs send me into an apoplectic fit of joy--, is socially aware, and is a darn good cyclist. I've listened to this album of well-written and beautiful songs about 342 times and each time it brings a smile to my face. I also feel compelled to mention that I loooooove peaches. I like to rub them, snuggle with them, devour them, and stick my oversized noggin right in between them. What a peachy delight this cd is.

At the so-called \\"super-systemic\\" level history making decisions about the EU system are being made. Examples of this kind are the Maastricht or Amsterdam treaties. At the systemic level, the EU institutions (Council, Parliament, Commission, Court of Justice) interact and decide directives. Details of such directives are worked out at the sub-systemic level where the committees of these various institutions are active.The authors also spend some time explaining the basic makeup of these EU institutions.They then concentrate on the most important policy areas.

I've been a past admirer of Peters and his delivery technique as a harsh but incisive corporate coach. But the ideas are slowing down, and although you may be dazzled with the puzzling and busy page layouts of the book, drill down further and you realize perhaps Peters has done his best, but ideas aren't as forthcoming as his younger and more active years. This is no crime, but I suspect his reputation now precedes his content. I much prefer the \\"The Art of Happiness at Work\\" by HH Dalai Lama, or the new Asia book \\"Dot ZEN\\" by a tag team of new authors in the Far East. Quirky but refreshing with lots of real stories out of the East."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying","review":"I downloaded a copy of this book from Itunes for my ipod. He was hard to understand.

The design is awful and will give one a headache just attempting to keep up with the graphics and sidebars. I'm a Tom Peters fan, but this book was a disappointment. He states the obvious, retreads old stuff, and makes no compelling case, other that his \\"I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore\\" attitude (which is admirable to a point).

This would be good book to supply with an accompanying DVD to get the full impact of Mr. Peter's enthusiasm.The references to white-collar jobs being replaced by a cheap microprocessors or cheap labor was right on the mark. Thoughts were freely borrowed from others such as Pink's \\"Free Agent Nation,\\" but that's ok.The lists of sources referenced throughout the book were worth the price of the book.

I considered this book especially valuable for young people as they start their careers.But the book itself is disappointing in its format. It is very fragmented and looks like a cartoon.

At first I was sceptical of the credence of these links to the brain but by the time I had read the first few chapters I was genuinely intrigued by the way Shakespeare does seem to have known about the brain.One criticism that may be leveled is that it may not go into real depth in either of the fields the book covers, and for this reason it might not appeal to a true expert in Neurology or Shakesperean literature.

Wynton's interpretations of some of these pieces are laughable in their complete lacking of any sense of direction. Compare his recordings of the Enesco and Hindemith with ones put out by Phil Smith and Charlie Schleuter,amd it is like listening to a student play a piece for his teacher, and then the teacher playing it the way it ought to go.

Although the films surveyed are perhaps more well-known now than they were on their first release, it's interesting to find out what Turan thinks of them.

There is no inductive or deductive reasoning that leads to any property of God."},{"rating":"1","title":"Minnie Pearl autobiography","review":"A wonderful story!

From the reviews it seemed like it would be a good book for me as I like the versatility of being given measurements based on gauge, then being free to innovate from there. She has size charts for men based on shoe size 6-15, for women, shoe size 5-12 and for kids, shoe sizes 4-13.

As a knitter of medium experience (sweaters, scarves, and afghans), I was intrigued by the idea of knitting socks but didn't have time to take a class. After my first failed attempt with multicolored yarn on size 0 double-points, I ordered this book and worked through first the \\"class sock\\" and then a second, larger test sock to learn technique on larger needles with a solid-color worsted weight. Now I'm finishing up a pair of socks (using a fabulous, sparkly Fortissima Colori yarn on size 1 needles) that are turning out so well I wouldn't be embarrassed to give them as a gift--but I don't want to part with them! The only improvement I can think of, if the book is reprinted, would be to make it spiral-bound."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love Charlene Schurch's books!","review":"In my ever-so-humble opinion, this is the way ALL sock patterns should be written. It is so discouraging to find a great pattern and then realize it is written for someone with teeny tiny feet! Other books suggest using larger or smaller needles to adjust the foot circumference, but with many patterns the use of larger needles wreaks havoc on stitch definition.So thank you to Charlene Schurch, who understands!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful book","review":"If you can only afford one book on sock making, THIS is the one that you need.

In this part, instructions for the instep and sole are reversed, and (as another reviewer noted), there is no accounting for the two remaining wraps. If you have made socks before, or if you have completed the book's \\"class sock,\\" you can figure out what to do. Still, it is odd that a book with such detailed and clear directions for the kitchener stitch and for the class sock becomes so utterly confounding in this section.

Did not mind the wait in between. You know the cliche...less is more. This is not a page-turner-find-out-who-dunnit of a book. More of a go-along-and see-what-happens-next story. Like to go along as primary characters gain some insight? Like to come across secondary characters who have some sort of quality that keep them from being bogged down in the \\"who's that?\\" pit? Ms. Letts' style keeps the story moving along--the right amount of visual description of what you'd see were you there, without pushing the reader to the \\"get on with it\\" moment; some local flavor without going \\"corn-pone\\"-ish on us; a few remember-when flashes for the readers over 30 :). Look out for a breath-taker near the ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unhappy birth mother","review":"As a birth mother to a child given up for adoption more than 30 years ago I was so disappointed with Billie Lett's attitude toward adoption. Does she think a child would be better off with a 15 year old mother than it would be with 2 stable parents that couldn't have children of their own? I loved her other 2 books but almost threw this one off the airplane I was flying in while reading it. I was so upset that I didn't even care who-done-it or how it ended.

Basically it asserts that mothers who give up their children don't love them enough to keep them. That's patently untrue, and caused me to be concerned about, 1) young women who might read this novel and feel that this is a prevailing opinion, and 2) men and women who have been adopted feeling that their mothers didn't care about them.Frankly, this spoiled the whole book for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"a bitter disappointment","review":"After waiting for another book by this author, I was truly disappointed by a run of the mill whodunnit. I should probably call it a \\"whocarewhodunnit\\". I found Ms Letts's first two novels engaging;filled with interesting characters. This story is simplistic, filled with a cast of characters one can barely keep straight and in the end everything and everyone seemed forced. Shoot The Moon was neither a good mystery nor an interesting character study. Without giving anything away, the questions that Nick (the main character) gets answers for and the relationships that he forms are not remotely fulfilling or well-defined.

Happily, I enjoyed Shoot the Moon nearly as much. So much so that I devoured it in only a couple of days!Billie Letts has a way of writing that really makes you care about the characters. That is what keeps the reader wanting more, I think. This book was the perfect balance of mystery, a little romance set in a small town that provided a great background with stories of it's own. The main plot of the book though is about a man who is visiting a small town to find his birth mother, only to discover that she was murdered when he was 10 months old. Now, 30 years later he's trying to find a killer and get to know the family he never knew he had.If you haven't read Letts, I really recommend her.

Unfortunately, I was very disappointed. I never cared about the charactors, the writing was simplistic and the conclusion was wrapped up too quickly. Beverly Hills millionaires don't behave like Mark Allbright, the charactor of Ivy was not fully developed - I never got a feel for who she was and she and Mark's relationship was completely unbelievable and the reason for Gaylene's murder was just plain ridiculous. I never figured out who shot Mark. Did Ms. Letts reveal this or did I miss it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waited eagerly for this one, but...","review":"Oh, how I wanted to love this book.

It had a little bit of everything thrown in - intrigue, murder, romance, and plenty of excitement. The characters were all interesting and the resolution, though bittersweet, was fairly satisfying. The plot twisted along in pretty unpredictable ways, too. I would definitely read another one of this author's books. And it was a fast read, too! Though I must admit, the whole cousins thing was rather troublesome for me for a while.

As you follow Mark in his pursuit of his roots and the mystery that surrounds his adoption, Letts' explores the importance we have of knowing who we are and where we came from and the treasures that await us when we can open up and allow ourselves to be loved by others.While some of the other reviewers were disappointed with Shoot the Moon in comparison with Billie Letts earlier novels, I found the writing and story to be just as good~"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Book I have Read","review":"This is the best book I have ever read! I was absorbed into the story right from the beginning and could NOT put the book down! I fell in love with the characters, and the story is the perfect mix of suspense, mystery, drama, love story, and comedy. I LOVED IT! Thoroughly developed, quirky characters. I can picture all of it in my mind as if I were there. I did not want the book to end, though I was desperate to solve the mystery! This book will appeal to many different kinds of people, and is my #1 favorite book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shoot the Moon","review":"Shoot the Moon is a quiet mystery which winds slowly along gradually revealing a small town full of characters most of us no longer see in our hustle and bustle in the big city. The personalities are diverse, some touched with the curret culture of the Cherokee, giving us a further look into a way of life so different from ours. You feel comfortable and familiar with these people although it is nearly impossible to identify with any of them.Billie Letts dialogue is just unequaled in today's novels,making the book easy to read. Her character studies are not overly deep, but the charm of small town Oklahoma and the excellent dialogue and many diverse personalities are cleverly presented around the diary excerpts of a young girl murdered many years ago.The book is well worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Mystery","review":"This is my first experience with Billie Letts, but it will not be my last. She tells a compelling story, with characters who live after the final page is turned. Mark or Nicky Jack, as he was named at birth, finds more than he hoped for when he travels to DeClare, Oklahoma, searching for the mother who birthed him.The town is astir as they find out that Nicky Jack is alive. When the story leaks, reporters camp out and trail him.

The title track is a densely layered piece of psychedelia, oddly cheery, while \\"The Spiritually Immature Mansion\\" sounds more akin to what had come before when he was still Manitoba -- simple, stripped-down, wistfully melodic. The introduction of \\"Boreal Forest Opper\\" toots along with pan flutes and guitars, layered over crunchy textures, before the bulk of the song appears as a thick miasma of sound.

There are 21 songs on this cd and I can't listen to this cd all the way through because it does get repetitive after about the 16th song even though this is a greatest hits album. If you want a good toasters release go for Skaboom! or New York Fever.

Finally, we'd get creative and use what commands we did understand to complete the exercises. This is good if you're trying to learn creative problem solving, but not so good if you want to learn all the features of Autocad LT.

No spectacular sets, just talented actors portraying multi-dimensional characters. Superb acting, thought-provoking story and a little romance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"I will freely admit that I bought this because Gerry Butler was part of the cast. His performance didn't disappoint me and it's easy to see why \\"The Jury\\" was instrumental when the powers-that-be where casting for the movie \\"Phantom Of The Opera\\".That said, I was just drawn in to the drama from the begining. The story about the various lives of those who are chosen to sit on the jury of a hightly charged murder trial is great. All the actors are outstanding. Worthwhile watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good mini series","review":"Like most, I got this for Gerard Butler, but also for the good reviews and I like to widen out to watching movies from different countries. I'm not usually a big fan of British entertainment, but I did like this. All the acting was solid. It was pretty good for most of it, but it REALLY got interesting once the jury went into deliberation. That took the whole series up several notches and made me glad I spent the money to watch it.As far as not being rated....I would have given it a strong PG-13 for language. I was told they can allow three \\"F\\" words in a PG-13 and I counted three. Something to keep in mind if you are sensitive to cursing like I am. Some of the pictures of the murder scene were a tad graphic as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Brilliant Masterpiece","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this work because it is focuses not just on the trial but on the personel lives of the jury members.

If you like Gerard , you will definitely want to buy this movie, he gives a great performance.The only problem I had was in the end you are left with a cliff hanger, I found myself re watching the movie to see if I had missed something important, but it is just how the writers wanted to leave you, still with some doubts about the verdict. I would definitely encourage you to check this one out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent British TV Mini-Series","review":"\\"The Jury\\" is one of those British TV productions that has it all.

The recordings sound as good as they probably ever could (take that as meaning they are fun to listen to), and the booklet is nicely done. No lyrics are provided, but otherwise everything is just about perfect. And Patton himself is a revelation, perhaps not as dramatic as Robert Johnson at his best but a terrific performer -- and a voice that's going to get stuck in your head forever.Want a nice box set of one of the greatest blues artists ever and don't have $150 for the Revenant set?

They do provide PDFs, but I find books much easier to deal with. You do get the printed documentation when you buy standalone Photoshop CS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where to get the Printed Documentation","review":"Another reviewer raised a good point, that Creative Suite Premium includes scant printed documentation, compared with the printed documentation included if you purchase Photoshop, Illustrator, etc, separately. While it is all there in pdf format, for many of us, there is no substitute for printed user guides. It took a while to find it (have you ever tried to navigate Adobe's massive website?) but I finally discovered that you can purchase all of the printed documentation for the tools includes in Creative Suite Premium package for a nominal fee directly from Adobe. The best way to find that page is to google the string \\"Supplemental User Guides for Adobe Creative Suite\\".

After hearing Perahia play the two abovementioned etudes and the Spanish Rhapsody, I would say that Bolet may have met his match, at least for those particular pieces. Perahia's combination of razor sharp technique as well as lyrical interpretations are mind boggling. I could not imagine a better performance of any of these three pieces.Due to the immense technical difficulties presented in these Liszt pieces, the pianist must have complete mastery of these difficulties in order to bring out the musical aspect. The apparent facility with which Perahia does this prompts the question: did Perahia also make a deal with Mephistophles?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Liszt not sounding technical? the magic touch...","review":"Murray Perahia at his finest, making Liszt sound amazingly colourful and not just a crass display of technical pyrotechnics.

It took almost the first whole hour just to set up the story's predictable comedic end, and felt like a 30-min sit-com padded out into a feature film to accommodate a big-name cast. Maybe it's too subtle for my wife and my tastes -- but we found it disappointing, not that funny, nor touching. Maybe some will find it enjoyable for its love-story theme and recognizable actors/actresses.If you want more enjoyable comedies on similar themes (murderous elder women), try \\"Arsenic and Old Lace\\" (a classic) and John Water's \\"Serial Mom\\" (campy, over-the-top)."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD in wrong aspect ratio you lose picture.

Then a new housekeeper (Maggie Smith) enters their lives and all their problems seem to disappear.I didn't know what to expect from this movie and was puzzled in the beginning but ended up liking it. It's a dark comedy that's exceedingly dry and subtle, more sinister than comedic, and very British in tone. The cast, led by the marvelous Maggie Smith, is superb and they hold your interest even when the story is at times odd and confusing. The location photography is gorgeous.

I just read it again and wasn't disappointed. It takes place across India and gives a strong feel of the harshness of life there for a couple of poor kids trying to make their way. It's warm and exciting, with tremendous heart, but doesn't sugarcoat the dangers and disappointments of life. Read it to your kids (5-10 years old?), or let them read it themselves, (9-12?)."},{"rating":"1","title":"The eye of a storm","review":"No You Love Us spurts from this album. Nicky uses more direct words and you know what he means. Not a masterpiece like GT, and The Holy Bible. Not as good as EMG but it is the Manics and they still mean something. As a Manics fan I prefer their earlier stuff, many new fans like EMG and after, but Im a new fan and like the Richey era. This is nothing like the Punk of GT or the sorrow of The Holy Bible. It is on it's own. Nobody loved You does seem the perfect song on it, singing mostly about Richey, it is a beautiful piece.

I'm sorry these guys are all depressed and all, but give me a break! It's all slow songs that go on and on, some with horns and crappy extra instuments... these guys have gotten way too pompous. Would picking up the pace occasionally tire these guys out? Do they actually stand for an entire concert? The last thing I want to listen to is rock stars sharing their intense anguish over the world's problems. I can't believe these guys are so huge in the UK and Europe.

It\`s a decent listen and a competent rock album, yet it seems somehow dated and formulaic. Almost all the songs follow the same formula, and if it\`s alright in the beginning it soon gets repetitive and tiresome, given that the strong choruses and grand melodies lose their appeal and get a bit boring and unsurprising. This effort lacks edge, it\`s way too shiny, polished and clean, and at parts it really is dull and predictable. There are some good moments to find here, though (\\"The Everlasting\\", \\"If You Tolerate This Then Your Children Will Be Next\\", \\"My Little Empire\\"), but as a whole this effort is just average and unmemmorable.Not a keeper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly Disappointed","review":"I bought this disc on the suggestion from some people whose opinions i previously valued.

I don't know what they used to be or sound like. I only know that when I heard this album, I felt inspired. It struck me as something different from what I had been hearing. There is very little cynicism here and a lot of informed hope. Yes, there are hints of a social conscience, and while many artists write to causes, the Manics are not overt, are not condescending. They just play music. I can say that this album inspired me through many long days of work... in which I put on headphones to block out all the rest of my co-workers. This album has all the elements you look for: great lyrics, meaningful, rich music, very satisfying overall. Height of brilliance in the songs.

This often leads to the headset turning on or off accidentially.

The other seems to charge alright. the ear piece is cheap and feels like it could break off anytime.The sound quality on my end is good but my friends have complained about a slight buzzing sound and ask me to switch to a wired mic.Also it's big and heavy compared to the motorola I own.

Even wind didn't seem to bother the headset much. The voice quality was great on transmission and reception. But the earpiece is incredibly flimsy and can't be replaced. I got a new headset the first time on warranty. The second time it broke I could have gotten a free replacement again but I didn't want the hassle.

It paired right away with no problems and I've had no dropped calls or static at all. The volume is good and no one is aware I'm using a headset, no tunnel voice. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is, the fit is a little uncomfortable for me and it's hard to put on, need both hands. So, I can't quickly put it on when I get a call, I must have it on before I take a call or, just hold it to my ear which defeats the purpose. Other than that, it works for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bluetooth is cool","review":"I really like the Bluetooth. This is my first time using a wireless headset, and it's way cool.

I normally have the phone on my belt so I haven't tried the 30 foot range.The sound quality both incoming and outgoing are great. My hearing is not the best and even with my car window down and the headset on my left ear I can hear very well.Battery life is as claimed.My only complaint is the plastic loop that goes behind the ear is a little thicker than the Motorola. I have gotten used to it but it can be uncomfortable after a couple of hours.Still a great deal considering the Motorola is double the cost.I would purchase this again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good sound Awful to wear","review":"Purchased this based on customer reviews. This item has good sound quality, specially in windy areas. Here comes the BUT....trying to place this device on your ear requires a great deal of effort and then some. It hangs off your ear with no real way to adjust it. I finally got rid of mine and decided to order an SE HBH-610 aslo through Amazon, I will rate that later when it arrives. Logitech seriously needs to invest in testing this item on people before putting it on the market. If you are looking for an easy to wear BT headset, this is not the one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Logitech Headset","review":"Nice, durable, comfortable headset. You can drop it without breaking it, which is important to me. Only problem was the battery, which pretty much gave out on me after several months.

This headset seems to keep some of the interior truck noise to a minimum.Very fast and easy to pair with my Treo 650. Only a 2 second delay in connecting when getting an incoming call. Feels very comfortable on the ear. Only problem is that it resembles a male sexual organ. If you can overcome that, the value is unbeatable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just OK, that's all..","review":"The Logitech freedom headset gives you freedom alright, but no volume. The noise canceling works great, but the sound volume was too faint for me. In addtion, the fit was not right and I would consider my ear to be of normal size.

The sound quaility is terrific. The wind stopper technology really works. I was able to conversations with my windows down without any problems. The battery life if pretty good. I went 2 whole days without recharging. The only negative thing is the size of the headset. After using my Jabra Bluetooth headset for almost 2yrs, I came accustome to something going around the back of my ear instead of right over top of it. The ear cushion is really nice however at times it feels like sound is a bit muffled. Could be do to the fact I am not used to having something over top my ear.In all this headset got 4 out of 5 stars because of the price, usefulness, and aesthetics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well with new AudioVox Smartphone","review":"Fairly easy to set up after reading the directions.

Well, everything we heard was correct. it is very comfortable (thanks to having nothing stuck in your ear canal.) It does take awhile to get used to adjusting it correctly -- especially if you wear glasses. (Take the glasses off to put the headset on, then put the glasses back on!)

Then, without cause, the headset began to malfunction with both devices. First, my powerbook failed to add the device to sound preferences, even though Bluetooth preference listed the devices as paired and connected. Then, unexpectedly, my mobile phone could no longer find the device, even after bluetooth was turned off on the powerbook. As much as I would love to be using my headset, it now sits lifeless...

Logitech's web site doesn't have online user's manual nor information about how to do the most common tasks like dial a number using the phone and then transfer the call to the headset, with my S55, first dial the number and inmediatly briefly touch the so called \\"multifunctional button\\" in the headset: warning!!! don't try to do this while you drive because you will need both hands to do this \\"impossible mission\\" maneuver.Battery life appears to be excelent (by now, I only charged it once, three days ago)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very comfortable","review":"I like the fact that the headset eliminates wind noise, but it's not very comfortable to wear.

Range is approximately 30 ft but interference and crackling starts around 10 ft. Pairing (Nokia 3360) was easy and the unit has excellent battery life. The 'windstopper technology' really does work, no wind noise even when it's blowing about 15 mph. Conversations are actually clearer when driving my truck than when just using the phone.This may sound like an advertisement but I've been amazed that all the claims made are actually true.A few other things.

So the next day I called Amazon and asked for a replacement. One week later I received the second one. Then I tried to charge the battery, same problem occured once: the orange LED went off after about 30 minutes! I unplugged the cable and replugged it again, yet this time the LED was still on after 6 hours. Later I stopped charging and turned it on. It can be used, but my friends said the sound was a little bit noisy. Moreover, the battery drained after it is used for about one hour...

My ear is well within normal range of size and shape, but was bent out of shape by the headset.On the positive, wind noise and lost connections -- common criticisms of other BT headsets -- was not a problem here. If you don't care about medium to long term fit and comfort, or the aesthetics of walking around with such an large unit hanging off your ear, you may be happy with this headset. I wasn't, and am returning it.

You find you ear succumbing to the laws of gravity after you put this phones on, but you will get used to it eventually. The bulk is probably justified by the bigger battery size, which eventually increases your talk time"},{"rating":"2","title":"It works.","review":"This unit seems to work well with my Motorola570 phone (which is bluetooth 1.2).

The noise reduction microphone seems to work as I have had no complaints about voice quality either when out on my boat or when driving.It generally maintains a connection up to about 20 feet from the phone. Call waiting works, as does voice dialing. There are no selective ring tones. It stays paired fairly reliably and catches up after dialing a single digit in the phone's keypad.The only problem with this unit is that if your ears are on the small side it may not fit comfortably (my GF has small ears and will not use my headset). I can wear this unit for hours at a time while driving without discomfort, and it has stayed on my ear while driving my open boat at 40mph.BTW, I am now buying my second unit as my dog did a taste test on my original one yesterday and it did not survive..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great gadget for the $","review":"I recently purchased a Motorola V710 phone.

Otherwise, static. The microphone worked well (actually better than I expected). I was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem. Battery life was good. Abount 2 1/3 to 3 months after I got it, though, I started noticing that it kept failing. After some testing, I determined that the battery no longer goes for more than 8 1/2 minutes of talk time.

It is exciting, beautiful, and moving. The CSO plays marvelously, especially in the brass and strings. My only complaint is that the horns were underrecorded and that the upper winds lack color in their more exposed parts. It's nice to hear a conductor really let the brass shine on the last chord as well. This disc would make a fine addition to any collection or a great introduction to a Mahler work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Possibly the Best Recording of This Symphony","review":"Long have I quested after a Mahler 3 that carried off the power and almost otherworldly grandeur of the first movement, the deceptively simple (but not simplistic) build of the final movement, and the charming and bewitching character of each middle movement.This is that recording.Besides pleasing interpretation and pacing (read: the last movement does not turn into a dirge as it does in so many other versions), the playing of the Cincinnati Symphony is outstanding. Peter Norton's trombone solo in the first movement is doubtlessly the best available recorded version, and the section plays up to his standard throughout.And, lest we forget, there are Telarc's resplendent sonics. I have been a fan of the clean Telarc sound for years, but this is one of their best efforts, bringing off the warmth of Cincinnati's Music Hall quite well.An outstanding effort by all.

In fact, I give the TV show 4/5. However, NBC canceled this TV Show so it is incomplete with no ENDING. The title of this product is misleading because it says the COMPLETE SERIES, but in order to be a complete series it needs to have an ending.

At least with some TV Networks when they cancel a TV show at least they make sure it has an ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy If You Dislike Incomplete Series","review":"The 2 stars may be misleading. They consider this to be the \\"complete series\\". In reality, this is just Season 1. The series was cancelled. The \\"series\\" is incomplete. Therefore, 2 stars. It is one thing if the series was a collection of individual adventures or self-contained stories. But, this is one continuing storyline and such programs DEMAND an ending.As to the story, it is a good premise and holds your interest; at least mine. One of the problems may have been all of the character backstories were handled in flashbacks. So, some may have found it a little confusing. Hence, the low ratings that caused the cancellation.Now, there is scuttlebutt that the series is to be concluded on the SyFy channel as a mini-series. If that remains true, then wait until the actual series IS complete before buying. Otherwise, despite the good storyline, I don't think it is worth the investment."},{"rating":"2","title":"America hates sci-fi.","review":"I have learned to never fully judge a show on it's first season alone. It's hard to do a first season and keep it interesting.

There's so much instant gratification in our society that we want a season to start and end in just a few hours. We're just not willing to wait and watch a plan unfold. The final episode of this show was nothing short of spectacular. I was really looking foward to season 2 but that wont happen now. To many sci-fi \\"fans\\" have turned into critics.

Not so.I took up the book based on the blurbs on the rear cover and I was in need for a page turner. Well it is a page turner. The point of view is that of the narrator, Donna. I must agree with those reviewers who wonder about the narrator. There seems to be a certain streak of madness in her. She does set up scenarios which are bound to fall unto her - it almost as if she wants to be a victim. She as narrator, does provide only her interpretation of events and I think that we as readers, should step back.When Donna becomes \\"a street person\\", it is unclear how she is supporting herself and just how she is able to snap out of her \\"space\\".

Like Philip, this woman's husband distorts everything she says so he can start arguments; he is verbally and mentally cruel and appears to derive evil pleasure in making her feel bad.In keeping true to his character, the husband kidnaps the children shortly after his estranged wife remarries.

If you're thinking about it - stop thinking and BUY IT! Seriously!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT A TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE!!","review":"I got a MyBook Essential Edition as a gift from a friend. It was a DUD. The computer would not recognise it and so I followed all the instructions on the website and in the user manual. As a last resort, I called customer service. They verified that it was a DUD and told me that they could send me a replacement if I give them a credit card number to hold while I return the DUD. Because I only had a debit card, they said that would work just fine BUT they would DEDUCT the cost of the REPLACEMENT drive from my card until the DUD arrived there.An absolute ripoff!! I have spent the whole day crying over this STUPID HARD DRIVE and I will definately NEVER deal with WESTERN DIGITAL again! Their product AND their service STINK!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do no buy this product if you need a backup software to do the job for you","review":"I returned this product immediatly because 2 things:1) there is no backup software came with the drive, which means I have to pay extra$$$ to get one or I have to manually drag and drop2)No tech support, I emailed Western Digital and request for help, no reply at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seems nice at first, but not so good in the end....","review":"I was very excited to get this product when I first bought it. Everything ran very smoothly and I could look through files quickly.After less than a year of owning this product, however, the hard drive crashed and I needed to get all of my files recovered (which we all know is expensive).

I use it to back up both my PC and my wife's laptop. I recently had to reformat the PC and when I turned to the hard drive, it could not be found by XP. Arrrgggghhhh. It easily reformatted itself with the WD software but that does me little good as all of my kid's video's were on the drive as a backup. So I thought I was being clever by having a backup to my PC hard drive only to discover that I needed a backup to my backup.

I had it sitting upright, and it inevitably got bumped and tipped over on its side. That was the end of hundreds of gigs of very important files.I was shocked that it broke so easily! It wasn't like I abused the thing, and it sounds like I'm not the first person to tip this unstable thing over. It did such a great job of completely breaking that even though it turns on, it makes a loud clanking noise and can't be read at all.I'm very sad and will be looking into more reliable options."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great while it lasted.","review":"I had this drive for over a year. I had it just about full of important video files. I had it standing up instead of flat, and when the cat bumped it, it tipped over. That's right, it just tipped over. It didn't fall off the desk or smash on the ground, it just went from standing to sitting. Well, I guess that was enough, because after that, it stopped working. Goodbye files. Overall, I'd say look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"WD External Hard Drive","review":"Got a 250GB HD last month. It works very well with my Windows 98SE machine.

He's a fine, fleet fingered guitarist with a great touch, and hey, any album with some work with ex-Pat Metheny drummer Danny Gottlieb and Lyle Mays is worth looking into in my book. Fans of Pat Metheny, especially his older work, should absolutely check Nando out, although of course Nandos guitar work is much different."},{"rating":"1","title":"Neh.","review":"It was a pretty crappy novelization if you ask me. First of all, it was based on a whole load of episodes but ended up coming at about, what, 200 pages? and the price is pretty steep for a short book. I think the author needs to write out the characters better. It seems like they only read scripts and didn't really know the characters. Watch the show, don't bother buying the books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Album","review":"Man this is a great album. I've seen this band quite a few times. Great band. Much more melodic than their earlier stuff. I love the self titled cd and Animosity. This is by far one of the best albums yet. What I couldn't believe about this band, is that every member sings. And it sounds good. And not in that Nsync kind of way. The harmonies are key. The heavy riffs are still there. But its not overpowered by screaming. The band has evolved quite a bit. Highlights for me...Disgrace,Suffocate,Burned Out, and Broken Down. Also theres three awesome outakes on this album. If you haven't heard them, you need to check them out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome CD","review":"I absolutely love this CD.. I would even venture to say that it is their best yet. Sevendust always seems to find the perfect balance between hard rock and melody. There's everything from \\"Skeleton Song\\" with a slower beat, to \\"Face to Face\\", an awesome all-out aggressive song. I think every song on the album is just awesome. I saw them perform a few weeks ago acoustically, and they played some of these songs.. they sounded great. I've actually seen Sevendust live three times, and I would recommend any big fan to see them in concert as well- they are a great band!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Step backwards from animosity","review":"This album is really good and it has maybe 7 or 8 good songs on it, the bonus DVD is a nice addition. But it is not as good as animosity. The sound on this album is too light. the guitars don't have enough meat in them. listen to \\"redefine\\" from animosity, the chorus. it has a nice sound. the sound here is not like that. there's no low mids. and none of the songs really hit you like T.O.A.B. or Trust or Shine or Black or the songs from Home. For the first time, I find Morgan's drumming annoying, I really want the snare to sound different. On the bright side, clint's backup vocals are good as usual, especially \\"Skeleton Song.\\" And Enemy, Seasons, Broken Down, Burned Out, and Gone are great songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"-1000000000000000000000000 stars!!!!!!!","review":"seven dust stinks like poop! i hate them i hope they break up and that new song enbemy about Dez fomr coal chamber/devildriver i hate that song they suck i donmt see devildriver making a song about u kno who (not saying n e names here) 7ducks are a bunch of lil jr babys"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Breath of Fresh Air!!","review":"Finally, amidst all...that is coming out these days, something is finally worth writing about. Sevendust has always been an extremely consistent band when comes to writing and performing heavy rock songs. There are very, very few Sevendust songs that are just OK. About 99% of the time, their songs are all strong. And Sevendust's Seasons is no exception. From its heavy moments on \\"Disease\\", \\"Enemy\\", and \\"Face to Face\\", to its more melodic moments on \\"Broken Down\\" and \\"Skeleton Song\\", Sevendust takes another giant leap in distancing themselves from other bands in the rock music genre. Excellent vocals, as always, from Lajon and Clint. Excellent riffs, as always, from Clint, John, and Vinnie. Excellent drumming, as always, from Morgan. Go buy the CD, it's worth it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Amazing","review":"This CD is the best yet from Sevendust. They have grown so much from their first CD, it's amazing. They have that same hard unique sound along with some beautifully written melodic songs. The hard to melodic ratio is perfect for this album and it shows why Sevendust will forever be a great rock band. The tracks Broken Down and Skeleton Song are some of the best of all Sevendust songs. It'll be hard to top this album as one of the best rock albums of this year or at least of the last half of the year. Lajon's voice gets better and he amazes me more and more as I listen to this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sevendust Rocks!","review":"Me being a person not really in to bands that are in my native state of Georgia, I must say that Sevendust takes all that away. There sound is so hard and aggression and the messages are something that alot of people can feel. I hope they keep making good albums like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST NU METAL BAND OUT THERE!!!!!!!","review":"this isn't the best by sevendust or the heaviest but it is an awesome cd by and amazing band.if you a new comer to sevendust i would suggest getting home or sevendust first. I also agree with TensionExperiment if you are a true fan of good music or sevendust or hard rock then you'll see that they still kick A** they just changed a few things"},{"rating":"2","title":"Notes from A REAL Sevendust fan","review":"I own all of the Sevendust albums, shirts, DVD's.... I have seen them live more times than I can remember. So its safe to say that my review of \\"Seasons\\" should carry some weight here.First the negative points: This album is a little more mainstream than the others. The band may have made a deliberate move to make a more commercial sound with \\"Seasons\\". All the songs have a slick chorus, that in all honesty, gets repeated a little too much in each song.Now the positives: Sevendust has matured into the best band in the modern rock world. Lajon is the best rock singer on the planet, and the rest of the band is flawless here. I cannot find any songs that I dislike or want to skip. This record will hopefully turn the band into superstars, as it is truley a masterpiece."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wake me when it's over","review":"There is absolutely nothing about this disc that makes me want to listen to it again. This is definitely not up to the standard that Sevendust has set for themselves with their previous efforts."},{"rating":"1","title":"The previous guy is right","review":"Nu metal is pretty much done, and as a former fan I can only wish the members of Sevendust to find something they love doing other than playing music and find it fast. The New American Thrash and metalcore scenes are running the show now, and bands like Sevendust are about as relevant as whatever hair metal bands where leftover after Nirvana came out."},{"rating":"1","title":"(2.5 Stars) Barely Decent","review":"Sevendust have been around for a few years and are one of the hardest working bands in the scene today. Unfortunatly they've never acheived mainstream success and have had to watch much less talented acts such as Staind and others who used to open for them become millionares. So what do they do about it? They make an ultra mainstream record. While on the first or second listen, Seasons is good enough, it gets old extremly fast and lacks the timeless quality other albums had. This is a record entirely comprised of singles. Which means it gets extremely irriatating and cloying after a week or two. Not the worst album ever but dosen't deserve much more than a listen or two every couple of months."},{"rating":"1","title":"ehhhh","review":"These guys have done a lot better. Apparently they all went sober and decided to write an even more mainstream album than before, but everything just feels too polished and mediocre. I have to admit, I used to love nu metal but since then I've matured musically and my tastes aren't really the same. The Deftones Adrenaline is the closest thing to a nu metal album that I'll listen to. Sevendust where great on the s/t and Home, but here they just sound tired and kinda waiting to die. The song Enemy is really dumb too. I wonder if they're either pissed at him for treating Morgan's ugly wife Rayna like crap, or because he's actually in a much more serious and real metal band, Devildriver.Check out Killswitch Engage instead. Lajon wishes he could sing like Howard Jones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crap.","review":"I bought this cd thinking to myself, \\"This will be great!\\", and I heard it all the way through once, and sold it. This is their only bad album, and I was hoping for it to be A LOT better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 1/2 stars...weak","review":"I was only able to find 2 songs on this album that I could enjoy at all. This is their weakest album yet. Theres nothing on here that's too heavy, melodic, or original. It's nothing but dull and recycled guitar riffs and drum beats this time around. Here I thought they were progressing when Animosity overpowered Home but I was just plain wrong. Bad job guys, and I couldn't care less what any hardcore Sevendust fan that's just happy that their band is still making music has to think about my opinion on this. Just face it, soon you'll realize after a few more listens that this album just plain sucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"wow,sseeelll oouutttss","review":"wow,i heard this band back in the late 90's and it was the most amazing thing i had ever heard.now....There debut \\"THE BLACK ALBUM\\"won various awards and was a great rookie album.The sophmore slump was non existent with there second release \\"HOME\\" brought a new and matured version of Sevendust.There third release \\"animosity\\"was by far their worst and most disapointing release to date.Only one good song:praise and that was a repetitive \\"pop\\" song that only could be listened to once then sentenced to somones dusty shelf for the full of its life.This album was hopefully going to be there resurection attempt,falls short on exspectations but better than there attempt on being artsy on animosity."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd give no stars if it were an option!","review":"Sevendust is for kids who wear those silky baggy shirts with flames on them and smell bad. It's music for inbred skanks whose idea of romance is the dirty sanchez. These unoriginal \\"children of the korn\\" have somehow programmed this disc to take away IQ points from your brain as you listen to it. But if you're a tool and have never heard anything NOT played on MTV, it might actually impress your ignorant ass, you hot topic clone."},{"rating":"1","title":"just another mainstream band","review":"if u want to know what this album sounds like just go listen to their first one, or the second one or even the third one. why?? cuz they all sound the freakin same. these guys got about as much musical talent and creativity as britney spears. the music is great but im sick of hearing the same song 40 times. dont waste ur money, or just buy one of their albums and u got all 4!!! pathetic, pathetic, pathetic"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect starting point for anyone who is new to 7dust","review":"This is Sevendust at their most melodic. Some people might fight me on that. But they have kept the screaming to a minimum this time and focused more on Lajon's singing. Butch Walker's production has made for a solid, more focused, radio friendly feel. This is a perfect starting point for anyone who is new to Sevendust."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE best Nu-metal band","review":"Sevendust, Disturbed and maybe Stained are the best bands in the Nu metal genre. Seasons has some really good music on it. the track that really won me over was the first single Enemy, but it does not stop there. This album is good from begining to end. My favorite tracks on this disc are Enemy, Seasons, Broken Down, Separate, Gone, Skeleton Song, the second best ballad of theirs next to Angel's Son. Lajon's voice sounds even more terrific on this release than it did on Animosity and there was definite growth in the lyrics and music on this cd. Even non Nu-metal fans should check this out. I am not a big fan of Nu-metal and yet Sevendust is the only nu-metal band that I have more than one album of. This is how good these guys are. The bonus dvd has a lot of cool stuff on it too. If you want some truly badass soulful nu metal, this is the album to pick up. Strongly recommended"},{"rating":"1","title":"seasons change and so have sevendust...","review":"i have a lot of respect for sevendust and i own all of their cd's too but i can't say that i like where they are going...the songs in this cd each start off raw and hard but then is unfortunately laced with a melodic chorus...it just doesn't fly too well with me...the sevendust that i like are songs like \\"black\\"...i caught their animosity show at the tabernacle in atlanta and they can put on a show but i just dont feel it with this one...yeah i can see how everyone says that they've matured with this album and i guess i just haven't..."},{"rating":"1","title":"WTF?","review":"i am sorry but i am glad they got a new guitarist their new albums NEXT is good but this album sucked it wasn't heavy and didn't sound like sevendustpersonally i was diappointed"},{"rating":"1","title":"YET ANOTHER GREAT METAL BAND GONE SOFT","review":"Ok don't get me wrong i love SEVENDUST and there is nothing wrong with mellow metal BUT!!!!!!!!!!!! I cannot wait until a group will come out and not change their music style. i'm so sick of these bands drawing fans in with one type of music then going soft hmm hmm(creed,staind) just to name a couple others. I guess not all bands can be like OVERKILL who will never change their style for anything. I call it going from great to mediocre but then again the world is ruled by mediocracy uh? But anyway if you are a big SEVENDUST fan pick it up. If your a \\"rock\\" fan pick it up. If your a true to life metal fan (OVERKILL, TESTAMENT, SLAYER, JUDAS PRIEST) stay clear!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sevendust proves they do not follow the pack.","review":"Sevendust has once again come up with a great release in the field of numetal. It even steps outside those boundaries in some of its heavier songs to more traditional metal. I am so glad that they have not followed the lead of others in the genre, and used filler songs or guitar distortion, not to mention excess profanity to get their point across (a.k.a. at least half of the numetal bands out there). Sevendust has turned out a \\"Seasoned\\" release that people like me, who usually listen to Death Metal and Gothic Metal, can enjoy. This CD is one of the best numetal releases of the year. I encourage all metal fans to check it out. I like most of the songs on the album, but \\"Face to Face\\" tells me that they tried a bit too hard to get their point across, and missed. Overall, this is a good CD. Other numetal bands, take note of this release."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sevendust LIVES AGAIN","review":"Once again, the quintet from Atlanta has done it again. Lajon sounds better than ever and quite seemingly a lot more angry. Not that I can blame him with the murder of his brother and all. I can't wait to catch the acoustic tour. I have seen them play twice now and they get better every time. I love the feel of the new album. Animosity had its melodic moments, but this is an album i can just plain get out some built up aggression. Enemy is a great song with meaning to the band, and from open to close just rips. Face to Face, I feel, is the best song on the album. If you have built up aggression, that is the song to get it out with. I can put this album on and just get lost in it. Skeleton song is quite touching, almost to the point of Angel's Son. Lajon and the boys really now how to do it all. In sum, if you like hard rock, good guitar riffs, and good lyrics to boot, buy this album. This is a must own for any hard rock music fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great book","review":"This is the first book on this subject.

The book contains to my knowledge the most clear and complete explanation for a serious practitioner the inner alchemy of yogic transformation. This is not a book for a beginner!

I love the smell of the cleansing oil so much I would be willing to pay the price for this cream. I'm 35 and have started to see the signs of loss of moisture and sagging, but I don't have overly dry skin. It has a really strong, sweet powdery smell that is a bit overwhelming.

So, if you are wanting to use a Seagate because you like that 5 year warranty, here is a caution that it might not fit!CORRECTION: Five (5) stars after all! Sorry, my mistake. Before returning the enclosure, I tried again. This time the cover slid closed just fine, apparently I had not seated the drive in the enclosure properly.

Often, even students who don't like studying grammar enjoy the EIC editing challenges. They are short and the number of errors in a passage is noted in advance, so that students know when to stop or to keep searching. I would recommend this series for either homeschooled or in-school students to complement any other curriculum. It is indeed one of the Critical Thinking Company's best publications."},{"rating":"1","title":"Burned Again!","review":"I thought something was up when the play list on the disk didn't match what I had read in some of the reviews. Previous reviews of this disk mentioned \\"Snow White\\" and \\"Cab Calloway\\". Some referred to pre-censorship material (the crack down happened in 1934). Then I looked at the disk itself. There is a copyright date of 2007, well after some of these reviews were written. Bottom line: the disk contains NONE of the pre-Hayes censorship titles. No Cab, no Louis Armstrong, no Snow White, no Old Man of the Mountain. So if those are the titles you're after, this isn't the disk for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best selection.","review":"I was expecting to get a collection of early Betty Boop cartoons but found this did not have many of these.

I read books on art and artists, own many, collect art, understand the importance of Picasso to art history, but was never and still am not a fan of his work. NONETHELESS, this book was absolutely fascinating, so full of meaningful information, so well written and organized that I could not stop reading. The one strange lack, which I hope will become clear in the next installment, is the failure to help us understand that powerful charisma which made it possible for Picasso to so mistreat people and still draw them to him even before his success or fame. I am now ordering the following volumes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jazz and Poetry Collaberation","review":"This recording cannot be dismissed as a \\"rap\\" record. In fact, it is more in the tradition of jazz and poetry collaberations pioneered by Charles Mingus--his Scenes in the City, the Clown, Freedom, Don't Let It Happen Here, and Weary Blues. The heart of the recording is, however, not the words, but the music of Vijay Iyer, whose composition and playing here can only be described as brilliant. This record is proof that there are still innovators in jazz."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rimage Has Poor After-Sales Service","review":"Rimage has poor after sales service. If you're buying this product be prepared to fend for yourself.Their distributor in Miami, Brooke, would say anything to close the sale but once your money is in their pocket, the distributor would tell you to go to Rimage directly for support and Rimage would give you a runaround.The product worked pretty well at the start but as soon as I needed support - and believe me, you will need support too - they began the run around.As a matter of disclosure, I work for a Trinidad news company ([...]) which in no way competes with Rimage or Brooke.

On the other side of the sword we have a band that has no personality.What could have been done differently?A abnd liek Marty Paich or Billy May could pull off a Ole Blue eyes tribute or even ole Harru Connick Jr, but not the pops,s-o-r-r-y.

I don't learn very well from reading or listening to lecture. I purchased this DVD thinking it would \\"demonstrate\\" the topics it advertised. Unfortunately, most of the DVD is a shot of the author standing behind a work table and talking. I kept waiting to see demonstrations of how things are done, but these were few and very far between. At the end, there were a few demonstrations, but it didn't make up for the rest of the DVD. In the \\"wrap up\\" the author mentioned his next DVD would be a \\"projects\\" DVD, suggesting that this is where the demonstrations will take place. Also, the audio was terrible. The production is more typical of YouTube rather than a professionally produced DVD.For anyone interested in actually seeing fused glass demonstrations, I would spend the $39 on a membership to Bullseye's online education videos.

This is not the same old Hammer and the plot is definitely not up to Spillane's previous works. The plot is shallow, the characters are transparent and he should give up now before he embarrasses himself further. I bought the hardcover (never again) and when finished, gave it away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long in the tooth, short in the action, this Hammer doesn't","review":"I've read and enjoyed Spillane for 35 years but his latest work is a major disappointment. Spillane's Hammer has aged along with Spillane with the result that he is more like Barnaby Jones than the Hammer of old. He talks about his buddies from the \\"War\\" and the way he talks (and acts), you realize it is WWII.The story starts with him gut shot and for the rest of the book, he hobbles around. Where the Mike of old would have performed surgery on himself, reloaded the bullet and shot someone with it, this Hammer keeps going to the doctor and complaining. He gets engaged to Velda, she's more than willing, and he does nothing about it. Enough said? Like Agatha Christie, Alistair MacLean and others, age seems to have sapped Spillane's talents. My advice is to skip this book, find some vintage Spillane and enjoy the ride."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do the math","review":"I grew up on Mike Hammer. I can still hear some of the dialogue, written in the fifties, echoing through the halls of memory. Mike Hammer, his friend Pat Chambers and the drop-dead gorgeous Velda were all products of the second world war era. To have them bridging the gap between the forties and the nineties as if the two time periods were contemporaneous is a jarring experience. No amount of suspension of disbelief will allow for that. It's as if Spillane took the cash advance and phoned in the manuscript. My gut feeling is that he merely dusted off an old plot line from some unpublished work prior work, updated the technology and sent it in as a new story. I nearly choked when Hammer and Velda discussed the possibility of starting a family. Viagra can only do so much."},{"rating":"1","title":"costume","review":"The costume arrived quickly, but it did not look like the picture. It was a different color and very poor quality.

But the main story line is around Dr. Greene-- his new family with Elizabeth, his teen daughter, his relationships at the hospital, and his losing battle with the brain tumor diagnosed in Season 7.The episode in which Greene and his family go to stay in a tranquil house in Hawaii is without a doubt one of the very best in the entire series. I don't think anyone can see it without tears. Greene is the good father and good man we've come to care about, Elizabeth the strong woman we respect, and Greene's daughter gives a fine performance. It's moving, life-affirming, and honors the characters in a way that fans of the show will appreciate.A strong season."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great season!","review":"This is a great season to watch for all those Abby & Carter fans.

I'm reminded of \\"My Girl\\" by the Temptations as one of those combinations of purity. In this album, Paul Robeson captured purity a couple of times. You know the songs. You heard them as a kid. They are part of our culture, part of our humanity, reflective of a difficult time, and they remind us of how far we have come and how far we have yet to go.Robeson's voice is rich, pure, and resonant. The only fear I had (a fear I have with the digitization of any old recording) was the quality of the CD. Have no fear--it's crystal clear.Why not 5 stars? It's a personal preference: I would have liked to have swapped out a few songs for some others.

Meanwhile Mr Bennett of Longbourn has died and the pompous clergyman, Mr Collins must go and sort out his inheritance leaving his wife, Charlotte, about to give birth to twins in the company of her sister Maria Lucas.This entertaining story - subtitled a Jane Austen Entertainment - is an amusing read.

It makes a wonderful canon law primer for non-canonists, since it touches upon all the major areas where a pastoral minister will run into canon law in his day-to-day ministry. It is particularly strong with regards to the administration of the sacraments. For example, it lists the prerequisites for being a godparent, when a dispensation or special permission is needed for a wedding, and what to look for canonically when a non-Catholic desires to convert to the Catholic Faith. The book follows a simple format that is easy to read and easy to find what you're looking for.It also makes a wonderful lecture and course outline for canon lawyers looking to teach a basic canon law course to pastoral ministers within one's diocese.

While the plots often feel dated, there are enough nuggets here that readers can recognize the foundations of the characters. Despite the gap of more than five decades, some of the stories--the introduction of Mon-el and his struggle to break free from the Phantom Zone, the death of one of the three founders of the team--point towards what the team would be. There is an excellent introduction by Mike Gold. Still, the book is not for everyone and there is a cheaper version on the market in the DC Showcase edition though the pictures are not in color. However, fans of the Legion and comics fans in general will enjoy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Legion of Super Heroes","review":"Excellent.

The visuals worked perfectly to create the emotional environment of a cyberpunk drama.The plot kept up the pace, but only barely so. I found it too dark, lacking in depth, higher emotions, and sophistication. It was no match for Gattaca's (my token of sci-fi/cyberpunk perfection).Though it is easy for some to concentrate on the deficiencies of the plot, it provides an adequate backdrop for the visuals. The visuals carry emotional meaning and in some ways compensate for the deficiencies of the plot.

Regardless of his declaration of how much he loved her, he realized at some level that this relationship was not about the kind of love that would ever end in happily ever after, and, managed to self protect against it, even if he wasn't aware he was so doing at the time.

The author Michael Bergin isn't the smartest guy around, but that isn't the real problem. The main problem is that the book doesn't have a point (except maybe to get money). He is a guy that Carolyn Bisset had a few dates with, who she trusted on some points and then kept in the dark when she started going out with John John ... big deal.

If he loved and valued her at all, he wouldn't expose their most intimate moments. What comes around goes around, he'll make a few books from this book, but what will he do then?

The reaction from his family to these photos shows how removed his actions were from the principals he had learned at home. He also slowly began to accept Carolyn's abuse as a part of the relationship. This woman played poor Michael Bergin until the bitter end. She didn't really want him, but she didn't want anyone else to have him. She manipulated him and left him with little self-esteem.

Yes, documentary literature has its place in the literary world, however this one would not be missed if it had not been written.It has been suggested that he is writing a book about a Mass Murder.

It details the life of a mafia hit-man. Each chapter tends to deal with a differnt aspect of the mafia and how they impacted his life. I found it an enjoyable read, and would recommend it to someone with interst in the mafia."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time or money...","review":"This \\"true account\\" of a mafia hitman felt about as hard-boiled as a close-captioned episode of \\"Walker: Texas Ranger\\" or \\"Murder, She Wrote\\".The story doesn't ring true. No names, no locations. And that the author goes to such an extent to explain his interview methodology and the general mystery of his subject just adds to the \\"something don't smell right\\" feeling that I had after finishing it.I was sourly disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like a visit to the Dentist","review":"This has to be one of the most boring books about the mafia in publication. Joey becomes a grind to finish after the first chapter but since I bought it I figured I might as well finish it. There was nothing in the book that held the readers attention, it was monotonous.If I borrowed money from Joey and was late I would pay him just to avoid being bored to death by our pal Joey. Joey was not a member of the mafia he was an associate. I think if I were in the mafia and a street soldier I would ask my capo to take my mafia membership card away rather than work with my pal Joey. This book was not worth the tree that was cut down to have it written. I would judge the book as a minus 10 but you dont go that far."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Cheshire Cat is Smiling","review":"What a hilarious irony. Books like this (and sick movies like Farenheit 9/11) are GOING TO ELECT GEORGE BUSH TO A 2nd TERM. As David Brooks lamented in tne NY Times about Michael Moore, \\"The standards of acceptable liberal opinion have shifted. We're a long way from John Dewey.\\" Mr. Franks book is going to be a giant hit in the university district in Seattle, but this book, and Moore's movies will be powerful tools in the hands of Republicans next November when it comes time to portray Democrats as being looney conspiracy theorists. So thoughtful Democrats should be concerned about over-the-top books like this, and Republicans should be rejoicing. I guess not too many of the Amazon reviewers have the necessary subtlety to discern this irony."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage from an unethical Psychiatrist","review":"The primary principle of psychotherapy is the psychotherapist must keep his/her bias (countertransference)out of the psychotherapy as much as possible. Psychotherapy training involves intense trainingto control countertransference.Obviously, this \\"book\\" is a great example of how countertransference can greatly distort diagnostic accuracy. Therefore, the conclusions of the author are worthless.I guarantee this sick hater is not only ineffective at his profession but would cause additional psychological pain to any unfortunate patient in treatment with \\"Doctor\\" Frank."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Whacko, Leftist, Psycho-babble, Garbage!","review":"Perhaps the ones who really need to be \\"on the couch\\" are the leftists who write and actually believe this baloney. The author has never met President Bush much less conduct any sessions with him. He engages in wild speculation/diagnosis based on unsubstantiated rumor and second/third hand information. Without the common motivation of intense hatred for the President that the author and his fans share, most would give him no credibility whatsoever. The American Medical Association has severely criticized Frank's methods and analysis as being completely bogus. Even his collegues think he's a \\"goober\\".Doesn't really matter. The right man for the job won by a majority of American's votes. That's reality so deal with it! Of course if you can't, you can always schedule an appointment with this author and engage in a mutual whining session."},{"rating":"1","title":"It doesn't take a book","review":"Although the author who clearly has impeccable credientials makes excellent points about the President and the entire Bush dynasty regarding the psychological motivations for all of their behaviors, particularly W's, this could have all been covered in a long article. The author did offer very intersting biographical information to flesh out the story but the end result was still very repetitious."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hatchet job","review":"Bush on the Couch: a first-rate psychoanalytical hatchet job. It took me less than 60 seconds to find a list of Dr. Frank's political campaign contributions and it came as no surprise to me that every donation, going back to 2000, went to Democratic candidates.President Bush dissents from Frank's view of the political world, and therefore science tells us that the president must be clinically insane."},{"rating":"1","title":"Far too Freudian for my taste!","review":"I really did not like this book and got bored before I finished it. He starts with Freudian premises that have already been largely rejected by the psychological community. Then Frank builds all of his subsequent beliefs and conclusions on these premises, so if you think the initial assumptions are false, like I did, then the rest of the book just degenerates into a bunch of theoretical nonsense. I am no Bush fan, and I think he is probably nuts in some interesting ways, but this book did not get at any of them. I have heard that Freud was an undiagnosed and untreated drug addict, so his theories have a lot of denial built into them, and certainly no awareness of the addictive family systems that have been developed in recent decades. THAT would be a revealing Bush study, but this one was just a bunch of complicated but essentially silly German beard pulling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Serious Work","review":"This is not just your usual Bush bash - it is a serious work by a well respected professional. If you find The Toxic Texan's thoughts and actions inexplicable and want to make some sense of it all, read this book. This is probably the best book I have read on why/how this man operates. It explains why Bush cannot speak when talking about subjects requiring understanding or compassion - but he never gets it wrong when he's talkin' tough.I would like to think that enough Americans will read books like this (before it gets dangerous to do so) in order to spot a sociopath before they vote."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning revelations","review":"Anyone who is not blinded by the slick management of the GW Bush image has noticed arresting quirks in George's management of his own words, his own facial expressions, and his total disengagement from constructive dialogue. Dr. Frank puts all this into a coherent picture of a very neurotic personality. These revelations are unique because the media, as a whole, have missed the boat on criticizing Bush, who shuts them up when he can anyway, and the many other negative commentaries on the Bush presidency fail to make the case that our leader has a pathological personality so severe that he is unfit for office.Scan the major premises of the book and then go to see Fahrenheit 9/11 where the glaring truths from the book are given face in candid images of this man in action. Re-elect this man if you want America flushed down the tubes forever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another analysis of Bush by a different psychologist","review":"psychotherapists Briggs and Briggs have written a similar analysis\\"Bush and the Psychology of Incompetent Decisions\\" (which you can find using Google) which says much the same things, although they don't call Bush a sadist."},{"rating":"2","title":"A competent professional analysis, but I preferred THE PRESIDENTS THERAPIST","review":"This is a fine book, with great intelligence on display. I just thought it was repetitive and a little dry--and in the end, that Dr. Frank seemed a little biased. I personally preferred THE PRESIDENT'S THERAPIST (and the secret intervention to treat the alcoholism of George W. Bush) by John Wareham. Sure, unlike BUSH ON THE COUCH, PT is a novel, (a thriller, actually), but W's biohistory is all there and all accurate, and the author takes the reader inside the Oval Office (and then off to the president's Crawford Ranch) to show, with uncanny realism, precisly how an empathetic (and creative) therapist might have truly been able to Geo Bush address his issues. It was a very fast read. I couldn't it put down but when I did, I felt a whole lot wiser--though I have to confess that ending was a stunner that left me shaking. If you have the time and the interest, read both books, of course."},{"rating":"2","title":"A brave assessment","review":"An example of what it can be done and it is in powerful goverments at - a distance analysis, regardind political personality profile and political behaviour assessments. A brave work."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK but Not Worth the Time","review":"I thought I would devour this book, considering the juicy topic, but instead found myself yawning most of the way through it. For all of his psychological training, Frank tells us little that the bright layperson cannot figure out from merely observing Bush in action through his rare press conferences, appalling attempts at public speaking, and reading up on the background and personality of this man we are currently reduced to calling president. I searched long and hard for this book (it was hard to find on the shelves at the time I was looking as it was going through a reprint.), but you can save your time and energy for something more stimulating. I gave up 3/4 of the way through and felt released to look for something really worth the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read","review":"Bush on the Couch is a MUST read for all Americans, including Congressmen and journalists. Dr. Frank gives a compelling and frightening analysis of what makes George W. Bush tick. Run, don't walk, to your library or bookstore to pick up this insightful study of a man who -- you will conclude -- should not be president."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent ... scary !","review":"The President of the United States is psychotic.

We've had lots and lots of books attacking the president in the last few months, and certain publishers seem to be choosing their timing in very deliberate fashion. This one is comically bad. It is one thing to criticize the president's economic or foreign policy programs. It's quite another to claim that he is crazy!! This is really over the top, but in all fairness, if you hate Bush's guts already and just want to feel good about your resentments, then you'll love this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unethical","review":"It is patently unethical and unprofessional to write psychoanalytic reports on someone who is not your patient.

So the professor is a psychoanalyst, but one must remember psychoanalysis went out with high button shoes. It is not real psychotherapy which can be useful, but a high priced con game that does not stand up to scientific scrutiny. A lot of people don't like Bush, me included.

Her tone is gorgeous, her rhythms are spot-on, her diction is crisp, her interpretations are sly, sexy, enticing. As other reviews here have mentioned, Farrell was also a world-class opera singer who brought her enormous artistry to the American popular song. Rudolf Bing, then the general director of the Metropolitan Opera, looked down on her pop singing, but that didn't stop her. She sang well into her sixties (maybe beyond...I'm not sure), with the same style and grace you hear in these recordings. Eileen Farrell died recently, so we won't hear the likes of this voice again.

Still power and revelant. It is like Why Revival Tarries for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"Its very hard for me to understand the bad reviews that this book has gotten. Im not the type of person to write reviews but i feel that this book deserves a good review. Jesus Christ himself was hated so im not suprised that anyone that expresses truth would be hated also. The book and the concept of it is very good. The book is meant to erupt a hunger and yearning for Christ to help you get to another level of having a relationship with Christ. Its about seeking God's face and not His hands. Its about wanting God for who He really is and not for what He can do. Only those who truly hunger for God really appreciates this book. It all has to do with having a made up mind to radically serve God not caring about people ridiculing you but just understanding that God is most important. This book has truly been a blessing and will continue to Bless people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad","review":"My wife grew up in the United Pentecostal Church. This book gives me the reasons why she still has problems when dealing with church and authority within it. Tenney twists the Bible switches translations when it suits him. Mostly KJV and then twists the scripture to match his beliefs. Typical Oneness Heresy. Unfortunately, people buy this stuff and treat like the Gospel itself.Sad really. I am glad I got it at a book sale for 50 cents I still paid too much."},{"rating":"1","title":"just another emotional wish wash....","review":"Before I read the God Chaser, I was expecting to find that the author would suggest the logical ways to meet or draw God closer, but after several description of the historical revival facts, he just repeats some quotes from bible again and again without any meat....so frustrationg. It just tells the author also don't know how to chase God just as most of us. So why he write book and put the grand title as if the book is some kind of the recipe book?Just another money making idea in the waves of many junk book."},{"rating":"2","title":"truly a spiritually awakening book.","review":"i have never felt the presence of god so strongly as what was revealed in this book.it made me realize gods glory is more revealing than i knew."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spiritual thirst","review":"This book deepened my thirst for God's presence. The author gives his own experience with God's presence....and your just can't help but what he experienced. I read it through in 2 days....and loved it. I would recommend it for anyone who wants more in their Christian walk. If you want more of God in your life....then this is a great place to start."},{"rating":"1","title":"A lot of words with no substance","review":"I bought this book based on the title and gerneral comments made by the author. I've been looking for God in a desparate way for the last 3 years. This book was based on the events that occurred at a church in Houson. People falling down, the pulpit breaking apart, crowds pushing their way to the pulpit area, etc. Whether or not all this happened is besides the point of why I am giving it such a low rating. I read about a third of it and it was clear that this author lived by the motto \\"if you can use 100 words to describe something, why use one?\\" Also, I didn't get any practical guidance (perhaps he does his later). He talks a lot about who and what God is, but much of his writing is in the abstract. In chapter 4 (the last one I read) he seems to begin talking about how to ascend to this \\"secret path\\", but for the life of me, I just could not figure out how to apply it to my daily life. How to find God? Not by reading this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chasing God won't be easy, but worthwhile in the end !","review":"Tommy Tenney inspired me with this book to go into a deeper level of intimacy with God. Trying to find God is one thing, but chasing Him with everything that's in you until He sees that you are committed to Him is totally another. Tommy's book is a must for all who is serious with God, and for those who need refreshment in their spiritual lives.May God find you as you chase Him..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heretical Teacher","review":"I purchased the book at a revival, and thought it was good, but after much thought, it kind of makes you wonder about someone who calls the Bible a bunch of \\"dusty old love letters\\"...The fact of the matter is is that Tommey Tenney is a Oneness Pentecostal preacher trying to sell his books in mainstream Christianity. What Oneness Pentecostalism teaches is that the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are 3 manifestations of the same God, not 3 eternal, co-equal, distinct persons as the Trinity REALLY teaches. That's the main heretical teaching in Oneness Pentecostalism. They also teach that baptism should be done in the name of Jesus only, and that baptism IS required for salvation, which I do not adhere to at all, backed by Scripture. If you want to have a deeper Christian life, then GO DEEPER...just not with heretical teachers like Tommey Tenney, T.D. Jakes, and Joyce Meyer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful!","review":"The time I spent reading this book totals up to about 30 minutes. I'm sorry to say its 30 minutes of my life I'll never get back. Tenney spends absolutely no time doing any expository preaching (I doubt he even knows what that is), instead telling story after story of supposed powerful visitations from God for which he provides only subjective proof. How anyone can endure such garbage to the end is beyond me. It just shows you what is popular isn't necessarily spiritually nourishing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Prophetic Word for The Persistent","review":"I'm not even done yet and I can tell you that without reservation this may prove to be the book for all serious believers in the year 2000. This is not a book for the new-born Christian or babes in the spirit. This book assumes that the reader has experienced some downtimes during their walk with Christ that ultimately led to some level of frustration. If you're not ready, willing, or able to admitt you've been frustrated in your walk - than don't read this book. Those that truly want to know Jesus must be willing to pay the price to wrestle with him. This book will help you better understand how to succeeed through the downtimes. It may also question your devotion to God. Only then will God change your name from \\"Jacob\\" to \\"Isreal.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"God Chasers group teaching","review":"This is a terrific book to teach believers how to pursue the Lord and what it takes to reach each level the Lord wants us to attain. We will be under construction, by the Master Builder, all the way to the gate, but the Lord is never stagnant and has created us to fellowship with Him, we can be more than we think...we must believe Him!! Our group is studying this book, one chapter at a time, over a 10 session time frame. I appreciate Tommy Tenney's continual pointing back to the Word, because that's number one in our pursuit of the Lord's face. Our group's theme is to seek, see, and touch the face of God and to not be satisfied with anything less.Thank you for reading this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Pop Christianity book","review":"I had heard a lot about \\"The God Chasers\\" so I picked it up. The first chapter was excellent and I thought I had finally found a good book on experiencing the presence of God, which has been a life-long pursuit. After the initial chapter, the book degrades into a soapbox for Tenney's complaints about the modern church, pats on the back for his spirituality, and paints an Old Testament God that we should seek out of fear (not Godly fear, I'm talking terror here) not out of love. It's not popular to write a negative review on a Christian book but I'm tired of all these pop Christianity books that lack substance. This one is pure motivational drivel and that motivation stems from fear, no less. No thank you."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't like this book","review":"Tenney has some interesting things to say, but unfortunately he says them in the first chapter and on the back cover. After that, he just repeated himself. Also, I felt uncomfortable with his description of the church revival service that he attended. I believe that God does great things, but the author seemed to be bragging somehow. If you want to read this book, stand in the book store and read the back cover - that's all the author had to say."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can you spell H-E-R-E-S-Y?","review":"There's no other adequate way to describe this. If you believe in experience over Holy Scripture, consider the Bible as the \\"dusty, moldy, old truth\\" as Tenney describes it, then jump in!! I'm sure the passage in Matthew 7:22,23 \\" 'Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and in your name drive out demons and perform many miracles?'

Reading this book when I did, put into words a hunger and searching for God that was in my heart, but could not be described. \\"God Chasers\\" increased that hunger for rightousness within me and now I am eagerly awaiting and anticipating a mighty move of God's spirit that I may witness myself. Before I read this book, I thought the manifestations described in this book only happened in biblical days. Now that I know it can and does happen in this 21st century, I am waiting, chasing hard after God and His shikanah glory to be manifest in my life."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Lot of Red Flags Here!!!","review":"Tommy Tenney is passionate about his subject, but there are many red flags. The biggest is his doctrinal background. I would like to see him clearly distance himself from \\"Oneness\\" doctrine. It is difficult to see how he can call himself a \\"third generation\\" preacher of the gospel when the other two generations are firmly in the \\"Oneness\\" movement. This might explain his earlier experience (or lack of experience) with God. If he has finally come out of that movement, perhaps he is on the road to finding God.We are to pursue God and God is ready to be found--I do not feel Tenny will be helpful to those who truly want to find him and I beleive this book should be read with caution. Really analyze what he says and compare it with Scripture. Also, read some of A. W. Tozer's writings (which Tenney recommends.) I believe you will see a marked difference.Many more helpful reviews can be found on the Internet."},{"rating":"2","title":"HUNGRY!!!","review":"You know... i dont know what to say about this book.

A lot more emotional basket cases for us to clean up behind you. Experience with \\"God\\" is not a substitute for truth. When I was young an involved in oriental occultism, we prided ourselves on the spiritual presense we felt. Now that I am not a child, I have learned that God's presense is not about a \\"feel good\\" experience. Jesus was full of the Holy Spirit when he went to the cross. Not a great day for Him.

Worthless to the mature and stable."},{"rating":"2","title":"a life changing read ...","review":"I'm not sure what drew me near to this book. I read it in 3 days and have to say that it has significantly changed my life, more specifically changed the way I perceive my relationship with God, Church and prayer. If you're serious about having a relationship with God then you must read this book. It opened my eyes to a knew vision that now includes Him.

The writing was tiny and, basically, it was a bunch of hyperbole--a bunch of words with no substance behind it.Basically, the author analyzes the player (in simplistic terms) and gives you advice on how not to fall for his game. A prime example of the nonsense in this book:Question: Should I be in a monogamous relationship with the player?Answer: No. Don't be monogamous. There is no legitimate reason to be monogamous with someone else who is not.Well DUH!Instead, this is the only advice you need: KNOWLEDGE is the key to not being played, common sense and intuition gives you that.Anyway, I would not recommend this book because it said nothing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly Blessed Comedy Event","review":"As a devoted Christian and member of several 12 step programs I was reluctant to view the copy of \\"Stealing God\\" that my sponsor sent me last Tuesday. \\"Oh great, another comedy making light of the evangelical movement\\" I thought.

A wider pillow is neeed to cover the back of my chair. Also the elastic band which holds it in place at the back of a chair, is too small. It is stretched to max at the back of my chair.

In my opinion, instead of an elastic strap, a longer cotton strap, with an adjustble buckle in the middle, should be provided. Maybe two straps, connecting at the four corners.

I bought this pillow to go in my office chair in my den. It is quite comfortable & has supported my back as advertised. The real joy I discovered with this pillow was a 9 & 1/2 hour (each way) trip I took while driving. Normally when I spend more than a couple hours driving, my back gets tense & later sore from slouching in my bucket seat. After driving 19ish hours (there & back) I can honestly say my back feels great due to this pillow. My back had no issues at all which is a big thing for me when traveling.

When I use this lumbar pillow, I now leave class with no pain and sometimes even leave feeling better than when I came in.There are some good points in the other reviews -- the strap on the back is very small and so almost useless for big chairs. It seems to stay in place just from the pressure of my back, but I'm using it on textured chairs. Also, the cover slips.

Unless the reader completes the book, he will not discover that The Masters File is a type of apprenticeship novel wherein the main character undergoes a journey of self-realization as to who and what he is. The picture Gavin presents to the reader as well as to himself makes the story more than just a series of prurient homosexual encounters.I would have given the author a five if he had developed this theme a little better towards the conclusion, but, as is, The Masters File is well worth reading as more than just an exercise in gay sexual encounters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bella Luisa Radio Control Boat","review":"Great RC boat for young kids - it was a gift for my son's 10th birthday.

Awareness is an acquired taste. Rinpoche guides the reader towards it from several different angles and with an exquisite understanding of the Western mind and its wiles.

Sounds like an mp3 set to 96 kbps or worse. Maybe he was poor back then and recorded this on a cassette?

However the album is composed of very similar songs... same tempo, same mood, same husky voice and instrumentals.

On a subsequent road trip, I started paying more attention to the Christian radio stations, and discovered K-LOVE. After hearing a couple of songs that I had heard in church, I heard \\"Grace Like Rain\\". Had I not been driving, it would have brought me to my knees. I had never heard such a touching rendition of our old classic, \\"Amazing Grace\\".The title track to this album quickly became, and remains to this day, my favorite song of all time. The rest of the album is wonderful, but cannot overcome Grace's initial impact as a new listener. Todd Agnew shares the credit for bringing me back to Jesus.UPDATE: I subsequently saw Todd Agnew in concert. Sadly, his attitude is that if we don't give to his chosen charity, we are not Christians. When I met him after the concert, as he signed autographs, my wife complimented him and thanked him.

I usually wind up listening to 2 or 3 favorite songs of a CD, but I don't skip through anything when listening to this CD.

My CD was as described by seller. Excellent condition (like new) and came with the inserts. I received prompt delivery (4 or 5 days I think-sorry, I do not remember exact time span. However, I remember being extremely pleased at how quickly I received my order.) I have nothing but compliments for the seller. It was a pleasure doing business with him/her and I would do so again."},{"rating":"2","title":"His best, in my oppinion","review":"The song, Grace Like Rain is SO awesome. I sign to music and this song is my favorite. The way God's grace washes over us is so moving. The other songs on the CD are great too!I just saw Todd in concert and he is so humble, like someone you'd just want to hang out with. He points you to God, not himself. He tells you you are just like him, he just gets recognition for his job and you don't but that we're all the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"I bought this CD for the Thunder Song. I wasn't a fan of his use of Amazing Grace before purchasing the CD, but now I just love it. His music is fresh, worshipful, and enjoyable. Great CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Todd Agnew... Even JESUS plays air guitar to this CD!","review":"This CD ROOOOOOOOOOOCKS!!!!!!!!!!! I saw Todd inc oncert a few weeks ago and I just KNOW Jesus was playing the air guitar!! h ewas AMAZING and the guy who plays violin blew us AWAY!!! TODD! TODD! TODD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Asthma","review":"I started taking Ivy Extract when I read an article in a health magazine that Ivy Leaf helps with chronic bronchitis. I truly believe it works, at least for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"SNOWFLAKES AND FROST NICELY EMBODIED NICELY","review":"Michael Gettel's WINTER is a compilation of previously released tracks, along with new tunes making their first appearance. Gettel is a proficient pianist but his solo tracks are rather bland. It's the ensemble and/or orchestral selections that truly capture the landscapes and whimsies of the season.Songs like FLIGHT, FIRST SNOW, WINTER'S TWILIGHT, SHELTER, WHEN ALL IS QUIET, and MEMORY IN THE SNOW conjure up vivid imagery of the emotions and visages of the wintry environment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Do the Math","review":"I used this CD to learn new concepts in my math classes. It is one of the few products which covers math concepts for 5th -8th grade. The kids loved it. Even though they like to act older, they are still children and they are motivated through music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally...math is fun!","review":"If you're like me and wonder how to convey math to your kids or other young people without them looking at you like you're really, really wierd, here's the answer! A fun but well-crafted and presented album of the most clever songs one could wish for. And the album art -- including a cover by a 5th grader -- will encourage kids to give it a spin. Just terrific!"},{"rating":"2","title":"the best way to start the day","review":"This is a little gem of a book that I read often and have given as a gift at least 1/2 dozen times. It is inspriational and ideal you want to have more on your mind than the minutae of the day!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Keep This Book Handy","review":"This book is a succinct version of a larger one by same authors. Very good and great to pick up anytime."},{"rating":"2","title":"Daily Meditations on Soulful Living","review":"This is a collection of short meditations from 100 different sources. It is pocket sized and each meditation includes a suggested action from the editor. It has introduced me to many new authors and has made my living soulfully more intentional."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Earthy, Peaceful, and Enchanting collection of music","review":"I have found this wonderful collection of music endlessly inspiring, and have listened to it periodically since its release in '91! Generally I find \\"pure\\" New Age music (as I would define this CD) useful only as soothing background music. Never before have I been so immersed in a musical collection that originated from the New Age genre. Additionally, this collection truly does recreate the wonder and amazement often times associated with childhood. While listening, I commonly find myself traveling through green orchards, endless golden meadows, and majestic mountain peaks, spiraling endlessly into the heavens. Highly recommended, even for those generally uninspired by New Age!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Childhood memories that carry into one's adulthood","review":"I bought this cd for my daughter who was 2 year who has a thing for classical and musical tones. Even as of today as a young adult who loves to write and listen to this cd it still inspire her to believe in the impossible as always this music always relaxes her and inspire her in a way that is serene and magical. Thank you for magical 17 years of your beautiful music that sounds like we heard it for the first time every time we play it. Thanks, Mary"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I have long enjoyed Narada collections (especially the many that are themed around the winter/Yule/Christmas season) and had high hopes for this one. I was expecting beautiful instrumental pieces composed for children, to be listened to by children, to bring a sense of wonder to children. Instead, the tracks are just synthetic and not engaging (despite all those intriguing titles). My daughter(5)was disturbed by the use of this cd as background music and wanted it turned off. Perhaps I misunderstood the intended audience, but even as a collection for adult ears, it falls flat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bravo! Magnificent!","review":"This cd is the greatest. I really thought I would never hear those old songs again, sung the way they were intended to be sung. The band is great also. My kids even fell in love with it and bought their own! Now that's a compliment! Thank you Ms. Krall."},{"rating":"2","title":"Track one is worth the price of the cd. Super!!","review":"Krall's sensual interpretation of \\"Let's Face the Music and Dance\\" is the very best rendition of this song I have ever heard. The recording quality of the entire cd is something any audiophile will appreciate. A great selection for anyone who appreciates good music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Diana Krall- cappuccino for the soul","review":"Diana is truly an exceptional jazz persona. I first heard her music while being in a bookstore, and I haven't been able to see jazz in the same light. Her sultry voice and meaningful lyrics make it a great compliment for a cool day and a hot cup of cappuccino. Her rendition of I've Got You Under My Skin is great. Definitely check out her music!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bravo Ms.Krall !!!","review":"I'm crazy about Sinatra for the way he put his soul in everything he sang, you'll just end up 100% sure he meant every single word in his song. I had been searching for female equivalent of his magic. And I think I've found it in Diana Krall. Just listen to the emotion she devoted to \\"When I Look in Your Eyes\\". Or for straight comparison with The Chairman listen to \\"I've Got You Under My Skin\\". We're probably witnessing a truly great star in making here, folks !Go buy this CD ! Put it in your player after a long day in the office, dim the light, relax and enjoy the Krall treatment."},{"rating":"2","title":"From an \\"Oldie\\"","review":"I'm in my 80's and to hear the standards from a modern artiste amidst the welter of pop rubbish is nothing short of miraculous particularly her mode of vocalizing and her own piano accompanyment - simply wonderful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Diana's best to date","review":"I began listening to Diana Krall in earnest about a year ago. I bought up the meager supply of her recordings and fell in love with that sultry voice. I yearned for more. And then I got to watch her perform in Oakland at Yoshi's legendary jazz club last New Year's. It was at this time that I got to hear several cuts from When I Look Into Your Eyes. This new music is a natural progression for a singer/pianist like this young woman. In this album she makes full use of her vocal talent, she teases us with her take on Popscile Toes and she thrills us with I've Got You Under My Skin. I am simply left wanting more. Diana, I've got you under my skin."},{"rating":"2","title":"more delights from our Goddess of Jazz","review":"Previous generations had their jazz idols, divas and stars...witness Diana Krall and behold a shining star in the Jazz-heavens...and she belongs solidly to us, luckily, here at the turn of the century.This album just continues the stream of delights to pour forth over the piano keys and through the voice of this talented artist. What you'll really find amazing is the way she just wraps herself around the lyrics, making each song special and hers. Russell Malone on guitar and John Clayton on bass epitomize the meaning of the word \\"ensemble\\". The added bonus here are the sultry and subdued orchestral accompaniaments arranged and conducted by Johnny Mandel...NOT schmaltzy nor overblown as these types of orchestrations can end up sounding, instead of fighting Krall and her Trio, they do what they are supposed to do...lift her up on a pedestal of lush sound. What a sweet treat for the summer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cut the strings!","review":"I love Diana Krall (her \\"Stepping Out\\" album is my favorite), but I prefer the trio to the orchestra and strings that pop up much too often on this album. There's some great stuff here, especially her takes on \\"I've Got You Under My Skin\\" and--a personal favorite--\\"Pick Yourself Up.\\" I don't know if the strings and orchestra are an attempt by her label to \\"popify\\" DK or what. As far as I'm concerned, the sound with the trio was/is perfect and there was no need to tinker with anything. In any case, strings or no strings, horns or no horns, it's still a pleasure to hear Ms. Krall's sultry vocal on \\"Do It Again\\": \\"Mama may scold me/'cause she told me/it was naughty, but then/please, do it again.\\" Ooh-la-la. Maybe this disc will grow on me, but for now I prefer the overall sound of the first four albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank God music like this is still being recorded.","review":"Been listening to Jazz for over 45 years and being floored by a performer is now a rare occurrence. Krall's \\"Under My Skin\\" rivals Sinatra's. If you buy one album this year, make it this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Choppy singing, tentative vocalist","review":"This CD is nothing to bother about, she's clearly overrated in talents and looks. Her balads are merely OK but the moderate tempo songs she always sings choppy and never connects her phrases. It's too staccato and short sounding. Not easy to listen to at all. Don't recommend!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the fuss about?","review":"I try to like Ms. Krall, but for the life of me I just can't see what all the fuss is about. To me she just seems rather boring. She's the kind of vocalist you'd find singing in the cocktail lounge of big hotel. When she finished a number, people would clap politely and go back to their conversations. If you're a \\"smooth jazz\\" fan, aka Easy Listening, you'll love Ms. Krall."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fan long before she won Grammies","review":"A wonderful singer and even better pianist, Krall enthralls! She breathes contemporary life into a genre overlooked by the younger generations today. I heard one of her earlier CD's, \\"All For You...Nat King Cole Trio..\\" in a record store in Paris in '96, and I was hooked for good. If it is time for you to rediscover jazz, this is the CD (and artist) to start with."},{"rating":"2","title":"take back my words","review":"As another fan of Diana Krall, I came upon her thru this album. I had mixed feelings about her in the beginning and wrote about it previously. Well, since then the lady has not been removed from my CD and I slowly started buying each one of her CDS - and all in revert order, till I got till her first one! It is very interesting to hear them, since the lady CAN jazz it up, in her own style. Her choice of material is extremely good, making old material sound as if we hear it the first time. Also she may be one of the only musicians that you can hear over and over again and not get tired of. It's relaxing, it's smart and done very well - in its own genre. Would love to have a crystal ball to see what she will do in the future. Let her just sing and play that great piano with her accompanists - who can ask for anything more?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Diana Krall Rules","review":"Amazing sound quality, very inspired music, I heard the samples of the songs and i wasn't sure to buy it, then Diana Krall had a concert in my city, i went to see her and she left my jaw dropped, so I bought this and all of her dvd-audio's, totally worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is growing on me","review":"This CD did not overwhelm me from the start. And I still prefer Linda Eder on when I look in your eyes and Susannah McKorkle on Let's face the Music. But it is getting better the more I listen. Not being a fan of the genre of jazz of how fast can I string notes together before I find 2 that go together, This is the type of jazz I find appealing. Good CD for a quiet evening."},{"rating":"2","title":"More, please","review":"What a talent. I'm holding back the fifth star because I think her accompanists could be better, particularly guitar."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easily one of my top 5 favorite CD's!!!","review":"Diana Krall has revitalized the art of romantic music. This is her best CD to date and if you love the music of Love you will not be disappointed by this one. I especially enjoyed the title track, the Michael Franks song \\"Popsicle Toes,\\" and the bonus track (not listed on CD) \\"Why Should I Care\\" which was written by Clint Eastwood for the movie \\"True Crime.\\"Buy it and listen to it with your lover! :o)"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the most soothing CD I've ever heard!","review":"Unlike several of the other reviewers I read, I had never heard of Diana Krall. I was flipping stations this past Sunday and happened to stop on a syndicated jazz show. They played the song, \\"Let's Face the Music and Dance,\\" and I fell in love. Later that same day I bought the CD, and I have played it daily. It is so soothing and relaxing that I feel as if I'm floating while listening to her music. I will now shop for earlier releases."},{"rating":"2","title":"Introduction to Jazz Through Pop","review":"Diana Krall does it again. By recording old pop standards with a jazz undertow, Diana is re-introducing jazz to the mainstream public. I always look forward to the bridge were Diana's excellent piano playing with the accompliment of other musicians makes the songs something more than just someone signing an old pop standard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"I purchased this album while just browsing through the jazz section. I am not (correction) was not a really big jazz buyer but I am trying to get more into it. I listened to a sample of her album and I was hooked from the start. Diana out does herself with this album. Every song is a winner! I went out and bought two of her earlier CD's immediately and I plan to finish out my collection soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enthralled and Mesmerized","review":"We received the CD for a present and were unfamiliar with Diana. When we first listened, we were swept away by her charm, grace and muscial styles. This is a perfect complement to any female songstress collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best","review":"This is the best record. My favorite songs is I've got you under my skin. The first time i heard it I cried because i had never heard anyone sing a song with that kind of feeling before. After that i was hooked wich is not easy since I mostly listen to rap. I now listen to the CD at least twice a day and every night at bed time."},{"rating":"2","title":"She's a true gem to listen to","review":"...and if you haven't seen her live, you really owe yourself an evening with her. Her music is simply magic and this cd only extends on the joy this woman can bring you. From the great 'Devil May Care' to the funny 'Popsicle Toes', light some candles, dim the lights, and put in this cd...trust me, you'll have a fun evening."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely overrated!","review":"I would only recommend this cd to those who like German cabaret-style jazz. Despite the arrangements, Diana Krall is closer to Ute Lemper than to Nat King Cole. She knows a thing or two about subtlety but unfortunately there is almost no real emotion in her vocals. The lack of feeling and variety made this cd very difficult to enjoy. Krall has good intentions but for the most part she is all style and little substance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Puh-leaze","review":"Enough already. This has got to be the most overrated album by the most overrated artist in history. Yes, the music is pleasant, but Ms. Krall cannot hold a candle to several present day female vocalists -- Madeline Eastman, Abbey Lincoln, and Carol Sloane come immediately to mind -- let alone greats of the past like Ella, Sarah, Billie, Sheila Jordan, and Chris Connor. And her piano playing? It is competent, at best. Check out Jessica Williams, Renee Rosnes, or Eliane Elias for some real contemporary female talent. I think it is wonderful that so many people have discovered jazz through Ms. Krall's work. But if you are one of them, please take the next step and listen to some of the artists listed above."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the Captian???","review":"Diana Krall's voice sounds like Tennille of the '70's duo, THE CAPTIAN AND TENNILLE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yes, let's face the music","review":"I really wanted to like this CD--it got such great reviews. But maybe you have to REALLY love jazz music to enjoy it. Diana's voice is not extraordinary, but it is interesing. Natalie Cole's Unforgettable is a much better investment."},{"rating":"2","title":"When I look In Your Eyes, Diana Krall","review":"Very few musicians have the combination of talent and emotion that Diana Krall embodies. Her ability at the piano is astounding and her phrasing is impeccible. She can make you cry one minute and make you dance the next. Her choice of covered standards is thoughtful of the past, yet she brings her own style to each of them. I am glad she arrived on a scene devoid of young, talented musicians devoted to the best of jazz standards. I have every one of her CD's and am very grateful she chose the genre she chose. Bravo, Diana!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great ! (and more superlatives)","review":"Impressive musical flavors. My first jazz CD. I think I like it ! Several cuts could become my favorite song. I fell in love with that voice in \\"I've got you under my skin\\" I can't believe I would like such a slow song."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Diana","review":"Very nice recording in both stereo and multi-channel SACD. Make sure your 5.1 setup is calibrated to your SACD player, as the surround channels are strong."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite Jazz album of all time","review":"I'm a fan of Jazz and Diana Krall and have just about all of her albums. But this one is definetely my favorite one, followed by the Look of Love. I like almost all the songs here -- good variety from fast tempos like Devil may care and East of the Sun, West of the Moon to slow Bossa tempos like I got you under my skin to bouncy ballad like Let's fall in Love. A big thumbs up from me."},{"rating":"2","title":"relaxing music","review":"This is a great background music CD when you have guests, want nice music on, but not enough to interfere with conversation. Or you can turn it up and dance with your partner to something jazzy."},{"rating":"2","title":"The one to get ...","review":"This was a great buy. Diana has that sultry (and although I hate to use the term) - sexy way of singing that would please most people. The record delivers on all counts - singer and music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Supper club jazz at its best","review":"This is supper club jazz at its best. Songs are carefully selected standards, unconfronting and familiar, arrangements are slick and professional but unadvanterous. An unashamedly commercial product aimed at both lovers of mainstream jazz and adult contemporary pop. What makes this otherwise unremarkable attempt remarkable is the talent of Diana Krall. Her husky vocals, clear piano delivery, and effortless phrasing are delights to savour. She shows no sign of being overwhelmed by the ghosts of the jazz greats who had covered these standards many times before. Her style is both uniquely individual and unthreateningly familiar. There is an effortless sexuality in this young woman's voice that recalls Holly Cole, although Diana is a better performer. Her debt to Nat King Cole is implicitly acknowledged. Every blatantly commercial effort should be that good."},{"rating":"1","title":"It must be me!","review":"Please people, this beautiful young lady has a five note range, cannot sing more than three words without taking a breath, and from time to time sings off key. I can only assume that if you are still buying Ms. Krall's CD's that you already own all of Ella's recordings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninspiring and utterly disappointing","review":"Wow, am I disappointed after finally buying this CD. Other Amazon reviews and Grammy award nominations made me put my gut instinct aside and take the plunge. Not only is there virtually no passion in her voice, the clarity, inspiration and energy that so characterizes her personality on the Live In Paris CD, for example. is utterly lacking in this studio composition.The arrangements are pleasant, for sure. Let's Face the Music and Dance and the title song try to create an atmosphere, that's why 2 stars instead of 1. I am contrasting Diana's work simply against her other CDs, not against other performers.The lyrics are a joke, repetitive, simple, uninspiring. The voice is smooth, yet lacks any passion or interest even. Skip this one, unless you just have to have every Diana Krall CD in your collection. Commercial interests won over artistic expression in this one, and it shows."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tired of Looking into your eyes","review":"After listening to this CD more than a dozen times I came to realize that Irene Kral was a much more versatile vocalist. This album from Diana is alright but it gets boring after awhile."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't understand","review":"I have to admit some Diana Krall cd's work nicely as easy listening, but this one just goes beyond the point of \\"easy\\" and into the realm of boring. This cd is bleak, and monotonous with predictable arrangements, Not to mention the instrumentation sounds pretty washed out. Also, it really puzzles me how many people find Diana Krall so amazing, and even dare compare her to greats of the past. These songs are simple, maybe that's why they're called standards, I don't know, and they're simple because it's the performer who is meant to breathe life and joy and pain into the songs. Diana Krall is just the opposite of that.Her voice is lifeless, her phrasing, liltless and uninspired .I love jazz, and I guess the reason Diana Krall is so successful is because, she is \\"jazz' for people who love anything but."},{"rating":"1","title":"Luke Warm","review":"With Diana Krall there is always much better and much worse. She is the quintessential middle of the road chick. She is difficult to hate, but difficult to like. Her voice likens itself to the warm, smoky tones of the wonderful Carmen McRae (even more so on this release), and her piano playing is definitely sub par to her musical associate Russell Malone. But you know what, buy Diana's new one because she is good for jazz. Why? Because when you add her latest outing to your Amazon shopping cart also pick-up a Nat King Cole trio album, a Brad Mehldau and some Miles Davis or whatever. Take the time explore other jazz artists. And if you do, then Ms. Krall has done more then just sing for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"When I look in you eyes Diana Krall","review":"Look at my previous review on Diana Krall. Everything is the same and believe me if she has a bomb CD I will be just as honest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't believe the hype.","review":"Diana Krall isn't doing anything Shirley Horn doesn't do better..considerably better. Johnny Mandel's string arrangements sounded lush behind Horn, not treacly and pallid , as they do on this wannabe CD. Why not buy Shirley's string album, paste a picture of Sharon Stone on the cover and have the best of both worlds?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lighthearted soul music!","review":"I've been wild about Diana's music ever since I heard \\"Body and Soul\\" (from her first release) on the radio...had to pull my car off the road to soak it up.This CD doesn't grab me like \\"All for You\\", but I find the songs to be joyful and the lyrics uplifting. I could listen to Diana nonstop, all day long. I've seen her live three times and am astonished at her subtlety, brilliance, and clarity. Her presentation appears to be effortless and pure joy washes over the audience. What more can someone give to the world?"},{"rating":"2","title":"My first Diana","review":"I heard this CD in local HMV and got blown away by her performance in \\"Let's face the music and dance\\". \\"Devil may care\\" has all the emotion and attitude. I also like her style in \\"Let's fall in love\\". These are the songs I like most.This is my first Krall and Jazz album. I liked this one a lot until I get her earlier work \\"All for You\\" which, in my opinion, is her best album to date. This should be given 4.5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"sorry......","review":"ok. love scenes was a fantastic album. diana krall really showed her colours and her talent. i feel that with the latest release she falls short. she should have just stuck to the piano and her voice. with me, that wins. the whole orchestral bit in the background is stuffy and useless. it sounds like muzak and not much more. the two stars are for the superiority of her voice alone. finally, the song popsicle toes makes me physically ill. sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Diana Krall is Superb - \\"wild honey with a spoon of scotch\\"","review":"I would recommend all of Diana Krall's CDs to anyone who loves jazz or is interested in jazz. She is a tremendous talent, a wonderful pianist, and has a voice that one reviewer described as \\"wild honey with a spoon of scotch.\\" I could not have described her great voice better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Diana hides her light under a bushel","review":"I saw Diana Krall and her trio at Blue Alley last summer. It was a GREAT performance. She sang \\"East of the Sun\\" and then she and the trio played , jammed for a half hour. Other songs ran 20 minutes to 30 and she would only sing at the begining of the songs. It was mesmerizing. On this CD, she sings the chourus of \\"East of the Sun\\" and all but leaves out the piano, guitar and bass solos. The same song lasts 4 minutes; so disappointing when she can do so much better!This CD seems interesting in places but overall listless and burned out in comparison with her earlier CD's. The schlocky orchestra 1001-strings background doesn't help.She is primarily a jazz pianist, and she is being marketed as a singer. I believe the record company forces her to do this.Come on Diana, release a record of a REAL LIVE PERFORMANCE! Show the people what you can do!"},{"rating":"2","title":"She'll be right mate.","review":"Ok, so it's not Ella, Shirley or even Billie, but what we have here is some great listening. Diana Krall is a modern day diva, and we should be happy to have her on board. Her killer vocals may be slightly drowned by strings on this album but she rises to the occasion. Better than 99 percent of the crap around at the moment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album...if you're in the mood.","review":"Great CD, but you have to be in the mood to listen to mellow music to thoroughly enjoy it. Worth the investment though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jazz DIVA?","review":"...please...I really hesitate to even use that word in the same sentence as Diana Krall. She's probably the most overrated jazz vocalist there is out there. Yes, she can play the piano, but we hardly hear it on this CD at all! Singing is rugged and lazy sounding, nonchalant, and the piano playing is so sparse...what's the point of even having it on this CD? It really appears as if she's wanting her \\"looks\\" to make up for her short-comings as an \\"artist\\". That's what it looks like. Probably just a marketer trying to make a buck. I personally think it's cheesy all the way round. These songs she does on \\"when I look...\\", she has this habit of trying to be reinventive by singing all the balads in a moderate tempo and all the moderate tempo songs as ballads to make it sound refreshing or something. Her style is nothing short of predictable and trite. Disappointing and a waste of my time. Sorry, I'm not impressed with her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Shania Twain crossover in the making","review":"I think that the focus of Diana's music has shifted to her evening wear and latest hair styles. Not to mention those fabulous dresses of hers from Donna Karan as sited on her CD. She kind of contradicts herself on countless interviews where she stresses \\"It all a-boat the music\\" in her muffled Canadian speaking voice. After striking a pose with Vanity Fair, I see yet another Shania Twain crossover star in the making. I could bet money that her next CD will have much \\"pop\\" appeal. Maybe even a video to show off her new makeover. She don't impress me much."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"KRALL\\" under a rock!","review":"Whoever gave this woman a recording contract should be shot! Not only is this CD filled with tuneless songs with pointless lyrics, but they are all sung (to use that word loosely) by a singer (used loosely again) who sounds like Kim Carnes, Stevie Nicks and Laura Branigan rolled together on a very bad day after a 24-hour cigarette binge! I'd rather listen to chalk hitting the chalk board than to endure another minute of the nauseating Miss Krall!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tired and lazy vocalist!!","review":"This vocalist sounds like she just rolled out of bed and started singing. She takes her raspyness a little too far. It's nice every NOW and THEN but every since song and phrase is just a bit too much. I don't hear her singing \\"smoothly\\" like others say. She sounds hoarse a lot. Why does she always sing about body parts?? \\"popsocle toes\\" and \\"do it again\\" are just a little too risque for me. I won't play them at our radio station. Whole thing is average. I'm disappointed thoroughly. She's more of a pianist than a singer-she should play NOT sing!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you kidding?","review":"After reading all these glorious reviews, I'm still stumped by the responses. The only thing I liked about this was the music. Her voice is awful, and she sings off key. She is a mediocre singer at best, with skills but no real talent, and probably would have stayed playing small town piano bars had it not been for her model good looks...."},{"rating":"1","title":"She can't sing","review":"Diana Krall has no chops! I know this is harsh, but come on. In the old days they used to record these songs using people who could sing. Diana Krall doesn't sustain a line and has no dynamic range. In fact, she sounds like she's struggling somtimes -- it's painful to listen to. Obviously talent is a disadvantage when it comes to Grammy contests, record sales, etc. I guess people don't want to listen to those who really have a gift for singing. Perhaps it makes people feel bad if they have less talent than a performer, so instead they choose to listen to ordinary-at-best perfomers like Diana Krall."},{"rating":"1","title":"nothing special","review":"she is a alright Piano Player but NINA SIMONE won't lose sleep though.she is a Celine Dion in training.i feel cross-over more than solid goods.her voice is a hurting thing on the ears.and the whole strings and what not don't work.shes no Cassandra WIlson.overall she is a dime a dozen.i've heard this style done time in&time again.nothing special."},{"rating":"1","title":"Underwhelmed","review":"Though I don't normally care for most jazz music, I thought I would try this one because it was highly recommended in a favorite classical Christian education (!) catalog. I'll have to say that I was underwhelmed. I agree with a previous reviewer who said Ms. Krall sounds like a typical lounge singer in one of those big hotels, where the attendees converse, politely clap at the end of a song, and then converse again. I'm sorry, I really tried to like it. Is she popular because she's kind of pretty?"},{"rating":"1","title":"No Applause","review":"I listen to many different types of music, from African to hiphop, but jazz is my favorite, and the one I play most. I like many different types of jazz also, from Nat Cole to Steve Coleman, and under an Al Jarreau CD this one was recommended. I listened to the samples, and my very first impressions were: BORING. I would not recommend it AT ALL."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste","review":"Unimpressive. The arrangements, recording and backup are great, Diana is terrible. She has absolutely no vocal refrain. Her ability to create passion is nonexistant. I can't believe anyone would give this 5 stars, her singing is F L A T ! She was not able to hit one big note. Definately skip this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"My first krall cd and i'm hooked!!!!","review":"I am a young man of 21 that is just getting into jazz, and I am 100 percent into Diana. The only reason that I didn't give it 5 stars is because I believe only Louie deserves the big 5."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Romantic Album I Own","review":"I've read reviews by some Jazz purist regarding this album. They have a point. But I hope that they would agree with me that for an album of Romance, this is the ticket. Very well done it puts me into a dream state where my lover and I can \\"Face the Music and Dance\\".I wrote this when I was in love with a beautiful woman named Ronnie . Now I have little use for this album. It's for lovers not for hermites like my self."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than most . . .","review":"Not her best, but much better than most others. I was slightly disappointed that Krall chose to go away from her piano talents more on this cd. Still, her voice is quite beautiful to listen too. Maybe those who have been so negative with this new release are comparing it too much to her previous works, or to the greats like Ella and Shirley. I've seen/read plenty of interviews with Diana Krall, and those few listeners are the only ones comparing her to the greats. For those who knocked \\"Let's Face the Music and Dance\\" for being \\"lackluster,\\" look at the type of music it is . . . Bossa Nova? Since when was Bossa Nova brash and booming? The music type is smooth and unassuming, which Krall hits perfectly. Looks have nothing to do with talent such as hers, she could look like the elephant woman and still have a huge following with her kind of talent. I think this is an album that will prove its tremendous worth if given a fair listening."},{"rating":"2","title":"she's the best jazz vocalist/pianist alive today","review":"I've been a jazz pianist for 44 years now -- done a lot of playing and heard a lot of singers. Diana Krall is at the top of my list -- she is the perfect jazz musician. This CD doesn't display her brilliant piano work, but her vocals are perfect -- no one can sing jazz better than she can. The strings really do enhance the overall performance, and they're not overdone. Get this one -- you'll love it, especially \\"I Can't Give You Anything But Love\\" -- brilliant.John Bresnik"},{"rating":"1","title":"A revised rating","review":"I originally left a 4-star review for this album here at Amazon.com. I'm a huge fan of DK, and after the first couple of listens I must've been blinded by her good looks and her past performances. But now I've listened to this CD several more times and have to 'fess up: I don't like it much. I hate the strings. I much prefer the trio arrangement of her previous albums. If you want to buy a *great* Diana Krall CD, choose \\"All for You\\" or \\"Stepping Out.\\" This one just doesn't cut it. I'd give it 2.5 stars, but that isn't an option. And 3 stars is too high. Thus the 2-star rating. Sorry, Diana...I have to be honest. Lose the strings next time. Don't try to be something you're not (i.e., a pop star)!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Smoke without Fire","review":"Diana Krall wants desperately to be Julie London and she almost makes it. She is a better singer and her sense of phrase is on the money, but she lacks electricity. Now if there's work to be done and you ned a little musical narcotic to smooth out the edges then this will do the job. You can visit with friends, cook, build computers and almost anything else while Ms Krall throbs in the background. It won't break your concentration or mood. Only on Popsicle Toes does Ms Krall thaw. This playful tune is the highlight of the disc. In it Ms Krall offers both delight and the hint of potential. What a pity that this CD didn't find a way to let Ms Krall swing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful book with a soul and heart shown through pictures","review":"Beautiful book full of poignant and wonderful photographs of Nicaragua.

In short, this is a mistake, and only buying it could superscede such a horrible decision. This album is NOT close to what the band sounds like, and at points it sounds as if the musicians have never even listened to Dave and the guys.Here's the point: if you like dMb, even the smallest bit, do not support these piece-o-junk compilated dedications. They amount to little more than no talent bums riding off of Dave's success. And might I add, they couldn't be doing a worse job if they tried.P.S. And don't just take my word for it.

Lord of the Rings, by itself, is a great story and the fact that Ellwood and his wife were great admirers of Tolkien adds interest to this book. Their own love for the creator of the masterpiece brought him into their lives in a roundabout way, so one gets the feeling that this is almost Ellwood's way of saying thank you. In turn, we are gifted with a book that helps us not only understand the intimacies of the story but also how to apply the journey of Frodo to our own lives."},{"rating":"1","title":"bits of middle earth mashed into a theosophy catechism","review":"A true disappointment. What I had hoped would be a many faceted and critical look at the mythic elements in Tolkien turned out to be a fairly narrow sectarian presentation. Middle Earth is used here as a thoroughgoing allegory for Theosophy, very surprising indeed, given Tolkien's antipathy to allegorical interpretations. The writing style is grating, too, with the reader constantly addressed in the second person. Readers interested in the Lord of the Rings would better look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"A theosophical guide to Tolkien","review":"Ellwood analyzes the general spiritual character of Tolkien's plot and characters, and uses them as starting points for meditation exercises.

No wonder there are so many used books available for sale. The author writes in such a wordy prose with religious and preachy undertones that I couldn't even get interested in the book. The topic and title suggested something interesting with relevant ties between the movie/book and human psychology. Instead, I found it to be tedious and boring. The author rambles on with too much new-age babble and never says much of anything. Save your money and pick one of several other similar books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"I went into this movie trying to have an open mind, considering i had heard, at best, mixed things about it. But within the first 15 minutes, i knew it was a mistake to even give it a shot. It looks like a straight to video clunker, and that's basically what it is. the plot is simple. A man driving down a lonely highway at night. There's a love triangle gone awry and much speculation regarding what's in the trunk, and why it's there. But, frankly i didn't care about any of it. The acting is horrible, and the writing is laughable. So, trust me...don't even bother with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie Review \\"Haunted Highway\\"","review":"I am 61 years old and have seen a lot of horrible movies.

Out of my problems with the movie, I have two major ones. First is the dumb cop.

Yep. What can you expect for 5 bucks? The movie was cheesy and it's not about ghosts, so the cover is very misleading, as others have reviewed. It's about the dude going crazy because he killed his wife. If I remember correctly. The acting was terrible. Cheesy. Not scary at all. But for 5 dollars, who cares?

If you are reading these reviews and are interested based on the actually pretty decent design on the dvd cover, well get it just for the artwork then, and listen to all these reviewers. I would gamble with a 6 in 10 chance my McDonalds Fries will be cold and soggy, rather than buy this dvd and hope you would find it scary, decent or full of cinematic wonderment. It is utterly repulsive; the script, the reactions on screen, pure 'B' movie talent (for lack of a better word), and even the Japanese should be ashamed of themselves, but then again (for the most part) most of their horror films reak of amaetur fodder anyway, so listen save your well earned dollar.

This becomes almost absurd when one finds that on the other side, there are 3(!) complete annotated games with the ridiculous 8.Rb1??! against the Tartakower. And, again contrary to the editorial claim of objectivity, a bias for Black is perceptible, not so much in the evaluation of positions as in the choice of games.

This book makes you feel bad for using formula and giving bottles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some good advice, if you can ignore the militant tone","review":"I was searching for a breastfeeding book that would offer lots of practical advice. Jackman's book does provide advice but its couched in plenty of ideology and a militant tone that isn't super helpful. He presents info in a way that is sure to make some mom's feel guilty if they supplement with formula, use a pacifier, or pump regularly. Because I intended to go to back to work 6 weeks post-partum and would very likely do one of the above, I was offended by his tone at times. The other thing I didn't like about this book is the author will frequently say things like \\"I think its better...\\" or \\"I don't think that's necessary...\\" I felt like - I don't give a crap what you think, I was to know what the evidence suggests. When I asked the lactation consultant about this book, she said Jackman is a \\"lactivist\\" who offered some good advice but not always in a way that's sensitive to the diverse situations mom's find themselves in."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you are a working mother, don't even consider this book","review":"The Ultimate Breastfeeding Book of Answers: The Most Comprehensive Problem-Solving Guide to Breastfeeding from the Foremost Expert in North America, Revised & Updated EditionI would not recommend this book to anyone who plans to return to work while breastfeeding as it condems almost all uses of a bottle or pumping and so provides little to no information about these topics. The tone of the book is very sanctimonious, especially with respect to the use of any medications during labor and any use of a bottle. There are much more helpful and balanced books available."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be prepared for a judgmental approach...","review":"To be fair, I have only started reading the book, but I don't know that I will finish it. WOW am I finding it very judgmental! The author clearly takes the approach that if you are unable or unwilling to breastfeed you are a bad parent and your child is doomed to a life of illness and the two of you will never bond. I am currently expecting our first child and the tone of the author was making me so upset that my husband actually took the book away from me for the sake of my blood pressure!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this book!","review":"Dr. Newman's conversational style in this book is great. I have many helpful breastfeeding books, such as Kathleen Huggins' Nursing Mother's Companion (which is also excellent), but the Ultimate Breastfeeding Book of Answers fills a different void in the literature. I learned a great deal from this book, particularly from the sections on \\"Not Enough Milk,\\" and \\"Jaundice\\" and \\"Breastfeeding While on Medication.\\"This is also a book that I never tire of reading. I've re-read it many times, and always learn something new that I'd overlooked before. Excellent!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you only read one breastfeeding book make it this one","review":"This is a fantastic resource. I read it before my son's birth and referred to it constantly in the early days.

If you're buying this CD to hear the three \\"rare\\" tracks (Everyday, The Letter and You're the One I Love) that don't appear on any other JT release, please note that these are NOT performed by James Taylor! The song Everyday is NOT JT's cover of the Buddy Holly tune, it is a different song, and these 3 tunes are performed by an unknown (mediocre) singer whom I cannot identify at all. The remaining 6 tracks can be found on the \\"Original Flying Machine\\" CD, rendering this CD release completely useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ripped off!","review":"While visiting a store in British Columbia, I came across a JT album that I had never seen. I was so excited to think that I had run across some rare or unreleased songs by one of my favorite artists! The title of the CD I purchased is The Letter, but it has the exact same song list as Listen With James. I agree wholeheartedly with the previous reviewer who says to AVOID buying this CD. When the first song came on, I thought that there must be some mistake. By the time I had heard three songs, I was mad. The first three songs on this album are definitely NOT SUNG BY JAMES TAYLOR! This album was produced by Prestige Elite Records Ltd out of Holland in 2005 and distributed by United Audio Entertainment Ltd. It shows a modern-day photo of JT and the entire packaging is deceiving. How can they get away with this type of misrepresentation?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Only for serious collectors.","review":"This CD is actually James Taylor's first recordings with The Original Flying Machine (original album on Euphoria Records pre-eponymous Apple record) way back in 1967. Some songs (strange sequencing being it is the first three tracks that are non-JT lead vocals) are sung and/or written by Danny \\"Kootch\\" Kortchmar (although JT's guitar is impossible to miss even on those cuts). Interestingly, it is those cuts that make this a collector's gem (for those who might care). The Kortchmar cuts were never included on the original album and were only later available on vinyl on some records that were of dubious origin. For those who would want them (collectors/complete-ists) some of these songs are actually pretty hard to find on CD. I myself would have preferred it was called James Taylor And The Original Flying Machine for clarity and to keep from upsetting the masses."},{"rating":"2","title":"More space for mp3s and videos","review":"I have well over 120 gigs of mp3 and movies.

I did research and found out the model number of the hard drive in my computer then I found it here! and cheaper that like models else where.

I thought the ion feature of this would be great. The clicking is annoying, but if it worked, I wouldn't mind. This puts out WAY less steam, causing the amount of time it takes to heat a curler much longer than the old system. Then, after all that, it only curls about 1/2 as much. So, it takes longer for less curl--not worth it. I hope I can get another Caruso, but I hear they have problems now, too.

I'm all for positive reinforcement, but I didn't really like that no distinctions were made at all for wrong vs. right answers. So I opened the toy to see if this was just a limitation of the demo and so I could check out the alternate settings. After several attempts at trying the other functions and using the setting displayed in the demo, I never once saw the crystal ball work during normal play.

It is a brilliant biographical account of the leading figure in the financial world of the nineteenth century. There are many things you can take from this book.

There's a reason that your standard jumper cables are almost a centimeter thick, each. A LOT of power needs to be transferred to a dead battery. Not only is the size of the cable here too small, but it connects through the lighter - that normally uses an even SMALLER wire gauge behind the dash. That amount of power transfer is not intended to go through a lighter plug and dash wire. For benefit of the doubt, I tried it and let it sit for *30 minutes* to charge a very small car battery. Did it transfer power? Yes. Was it enough power to start the dead car? No. The general theory of this product is sound, but the actual application is a failure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for any die-had Ravens fan.","review":"The only downside to this DVD is that it feels a little bit barebones.

If you need a good sleeping aid, this may be the ticket."},{"rating":"1","title":"so boring","review":"My professor is actually the author of this book so not only do I have to read this impossibly boring book, but I also get the lectures too. The book is incredibly wordly and phrases things in more complex ways than need be. I read about a page and need to take a break and often times I'll read the page and have no idea what I read because it's so boring. So, unless you need it for class, I don't recommend this as a joy-read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Humidifier pads work just fine","review":"These are generic pads that fit several different brands of humidifiers.

These are very low priced compared to the OEM pads and they work just fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Metal Slug Madness","review":"The Metal Slug series on the Neo Geo is one of the most hyper and intense action games around. All-out bloody warfare and guns a' blazing, this Neo Geo legend has been ported perfectly for the Game Boy Advance. The game runs quick and smooth. The graphics retain that classic 'Metal Slug' look. An improvement over the Neo Geo versions is the introduction of a lifebar rather than the ol' one-hit wonder. Only bad thing is that the prices on the used circuit is way overboard. Otherwise, this is an awesome game."},{"rating":"2","title":"GAME","review":"Game Game Game Game Game Game Game Game Game Game Game GameAwlsome old game for those of you out there with a old DS.

Still, it is professionally put together. The musicans are competent--in tune and in time. Yes, the lyrics are mediocre, but only occasionally embarrassing (\\"The Animal Trainer and the Toad\\" and \\"My Lady\\"). I like the record's crunchy sound, and the guitar lick (with overdubs apparently) that alternates with the sailor whistle tune in its title song.By the way, this is NOT \\"heavy metal\\". For one thing, the term hadn't been invented yet. For other things, there are no devil-worship or monster-movie lyrics; there is no incessant repetition of an...riff as in Black Sabbath's \\"Iron Man\\"; and there is nothing over-the-top or excessive or unpleasant about the record all. It is an unassuming, simple, straightforward product of its time. There is some hard rock, and there are some gentler pieces."},{"rating":"1","title":"Right Song , Wrong Album","review":"This album has only the short studio version of Nantucket Sleighride .

Check out CDs by these incredible rockers!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad but not great","review":"I don't think Mountain's studio work ever approached their live performances. This just sounds thin, with the high point being Pappalardi's vocals in the title track. Leslie West plays much better on Leslie West Live. His guitar is the real star of this show, and his vocals get better all the time. This album doesn't capture the overwhelming sound the big guy generated. It seems like he was trying to be just another member of the band, and that's a waste. For a great kick, check out his acoustic versions of The Animals and Bob Dylan on You Tube. Mountain was just his warm-up act. He's better not than he was then."},{"rating":"2","title":"classic rock album","review":"Great studio album that show cases the dual vocal styles of the raucous Leslie to the softer side of Felix. These tracks are relatively subdued (but not dull) compared to the full on live sound that Mountain produce, particularly the fantastic Nantucket Sleighride that is featured on the live album The Road Goes Ever on. Mountain were'nt around all that long but all their albums are full of good honest rock music with a touch of class."},{"rating":"2","title":"Takes Me Back!","review":"After years of being out-of-mind, I happened to hear \\"Nantucket Sleigh Ride\\" on the radio and decided to search it out on Amazon.

The reviewer criticizes Irigaray for being an idealist-- but idealism is important, because it is what allows us to imagine a future where our lives are happier and the world is more just. Plus, this book is full of practical ways in which to think about implementing that vision-- like a discussion of what kind of laws the European Union would need if it really wanted to treat women as though they were equal to men.This book argues that if we want gender equality, then we need to do some serious thinking about some fundamental philosophical concepts we have, rights foremost among them. And it shows that we can't have gender equality if the yardstick for that equality is always the male one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasn't good to begin with, and now its almost useless","review":"This book had a few good things, like some training activities and basic strategies, but much of the info was wrong like how the plasma I's work or some of the ship stats in the back of the book. Now that the game has went through so many revisions to fix bugs and balance the game, the book is completely lacking or incorrect for most of it's information.

Unfortunately, only one of the sets with this front cover contains those episodes, and I was sent one of the other two by mistake. I was very disappointed when I looked on the back and found that the set contained only those toned-down post-code episodes you can get absolutely anywhere, with Henry, Grampy, Pudgy, etc. Don't order this set.

None of the Cab Calloway's. Few or none of the pre-code. And definately not the set that is described here.

The stories of Kuan Yin are well told, diverse and moving. He strikes an excellent balance between philosophy, history, story telling, Kuan Yin meditation techniques, and personal devotion.There are a few pages of b/w photos, of Kuan Yin, Tara and Avalokiteshvara, the pictures vary in quality. However, many of them I have never seen before and a few definitely inspire devotion.The fact that John Blofeld lived and traveled in China, his joyous devotion to Kuan Yin, and his knowledge of the Chinese language and culture adds immensely to the book and puts it in a class by itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kwan Yin Society highly recommends this book!","review":"This is the classic Kwan Yin book in English.Very interesting historical information.

With the Narada series, i've found that this version is an enjoyable fresh approach to this particular suite of music, even though i still enjoy the listening to the older versions. But for some reason, i keep coming back to this one.I think there are enough subtle touches here to really add some style to the pieces, without ruining the feeling that an old classic has been tampered with. The versions of Pine Forest and Pas De Deux, in my opinion really encapsulate the feeling of the story, without loosing the emotion. The piano in Pine Forest can best be explained by being enchanting and melodic. In all, this recording is a staple in my play list during the holidays."},{"rating":"1","title":"surprisingly unimpressive","review":"As a long-time Carol enthusiast, I was hoping for a much more interesting and enlightening book.

It has been a great toy in the bathtub as well as at the pool. The figure stays upright very easily unlike some other water toys we have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for Meditation and Yoga","review":"I'd have to disagree with the review that called this \\"new age kitchenette music\\". I find it difficult to meditate to music that has a lot of polarity to it or forces me to listen to it instead of listening to my inner self. The songs flow together. It may seem repetitious at times, but the songs are subtly individualistic. This group is anything but 'Americanized'. They're a great blend of Indian, Arab and African flavor with a dash of Celtic. The music also is the ideal pace for yoga as well, yet soft enough even to sleep to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beyond incredible","review":"If you could describe the most perfect musical experience, it would have to be Vas. Greg Ellis and Azam Ali create nothing less than magic. Azam blows away even Loreena McKennitt (Sorry Loreena, I'm still a major fan!!!) with her \\"wordless\\" style of singing (and stunningly beautiful voice) which pierces the spirit. Putting on candles and listening to these albums is the most tranquil and peaceful relaxation I've experienced in years. Others have described Greg's abilities far better than I could: masterfully tying East and West together. \\"Sunyata\\" is the best, with \\"In the Garden of Souls\\" a VERY close second. \\"Offerings\\" while following the other two is still a good album to have also."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for world music listeners!","review":"This CD is really amazing. With voice and percussion only Ali and Ellis make a music of the world, for the world. I highly recommend this CD to play over and over. Unfortunately, their second release 'Offerings' is less inspired that this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great mood CD of mostly Persian influenced tunes","review":"This is sort of a unique CD. The sung lyrics have no meaning. Literally. Pretty noises in no language. This was intentional on the part of the singer in Vas. The idea was that the listener could just listen, and then imagine whatever lyrics and meaning they wanted to. The effort was not wasted, and a very good CD of Persian influenced music is the result. If you like Dead Can Dance and Delerium, you have a credible chance of liking this CD. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best albums in my collection","review":"I have sat and read all the reviews. I have mixed feelings about all of them.this much I can say. I got this album the day it came out and it has stayed in my current rotation for around 2 years.I started out with Ministry on Psalm69 like most fans .. and was kinda dissapointed by Filthpig ... but what I realize is that they are growing and developing. What good is pumping out the same album over and over again? It's like saying that Rollin's never did anything good other than \\"Liar\\" - please!Anyway what you will find on this album are some deep dark brooding grooves.. experimental industrial music.. thought provoking lyrics.. and enough highs and lows to make you want to tear up some major s#@t!!nice additions of the new instrumentation. This is a road not many have ventured to travel.. and the results are great.Can't wait for the next one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ministry still ahead of their time","review":"I know this album is not Psalm 69, it's still a damn good album. First it takes a few listens. I also didn't appreciate the experimental songs like Nursing Home until I recently heard them live. Plus the first three songs are very aggressive and very Ministry. While it's not a \\"classic\\", it's a damn good album with an edge. Open your mind and pick this one up. I thought Filthpig was a terrible album three years ago and now it's one of my favorite records."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why So Much Hatred For This Album?","review":"The Dark Side of the Spoon for some reason is seen as Ministry's worst album to most people (even Al Jourgensen said it was really bad) but I strongly disagree with that. There are definitely good songs on this album but it takes a few listens until it starts growing on you. Dark Side of the Spoon is Ministry's darkest and heaviest album but because of the lack of popularity this gem has been greatly overlooked by most fans. I am a HUGE Ministry fan and I absolutely love the albums \\"The Land of Rape and Honey\\" up to \\"The Dark Side of the Spoon\\", I actually like those albums better than the stuff they did in their Anti-Bush Trilogy. This album is not for all Ministry fans but it is definitely worth a listen if you are willing to give it a chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ministry wide open.","review":"I think that this is the most human record that Ministry came out with, and is a dark, hard story of rehab, abuse, and the questioning of one's worth. This album blew me away.Songs like 'Eureka Pile' and 'Nursing Home' still give me shivers every time I hear them. I was really impressed with the forthright honesty and depth of this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome industrial sound!","review":"I first discovered Ministry through a co-worker who was devoted to them, and I have to say that I haven't heard anything by them that I don't like yet. I bought this album a few months ago, and every time I play it for someone who's never heard of Ministry(yes, there are those people)they end up with a copy. This one's got both slow, haunting songs and faster paced, get-you-goin' songs(Step,Bad Blood). I'd say that this (or Psalm 69) is a great album for those of you who want to hear Ministry for the first time, so hurry and have a listen!"},{"rating":"1","title":"All Good Things...","review":"I was really looking forward to this album. Really. I didn't think Ministry could/would make another Filth Pig, yet they manage to make it sound _worse_. The only song worth mentioning is Supermanic Soul; all the other songs are pathetically slow, boring, and oh-so lame. Ministry is DEAD."},{"rating":"1","title":"time to pack it in...","review":"Well what can I say about Ministry, from the sheer brilliance of The Land of Rape and Honey to The Mind is a Terrible Thing..they have severely slumped to churning out run of the mill industrial metal, power cords galore and shoddy sample work meld together to give a weak thoughtless sound.

As an album DSOS is rather straight foward and un varied...but listened song by song it is very enjoyable. The opener \\"Supermanice Soul\\" and the single \\"Bad Blood\\" use the noisey guitar sound to the bands advantage rather than drown out the vocals like in FP...also good is the well titled \\"Vex and Siolence\\" and \\"Kaif\\" with makes good use of Als wide range of instruments. The humerous \\"Step\\" is also a highlight but the best song without a doubt is the seven minute saxaphone driven opus \\"Nursing Home.\\" Even though Filth Pig was a bit of a let down...Dark Side of the Spoon will defenitely make up for it...by the way...whos that fat chick..."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"When rock groups get too old\\" or \\"Pass the prune juice\\"","review":"Having been introduced to Ministry in my college years I grew found of their loud unusually style. The mixture of samples, 3 chord riffs at volume 11 and lyrics reaching into a culture I secretly admired. Fast forward 5 years and I see a band who at one time held a ranking of pioneers in the \\"industrial\\" music scene, putting out music to pay the electric bills. Some titles, \\"Step\\" show flashes of Al's unique style and personality but too many songs are just stale. The album relies are dark monotonous rhythms which sound outdated most noticeable on Vex & Siolence.

Psalm69, Mind is a Terrible Thing to Taste and The Land of Rape and Honey were THEE albums of my teens. Filthpig sucked, so does this CD. If you're looking for the fast paced industrial metal get mid-period Ministry CDs because they are the best this genre has to offer. If you however love the 80's pop or early electro-industrial get With Sympathy, Twitch or better yet, 12\\" Anthology!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another \\"who cares\\" CD from Ministry","review":"First off, I have lost all respect for Ministry. What they have accomplished here is a big nothing. Next, I put on this CD and I thought that my stereo was broken from the poor recording. Ive heard local demo tapes made on 4 track recorders sound better than this garbage. What Ministry has done here in my opinion, is made a CD under contractual obligation with the record company, with little or no thought put behind it. Actually, what the real problem is for Ministry is that they are in too many bands (Lard, RevCo, 1000 homo DJ's etc..) and have forgot their main fans are Ministry fans. Without Ministry, their would not have been Lard, RevCo etc..Buy this CD and be dissapointed. I give this a 1 because the first song is the only good song on the CD.

Not only is this the worst quality sounding recording Ive ever heard on CD, (even worse than those 8 year olds from Old Skull) but the songs are that long slow drone, with the same beat over and over.

While \\"Dark Side of the Spoon\\" has it's moments, it is almost as disappointing as their previous album. It's aggressive, loud, and abrassive as just about any of their other material, but the passion that Al Jourgensen and co. have displayed for years just isn't here. Standout tracks include \\"Supermanic Soul\\", \\"Step\\", and \\"Vex & Siolence\\", but other than that it is clear why \\"Dark Side of the Spoon\\" didn't go over well with longtime Ministry fans. This proved to be Ministry's last album with longtime label Warner Bros. before being picked up by Sanctuary and returning to form with their most recent album \\"Animositisomina\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"one star for every good song on it.","review":"I sold this cd a week after I bought it. I like industrial music to kick as.s.

There are two kinds of industrial music fans, the angry ones and the whiny ones. there are whiny songs all over this cd and alot of stupid humor crap and a jazz-ish song and saxafones and banjos and it sucks.

Unfortunately, 'The Dark Side of the Spoon' is an even more boring and irrelevant album as 'Filth Pig'. 'Filth Pig' had a few good songs on it, this has none. If you like a high school level, riff-metal band, you'll love this album. If you like anything Ministry made pre-'Filth Pig', you'll be saddened by this effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same old song and dance","review":"This album sounds striking similar to The Mind is a Terrible Thing to Taste. Frankly, I didn't like it. Ministry seem to have pretty much run out of ideas to be creative.

Perhaps Hypo and Hermes need to pack it in."},{"rating":"1","title":"sad","review":"It really saddens me to think the only redeeming qualities of this album are the brilliantly sickening cover art and the Pink Floyd spoof of the title, a not so inside joke about the band leader's heroin addiction.

This is the one that got em dropped from their record label, and for once, the guys in the suits at Warner Brothers knew when it was time to call it quits. Ministry, apparently, did not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ministry is great","review":"Filth Pig and Dark Side of the Spoon are, in my opinion, two of the best albums of the 90s --at least for people who like heavy music. Al Jourgensen is intelligent, musically talented, and has a sense of humor. he does what he likes and i happen to like it as well. i have never really heard anything by ministry that i didnt like ( although im not thrilled with the song \\"test\\" or the album \\"with sympathy\\") everything else that comes from Ministry has ranged from pretty darned cool to freaking awesome and both the last two albums fall into that last category for me. they are both different sounds, but with some of the same essential building blocks...and the key ingredients, Al Jourgensen and Paul Barker.

However, the album is not all bad. \\"Hands On Me\\" reminds me of \\"Dip It Low\\" with the fast beat. \\"Miss You Like Crazy\\" should be her next single, but she probably won't spare us and release something like \\"I Can Be That Woman\\".

The plastic on the spout of my last Copco kettle burned on my gas range so I knew I wanted a kettle with no plastic parts near the heating element.

My search is done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where did the whistle go?","review":"Oh I liked this teapot enough when it worked. The harmonic whistle always got my attention, and to give it credit it lasted about 2 years but then it stopped whistling without warning and I nearly boiled the water aways since I can be forgettful at times. My other issue was the lid can get very hot so if you are removing it to steep tea bags you need to pull it off with a towel. Also the handle and your hand are in the way of filling it so you kind of have to hold it a bit sideways to fill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heats quickly...whistle is beyond awful","review":"Picked up the \\"onyx\\"-colored one at Bed Bath & Beyond (same price as Amazon), after seeing this kettle recommended in \\"The Week\\" magazine for having a nice whistle. Stylish design..Put it on our gas stove and it heated quickly but the whistle is terrible! When it's about to go off, it sounds like someone gradually whistling from a low note to an ear-piercing high note. Drives us and our Golden insane: it honestly almost hurts your ears. Plus, the handle and \\"trigger\\" to pull the spout up is made of plastic and both were warm, almost hot to the touch after it came to a boil.Per the other reviews, I could see the plastic melting on this. Maybe it's not designed for gas stoves. (We were using one of the largest burners, I guess...)Great looking kettle and fast-heating but considering the reviews about parts melting (causing the whistle to stop working after a while), plus the insanely loud noise it makes, we're taking this one back."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO WHISTLE = DANGER","review":"I agree with several others about the dangers of this kettle, as beautiful a design and as great a whistle as it has AT FIRST. After more than a year the whistle has not been consistent and certainly no longer has the great train sound. I put on water for a cup of tea, got busy, did not hear a whistle and when I finally realized something was wrong, the plastic cap melted, the plastic attachment to the metal part of the cap melted/broke, and the lid plastic was a bubbling mess! This could have caused a very real problem on the gas stove top! I thought it was \\"just me\\" until I read the reviews as I looked for a replacement. I will not replace with another Chantal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped whistling afer a year or so","review":"It's a nice looking kettle but it failed in its most important and pretty simple function of whistling only a year after purchase.

I gave it to my oldest for his 6th birthday and he was thrilled to have his own bowling alley. We put it together and they started to play. It lasted one whole hour before it broke. The pins jammed, and yes they were playing with it how it is supposed to be played with which is by throwing the ball at it. According to the booklet, you are supposed to turn it off and then back on when this happens. Thats what I did and it didn't work. The pins just make a horrible sound and they don't move. It says not to return product to place of purchase but the toll free number to call with problems is open at very inconvenient times so I have not been able to get a hold of the manufacture yet. So, buyer beware. It looks great but obviously it has some flaws with the electronic parts. It plays music with a strike and spare and resets pins (if not jammed. My son loved it until it broke."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very dissappointed","review":"My 3 1/2 year old son received this toy as a gift. He absolutely loves Diego and bowling, so the combination of the two created a very excited little boy when he opened the gift.

And now when we turn it on it makes a constant annoying cranking sound.

This item looks so large on the box and in all the advertisements but it is like a mini bowling alley!! It actually stands only 11 1/2 inches---thats less than one foot tall!!! Even though I purchased it on sale, I'd say it is not worth it. Another writer had it on the money when she said there is no way a child (mine are 3 and 6) can stand up and bowl with this. They have to sit infront of it and roll the ball in order to see the pins. A note to sdvertisers--just tell it OR in this case--show it like it is and let the consumer decide if they want to buy what the item ACTUALLY is!! Tricking people is not good business practice!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"So others are not fooled","review":"This is a fun toy for my three year old. However the size is seriously misrepresented.

Cook is in one of his more sombre moods and it seemed like he wanted to keep it slow and serene. Trouble is he made it boring at the same time. Where was the gusto of Tempest? It's not that bad seriously, but I expected better and felt let down. Not a good way to spend my money. If you want Cook's best, listen to Tempest and Vertigo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Blend of Anglo, Latin, and Flamenco","review":"\\"Gravity,\\" is the first of Jessie Cook's (five, excluding the compilations?) albums, and it continues to hold up as my favorite. I can recommend all five as worthy. I love the energy and creativity, and the way it makes me feel. His blend is less percussive, and more melodic. The music conveys a powerful, uplifting spirit that is both exciting and sensual.I saw Jesse Cook perform in Annapolis, Maryland, several years ago with the very talented Bill Katsioutas, along with a percussionist. It was a great show, and absolutely confirmed Cook's athleticism with the guitar. I was disappointed these two didn't continue working together on future albums.An interesting thing about Cook's music is that it's great for almost any situation - driving, writing, working out, or an evening with your lover (can I recommend Luna Llena for getting in the mood...)!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Technical Skill Over Art","review":"Why didn't I like this? Maybe it's the modern jazz influence common to Nuevo Flamenco (perhaps that explains the Kenny-G hair). Or perhaps it's Mr. Cook's desire to show us how fast he can play rather than to compose artistic music first and back it up with technical skill second. So portions are indeed energetic and playful, you might say 'cutesy,' and that may be enough for you, but the more I played it the more I felt that it lacked soul and deepth. I liked the Middle Eastern influence but in track 8 the heavy drums choke it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"What an ending.","review":"I picked up this book absolutely clueless to what I was about to read. I had read the back cover, and it seemed intriguing so I gave it a chance. I think that my use of the word intriguing is an understatement, becasue Special is so much more than that. Although I think that the characters are very mature for their age, I think that Bathurst captures the cruelty that teenage girls enflict upon one another. I highly reccommend this book for those girls 14 and up. The graphic descriptions might be a little too graphic for those who aren't mature enough to handle it. However, be prepared for an intense, and shocking ending. Also be prepared for a cliffhanger that leaves the actual events up to your imagination."},{"rating":"2","title":"Translation","review":"Elmer's Weather is a great little book.

Besides covering the basics of sentence construction, Minkova even give examples of the vaster rhetorical tricks employed by various classical writers. Examples abound for each point, though sadly they are not cited.While none of the information inside is exactly wrong, the book will probably prove unusable to most interested readers. There are no exercises, so students can't gradually build up their skills chapter by chapter. The production of the book is amateur, with poor typesetting and limited editing.

The illustrations are excellent, but the book is nothing more than a rabin pro-African propoganda dumbed down for elementary or high school students. It is not thought provoking, as all of Africa's ills are blamed on Western colonialism.It's aimed for a high-school or lower audience. It seems Shillington is more concered with increasing the damaged self-esteem of Black students than with providing an accurate history that will allow those students to see the world realistically."},{"rating":"1","title":"Historically inaccurate and biased","review":"I am a fan of Shillington and I expected more from this book.

He covers in great detail and quality of the relationship between Africa and Islam as well as the nature of slavery and apartheid. He covers the slave trade in quite a bit of detail, explaining the value of the African as a marketable commodity. He also explains the origins of apartheid as a colonial parting gift that became entrenched racist national policy for more than fifty years. Shillington's survey is quite appropriate for a high school African history class, an undergraduate African history survey or introduction or even as a first book for a graduate African history course. The topics covered here are obviously from an Africanist point of view although there is a minimum, if any, level of bias on Shillington's part."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent survey for the first-time reader","review":"Extremely well written and hard to put down.Shillington has an obvious affection for Africa, but I expected it and allowed for it.

Open the tube at the top, pour in some water, then power the unit on. It will not be silent right away. There's still air trapped in the system, and there'll be a few \\"burbs\\" from time to time when these air bubbles are pushed out. But once that is all done, it really is whisper-quiet.Now, changing filter media. The first time I tried this, I was a little worried, but there's nothing to it. Shut the filter off, pop up the lever on the hose-fitting assembly and remove it. It's sealed off, so no dripping water.

They were .38 cents each and simply push in and secure very tightly. Be sure to get them as tight as will fit in the hole. They were in the screw/bolt aisle and in the \\"specialty\\" section. I tested one out and pushed it in a bit and had to pull and pull and almost had to borrow a set of pliers to get it out!

It makes it look classy and most CR-Vs don't have them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly made...","review":"I decided to buy this after reading all of the reviews and I'm sorry to say that I wish I had listened to the lower raters. This is a very poorly made product. The plaque itself is very nice and sturdy but the hands on the clock and the thermometer are really cheap and flimsy. When I got it out of the box the hands were all bent and a piece of the hand for the thermometer was broken off. The hook for hanging on the back is actually the thermometer itself so if you have to twist it to hang level (which I did) then it moves the hand on the thermometer.As for the temp being wrong...it was, but there is a way to adjust it to read properly once it acclimates to the temperature.I was able to finagle it enough to work and decided to keep it just because I didn't want to hassle sending it back. If you are OK with bending the arms and manually adjusting the temp a few times then this is OK. If not, I suggest looking somewhere else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low Quality","review":"The clock is of low quality, paint job is streaky, the clock did not function, the hands on the clock are flimsy and bend if you are not extremely careful.

Anyway, we got some very nice wind last year and I forgot to mount (properly) so it fell off the hinge and broke. I had been looking for a replacement for some time. This item is very good with regards to quality and functionability. The only hitch is it is somewhat dark but it does a good job of being a versatile unit by allowing you to have a clock/temp gauge. The artwork is very nice and if you are looking for something that is practical, appreciate unique items where you will not find everybody on the block with the same unit......you will find this a great bargain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective Thermometer","review":"The face of the item is very nice and the clock worked fine. The thermometer is part of the same plastic unit as the hanging hook. If you straightened the unit, it moved the thermometer. The thermometer itself never moved on its own.

Yep."},{"rating":"2","title":"Remarkable, Outstanding, A Must Read","review":"This is the best book I have read on the subject of the art and culture, it should be recommended to anyone interested in history of art, music, architecture, and sociology.

It reminds us once again that human problems do not change in time, it is our approach toward them that defines us as personalities and as societies. \\"The Civilization\\" shows that human race has huge ancestry, which must not be forgotten, but used for good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective, should've paid attention to the other reviews!!","review":"The game with the Pittsburg Steelers is missing.

Now don't get me wrong - I used to be a big fan of Terry Brooks (and his original 'Sword of Shannara' series), but now I see that he's become mighty fat and lazy. The book reads as if he wrote this in his sleep, making up the characters and plots as he went along, rehashing bits of his previous efforts. Don't waste your time and money on this - I recommend Stephen Donaldson's 'Thomas Covenant' series, if you haven't yet read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"OH MY GOD, THIS IS BAAAAD...","review":"I read some of teh Shannara books when I was a kid. nice, but never worth going back to.

I enjoyed this book greatly! Although to like this book, you have to like his style of writing, which he has established in his previous books! (Sword of Shannara, is my third all time favorite book, although I was disappointed in the Elfstones)A few things that I didn't really like was the beggining, just before they set out on the quest and Leah, is discouraging them: This is too much like the other books, and I thought it boring, and pointless, since I knew they would end up going anyways! I am really happy to see a relative of Panamon Creel back in the story!

Great series.","review":"So, you've read the Sword, Elfstones, and Wishsong... there's a lot more to come, and it all starts with this book. The Heritage of Shannara is an excelent series from Terry Brooks, almost as good as his Word and the Void series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good introduction to a so-so series","review":"Terry Brooks' writing style is compelling. You don't want to put the book down. You'll love books 1 - 3 of this series, but be warned: Book 4 falls far short of the rest. The first three books will almost read themselves, but Book 4 moves much too quickly. Everything concludes much too abruptly. My advise: get this series at the library. Its not quite good enough to buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terry Brooks took a dive","review":"The first three Shannara books have a wealth of description and style. They introduced me to a Tolkien-like (some say too Tolkien-like) Epic on grand proportions. Perhaps too child-like, but I'm not so cynical yet. This book however (and the books following) just failed to live up to it. Maybe I had grown up too much by the time I read this book, but this series was a huge disappointment, after three stunning books. The world of the Ohmsfords is losing its magic, this book and series already did."},{"rating":"2","title":"A tipical Shannara story","review":"Terry Brooks is living in the past. With constant references to the Sword of Shannara and the other books, he basically just changes names of characters and places. The all out story was very good. I would read for two hours straight adn not even notice it. I was that interested in it. Personally, if Terry Brooks wrote more Shannara books I would buy them. No true Shannara fan can say that they wouldn't. His novels are to interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"shame shame shame","review":"It took my two weeks to stop giving up on the Sword trilogy but after I got past the first 50 pages, I was hooked.

In other words another action packed thriller. an easy read."},{"rating":"2","title":"interesting..","review":"To be truthful, this was the first Shannara book I've read, but I've read them all including First King. I would have to say that this one was my favorite, mostly because I liked the idea of the shadowen and all the possibilities behind them. Well developed enemies if you ask me. The characters seemed rather similar to their ancestors, but hey that's how Brooks always writes.. Every single book in the first series had new characters that were related. I liked this series because it sticks with one set of them throughout the whole thing. If you want to like the shannara stuff better I would suggest reading the heritage of shannara books before the original, even though you'll wonder who Wil Omsford was and what the Wishsong actually used to be like. The new wishsong is cool though :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The future of the Four Lands...","review":"Brooks returns with a great book with everything a Shannara fan is looking for.

Terry Brooks follows up the fisrt series with a spectacular new one. I loved the characters in this one, especially the Ohmsford brothers, Par and Coll. I loved the bonds of loyalty and purpose that bound all of the characters together!!! These are my favorite books and I am a diehard fan of sci fi and fantasy. When you read these books its more like living in the four lands for a while rather than just observing what happens through the author's eyes. You are sucked into the story. If you develop any emotional ties to the characters at all. Be prepared to be played like a violin!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A superb followup to a FANTASTIC series.","review":"As a die hard reader of fantasy fiction I've come acrosssome extraodinary series. David Eddings, Tracy Hickman andMargaret Weis, and Robert Jordan all have, in my eyes attempted to match the epic fictional works of Tolkien. Terry Brooks has done so, and where the Silmarillion has fallen short on the history of Middle Earth, Scions does the Shannara series justice as a prelude to original trilogy.Brooks uses the same flair for describing his characters to emphasize the differences between generations as he has always done to impress this reader in his earlier books. Settings as tangible as any in real life fill the imagination as the Four Lands unfold in greater and richer detail with each volume in the Shannara series.Ultimately it comes down to this: I was disappointed that the book had to end and wait breathlessly for the next in the fabulous Shannara series"},{"rating":"1","title":"Scions of Shannara - Terry Brooks rehashes faithfully","review":"This book, although not badly written, is exceptionally uninspired. The characters are rehashes of characters used in his earlier books almost exactly. His plot is somewhat tired as well; the little party on it's quest. As events happen, they don't seem to advance the story much, they are just the obligatory compications. Perhaps the most annoying facet of the story is the references to all his previous books and characters. I think it's nice to have a sense of continuity between series set in the same location, but here it comes across as if Brooks can't quit congratulating himself on everything else he's written previously. Brooks seems to have put little thought into this one. I'm not sure I will move on to the next; I may just reread Robert Jordan's series instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"My view","review":"I have only read the first 50 pages of the book and i already rate it as the best book i have ever read. it drew me in so fast it took my breath away.

Many recipes 'stem directly from', if that is possible, Harris' most delicious novels such as Chocolat. The photos, descriptions, ingredients, and recipes themselves bring the reader another step closer to the 'reality' of the characters so relished in her novels.It takes me to the world of Blackberry Wine and Five Quarters, for example. In this volume you can see them, smell them, taste them, it gives their world colour and texture.I like that.Admittedly, as the book is quite new to me, I have only (so far) tried the one recipe I was most keen to appreciate with my own senses: Vianne's Hot Chocolate. If the others turn out as luxuriously, this book is going to provide some true pleasure in the kitchen and at the table."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who Can Resist?","review":"Who Can Resist a cookbook written by the author of Chocolat?Come on...I couldn't resist.

Very close to it. I know this is not pure flamenco, but the tunes should be there. Only one or two are nice. rest just goes on. I suggest that people who like this type of music should try Armik. He is really a genius in composing. He makes melodies. he is out of this world. He make pure melodies. No thrash. He is really a professinal. His music really has passion. the guitar sort of begs wanting something which captures in your heart. Try him, you will forget oscar and everybody else. He is the master composer!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This CD is over-rated and lack of character","review":"I bought this CD because it has 5-star rating. I was so disappointed with the music. It is so plain and uncharacteristic. Nothing stands out in the CD. Personally I also own Duende, Fire and Grace, Obsession and Gypsy Soul. This one is clearly at the bottom."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very much like flying a real airplane","review":"I have had this program for eight years. I also have a friend with an airplane who takes me with him from time to time. I find this program enhances my meager skills enough that if he suddenly blacked out, I could get us back to the airport and safely landed.I do not have a pilot's license and have never taken flying lessons, other than what my friend has shown me.Newer programs have more aircraft, more airports, and more scenery; but this program still does all of the basics you need for flying a real plane, and does them well. This program has more features than I will ever use. Using it will also make you a better, calmer airline passenger. You will know more about what the pilot is doing and how the plane is responding.I do not have a joy stick, but use the number buttons on the right end of my keyboard for controls."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazon - Thank You For Stocking Great Vintage Product","review":"Those of us that enjoy Microsoft's original Combat Flight Simulator require this product for certain enhancements.

They had one copy of it at Amoeba. They had a few 12-inch singles too. This is probably the most experimental record of all the records I have reviewed this month. It is a collection of all the singles from the past six years (2000-2006). It is a mix between dub, two-step, drum & bass, and goth. There is some atmospheric stuff mixed with some driving tunes. People often ask me what I am listening to. This is the sort of record I would be into even if I wasn't being a reviewer. This is amazing. This is underground. This is definitely a new sound. You should check it out too."},{"rating":"1","title":"I want my money back!","review":"Buying this CD was the biggest waste of my money so far in 2007.I'm throwing it in the garbage because it is such a bad CD.

I am someone who is always in search for new music because, well, I like the new stimulation (must be a dopamine effect somehow deep in the brain). Anyway...When I received this CD and first played it, it went into my \\"ech\\" pile. But I played it again, and again, and each time it grew on me and in but a few weeks it has become a favorite that I am so glad I purchased.If you are open-minded and appreciate the nearby genres but want something fresh and distinct, then do go ahead and purchase this.

At least, you should think so, given that this book should be revision for you. It doesn't really go far into any involved maths. Just enough is covered to enable the description of basic circuit elements - resistor, capacitor and inductor. And to describe the AC impedance of a little circuit. A very minimalist approach.The book feels like a high school level offering. One would hope that at the university level, more advanced discussions of circuits would occur."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for technicians brushing up on math they need","review":"This outline is not going to teach you a full course of algebra, trigonometry, or any particular branch of mathematics. Its reason for being is to teach the mathematics that technicians need in their daily work. This includes calculating wire sizes, impedence matching, the math of DC and AC circuits, and, of course, some basic trigonometry. If that is what you seek, this is the outline for you. It has enough exposition to function as a tutorial in its limited subject matter. It is a good companion to \\"Schaum's Outline of Basic Electricity, 2nd Edition\\", since it goes more into detail about the mathematics of the subjects covered in that outline."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good","review":"i found the book helpful in math for my basic d.c. class and i would recommend this book to my classmates."},{"rating":"2","title":"Learning to see","review":"This is a basic book.

The book is set up like a work book and walks you through the process step by step. J. Womack is very prescriptive in how to produce value stream maps. It would be helpful to have additional examples from several industries. Value stream mapping is useful in helping to indentify areas that need improvement projects. They should be the basis for strategic plans for process improvement.

I read them with each purchase and normally I don't feel the need to contradict others. I found that Bruce Bain's \\"pretend you never seen one before...\\" to be chilidish and absolutely off the mark. I am an art student and art appreciation major. When I first went to art class I was self-taught without instruction. This was a good thing. My first professor advised the class \\"Everything you learned before now forget. You learned it that wrong way! I will teach you the right way\\". It is just like this that the artist is telling you to forget your preconceived notions and look at subjects with a fresh eye. I picked up this book in the book store and ending up reading ten pages standing in the aisle before I knew it. Its a marvelous find. I highly recommend.

How disappointed I was to discover that these cd's sound no different now than they did when they were originally issued eleven years ago! And that sonic experience can be summed up in two words: TAPE HISS. So much tape hiss that it's almost unbelievable. They may have repackaged these cd reissues, but it certainly does not sound as though they bothered to remaster them. And that's too bad; these Mountain masterpieces desperately needed to be properly restored/remastered. Shame on Sony! This amounts to thievery."},{"rating":"2","title":"Im Blown Away By The Quality Of This Affordable Guitar","review":"Well before I ordered I read a lot of reviews on this product and for the most part they were very good..

Im blown away at the quality of this affordable guitar.. Ive been playing $1000 guitars at my local music store and I have to say this $120 guitar sounds just as nice as most of them.. The action is very low and easy to play, the sound is amazing considering they're just stock pickups.. Its nice and light so it doesnt kill ur shoulders while playing..

The guitar seemed to play OK until we realized the front pickups were only working a 1/3 of the time. if you switched to the fronts only it would cut out for minutes at a time.

Anyone who thinks the Christian faith is dull,hypocritical or for the gullible should read it to have their preconceptions challenged. What I like best about it is that Cooper and Tice allow their charming,self-deprecating characters to shine through with plenty of humour and relevant references to their own interests in cinema and sport. It should be added, that this is never at the expense of the Biblical truths- though I suspect that people over a certain age might not be au fait with references to RADIOHEAD or THE MATRIX! Not only is the book challenging, it is also unintimidatingly easy to understand and refreshingly unsentimental and sharp. Give this as a gift to your non-Christian friend, but also read it yourself to remind you of the joy of the incredible love of Jesus."},{"rating":"1","title":"If only zero stars were a choice....","review":"This is easily the most consistent disc I have ever heard.

As my grandfather was fond of saying \\"do not wait with your hand on your ass - it might grow there\\". The album is entirely instrumental - no vocals (probably a godsend), and almost every track seems to be in a different tempo or a halftime feel. This sucks the energy right out of the original tracks. If you've ever wondered what a Foo Fighters song might sound like as a waltz or a bossanova track, this may be up your alley. Otherwise avoid this as if it were drenched in radiation levels that would make your pink parts shrivel and fall off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor job for great band","review":"the guitar tribute to the foo fighters was done poorly. it is not what i expected, i expected it to be even close to what the actual songs sounded like. you can barely understand what your listening to for some songs...\\"monkeywrench\\" is a great example...i didnt know what song i was listening to until it got part where dave screams \\"one last thing before i quit...\\" some of the songs are done good though, for example, \\"low\\", it sounds really good. all my life sounds ok, but i wouldnt recomend this cd unless you are an avid foo fan and just want to build on your collection of foo memorabilia."},{"rating":"1","title":"strange necklace","review":"some of the beads are covered with this strange burlap material that is very ugly!

Even we two were immortalized as \\"The pancake men\\". Should you ever wonder, why people still know us along the river, why not buy the book.

He lays out the facts about the origins of the Bible, and lets the reader make his own conclusions. If you're a Christian, you should find this exploration of the historical origins of your religion to be fascinating, and it won't threaten your faith."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great secular view of the Bible","review":"Asimov's book gives a very good secular view of the Bible and puts the events occuring in the Bible into historical perspective. It also provides an understanding of the the structure of the Bible, e.g., what is considered canonical (by Jews, Catholics, Protestants), who likely wrote what (although the scholarship may be dated), what was occuring in history when the various books were written, etc. Consider this a book for Bible 101 to teach basic Bible literacy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything you should want to know about the Bible.","review":"Good book. Very informative and interesting. Gives a sort of \\"behind-the-scenes\\" approach to the bible. Fills in much of the who's who and adds much needed historical context to the otherwise vague biblical stories. Some parts are a bit slow and dry, but these parts correspond accordingly to some of the bible's drier parts. Heresy or not, I preferred reading this to the Good Book itself. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dated, but so what","review":"This is one of the best books ever on biblical studies, including the Old and the New testaments. It's written in clear simple language and covers just about everything you can think of, including some things you wouldn't think of. If anything, I'd like to see the book expanded. Asimoz skips over some chapters where I wish he had spent more time. And his traditional view of the bible seems outdated nowadays.

But Bible scholar? If anything, this book is a good study in secular humanism's approach to the Bible. However, good objective Biblical scholarship this isn't. Within its pages, are many of the arguments made by the 'higher criticism' camp of the late 19th and early 20th century. Even in it's 1992 rewritten form it overlooks several recent archeological findings and still manages to mangle the greek. In plain English, this book preaches to the choir of skeptics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Consult an expert","review":"Reading Azimov concerning the Bible is like reading Billy Crystal about brain surgery!

It doesn't pretend to be a work of original scholarship. It is what it's titled: a 'Guide' to the Old and New Testaments. Asimov emphasizes chronology and context, which gives the reader the sense that the things depicted as occurring in the various books of the Bible aren't just a collection of disconnected and discordant events. It is an extremely interesting history book in and of itself, and I learned more from it than from any other book about the Bible I've read of narrower topical scope. This was an ambitious project even for Isaac to attempt to tackle, and the range of his 'general overview' is as informative and fascinating as anything else he ever wrote."},{"rating":"2","title":"The old Intellect focuses on biblical concept","review":"In terms of intellect, he could do almost anything and master it. He was the Voltaire of our time. And, still, his intent was to provide information that a thinking mind might utilize to make its own determinations. In this small aspect of his study, when he focused his considerable energy in this direction, his own words must express his motives:\\"Imagine the people who believe such things and who are not ashamed to ignore, totally, all the patient findings of thinking minds through all the centuries since the Bible was written. And it is these ignorant people, the most uneducated, the most unimaginative, the most unthinking among us, who would make themselves the guides and leaders of us all; who would force their feeble and childish beliefs on us; who would invade our schools and libraries and homes.

Their new talent is going to add a little life to the redundant sounds of the music scene...This album is the best I've heard in a long time, and it's about time these guys are heard by the rest of the world's population. Their mind crunching metal and unique techno and industrial tastes are enough to make a fan of anyone. Pick up this album as soon as you can, it's going fast.

This isn't anything personal, because I have actually met the band briefly on their UK tour with System of a down and they seemed like nice guys, but I just have to say that I hate this album. The best description of this is like a half-hearted combination of White Zombie, Fear Factory and Ministry, without any of the good bits. This is just so unoriginal and predictable, every song is just lowest common denominator pounding metal with nothing interesting or redeeming whatsoever. Although there is a pretty good production job it doesn't hide the fact that every song sounds the same, that the lyrics mean nothing and that the whole album is a bone-headed neanderthal experience. For those who think bands like Coal Chamber and Mudvayne are cutting edge."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent service.","review":"The product arrived earlier than the earliest anticipated arrival date in the condition promised, works great and it's a great album.

After you buy this cd go buy Machine and then if you wish to continue to listen to Static X maybe Shadow Zone but after that you need to wait for a newer cd then Start A War. By the way the title of this is because Wisconsin is the first cd they made then Machine.

Bled For Days is not the only worthwhile song on the album. Push It is also good and is the latest single. Love Dump is also good. These guys aren't suppoaed to be Led Zeppelin or Metallica. Their one mission in music is to turn it up, scream and let it go. To that point, it delivers. If you're not looking for something that will shake the cobwebs from your head, this is not for you. But, if you're looking for loud, kick *** music, then buy this disc. You'll like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"These guys sound great","review":"I'll admit that I was a little hesitant to buy this album when I first heard the song \\"Push It\\" on the radio. Well I'm glad that I did because, I love Static-x's sound. They don't sound like every other metal band that comes out in today's music, because the lead singer has such a different voice. I love every thing about this cd. The guitars, lyrics and voice of the music sound great. The only problem with it is that some songs sound repetitive after a while, but really it isn't that big of a deal. Overall I think Static-x have a good future ahead, and you should buy \\"Wisconsin Death Trip\\" to see what I mean."},{"rating":"1","title":"How does one buy this?","review":"Ok I have seen both of the videos on MTV and thats all I can say. This is the worst music I have ever heard. Here is a list of things wrong with this band.1- The lead singer doesnt even speak english hey just says a bunch of jubberish.2-Look at the bassist for God sakes.3- Look at the lead singers hair. If you want good rock listen to stuff like three doors down, or Creed. This is the worst stuff.

Thats all I have to say"},{"rating":"1","title":"Every song sounds the same","review":"I have listened to this cd and basically every song sounds the same. i think that they should start to try new things and not just have that heavy punk sound to every song. after listening to about 2 of there songs, i started to get tired of there sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hilariously simplistic!","review":"If amateurish songwriting and two-note riffs are your thing, look no further than this.

This isn't anything special. These riffs have been invented long ago by metal masters like Machine Head. These guys just add the brainless screaming on top, and the \\"industrial coolness\\" - what? If you want industrial coolness listen to techno. If you want heavy ass music that's actually skilled, listen to Carcass's NECROTICISM: Descanting the Insalubrious OR better yet, Machine Head's Burn my Eyes. Now those guys have brains on their shoulders. Throw this out, and get the albums I've recommended, or just go check out reviews for them here or elsewhere. You'll be pleasantly surprised."},{"rating":"2","title":"These guys rock.","review":"When I first heard these masters of what they do, I couldn't understand a damn word that vocalist Wayne Static was saying. Then, I bought it, read the lyrics, and they were awesome! I learned some of the bass riffs and the album is a hell of a lot fun to listen to. If you are a fan of Fear Factory, hed p.e., or even Black Sabbath/ Ozzy Osbourne, give this album a mic check and I'm sure you'll want it."},{"rating":"2","title":"UNBELIEVABLE!!!","review":"THIS CD, BY FAR, IS THE BEST MUSIC I HAVE HEARD IN YEARS! STATIC-X sucks you in with no warning at all! While I agree with other reviews I've read that their music is somewhat \\"derivative\\", there is something about this band that is COMPLETELY FRESH and EXCITING! In fact, I wouldn't call it \\"derivative\\", but would say that they pay homage in the best way possible to AMAZING bands of past (i.e., Joy Division, Ministry, Nine Inch Nails, etc.). IT'S A GREAT DEBUT ALBUM FOR A BAND I HOPE TO HEAR LOTS MORE FROM. BUY THIS CD - YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Exstatic about Static-X","review":"This is one of my best overall cd's.

Rock on Static-X!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Static-x is what i've been waiting for...","review":"Finally...something new that kicks-a**.

You have to hear it to believe it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not exellent","review":"This CD actually has some of my favorite songs of all time on here. Bled For Days, Push it, Love Dump, and Wisconsin Death Trip. I don't have much to say for this CD but I recommend you to get Machine first before you get this one. What I've heard of Machine, that one is far better than this one! A good CD thought with great guitars and drums. The vocals are okay but they could have been better. Worth 9 bucks at tops for me. But a okayish CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"No great songs, all a little bland","review":"I bought this Cd cause I heard it was great hard-core.I guess hard-core doesn't excite me like it used to. I still like bands like KORN and Rob/White Zombie and love P.O.D., Nonpoint, Deftones, and Taproot. This Cd is different though. None of the songs really excite me. There are some bands like this that just don't excite me any more. Maybe I am liking softer stuff, but I recommend that even if you love hard music, think twice about this Cd, cause it isn't all that great. My review used to end here (with only 2 stars), but I decided to add some. This Cd grows on you the more you listen. If you can relate to liking the band that I have talked about above, give this Cd a try. You may agree with my above statments, but I give this band a lot more credit for this Cd nowadays. I didn't like their new one though."},{"rating":"2","title":"great cd","review":"this is my favorite band. songs 1,2,3,5,8,9,10 are the bestsongs. wayne static has the best voice!"},{"rating":"2","title":"High-Energy cd","review":"Another great debut by an up-and-coming band. The music is fast and furious with added depth from the programming and keyboards defining them as another band in the techno, industrial, nu-metal genre. The music is accentuated by the vocal assault of the frontman whose psychotic singing style reminds me of Coal Chamber or Society One. \\"Bled For Days\\" is my fav track and the best song on the cd while \\"Push It\\", \\"Love Dump\\", and \\"The Trance is the Motion\\" are also worthwhile. The only problem is that the cd is kind of short, some of the songs just sound the same, and a lot of the lyrics are just mindlessly repeated over and over. Otherwise, a great high-energy, intense cd that is worth checking out. Also check out: Spineshank, Rammstein, Ultraspank, Professional Murder Music, American Head Charge, and Solemn."},{"rating":"2","title":"PUSH IT AGAIN","review":"i just saw them yesterday with PM5K in NYC... my neck still hurts from all the head banging... had the album for a while now... if u r a metal fan looking for something different u should get this. GOT TO LOVE THE HAIR. static-X r a cool band with cool sound. keep it simple STATIC. out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good cd, worth the money","review":"I'm usually not a big fan of industrial music, because most of it sounds like a copy of Ministry, Godflesh, or White Zombie. This group does have some hints of these groups in their sound, but the vocal sound and INCREDIBLY heavy guitars make for a distinct and awesome sound. Another band that is as good, if not better, but is no longer around, is Prong. If you buy this cd and like it, go buy Prong's \\"Cleansing\\" album, because this cd is noticeably influenced by that more than anything else. All in all, it is an excellent debut from a band that can only get better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Static-X has major talent!","review":"Static-X is awsome. I bought this CD acouple of months ago and I still love it. It has a real metal/industrial type of sound to it. The lead singer Wayne is screaming in a high pitch voice one second, then the next roaring really low. Some bands that they sound a tad alike are White Zombie, System Of A Down, and Powerman 5000. But these guys copy nobody, they have their own techno/metal sound. I saw these guys two nights ago up in Portland, Maine. They were awsome! I love this band. Buy the CD and see them live too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"holy buhjeebuzz, this is a mighty good album!!!","review":"I must say, this is the best album i've heard since end of heartache by killswitch engage (buy that one too!!). nice riffs, vocals, and did i mention nice riffs!?! holy crap!!! best $10.99 i've ever spent in my life!! my immediate thoughts after hearing this album were, \\"this nice...WOW!!...i love this!!...etc.\\" i just bought it today too, approx. 6 hrs. ago. my faves of the disc include:Push itI'm with stupidBled for daysLove dumpI amStemSweat of the budFix!!Wisconsin Death Trip!!The trance is the motionand that's about it. i hope the reader of this review relizes how serious i am. i am really serious. this is a must have for industrial fans. OH YEAH!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"something is weird here","review":"Well, I am not one to complain but has anyone noticed the similarity between the first song on this album amd the first song on Astrocreep 2000 by White Zombie? If your ears arent tone deaf like the rest of the nation is you would automatically notice it. The songs sound exactly the damn same! I'm expecting anytime for rob to come out and say \\"TUUUUUURRRRRNNNN ME ON YEEEEAAAAAAHHHHH! \\" That and the whole album isn't what the doctor ordered either. His voice sounds like Zombie also and the high pitched one sounds the same only it sounds like vocal effects from the studio were used in the camoflauge."},{"rating":"1","title":"eh, i'm more a slipknot kind of guy...","review":"Like the title says, i'm more into slipknot's innovative style of music with their many musicians in the band. This is too soft for me. And I don't like how they repeate their lyrics a lot. they need to have more variety in their songs. For instance, the beginning of \\"Down\\" he repeats one word 3 times, then a phrase 3 times, then the main chorus phrase 3 times, then another word 3 times... its all just too simple, not much thought into their songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD!","review":"This CD is so Bad! Stastic-X is so horrible! They just rip off everything that is out there now! That isn't that bad of a thing, but they just do it so bad. In the song \\"so real\\" he says only 5 different songs. The songs make no sense, and they just stink! I haven't heard a worse CD than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hardest album I own","review":"I say this because it's true. Static-X is VERY hard, and sometimes this can just cut into your brain and make you go crazy. But, unlike such super-hard groups such as Slipknot, this album doesn't give you the migraine of a lifetime. Each song has a message, and it's not about killing your friends or parents. Actually, I don't believe that they tell you to do ANYTHING in this album, Wayne just wrote some songs out and they put some cool music to them. I like this cd so much, I even took the time to figure out (with the help of the cd cover with the words in it) the lyrics to the songs AND be able to sing along with Wayne. Ken lays down some killer drum beats in some of the songs. Altogether, this album is great. Although some of the later songs seem a little like the songs at the beginning in sound, they are totally different in substance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Next up and comming band!!!","review":"Wisconsin Death Trip is an unbelievably good album. Static-X has a techno-grind sound similar to White Zombie. If you are into loud, ear catching beats...buy Wisconsin Death Trip. Get up on this Wisconsin Death Trip!

It's not bad, but it's nothing special either."},{"rating":"2","title":"band of the last 10,000 years","review":"Static X's new album is like a hard core WhiteZombie.

Nope!","review":"When I saw MTV play \\"Push It\\" by Static-X on Spankin' New Music, I was impressed. So I bought the CD. Sadly, the whole thing is utter drool. The guitars sound like static indeed. The lyrics are pointless. Is it my imagination, or are these guys trying to fuse the great and timeless Fear Factory with stupid posers like Pantera and Limp Bizkit. If so, than it's a weak combo. As for the vocalist's(not singer) major problems, here is some advice, go tell someone who cares!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Snap into a slim jim","review":"After hearing the song \\"Push it\\" I thought Static X sounds like a pretty good new band, with a sound kind of like Rob Zombie's solo LP. After listening to W.D.T. at my friend's house I realized every song has only one riff played over and over. The lyrics are just plain dumb. If you want to hear some real hard core music try Acid Bath or Clutch. At least those two bands have talent and are original."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT Debut","review":"This CD is undoubtedely one of the BEST Techno-Rock genre groups that I have EVER heard.

I admit that they have talent, but most of the songs are dull. The first line of \\"Bled For Days\\" perfectly describes it: \\"Meaningless, it's meaningless.\\" A few rockers, but mostly boring industrial metal. If you like bands like KoRn and Slipknot for their energy, you probably won't like this band because they don't seem to have much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good Indus-metal Band","review":"This is not a nu-metal crap album. Even if it's cool to get this one, because of radio or MTV or whatever, this CD is really good. I listen to a lot of Industrial-metal bands, I mean bands like Ministry, Godflesh, Prong, White zombie, Pitch Shifter (pre-'dot com' album), and not techno-pop combos like Dope, Orgy, Pitchshifter (post-'dot com' album) or Powerman 5000 (far better before their last album). And I must admit that this one is not bad at all, on the contrary. This remind me a lot of what did Prong (what a fantastic band), mixed with White Zombie ('Astro Creep'-era). It's not too catchy, and the voice can be really aggressive, I like it a lot. It's not on the same level as some masters as Godflesh or Ministry, but for a first shot... impressive. I hope only that they won't turn to more mainstream and less original, as bands like Fear Factory (I'm sad) or Pitch Shifter (it's a shame to wayste such a talent)."},{"rating":"1","title":"not as good as i wanted it to be","review":"I saw staic-x open up for fear factory a while back. they were pretty good i met the singer and bhought a 3-song demo itwas great.

Goldrei's book is by far the best on my list. Goldrei has the talent of presenting a fairly difficult and abstract material in a friendly style, with abundant explanations, solved exercises, illustrations, and illuminating comments. I can highly recommend this book as a first reading on set theory, whether for self-study or as a supplementary text for a course on the subject. For the interested readers of this review, here is how I rank some of the other books I've read: Stoll is definitely a second, then Suppes (which goes deeper than both Goldrei and Stoll, but in my opinion is poorly organized and suffers from nonstandard and funny-looking notations), followed by Halmos, Machover, and a few more.

Otherwise, every other selection is a joy to behold. Suprisingly, \\"Mean Mistreater\\" is even better than the original! The coda at the end of \\"Mean Mistreater\\" takes the classic in a whole new direction. If only there could have been a version of \\"Inside Looking Out\\"! Great cd and a load of fun all around!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"magnificent Celtic music!!","review":"Though I have listened to quite a bit of Celtic music and really love bagpipes, this introduction to \\"The Legacy of Turlough O'Carolan\\" has captivated my entire being. There are melodies which have me up on my feet dancing to the tune of quiet waltzes (Si Bheag, Si Mhor by William Coulter; Captain O'Kane by Seamus McGuire) or either attempting some type of jig! My all time favorite is \\"Lord Inchiquin\\" performed by Deiseal. This is a fascinating and fun piece of music that transports me back to the 17th century to join others in a spirited dance at some outdoor festival! Marvelous!! Additionally, the biography supplied giving details of O'Carolan's life is inspiring considering what would seem like an insurmountable physical limitation - blindness! Buy a copy of this CD! Enjoy!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Soothing Celtic music","review":"Some of these songs will bring tears to your eyes.

There are a few issues that I have, like some of the other reviews, is that the blue part comes apart easily and it's very annoying having to keep putting it back together over and over again. The music also gets annoying after a while but the off button is a nice option to have. The blocks fit nicely into the wheels of the truck which keeps them from losing. Overall, it's an OK truck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great toy for a little kid","review":"My son received this when he was about 9 months old and loved it.

He has been fascinated with it since he was about 3 months old. Something about the noise it makes and the fun of watching the blocks dump out of the back of the truck.By the time he was about 5 months old he could rip the whole thing apart (take the bed off the truck as well as pull the cover off the bed) but it only comes off into 3 big pieces so nothing is dangerous. Now that he's teething he actually enjoys chewing on the pieces once he's pulled them apart!I would definitely recommend this. The only toy that he likes better than this is the Peek a Blocks Train. I didn't see it on this website, but you can buy it at most any store.

Your first mission is to fly though magical rings. The Story is even worse, you have to save random civilians using various powers. The levels keep jumping, so your never in the same place.The multiplayer was kinda fun, but it gets dull fast.

And fourth, Superman flying through RINGS! The character you control might look like the big 'S', but he ain't no Superman. I mean, I can understand how in the game, he might need a health bar, but I would have like for him to at least take a few hits without dying. And what's with the fog? Why's he in a virtual world?

I don't know much beyond that because I got bored, tossed the game aside and moved on to a better one.Considering an awesome game like Angry Birds is $.99, I'd say that the cost/fun ratio of Superman is pretty poor and extremely expensive at about $1.99-2.99 + shipping.

The actual score I give Superman 64 on a scale of 1 to 5 is -12. See if you can find anyone who disagrees...Ehh, changed my mind... I'll show the game's score... wouldn't want anyone to think I actually liked this thing...(You know what, I get tired of people thinking I actually LIKE this thing, so I change the star rating to give it the score it deserves...)"},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't even play this game.","review":"I didn't even play this game and I don't own an N64, but because there are so many bad reviews I will just give this game another bad review so people won't buy it since it's supposed to be the WORST GAME EVER."},{"rating":"1","title":"Titus Ruined My Life","review":"My friend's birthday was coming up and since he liked the Nintendo 64 and Superman I figured this would have made a nice gag gift. I was wrong. He never knew about the dreaded Superman 64 and decided to play it hoping it was going to be better than sex,money, and booze COMBINED. He couldn't get past those rings in the very first stage and in a fit of rage he attacked his mother and bit the dog. The psychiatrist deemed him clinically insane. He vowed that once he was out of the mental institution,he would come after me. I now live the rest of my life in fear because I made the fatal mistake of purchasing Superman 64 for only 1 CENT."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish this game was better","review":"I thought in this game you fly around ,punch bad guys and save people but it dues not seem that way beacause on level 1 you have to fly through rings. Man it sucks that you have through rings! And also theres another reason why I gave this game 1 star. The graphics on this game are bad but of course nitendo 64 games have bad graphics but this real bad graphics. Also on level 1 you can hardly see where your going beacause of the fog. If I were you I would not get this game but if you just collect superman games that fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Video Game Ever!","review":"I got this game from the flea market. I got home, I played it and I can't believe how bad this game is! The graphic is horrible, the controls are awkward and the music in the menu doesn't have the Superman theme song! First off, you fly through sooooo many rings, after the rings, you do a task. After the task, you fly through MORE RINGS! After more rings, there is ANOTHER TASK!! The one task I couldn't complete is saving people from a tornado, so I just gave up. This game is really BAD, its the worst game I have ever played in my entire life!! Its bad as ET on the Atari 2600. I would NEVER recommend this game to anybody at all. If your a hardcore video game collector, stay away from this game! Pick a different one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I am a huge Superman fan. I prefer Batman,but I like Supes. Coming from a Superman fan....THIS SUCKS.","review":"Im actually 34 years old.

The graphics are so 1970s and clunky that I could barely stand to look at the game. Get Batman Begins instead. I hope the Superman Returns game in 2006 is better than this cheaply made game.

The sound is not exacly a sound it's more like screams of horrible pain. In general gamespot is right, my cus' is right, hell my teacher is right. This game sucks.

I got it since I am a Superhero fan, but trust me, even if you are a diehard fan of Superman, resist the urge to purchase this game or trade for it or even accept it for free!!!!! This is one of those noway games that should be thrown in the microwave and have the molecules in it to be melted for good.When i first turned the game on, the people in the first level looked like an oil painting. And it is nearly impossible to fly through those rings!!! Miss one ring and words show up that say,\\"Lex wins\\" and you hear a really bad reproduction of baldy's laugh.I put two stars for this being a fun game because it is so much fun to laugh at!!!

IT IS A DISGRACE TO INTELLIGENT BEINGS EVERYWHERE! MAKIND SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF ITS POOR ABILITY TO CREATE GAMES! IT IS UTTERLY POINTLESS! IT MAKES SOUTH PARK LOOK LIKE SHAKESPEARE!

I'd rather play the equally horrible Superman Man of Steel game from XBOX. At least it looks presentable.They couldnt even get decent graphics on this game. Superman dying from an ordinary bullet? PURE UTTER CRAP.I asked my dad to throw away my N64 after this game. That game was the tuning point for me. I no longer play N64. In fact,I only play the original playstation for their Crash Bandicoot games. If you want a good superhero game get x men legends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this game","review":"If flying through rings with bad handling and a time limit is fun then buy this game. All you do is fly through rings and fight enemies on a time limit and with special abilites you have to find with limited amounts. It would be fun to fly around and cruise the city but with the time limit you would run out before you get anywhere. Even if this game was a buck it's so bad it couldn't even be a novelty. People who know this game might even make fun of you. Anyways I don't think there will ever be a good superman game it's sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate it!","review":"This game is laughable. It has bad graphics even for a N64 game and it's the most boring game ever. Gamespot gave this game an abmysal 1.4, possibly the worst score they ever gave for a videigame.

It was the worst game ever!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book about the Heroes of our Country during WWII","review":"This is a must read for anyone interested in the Medal of Honor or those brave men who won it. The accounts of how a great many of these men won these medals are riviting. A complete list of all the men that received the Medal during WWII is included at that end of the book. In many cases the book lets you know what happened to those men who went home after the war. In many cases its a tragic end. The book also lets you know who survied the war to go home with their Medal.

The instructions are pretty horrid and the diagrams simply do not help at all. The wood is of decent quality but it will need another coat of stain and sealant.With those two caveats out of the way, now to the good stuff. The chairs fold nicely, feel very sturdy once put together and look great. The company sent some nice followup emails so I get the sense that they do care and do listen to their customers (as I didn't have any real issues I can only give my impression).So if you are looking for a good looking outdoor chair that isn't expensive, this is a real find."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great chairs!","review":"We've just assembled one, but we're already impressed with the quality for the price.

If you buy this chair beware of the finish."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Fillers On This Compilation","review":"Some More Swedish funk from Gothenburg. This time a little more variety than volume one. Most of the music is Luke Eargoggle and Rutherford under numerous aliases each with a different style ranging from cold dark electro to italo-disco. This actually makes for a fun listening experience trying to figure out whos behind what guise.Once again all of these tracks are from limited edition vynl,or unreleased. When listening to much of the contemporary music in clubs today, it is a nice treat to get in my car or go home and hear music like this which is far more superior in emotion and replay value. The anlogue synthesizers, the vocoder, and just plain hard basslines are all here. If you have not heard of Stilleben records get this as well as anything from Bunker records.Either you will be too slow too understand this music when you hear it or you will be instantly hooked and throw away all of the contemporary and electroclash garbage you were forced to listen to."},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting combination of unique songs","review":"This CD was what introduced me to the entire New Age genre of music. It's variety of artists provides you with a broad scope of different styles ranging from piano solos to tribal rhythms. But I must comment on the very last song, The Earth Tribe, by Nando Lauria. It is probably one of the most beautiful songs I have ever heard in my life and I often listen to it, loving it for its strength and its powerful vocals and rhythms that express emotion in a way that just grabs you by the heart. I would even dare to say that it is one of the best songs on the CD and one of the best I've run into while listening to New Age. The CD is worth trying because its variety of styles will probably please many different tastes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Discovering a New Beauty of Music!!","review":"What a wonderful musical experience! The works of R. Strauss and Ravel played here may not be very popular but you will be mesmerized by their beauty, depth, and \\"freshness\\". All are excellent but my favorite is Ravel's piano concerto in G. Especially, 2nd movement brings such peace and gentle joy. The rendition of the pianist is precise and musical. The young conductor Vladimir Jurowski seems to be very good at expressing subtle nuance and inner detail of each work. Technically, both video and audio quality is at top notch.

The federal government should investigate this place. It is horrible that they would engage in this type of business whether they are giving refunds or not.

This CD presents Andean music and musical instruments in a contemporary presentation. The CD even has a bit of country music flavor on several songs for those who like that venue. For a person who wants to experience Andean Music this CD provides nice variety and insight what contemporary Andean Music is like. For the person who has CD's on Andean Music, I feel, ANDEAN LEGACY would be a nice enhancement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Excellent","review":"I find this CD to be very relaxing and inspiring.

The model is very heavy, the wings feel flimsy (I know heavy and flismy in the same sentence sounds like contradictions, but see one, and you will know what I trying to say here). This is the first lego starwars model I have felt the need to glue together. It looks great, just feels overheavy in all the wrong places, and light in all the wrong places. Also, I hate adding decals to legos. That was the whole point of the silk screened pieces, no decals. My recomendation, look at one carefully, and talk to someone who as built it before investing. It's a very expensive model for all it's flaws."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny and Funnier","review":"Dave Barry really fulfills the position of funniest man in America with this book; he makes every line something to laugh about.

Don't get me wrong there still are plenty of booger jokes that everyone has come to know and love from Mr. Barry. The book covers many interesting topics like; Exploding animals and other assorted things, dogs, and buying cars.

He's almost funny in an amateurish-comedian sort of way.What Mike is more interested in than \\"truth\\" is fame and some form of entertainment contract. He vies to be the next \\"Limbaugh\\" or \\"Coulter\\", but sadly, lacks the wit, charisma, or the insight to the issues that these others have, or had.Which is why, of course, so few people have heard of or read his virtually \\"self-published\\" ego book.Mike Adams is not very funny.

I've tried making meatloaf and breads in them, and they always stick to the pan even when I heavily crisco or crisco/flour the sides and bottom.The pans are also smaller than my other 9x5 pans so they tend to overflow with bread recipes created for a standard bread pan.I like the fact they are aluminum and feel sturdy and they don't overcook my breads like a lot of metal pans have in the past, but I'm going to be looking for something different that doesn't destroy the sides and bottom of everything I make and can take being sprayed with PAM and not destroy the pan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great bread pan","review":"If you want a bread pan that allows bread to come out easliy, this is the one you need.

My previous model was made more poorly (cheap plastic parts, especially the water tank) and gave up the ghost after about two years of occasional use. I bought a new one expecting comparable performance. This machine has been re-engineered in some positive ways (sturdier water tank, easier to clean the intake area) but it totally lacks the suction necessary to get the water & soap out of the carpet. It seems like a waste of time and energy to scrub the carpet just to leave it soaking wet with dirty, soapy water. Plus, mold can easily grow within in the 2-3 days it takes to dry completely. I've talked to Bissell customer service about the inadequate suction; they told me the gaskets need a while to \\"settle in,\\" but I've had it for several months and multiple uses now with no improvement. Needs major improvement!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great ! ! !","review":"This cleaner did an incredible job on my carpets. My carpets looked so bad that I was sure I would have to completely replace with new carpet. After researching different products and reading the good reviews on this cleaner, I decided to order it and give it a try, I'm so glad I did!!! It worked great and my carpets look fantastic. Old stubborn stains are gone, and heavy traffic areas look great. The carpets look new again. I Highly recommend this cleaner."},{"rating":"1","title":"When it works, it's good.","review":"I bought this thing because of the over all good ratings. Sadly, it was nothing but a tease.I'm on my second one in less than a year and it's currently broke. The first one broke after a month of lite use. I used it for spot cleaning after an aging cat. The first time the thing stopped spraing, so I sent it back. Now with my second one, guess what has happened. No water comes out the hose or the bottom. It sometimes will spray for about 4 seconds. I've tried priming the pump, unplugging it, everything.I rarely take the time to warn people away from a product. I'm usually the sort that is very forgiving about a products flaws, but this is my SECOND one that has broke in the exact same way. Coincidence? Or a shoddy product?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dirty Water Drips Back Onto Carpet","review":"Even though I cleaned the machine between each empty and fill, if I did not have white carpet I would not have known this machine leaks the dirty water back onto the carpet. I had to shampoo the carpet two more times to remove the extra spots left in the carpet. A second time with detergent to remove the spots and then immediately with a rinse only cycle. My second gripe is the clean and dirty water reservoirs are in the same small space. I had to change it out about every 10 minutes. The machine gets one star for the dual brushes which I think are a positive for this machine. Unfortunately, that was not enough for me to keep it. It would have been cheaper for me to hire someone to come in and steam clean my carpet considering the fact I had to clean it three times and this carpet is in a low traffic area. I've had a Hoover for 8-10 years and will look to see what new machines Hoover has on the market."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed to say the least!!!","review":"I have read the reviews of others who have just purchased this carpet cleaner. I raved about mine and recommended it to everyone after using it the first time. However, now that I have owned it for a year, used it a few times, I would not recommend it to a soul. Here's why: 1) the water dispensing mechanism is in the handle and is controlled by a weak little spring and a cheaply crafted plasic bar. After using the machine a few times, the mechanism becomes weak and stops working. 2) Though it does have a \\"Proheat\\" title, it is a \\"No-Heat\\" system. The water never gets any hotter than the tap water you used to fill the tank. Without water and heat, it's pretty hard to clean anything! 3)The whole thing is put together with screws, so cleaning hair and dirt out of it is impossible. I would recommend a Hoover. One model has a two year warranty and is $100 cheaper. I am not happy with this purchase and I paid $250 for mine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"Carpet cleaner did an excellent job. Dried within a few hours.

Within the first 90 days of purchase, we had to twice replace the unit. The current one is rarely used and when I pulled it out to use it today, I ended up with it dispensing all of the soap in a very little area. Now my carpets are soapy and I will have to rent a professional cleaner to extract the many ounces of soap that are now in a less than 3 foot area of carpet.Had this machine been heavily used, I would be more forgiving but the fact of the matter is that I've never used to for extensive or heavy cleaning. I have cleaned at most 5 rooms with it before this incident. I will be buying another brand in the future.

I am now on the second Bissell and although it works marginally after about 6 uses, it doesn't really extract the water from the Berber carpet very well, so I am left with very wet carpets that have dirty water left in them.

I called and was told to bring it in for a repair estimate. After driving to Seabrook, Seacoast told me it wouldn't repair my unit because Bissell did not reimburse them enough to cover the time needed to repair the unit.

It cleans great at first. The problem is the way the water reservoir fits back on. It's kind of a pain to get it to go down on so that it suctions up the water. If you don't get it down just right it'll just leave the water on the carpet, so now you have a stain that is merely watered down and spread over the area instead of gone. At this point, the water reservoir doesn't stay locked in place. It just doesn't suction up the water anymore. I've only had this thing a couple years--it should have lasted a lot longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bissell ProHeat 2X","review":"This machine is terrible.

My ecru colored carpet which was dirty from usual wear and tear from my family and dogs cleaned up pretty good the first few times I bought this cleaner in November of 2007. I was very happy with it initially. Then it began to leak cleaning solution and the water would not come out to rinse the soap from the carpet. Here I am almost a year later, and the thing turns on, heats water, and does nothing else. no water,no soap,no suction. The cost of repair exceed the cost of the machine ( in money and hassle) and I am very disappointed in this cleaner.I expected at least 3 years of use from it.

In its manual, it cautions against using it on a Berber carpet. The manual said nothing about any possible damage to a Frieze carpet. When I called Bissell to report the damage, the first person was unable to give me any answers. When Corporate called me, they left a message stating that they would look into the matter, but I should have known better to use their carpet cleaner on my carpet.

I certainly did not get my $200.00 worth out of it for the relatively few times I've used it.

One day he tried to use it and no water would come out!! We had only used it probably less than 6 times! We are not very happy. Not sure if we will buy another if we cannot get it to work or just keep using my mom's. I have mixed feelings about it.

The bladder is the part that you put the hot water in and when I did my carpets fuzz or lint that came off my carpet went into the bladder.

Soap water dries up inside, and blocks water from spraying. The heater is nothing much to wrote home either.So after being a $100 lighter, I learnt that after using this cleaner, I should spray out all the water (without soap), and store it in a perfectly clean condition.

I also got a large amount of dog hair out the first time and the machine was not capable of picking up the clumps of hair, but it did isolate them so that I could pick them up and get rid of them.

I read these reviews before I bought it and saw the majority loved it. Should have gone with the minority opinion... Bought a Hoover and am very happy with it.

The Elctric motor is supposed to turn the brushes to create a power brush clean, but quits working shortly after you use the machine a few times. It does not last.

I was so excited to save enough money and find a sale so I could own a Bissell. A friend of mine had an old one and his worked great. And so did mine for the first few times I used it. But, the pump started to work only intermittedly and just after the warrantee expired, the beater brushes stopped working. Sometimes the hand tool would spray and sometimes it wouldn't. I have a friend who owns a repair shop who looked at it. He said the new models were made using plastic parts and they break easy. He said the motor that ran the beater bars no longer worked. I have been trying to use the cleaner without the beater bars, but with the intermittent pump, it's just frustrating at best. My daughter bought the same machine and hers did the same thing.

I do have to change the water frequently but it's made to be lightweight. I can live with that. It cleaned our vinly flooring very well but I don't like \\"mopping\\" with a cord.

This would be a good book for people who see cooking as a hobby: something they do occasionally, for fun, without worrying about time, convenience, health or expense. For everyday cooking, it's pretty much useless. The recipes are all quite time-consuming and complicated, requiring, for instance, special stock which must be homemade and for which store-bought substitutes would be unacceptable. Lots of the recipes are heavy on the butter and cream, which is fine for special occasions but not the way I want to cook on a regular basis.I would recommend this book to anyone looking for special-occasion recipes. Everything I've cooked out of it has turned out great, and I would definately consult it for dinner parties or similar occasions.

Generally, everything has been very appetizing and delicious. The recipes are sometimes complicated, but I like to cook, so it's generally fun and educational for me to try them. Because the recipes are so original, I often get inspiration later on for simpler versions I can make on weekdays. Many of the recipes are quite easy. The spinach soup with curry spices for example.

References are made to the horrors and trauma of war suffered by former Japanese soldiers. It also describes the wide discrepancy between different groups of people as they hold onto wealth and status, or madly scramble to grab them. We also see glimpses of black market and yakuza life styles. The murders are creepy and disturbing, and the psycho-sexual world of tattoo customers is nicely underlined.

Having a traditional Japanese tattoo myself I was most impressed with the treatment of the art in relation to the trials of living with the artwork,and those who seek to posses it. The way the story does not rely on the tattoos to be the entire focus of the book is refreshing. The moral and ethical questions raised by the pursuit of these tattoos is hardly touched on,but this is a murder mystery not a book about ethics. As far as the mystery goes it is very well thought out and intelligent. You get to know the characters without too much guesswork and they do not have as rough a diologue as you would first assume.(this is in reference to the strict translation that is offered)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good story, Kindle edition full of errors","review":"A very clever and entertaining thriller. This would have been a four-star review, except that the Kindle edition has literally more than one error per page.

However, if you want to blend in and maybe even expatriate, then as the title said, this book is so completely out of touch with the Brazilian people, it's pathetic.The prices are all in USD, which doesn't make sense, because everything is changing, especially the exchange rates. The coverage of Sao Paulo was pathetically small, maybe 30 pages for the second largest city in the world, hardly enough.In short, if you are backpacker, leave this 400 page tome at home in favor of another, lighter and more appropriate book that you pick up in the region you are planning to hang about in."},{"rating":"1","title":"not so great...","review":"I am usually very satisfied with the Lonely Planet books on travel, however I found that the prices in the Brazil book were inaccurate.

The Brazil book was great in that it helped me navigate through different cities in Brazil, and it offered great recommendations on where to go and what to see. The issue that I had was once I got to places like Sugar Loaf and Christ the Redeemer the prices were much more than what the book had said they were. The food is rather expensive in Sao Paulo and Rio De Janeiro, which the book did not indicate. Overall, I was less than satisfied with the information provided."},{"rating":"1","title":"Parts of it are out of date","review":"OK in general but so are other travel guides. What matters most in a travel guide is that it is accurate and up-to-date. It appears the Porto Velho section has not been updated for years - hotel prices have gone up 50-100% (seriously, the $35 rooms now cost $70 in the Tia Carmem) and Internet caf��s have disappeared! This is unacceptable for a product sold with a 2010 publishing date. If I had known the city was twice as expensive as I thought I probably wouldn't have bothered sticking with my travel plans through a 60-hour flight delay...Second the comment on Quatro Rodas - it's just over 10 pounds for quality, up-to-date information."},{"rating":"1","title":"Atrocious accommodation recommendations, wrong maps, and more","review":"I cannot possibly agree more with an earlier review suggesting that the book's coverage was horrendous - though the problems don't stop there. Maps are not really accurate (hence will cost you much unnecessary walking), recommended pousadas are overcharged student hostels with rooms scantly larger than Japanese 'coffin beds', and 'safety advices' aren't really reliable (be sure to find in the next edition a line like 'with the World Cup and the Olympics coming up soon, however, all these are bound to change as the government is determined to clean up blah blah blah'). Mightily disappointed by an LP for once."},{"rating":"1","title":"Out of date, prices are 59% higher","review":"There is no rating of sights and telling me what to skip if I have only one day to spend in a place, which makes this book hard to use. Practical information is out of date."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really out of date","review":"We went to Rio using this book and were very disappointed. While the background information in the books is helpful, the book is very out of date, and often inaccurate. In particular:1) Most of the restaurants recommended that we tried to go to were closed down. Those that we found were not as good as the review suggested.2) Maps are small, hard to read, and often inaccurate, placing locations on the wrong block, or leaving off crucial information, such as there are buildings blocking routes through neighborhoods. This often caused us to have to backtrack quite a distance to get where we were going.3) There was not much useful information about Ilhe Grande."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best on the Topic","review":"This is an excellent text, functioning as a summary of international research on a mostly ignored topic. The researchers clearly were interested in focusing on science rather than political polemics. If you're a researcher, a psychologist, a law enforcement agent or policy maker, this text should be in your library. Definitely worth the cost."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing guitar!","review":"Lots of guitar virtuosos have a problem with writing actual songs.

Also the chapter on avioding blunders is laughable. Basically it states that before mAKING YOUR move you should look at the board through the eyes of a patzer and if your move is the same as the one the patzer would make then think of another move. So if you already wiped your ass today, you won't have any use for this book. Look elsewhere!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Case","review":"I bought this case to replace my wife's crappy case. This is a perfect case. It's a hard plastic shell and the interior is very soft. The latches are incredibly easy to use and it keeps the guitar solid so it doesn't move around. The guitar it's protecting is an Ibanez GSR 200."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great rugged case","review":"SKB cases rock. They're durable and they don't weigh a ton.

Well, Abe's Oddysee is one of my favorite video/computer games (I have the PC versions.), probaly just second too Exoddus. The film clips are very good, and funny, all of the creatures are good. And what I like, is that it isn't just one of those shoot-em'-up games, where you just see how many people you can shoot. Acctually in this, you see how many people (mudokons acctually) you can SAVE. Well, yes you do kill some things, but you have to figure out how best to do it, you usally use the creatures against each other. If you don't have Oddysee yet, you should get it, it is very cool. Then get Exoddus!"},{"rating":"1","title":"fustrating","review":"If you like games were you have to do everything over and over a thousand times before proceeding to the next area just to do that a thousand times more than this game is for you.

The controls are easy however and the game can be amusing and addictive at times but I certainly would not consider it very fun to play."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible game!!!","review":"Oddworld Abe's Oddysee is the most overrated game on the PS1! Let me tell you why it's so bad. For starters, it's main selling-point is humor, and this ''humor'' is mostly made out of repetitive and boring fart jokes. Second...it's insainly dificult! You can't fight back. So this means you have to run away every time a bad guy sees you. The frustation doubles when you consider that you die after getting shot once. To top it all off the story is supposed to make you root for Abe. (the main character) But do you? NO!! Because he's extremly stupid and unlikable like the rest of his race! (Abe is trying to save them from becomeing food.) I say they deserve it. this is a bad game folks, very bad. Oh...and the voice overs are bad to."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS IS THE BEST PUZZLE GAME EVER!","review":"If you like games like Tomb Raider and or Lemmings, you won't be able to walk away from this game. Though the plot is a bit dark the game is funny as heck.I spent hours playing this game (then i had to return it) so i bought it:). Abe's oddysee is probably one of the hardest problem solving games ever. And the controls are very easy to learn. You really got to buy this game.Though the game is in 2-d the screen changing graphics are spectacular! And the movies run extremely smooth. But dont buy this game if you arent willing to get addicted!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Blast From the Past!","review":"I was thinking a lot about this game, I had played it at my brothers house a long time ago and wanted to get it. No one carried it in the stores around me so I checked her on Amazon.com. I found it at a great price and used and when it came it was in good condition with the case and book inside. I am pleased and enjoy it when I have time to play. This game makes me smile and the endless journeys are fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Really Flamenco","review":"If you are new to the sound of Flamenco, this is a gentle introduction, fused with the modern sounds of jazz and predictable 4 beat rhythms. It would be more appropriate to call it a jazz fusion with a dusting of flamenco. Calling this album FLAMENCO does a great disservice to what is really flamenco-driving, complicated comp��s, complicated remates, wrenching lyrics and just guitar, caj��n, (maybe flute) palmas, cante and footwork. If you're looking for real Flamenco-IT'S NOT HERE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"other albums are better","review":"I liked only 7 songs out of 12 on this one. Tomatito and Jesse Cook could be found on better collections though. Again, tapping, clapping, congos, and the like.

But my mother-in-law left a copy of The Cat Who Knew a Cardinal here after her last visit, and I picked it up to glance at it and the next thing I knew, I was on the fourth chapter. These stories aren't just mystery novels, in fact, I wouldn't care if there were no mystery at all - the characters (including the cats, of course!) and the scenarios are just endearing, and I want to read more of these stories just so I can be back in Qwilleran's world."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Cat Who Knew a Cardinal","review":"I had most of the Cat Who books and wanted the full collection.

The reason is simple, Quill comes off as such a total jerk. If the main character comes off as unlikeable it's hard to much care about what happens. I will give one example of what I am talking about. In this book there is a sucicide. This man just walks out on his wife and child to live in Pickaxe for no reason what so ever. { All this is set up in The Cat Who.. Talked to Ghosts} When his wife lets him know she will not take him back he kills himself and Quill makes the wife into a heel as if this mans own actions had nothing to do with the situation. It was at that point I stopped reading. For some I am sure this would be perfectly fine but it stuck in my craw. But of the first 14 books in the series this is the only one I would not recomend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Always a Good Buy","review":"I have always gotten very acceptable products from Amazon.

But somehow they do not have their emotional and musical pull in this format. I am not quite sure why. Whether it is the modest production values or some of the less-than-powerful or song-appropriate voices, the emotional power just does not come across. Note the versions of \\"Some Enchanted Evening\\" and \\"If I loved You.\\" Still, as other reviewers have noted, there are some good moments. Namely the version of \\"Sixteen Going on Seventeen\\" with Judi Dench. Melodious and funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"A real stinker","review":"Oy, what a disappointment. Very poor recording quality of this live performance -- sounds like someone on the front row recorded it with an old cassette tape pocket device. The Judi Dench number (\\"Sixteen Going On Seventeen\\") is a hoot, and there's a pretty colorful number from Oklahoma (\\"Kansas City\\"), but they can't compensate for the rest of this very sub-par project.

I tried everything but could not get it to be stable enough. The bottom portion of your DVD player wasn't really held up with anything except for the middle velco strap. Not reliable enough to put in the back seat of a car where your precious lil ones sit.All in all, the case is a great case if you only need it for carrying your DVD players around; otherwise, I would stay clear of this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good CD","review":"Really Enjoy this CD every time I listen to it.

We can't even \\"look inside,\\" as we can with ordinary Amazon offerings.Given any kind of discretion at all, like not copying the title page, one could probably get this book for half price by Xeroxing it at a library.

Instead of the standard car chases, the director substituted foot races through Paris buildings and the Metro. This was a novel idea and definitely holds your attention.The best part of the film is at the end when our hero, who is wanted by the police and the police intend to shoot-to-kill, has to break into the crowded police station and escape with his pregnant wife.How in the hell does he do that when his face is on every poster, on every floor?Yeah, that's worth the price of the film."},{"rating":"2","title":"outstanding action drama","review":"This is an outstanding action drama with almost non-stop action and excellent story development. Gilles Lellouche is outstanding in the lead role."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice flow.","review":"You can tell that the writer and director spent a fair amount of time on details which to me is an accurate indicator of quality. The storyline of an inadvertent citizen being drawn into a bit of criminal and police conspiracy intrigue has been done before but this film had enough twists to that story that it was still engaging. It had a nice flow to the action - not excessive and overly stereotypic in the chase scenes. Acting was passably OK but kudos to the cinematography to keep the whole experience feel really close to the viewer. A few parts seemed a bit too unlikely but not excessively so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Action Movie in a non American way","review":"I thought this was a very good action movie and a nice surprise for a genre that can be over commercial and dull.

This was not it."},{"rating":"2","title":"My son does not like it..","review":"My yougn son has no interest in the book at all. My older one does because he can read it himself, but my 2 year old wants nothing to do with it. I believe it's because the pictures are out of focus, and not very pretty looking.

I sent it back. I really, really, really admire what the author was trying to do and I am still nursing my toddler so you can imagine that I'm right there with her in wanting more materials for families like ours. It was just poor quality, to be honest. The pictures were all of the same mom and baby nursing in different places, or with psychedelic backgrounds around them that were choppily photoshopped in. The last page, supposed to be a mirror, was first of all wrinkled permanently, and secondly, about as reflective as a spoon. Also, the photos themselves were not very artful or tasteful, and the one of them nursing in the tub made me uncomfortable. I felt it should be a family photo album instead. I am so sorry that a real publisher wasn't given the opportunity to or wouldn't publish this book to a higher standard."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is wonderfully appealing!","review":"I just gave this book to my son for his second birthday (he still nurses quite frequently).

Good Luck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"For fans","review":"I love Berlin - and have done since I heard No More Words when it was first released.I love Terri Nunn - she is STILL sexy, and has a great rock voice.The quality of this DVD, however, is APPALLING!Playing in DTS doesn't make the slightest of difference. The mixing sounds like its been done by an amateur, and the video looks like its been shot on a series of home video cameras.I have many music DVD's, and honestly, this is the worst quality in my collection - lucky I'm a fan otherwise I would send it back!Another annoying thing is they seem to have resorted to a technique a lot of older music videos used - an interview between tracks. The beauty of a DVD is you can skip to menus and sub-menus to CHOOSE what you want to watch. Mind you, Terri's words were quite interesting,, but not in the middle of the songs PLEASE!Overall, the production of this DVD is AMATEURISH at best. Very, very unfortunate as Terri Nunn and Berlin are a great band this DVD does not do them justice AT ALL!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great live show will= great live DVD...","review":"The shows rock harder than you assume a band known for \\"80s snyth pop\\" would. Terri's voice live is incredible and is an underrated singer. I was literally dragged to the show,expecting to see a washed up band. What I got was a band that sounded potent and current, with Terri putting on a show with unbelievable energy and charisma, who looks like she was cyrogenically frozen in 1988 and released yesterday. Go to the show if you don't believe me. The DVD is going to be \\"Storytellers\\" style, and doing some of the songs acoustic (it actually works) with the original members."},{"rating":"1","title":"BH Maxwell","review":"Is this a vanity publication?Of course, only Mr. Maxwell would give this book 5 stars! (not to mention complain in his own review about bad reviews- that's the price of a bad book- bad reviews)I really tried to get my money back- being a poorly written book wasn't reason enough for a refund... So I threw this book in the garbage.PLEASEDO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I want my money back","review":"I was looking forward to read the book since the subject matter is very interesting to me. Sadly, the author (Fredric Alan Maxwell ) sounded way too bitter and way too biased.After reading the book I had these questions: Did the author proof read his book? The author did not even know how to spell Bellevue, WA in his book. Did he just do a search on the Internet and selected what appealed to him? Why is the author very bitter?My suggestion to the author:- Try to present facts and have the reader come up with the conclusion wither Steve Ballmer is a 'Bad Boy' or not!!!- Try to sound a little less bitter. That would sell more books!!!If you just want anti Microsoft material, just read it off the net and don't waste your money on the book!!! I feel I wasted my time and money on this book :-("},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Book, Maxwell","review":"This is a slickly written, but ultimately empty book. The tone is more than a little paranoid. Mr. Ballmer is a businessman, successful and associated with Bill Gates. Therefore, there must be something evil about him. But what that is never gets stated. He curses, he knows Bill Gates. These are the principal charges leveled against him. The glib writing style can make you forget, for a while, that little is actually being said, and none of it is new. But, like most fluff, it doesn't stay with you once you're done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ballmer and Gates make a perfect combination","review":"When the name Microsoft is brought up, Bill Gates comes to mind, but few realize how important Steve Ballmer is to Microsoft's success. Ballmer is the current CEO, and he makes things happen at Microsoft. He has passion and truly loves his work. The author writes that the Ballmer's truly extraordinary accomplishment is putting up with Bill Gates because Microsoft's co-founder Paul Allen could not. Gates and Ballmer took the company from 30 to 50,000 employees. They make a perfect combination because Gates is the tech guy and Ballmer is the business guy. This book is a great story of a man that has always been in the shadow of Bill Gates.Mariusz Skonieczny, author of Why Are We So Clueless about the Stock Market?

I felt that the writer basically did a Lexus Nexus search, and took out what he wanted to find.I am neither for or against Microsoft - just didnt get that much out of the book. A few facts here and there were pretty interesting, but overall, I felt the book was really skimming the surface on many things."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough materials to make it BAD!","review":"The materials on Microsoft Corporation and Bill Gates were written many times, in the past 10 years. Steve Ballmer lives in the shadow of Bill Gates. He befriended Bill, works for Bill and makes Billions $$$ from the Microsoft stocks. Had him work for Proctor and Gamble, he would be just another so-so manager. What makes it bad? The fact he is Jewish, tall and cursing all the time, is not enough to make him a BAD boy. I believe \\"BAD BOY\\" is just a marketing tool to sell the books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low rent smear job against Ballmer","review":"The author tries desperately and repeatedly to connect Ballmer with the nazis. The author's obvious dislike of and bias against Steve, and his assumptions that every negative rumor about Ballmer is true, speaks very poorly of his scholarship and any historical value this book might have had."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"This book is a complete disappointment. The author has an interesting subject but provides little authentic insight on Steve Ballmer and instead fills the pages with irrelevant material and personal observations. As an example, in one chapter he lists the voting statistics for the 2000 presidential election, spends 4 pages describing a conference that he attended (that had nothing to do with Microsoft) and reports on an interview with the manager of the Seattle Sunglass Hut. He also makes a number of obvious mistakes, for example he describes Microsoft's Internet Explorer as a \\"search engine\\", so it is hard to trust the facts that he does present. The author's style is easy and engaging, and at first glance the book looks interesting, but unfortunately under that veneer there is little of real substance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Bad","review":"The author's dislike (if not an outright hatred) for Microsoft, Gates, and Ballmer is more than evident. He constantly compares Gates to Hitler and almost gives you an impression that the fall of the stock market, and the events of 9-11 were planned by the \\"diabolical duo\\". The book constists primarily of retelling what bad things the author read or heard about Microsoft with the only genuine piece being the description of how the author visited the stockholder meeting and Gates glared at him, generously spiced by passages about what big liers Gates and Ballmer are......."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely disappointing","review":"Very poorly written, frequently goes off on irrelevant tangents, clearly biased against Ballmer, MS and Bill Gates, and full of factual errors. His attempts to describe technology are laughable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting and Eye-opening Read","review":"I got Bad Boy Ballmer as a present, put it on my bedside table, and picked it up one night last week.

I'm getting him a copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poignant...","review":"While we all know so much about Steve Jobs life from the media, this documentary brings it together in a beautiful honest way. No there are no earth-shattering hidden tidbits...but it also doesn't hide Steve Jobs tough, sometimes unlikable side either. Worth watching."},{"rating":"1","title":"A hastily made tribute...","review":"I remember coming across this documentary on YouTube at first, but waited until I could sit in my living room to actually see the whole thing. What I saw was sort of embarrassing, and I know that Steve Jobs would find it a poor attempt at trying to tell his life story. I got that idea when I saw the poor green screening, and the presence of Will.i.am in the teaser at the beginning, I was probably gonna be seeing something that wasn't THAT good.The interviews feel sort of contrived, and it all feels too soon to find all of these people who knew Jobs.Do yourself a favor and get the Issacson bio. This isn't it."},{"rating":"1","title":"For fan boys, not for actual IT people","review":"Every one knows the true history of Jobs.

Someone said that some of the material was regurgitated for this program, and they are partially correct, however, many of the interviews shown were original to this quick film. I wish it could have been even half an hour longer, but afterwards I did feel somewhat inspired."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was hoping for a more objective story","review":"This felt like Apple fan boy/girl buzz phrases and propaganda. It was not even interesting. I was hoping for an objective documentary style look at Steve Jobs' life. I would really like to learn more about him and not just hear the same old hype. Hopefully, some one will provide that in a future book or film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor content quality - not up to PBS standards","review":"This DVD is very poor from the aspect of scripting and content, with many omissions and inaccurate statements. None of the really key players are interviewed directly (some outtakes of other interviews such as the joint interview with Gates), whole segments of the Jobs/Apple story are left out, and other aspects are misrepresented. If you have read Isaacson's biography (book), this DVD is merely some eye candy - nothing more.

Why is there such a need to credit the executives who run companies for all the creativity and hard work of their people?RIP Steve.

This so-called documentary provides absolutely no insight to the man who changed the world. The film shows snippets of random things about Steve Jobs that tells absolutely nothing about him or his history. It doesn't talk about his childhood, his upbringing, his education, or what he actually did at NeXT, Pixar, and Apple. The so-called interviews are nothing but people who say \\"yeah, he was a great guy.\\" Steve jobs was more than a man who revolutionized the computing, animation, phone, music, and tablet industries. He was a spectacular character with a unique personality in his own right.\\"Steve Jobs: One Last Thing\\" is merely a film that was made to cash-in on his recent death. Read Walter Isaacson's autobiography to truly get a glimpse of the man."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expected better from PBS","review":"I am used to seeing things on PBS that are in-depth, and that do not rush through things to cover all the bases. This documentary was more along the lines of the latter. The sounds effects when transitioning from one \\"chapter\\" to another were very annoying. I wish they had picked on an aspect of his life and covered it more thoroughly, or produced a longer documentary. It was informative, nonetheless."},{"rating":"1","title":"90% trite, 10% insight","review":"If you've just arrived from another planet, this might be a good documentary to watch to better understand the cult of Steve Jobs.

Before watching this documentary, I was completely indifferent towards the fact that Steve Jobs had passed. Yes, I understood that he was this 'geek' that had created these 'awesome' gadgets, but what I failed to understand was why the world came to an abrupt halt when his death was announced.Watching this documentary, left me with no question in my mind that this man was truly a creative genius that took the technological world to a whole new level. A level, truly of his own.Steve Jobs: One Last Thing"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ehh..","review":"If Steve Jobs was really as interesting, creative, and dynamic as they say, you would think the film would have been able to show it more. Instead of gaining any real insights into who Steve Jobs was as a person, or how his life shaped him, I felt like I was just watching a celebratory tribute to Steve Jobs. If you want to watch laudatory snippets praising the creativity and amazingness of Steve Jobs, without any real depth in the film, this is it. I don't think I learned anything here, and to be honest, I feel a little grossed out by how gushy in adulation the film was. I expected better from PBS."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a total waste of an hour...","review":"After reading Walter Isaacson's biography of Jobs, I found it an interesting, cut down version of Steve Jobs life.

She makes a series of selfish decisions and then reaps the consequences. She makes a few pathetic attempts at redemption toward the end of the book, but it almost seems like an afterthought by the author. The book left me annoyed for wasting the time reading it.

However there are just a few small problems. I'll start with the good news. This is the best hunting game i've played and I've played a lot. The graphics of the animals are very nice. There are so many kinds of animals to hunt like bison,deer,bear,moose,goat,sheep, etc. It is very realistic, like if you don't drink water from your canteen your health can go down.

I thought it would be similar to other children's cookbooks with colorful pictures and detailed explanations--it has neither. While the idea of this cookbook is definitely a good one, this presentation is awful.Additionally, the first \\"recipe\\" is for Kool-Aid which this book says is a good drink. Personally, I find Kool-Aid lacking in nutritional value. Also in the beverage section is a recipe for \\"Adult\\" eggnog which includes alcoholic beverages.

This is the battle that, in the minds of some, solidified Gen. Grant's reputation as a mindless \\"butcher.\\"Ernest Furgurson posits many theories for the Union's debacle at Cold Harbor, including Grant's lack of \\"imagination\\" on the battlefield; a breakdown in communication between Grant and Meade, and deft generalship on the part of Robert E. Lee.Certainly all of these factors played a part in one of the bloodiest battles in the bloody Civil War."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Brilliantly Written Book","review":"Ernest B. Furgurson has proven that Walt Whitman was wrong. The \\"good, gray poet\\" once said that the real Civil War would never get into the books. \\"Not War But Murder: Cold Harbor 1864\\" is as about as close to the reality and horrors of that struggle as we are likely to get. I absolutely defy anyone to read the opening paragraph of the Prologue without reading the book to its end. I recommend it not only to everyone interested in the Civil but to everyone who admires brilliant writing. This book is military history at its finest, but it is far more than military history because of the complex moral, philosophical and psychological questions that it raises and with which it deals. With \\"Not War But Murder\\", Furgurson, who has already written two fine Civil War books, joins the ranks of such distingished historians of that perilous time as Bruce Catton and Lloyd Lewis."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read, about a disheartening battle.","review":"Read this book a while ago and it's always stuck with me due to the nature of the speed of death which left it's mark on Cold Harbor.

It never really felt dull, and I ran through this book easily and happily."},{"rating":"1","title":"Biased","review":"You would think while reading this well-written but highly-biased tome that Robert E. Lee never made the mistake of sending troops into massive frontal assaults against impregnable positions. Yet Lee was far more experienced at wasting troops in useless attacks than Grant. One need only examine the disasterous Confederate attacks at Malvern Hill in 1862 and Gettysburg in 1863 to see that Lee had his own share of \\"Cold Harbors.\\" And that is exactly where this book fails. While Furgurson does debunk some of the myths of Cold Harbor, he acutally manages to bolsters the myth of Lee's saintly invicibility. I thought most of today's historians were moving beyond this type of mindless hero worship, but apparently not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intense","review":"Gripping in its study of the events, movements and thoughts of all the participants. A must read for all. It is sometimes dry but never dull."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Civil War's shortest battles comes to life","review":"The depth of this work is contained in the events that precede the battle, and the effects that the results of the battle have on both Confederate and Union armies. Although labeled as one of the bloodiest battles of the war, the crucial fighting lasted less than one hour. Furgurson carefully lays out the thinking of Union and Confederate commanders, the strategic posturing that both armies seek before the battle, and the consequential tragic results of that battle. The author tacitly lays the blame for the heavy Union losses on the antipathy that existed between Meade and Grant. Included in the book are a number of individual soldier experiences, all of which I found fascinating reading. Although not the most interesting Civil War battle account I have read, Mr. Furgurson does an eloquent job in providing just the right amount of detail without overkilling in verbiage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mine needed repairs after 3 years and only light use!","review":"I'm a do-it-yourself'er with an old house that needs work.

I went out and bought it that weekend and couldn't be more satisfied. It's an album that you can put in and listen to start to finish, and that's rare nowadays.

The fiber optic cable looks like is was cut with a chainsaw, the cut is very rough and some of the outer cover is bent over the fiber itself. In addition, there is no mechanism to focus any of the flashlights output into the optical fiber - so what you get is about 1/50th (or less) of the output of the flashlight going down the fiber!I guess I was hoping for something more useful, but for 6 bucks I got something I will likely never use."},{"rating":"2","title":"pleased","review":"Exactly what I wanted.
