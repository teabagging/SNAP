Anyone who has been in an interracial relationship can understand the issues this couple has to deal with. I really appreciate how Kimberly comes off as being a strong women. Not weak like most white women are portrayed to be in most interracial love stories. My only problem with Jordan is, he is too worried about what everyone else thinks of his realitionship with Kimberly. I say, f--k'em. If they have a problem with it, you don't need them. In the end, it's always hard to find out that you really don't have friends in this world, only associates. I'm glad there was a happy ending to the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprising!","review":"This book was full of surprises! Very interesting reading. I am really impressed with the way Mr. Dickey explored the feminine point of view and for the most part was dead on key. The characters were easy to relate to. The story line was very interesting. No matter what side of the interracial issue you stand on you could understand and appreciate the characters' point of view. Overall, it was a very GOOD read, leaving me wanting to read the next novel by Dickey."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent book filled with love and laughter!","review":"Eric Jerome Dick has taken the very sensitive subject of interracial dating and handled it with tenderness, brutal honesty and a great deal of humor. The two main characters, Jordan Greene and Kimberly Chavers share with us, their feelings on race and relationships, family secrets and all of the drama that goes with it. The story that unfolds is heartwarming and hilarious and so very sweet. I found myself laughing like a crazy person one moment, and in the next moment, asking myself some serious soul-searching questions. This is definitely one of those books that makes you believe in true love. Forget about the societal hangups which attempt to dictate who you should love...love with all of your heart...whomever that person may be. Oh yeah...READ THE BOOK!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A HIGHLY RECOMMENDED BOOK ...","review":"This is a Fantastic book I've never read any of E.J. Dickey's books before, but I will continue to do so from now on. I could not put the book down. It is very well written and I would recommed it to all my friends...Keep up the good work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliantly written","review":"What brilliant writting. Dickey took his time to allow the reader to develope a relationship with Jordon first, then later Kimberly and all the other people in their lives. He managed to do that without letting his writing become overcrowded! :)I particularly liked that fact that it wasn't a 'they fell in love, and more love and more love'. Each character had a LIFE, and other relationships that helped us to identify with the character, and understand the other. As the pages ran out, I was dreading a typical 'wrapped up in each others arms' ending, instead the reader was left to think that this was a REAL relationship that required real effort!Bravo Bravo Bravo"},{"rating":"2","title":"Really brought my own life into perspective!","review":"I bought this book one night and finished it in a few hours. The last 40 pages or so had me in tears and afterward I had to call up my boyfriend just to hear his voice on his machine, since he's in Memphis visiting family. Jordan reminded me of him so much that I couldn't stop thinking about him for the next several hours. I understand exactly how Kimberly felt, being a white woman dating a black man. And the book also offered me an idea of how my boyfriend might feel while we're out together. I loved it!! A definite must read for anyone and everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy reading and very hard to put down.","review":"I really enjoyed this book. It had me guessing and it peaked my interest. I say to you all that he's writes as well as Sidney Shelton and Sandra Brown. I finished this book in just 12 hours (6 hours a day). However I'm not happy with you using God's name in vain. His last name isn't Damn. Other than that I would have given you 5 stars. Thanks for a great story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well-written, touching and (mostly) free of stereotypes","review":"As a white Jewish man living in Memphis (and an NY transplant to boot) and involved with an African-American lady I could relate to this book, and felt that it was warm, touching, and realistic. I gave this book to Danielle because it backed up what I have always said: You, not your family, neighbors, or peers, are in charge of your life and whom you share it with."},{"rating":"2","title":"fantastic book, well written and a must read for everyone","review":"A fantastic, well thought out, well written account of the way petty insecurities and prejudices affect peoples lives. This is a must read book for everyone who has an opinion on interracial relationships. i loved it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book was well written with lots of surprises.","review":"Once again Eric Jerome Dickey has done an outstanding job. Mr. Dickey knows how to keep the reader's attention. He also does an excellent job relating his story line to real life situations. I'm looking forward to reading the next one which I hope is soon to come out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very interesting","review":"Eric Jerome Dickey is a very talented writer. Milk in My Coffee is wonderful book with a few surprising twists which make it a very enjoyable book. However, Sister, Sister was much funnier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Many Stereotypes","review":"The novel plays up to the stereotype that all black men want a white woman. Also that he would leave a good black woman the moment a white woman gives him glance. After reading this novel, I know that I would never read or purchase anything else by this author. I am very disappointed in this book as well as for this person being of African-American origin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Realistic","review":"This was my first book by EJD. I'm not African American so I can'tspeak to that side of the story, but I did find the characters in thisbook to be too one-sided (character of Jordan possibly excepted). Noone is THAT bad (the 'sistas') or that \\"lily-white perfect.\\"People are complicated beasts, not to be described as simply good orbad. Also, the only reason Jordan eventually accepts Kimberly isbecause she has some \\"black blood\\" in her ancestry. Give itup. You may be black or white or any other ethnicity by blood, butknow nothing of the culture from which you hail."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easy, predictable read","review":"This book touches on but never fully explores interracial romance. Sure, there's background characters that question the love affair, and you do get a sense of the reluctance that the main character feels, but it's really only 2 dimensional. I bought this book to read on an airplane, and really that is all it's good for. It's not particularly funny, or the characters particularly thought-provoking. I haven't read Dickey's other novels, so if you're looking for one of his to read, I suggest you begin with a different one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent reading","review":"This book is very interesting from the beginning to the end. I'm not a book worm, but I definitely recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book, colorful, hip, and mordern","review":"Whoever doesn't like this book is crazy, it's odvious that they can't enjoy African-Amerocan literature. Milk in my Coffee has spice, it's a creative way of showing one of today's major issues from both sides. I'm a African-American woman and I don't feel threatened by white women because I know what I've got is real. So we all need to keep it real and give the man his props!! Eric Jerome you go boy, job well done!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Memorable","review":"I think Jordan (the main character), is the type of man that most women would kill for. Unlike his 2 crazy brothers. :o) This book was funny, romantic and touching. You could feel his pain over the break up with his best friend Soloman. I wanted to give him a can of whoop a--!! Kimberly was lively, adventurous and real. The hospital scene with Jordan and her parents had me rolling on the floor laughing. Thanks for making my couple of days Mr. Dickey. Great job!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS BOOK IS DA BOMB!!!","review":"This is a review and a comment to the woman in DC. Sister, please get a grip! First, YES, I do know alot of women just like J'nette(and some more triflin than that)!!! So, just because you don't know ofLany woman like that, doesn't meanLthat they aren't out there torturing poor African Kings!!!!! EJD is speaking the truth in his books!! I can't wait to read FNL and Cheaters. Milk in My Coffee was excellent! I will say this, Kimberly shouldn't have lied. She should have told Jordan that she was married and had a black father, not that the father part was a big deal..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Milk in my coffee","review":"There is nothing progressive about this story as it relates to inter-racial relationships between a black man and white woman. Again, we have an author trying to sell us on the black man white woman relationship. In this case the author attempts to create a white female character that black female readers won't hate. Unlike real life situations, where the white female is usually uneducated and of lower class, this one is a professional, and so I assume she is suppose to be an exception.Sorry, it's still bulls_________. Regardless of her short comings, the white woman will always be placed before us as the ideal woman, mother, lover, etc and many Black men have bought into that big lie."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book was moving and all about real life.","review":"This author is on his way. Off his three books this one is the best. It is an attention getter and takes some turns that will blow your mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Left me wanting more","review":"I enjoyed this book....only becaue I was still riding on the high of \\"Friends and Lovers\\" but the book left me wanting more...I think that EJD could have developed the character of Kim more andd not dismiss the serious issues that biracial women in america face....The book made me rethink my own prejudices on interacial dating. Leaving me to question what color is love anyway?"},{"rating":"1","title":"TYPICAL WHITE WOMAN BLACK MAN STORY","review":"TYPICAL WHITE WOMAN BLACK MAN STORY. the book constantly tries topersuade us that it was the person he fell in love with not the color or her skin. pure bull."},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally caught off guard.","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed the duration of this wonderful piece of fiction. It periodically caused me to wonder if it was fiction at all. The characters were vibrant and humorous. The setting and use of words were interesting and captivating. I found this to be an excellent read with quite a few interesting twists at the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved it!","review":"The one thing that came to my mind after reading this book is how much I loved it. I remember I went around telling all my friends how great it was and that they should read it to. I started to feel like I actually knew the characters in the book. EJD made them come alive. The story was full of surprises. That made me not want to put it down. Jordan and Kim had a great love story. When the book ended I just wanted to hear more. By then they had become apart of my life. I wanted an update of what happened next in their lives. The book touched on every emotion. I felt anger, sadness, and joy. This book also, at times, made me laugh. I've read Sister, Sister and Cheaters as well, but this one was the best. This book is definitely a MUST READ!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved the story but the ending...","review":"The story was okay the problem was the back and forth between jordan and j'nette then the part with his brother reggie was touching that got to me although I haven't being there. the end of the story lack information and the guessing what happen didn't help. mr. Dickey lets hope your next book is steamy, exciting and sexy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read","review":"This is the second book by this author I have read. The first, Cheaters, was written after this book, and I thought it was even better, so I guess this author just keeps improving..I was concerned at first that this would be a novel about racial issues. While race was a topic, it never became overbearing or preachy.This book is fun, romantic, fast-paced and a great page-turner. I really enjoyed the characters and was happy for a little (ok, alot!) escapism....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could not get into this book.","review":"Did not like this book after 3 chapters. I usually enjoy reading Jerome's books. But this one really stunk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth reading","review":"I didn't even finish this book... after reading the first 50 pages I put it down and vowed NEVER to finish it. I would waste my time or money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Milk In My Coffee - give me more!!!","review":"I just finished reading Milk In My Coffee and it was fantastic. I have found a new favorite author in Eric Jerome Dickey. I feel the book was true to life concerning interacial relationships and there were lots of twists and turns which kept me going. Good Job Mr Dickey!"},{"rating":"2","title":"milk in my coffee","review":"I loved the style of the writer. After reading the book I felt what Jordan had to encounter with his best friend sleeping with his ex. My heart went out for Kimberly I once was trapped like that. I love this book and would & have recommended it to serveral friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Milk in my coffee -- A Sistah's Point of View","review":"I'm currently reading this book and I must say, I'm glued to its every page. I happen to believe that love is blind and enjoy the way that EJD brings us into the lives and emotions of these characters. The slang is hilarious and the fact that I can totally relate to the intricacies of the relationship despite the fact that I've never been in a bi-racial relationship also fascinates me...it just goes to show us all...that, love is truly blind... I hope this book continues to open my eyes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deep!","review":"This was simply a great book. I really enjoyed the depth and background the characters had. Once you start reading you will not want to put it down. Just when you think that you have the ending figured out, WHAM!, something else is thrown in and you have to rethink the outcome. When milk in my coffee is explained, I was out done. This book told me that we often judge people at face value instead of taking the time to understand the real person on the inside. DEEP, DEEP, DEEP! Really made me think. I can't wait for the next one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insightful!!!","review":"Milk in my Coffee gives an extremely insightful account of interacial romance and the internal conflict a brotha went through before he took the step for LOVE!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT!!!","review":"This book took me on an emotional ride. I was mad at J'nette, jealous of Kimberly's friends, glad and mad for Jordan, and I felt sorrow for Peter. Great Book! A must read for everyone!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"this book is the real truth","review":"FINALLY a book by an african american that doesn't fall into simplistic stereotypes about \\"interracial dating\\" (we're all 1 human race- but anyway....) EJD was on target. Brothas who are with caucassion women aren't all lost or misguided like OJ. Some of us love people for who they are, not their skin color -be they black like me or another shade in God's rainbow. And even if in relationships with a brotha and sista, if it isn't based on more than skin color, it isn't going very far Do I need to mention the skin color issues blacks have with each other???. Ooops! Won't go there. Thanks EJD for a REAL story about HUMAN beings who happen to be with another skin color."},{"rating":"2","title":"A delightful, inter-racial romance with lots of twists.","review":"Milk in My Coffee captured my interest from the very beginning. You can feel the chemistry of the two main characters right from the start, however, you don't really know just how far it will develop. There are so many circumstances throughout the book that will totally take you by surprise. The style of writing in which Dickey depicts the story is witty and very creative. There are times when you will be knocked off your feet at the suspense that is revealed. At other times, you will find the actions/words of the characters excruciatingly humorous."},{"rating":"2","title":"A dynamic book to read -- keeps you interested","review":"Milk in my Coffee was a very good book for a very skeptical reader as myself. I had heard about this book about a year or so ago and decided not to read it. I didn't want to read another story about an interracial couple. But this books made me put my foot in my mouth. Eric Jerome Dickey did an extraordinary job with this book. His descriptions of the feelings that both people were feeling were very realistic. I like that the male was written to struggle with his decision to date a caucasion woman. It helped me to understand a little more about how they feel and the emotions that they go through. I was also interested in how the woman reacted to his family and friends. The book was very realistic and compelling. In the end I was a little disappointed in the outplay of the story but the book will definitely keep you. I read this book after I read \\"Liar's Game\\" and this by far was better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining!","review":"Milk in my Coffee was great... it was funny , emotional, an very real. However, I would loved to see the author create a positive ,beautiful, and loving black women character in at least one of his books. All in all, I give four stars!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Coffee Is Not My Cup of Tea","review":"Hated it! Hated the characters! It was dumb how the characters met and became a couple. Didn't quite get that. There are a few good laughs, but not like what you're accustomed to when reading an Eric Jerome Dickey novel. He made black women seem evil and ignorant... Come on, Eric! You can do better than that!!! Readers want material that's readable and interesting; not fairy tailish and uncredible. Better luck next time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did we read the same book?","review":"Okay I've read, Friends and Lovers by EJD and loved it!!! I read the reviews before I read this one. While I have to say that EJD is a fascinating writer, literally speaking, what in the heck was he doing with this one? The reviews on this book for the most part baffle me. There was no in depth discovery of inter-racial relationships or relationships period. Every relationship in this book was bad, expecially between Jordan (the main character) and the other black women. His relationship with his best friend was even horrible and I personally don't see brothers vibing like that. This characterization to me was inconsistent. The only decent relationship in the book was between Jordan and Kimberly, the white, black, white woman? Hello???? I am all for whatever floats your boat in terms of relationships but to depict every black relationship as a travesty of mankind was a big turn-off. Try again Mr. Dickey. Please try again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keep it coming..","review":"Milk in my coffee has been a wonderful reading from cover to cover! I'm not your \\" dedicated \\" reader but, MIMC had me up late. The characters are/were very \\" real \\" and the story just kept building. Friends, family and dedication to self, these were evident while I was reading and these things are all very important. EJD, you ARE amazing. Keep on writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"very enlightening book","review":"Mr. Dickey brings to life the challenges an interracial couple may face. The book made me think how I react to an interracial couple and how to now improve my behavior. I never thought of what that couple might be facing. Good job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeps you going till the end.","review":"Milk in my Coffee...definitely held my attention. This relationship just reflects what exists in our society. I enjoyed the various relationships between each of the characters. I like the way Mr Dickey writes interweaving the lives of his characters..everyone comes with a history.I think he was very accurate in portraying how sisters feel about interacial relationships. He gets a thumbs up.BTW...if you get a chance to see Mr Dickey at a booksigning do so. He is a very entertaining person. I would like to see more of his personality in his books."},{"rating":"2","title":"MILK IN MY COFFEE","review":"I LOVE EJD'S BOOKS. THIS WAS REALLY GOOD THE ONLY THING I HAD A PROBLEM WITH WAS HOW HE MADE BLACK WOMEN LOOK. TO TELL THE TRUTH I DO NOT KNOW ANY ONE WHO IS AS OFF THE HOOK AS JEANETTE AND HER SISTERS. THEY WERE POTRAYED AS REALLY GHETTO. BUT ASIDE FROM THAT THE BOOK HAD SOME SUPRISE TWISTS TO IT THAT MADE THE BOOK REALLY INTERESTING. I REALLY ENJOY EJD'S WORK. BUT NEXT TIME GIVE THE SISTERS A BREAK AND POTRAY THEM AS THE SMART AND CLASSY HUMAN BEINGS THAT WE ARE"},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD BOOK","review":"This book is not a typical book about an interracial relationship. He added many more bits and pieces to the novel which expanded your thinking and kept you reading. A lot of the surprises in the book were excellent also. The ending was fairytaleish but the book was still very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Milk in my Coffee","review":"This book like his others was wonderful. A little slow at first but once you know the characters you really get into it. I felt as though I knew the characters personlly and hated that the story had to end. I recommend this book to all readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"HATED IT!","review":"I have read all of EJD's other titles but this one did nothing for me. The beginning was slow, the middle was too fast, the end left me hanging, the author is African-American yet there no positive African-Americas, Kimberly was made to look perfect when in fact she was very foul, and I could continue but I believe I have made my point. I hope Liars Game will be better."},{"rating":"2","title":"BOOK OF THE YEAR","review":"This is the first book that I have read from Dickey, my fiance has told me in the past that he is a great writer because she read his book \\"Sister, Sister\\". Since then I have been determined to read this book, once I picked it up I was unable to put it down. I applaud this man for his brilliance and his ability to get the attention of so many of different races and culture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eric Dickey writes a fabulous book","review":"I have read all three of Eric Dickey's books, and they're all great. I had preconceived notions about this book from the title, and was a little disappointed at the twist in the book. As a partner in an interracial marriage,(white/asian) I thought it would be more about their overcoming their differences, and the prejudices of society toward miscegenation. However, It is still a fabulous book, and Eric Dickey is an extremely talented writer. I look forward to reading more of his work in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"superb!","review":"with a tissue in one hand and a champagne glass in the other i toast my new favorite author!i haven't read the other two, but will definitely be checking them out. this guy knows about relationships!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant!","review":"After reading EJD's other two books, I was compelled to keep the EJD groove and trotted out to my local bookstore for a copy of his new title. I couldn't put it down. How refreshing to see someone step up and talk about a subject most people just whisper about behind folks backs. It's 1998 and the population of our great nation is still looking at the world and it's inhabitants like they did their box of Kindergarten Crayolas. EJD dared to go there. His insight into the controversy of interracial dating from both perspectives was straight up. He took me back, had me laughing, crying, sighing, talking to myself. Love, like friendship should be color-blind and hopefully EJD made a step toward removing the corrective lenses. Stereo-type your Sony...not people and go out a buy yourself a BIG box of crayons:)"},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent writer","review":"Eric Jerome Dickey is an excellent writer.you can't put the book down.

Now I'm on Cheaters, and I just finish reading Friends and Lovers. I have a bad habit of not finishing books and Milk in My Coffee was the first book I actually finished in my whole life and Friends and Lovers is the next. Everybody should go and buy, or borrow this book. Whatever it takes to get -not just this one but all of the ones he wrote. Because they all leave you wanting to read more and more because he is the best writer that I have read since Shel Silverstein's Where the Sidewalk Ends... Buy the book and see for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who Would'a Thought...","review":"I really related to the book. It was reality, these things happen all the time. People are always trying to play someone out. I wasn't too crazy about the reunion, I had to skim through those chapters. Some parts were slow and little too detailed for me. But nevertheless, the book was very good. I could not put it down. I was always wanting to know what was going to happen next. I think this was the first book I enjoyed from beginning to end. And great to read on the Path on your way to work...I can't wait to get more."},{"rating":"2","title":"AN HONEST REVIEW OF THE CHOICES MEN HAVE IN MATES.","review":"I ENJOYED THIS NOVEL AS MUCH AS I DID GINGERSNAPS BY DELORYS WELCH-TYSON.

The story never explains itself. Why is Kimberly attracted to Jordan, and vice versa. Why are Solomon and Jeanette such bitter and terrible people. The end is a cop out, so you do not get the chance to really explore \\"inter-racial\\" dating.Additionally, both Jordan and Kimberly were completely against dating and marrying each other, yet in the end...and again, why??? Neither are desirable people, and would both benefit from a bit of psychological attention. Are there people actually like this??? Needless to say, I did not like this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Job well done....","review":"I really enjoyed this book. It was the first of his books for me so I didn't go into with any high or low expectations. But I did come out of it vowing to read ALL of his books. This book held my attention to the VERY end. What I liked most about the book was the fact that when you read the title, you automatically assume,\\"Oh just another book about an interrracial relationship\\". But in the end, boy did he give more than just what I expected. I enjoyed the book and I enjoy him, Eric Jerome Dickey, as a writer. I wish him much success."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Story, A Bit Jumpy","review":"Although the narration of the story is a bit jumpy, this book is provacative only because of the subjects that are brought up. I call the narration \\"jumpy\\" because of the tangents that detract from the central storyline of the couple with different skin tones.The main story is definitely commendable. Eric Jerome Dickey explores racial lines in a very sophisticated, interesting manner. It seems that there is an unwritten rule that a person born to a black mom and a white dad is automatically considered to be black. That is what Dickey focuses on. He honestly represents racism not only between whites and blacks, but racism in between members of the black race. That is often a difficult subject to broach, yet Dickey does it fairly and realistically.A great read that gives you something to think and talk about when you are done."},{"rating":"2","title":"SUPERB!","review":"After reading this book, I went out and bought other novels by Eric Jerome Dickey. I have \\"Friends and Lovers\\" and \\"Sisters, Sisters.\\" I am living overseas. So, I either order my books online or purchase them from our AAFES Bookmark. I was indulged in this book. I took it to the gym, the grocery store, to work; where ever I thought I might have the time to slip in a few minutes or an hour, I read it till I finished it. As I approached the last few pages of the book, I got mad because I had finished it. The little synopsis of \\"Cheaters\\" at the end of \\"Milk in my Coffee\\" sent me on my path to find that book and I did. Presently, I am reading \\"Cheaters.\\" His writings are so live. As I read, I could vividly picture the scenarios in my head. After finishing the book, I felt as though I had seen a movie or something. Mr. Dickey is truly a gifted writer. I love to read and when I get something as interesting as \\"Milk in my Coffee\\" I get a new sense of excitement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Almost Til the Last Drop","review":"Great book. I was just a little disappointed when we found out the \\"truth\\" about her. I felt that if Dickey was going to explore this topic, he should have stuck with it.

I usually don't read much fiction, but this one caught my eye, being in an interracial relationship myself.

I emailed Mr. Dickey personally and thanked him for a wonderful book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"more, more, more...","review":"i have read about 20 books this summer and milk in my coffee is the best by far. i felt like i knew all of the characters personally and felt very strong emotions about each of them. i loved kimberly and jordan together from the beginning. i wish that we could have seen jordan's relationships with his brothers develop a little more. also, i was wishing for a little more fanfare at the end but, all in all it was a great book that i read in less than 24 hours! looking forward to reading mr. dickey's next work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Emotions","review":"This story inspired me very much, Kwoning that im a young latin teenager. When i read this story it hit my emotions, because i have a freinds thats going throught the same thing. The way the author expressed everything brought back memories to my head.New York is the same way he said it to be. As i tell this just aint any book that once you start reading u get bored. This is the type of book that once u start u dont want to stop, that once it finish u dont want it to end. Many people probably dont feel this way but i do as we teenangers say this book is the bomb."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expected so much more...........","review":"This is the first book I have read by Eric Jerome Dickey. After hearing so much about his books and how great they were, I finally bought one to read. Boy! was I disappointed, I expected so much more from the book. There were certainly some unexpecteds in this storyline, but ultimately it left me thinking where is the rest of the book? It seemed unfinish! I'd be hard pressed to buy another one of his books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Milk in My Coffee","review":"Milk in My Coffee is a pretty good book. It has a serious tone at times while there are funny moments also. Dickey kept me reading because I could'nt wait to see what would happen next. Throughout the book new twist and turns popped up which kept me interested. I cannot wait to see how the book turns out. The issue of dating outside your race is common but it is not noticed as much as he made it seem. Dating caucasian males myself I understand the issues that he brings forth but they don't bother me that much. I think that I have a choice to date any race no matter what anyone says so I am glad Dickey's characters, Kim and Jordan, did what they felt was right. Dickey made his details clear and expressed his ideas very well but he could've left more things to the imagination. Overall it was a good book because it was iteresting and realistic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated it!","review":"The only reason I give it 2 stars is because I love EDJ's book. I am a strong BLACK woman in love with a strong BLACK man. Personally I'm not big on the whole black/white dating for the simple fact that no one can understand a black man like a black woman and vice versa. Don't get me wrong I'm not racist I am just tired of us being described as loud, ignorant, and less than other races. For a black man to write something like this is totally disrespectful. Not to mention the ending was way off. Come on EDJ. Where my girlz at."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eric - You Really Let Me Down!","review":"this book is the worst book I've ever tried to read from Eric Jerome Dickey.

Oh for anyone wondering, this one is from BEFORE he began using million dollar words lol."},{"rating":"1","title":"INSULTING","review":"Milk in my Coffee was a book club book so I had to read it or pay a fine. Otherwise I wouldn't have finished it. I've read all of Mr. Dickey novels but this one was insulting to me being a black woman and a supporter of black writers. Personally I'm not for interracial relationships but why was all the black women so ghetto. The characters were not real. I did not like this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book.","review":"At first glance, I was concerned that this book would be another book about a prejudiced brother who only considered dating white women. Not the case at all. EJD takes a realistic look at interracial relationships. The book is about two very real people. I was also very impressed with the unpredictability of the story. You think you know what's going on but you have no idea. A definite must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very funny and entertaining","review":"Dickey's book gave you an entertaining side to interracial dating. It is just as good as his previous books.

During her trial for heresy, there are flashbacks in which Jeanne replays key scenes of her life and mission to save France from the \\"godons\\" (goddamned English) during the Hundred Years War. One of the keys to the authenticity of Anouilh's voice is that he used the original transcripts of her trial in the 1400s to get it right. Many years ago when studying the play in high school, I heard that in the course of writing the play, Anouilh fell in love with the character of Jeanne and was unable to bring himself to kill her in the end. So, the ending is both a surprise and a tale of the indomitability of Jeanne' faith. The only thing missing from this version of the play is Anouilh's introduction to his master work."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's okay to want a grown up life too!","review":"I am a devoted parent. I do everything for my kids and put them first. I know that it has to be that way because they're young and I'm the one they have to look to and rely on. But my own loneliness has just made me sink and feel so low. This book helped me understand that my kids can't meet and make up for my adult needs for understanding and companionship. That's a whole different world. I feel relieved hearing other single parent's stories about putting your kids ahead of you but still having to have a world of friends including male friends. I have begun slowly to date. Some of the stories in the book are a hoot and I have had a few corkers. I felt supported by the sharing in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip it!","review":"Written by a single author with no children of her own, I found this book to dole out extremely permissive wishy-washy advice that advises parents to coddle their children and permit poor behavior. Very new-agey, progressive nonsense!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip it!","review":"Coming from a woman who has no children of her own, I find it very interesting that she considered herself expert enough to write a book. Most people giving out the advice on children, don't have any of their own. I thought this was a wishy washy endless diatribe for the permissive, new age parent. Lots of psychobabble nonsense that believes children should control their parents and we should sit back, smile and analyze..Save your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing we haven't heard before","review":"I've read a bunch of different books on the subject and didn't find this one to impart anymore wisdom. Its for the parent who answers to their child and not to themselves. Its written in a very stodgy, unhumanistic way that pretty much says, \\"please your kids before evr pleasing yourself\\".

As you know, we Japanese can't buy any new CD from US Amazon. But this item was sold on 'Market Place'. I was really exited.This performance is really great and the Cleveland Orchestra is perfect!! In recent years, all orchestral recordings are recorded in live performances. So, technical problems certainly exist even if in major orchestra. But this performance is a session recording. Szell was a great 'Bruckner' conductor and his performances were virtually flawless. This performance is the fruit of \\"Three Perfects=Session recording, Orchestra, Conductor\\".But in this old analog recording, there are some random tape noises (not \\"His\\" noise).

He did these because he wanted to (as usual) & it shows."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much religion","review":"I ordered this because I heard a review of it on NPR -- with lots of Cash's singing included. This package contains two CDs. The first one is wonderful, is like the review I heard, with a variety of wonderful, interesting sohgs.

This album helps to prove it. Away from all the back up singers and bands, Johnny sits alone in his studio and records these 49 jewels to be revealed for a sunny day.The first disc has a lot of great songs that transcend musical genre boundries. I suggest listening to the entire thing because any song sung by Johnny Cash is wonderful. His deep and rich baritone complements his guitar playing magnificently.The second disc I feel is the true gem of this album. Johnny Cash is a great Christian man and this second disc helps to convey his relationship with Jesus Christ. Every single word in every single song is carried with great conviction and you can truly feel God's word being delivered throuh Johnny's vocals. If you enjoy this, I entirely recommend purchasing \\"Johnny Cash Reads The Complete New Testament\\".If you enjoyed the \\"American\\" series, you will love these newly discovered gems."},{"rating":"2","title":"the mother lode...","review":"It's been a big year for posthumous Johnny Cash releases, including the warm campfire glow of the (not quite) final Rick Rubin-produced American recordings and the tenth-or-so reissue of the now really complete (honest!) Live at San Quentin. The mother lode, though, is Personal File, a two disc set of previously unissued 1970s solo acoustic private recordings by Cash, complete with spoken introductions. A rare and almost miraculous opportunity to hear a larger-than-life legend at his most intimate, reflective, and, well, personal. There's one CD of secular songs and another of sacred ones, depending upon your mood/religious preferences."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Music at a Great Price for Cash Fans","review":"The title says about all I can say about this.

Disc 1 is all \\"family-man\\" songs, disc 2 is all gospel.I think the only people who will be able to appreciate this are guys who are married with children, really, really, REALLY die-hard fans, or both.

He describes the DES, which stood for over 10 years as the definitive method for encrypting data. We see how this attracted the strenuous efforts of some very talented cryptographers to break it.The book is worthy in showing some of the personalities involved in this struggle, if one might use that term. It puts flesh on what are otherwise often just journal papers describing breakthroughs, but which often give little information about what it takes in people to discover or invent such things.Look, most of us will never meet cryptographers in person. So this book may be a good substitute."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy the Book - Skip the Class","review":"This book is a college text, for sure, but it is easily read and understood without enrolling for the course. I would recommend this book to anyone wanting both an introduction and a useable reference to the subject of Quality. A better investment than spending almost as much for a trendy \\"fluff\\" book, of which there are many. Also, many of the other books on the subject tend to focus mostly in manufacturing settings. This book deals equally with the service sector as well. Particularly good case studies at the end of the book, treated in depth.Balance of methods, cases, and even a little history thrown in. Keeps it from being too boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great therapy putty","review":"Thera putty was recommended to us by my son's OT.

I normally keep this in the container with small pop beads hidden inside of it. I make my son take it out and then pull all the beads out to string together. It is a very good fine motor activity for him. My other son who has no fine motor issues just loves to play with the putty. It does not leave a big mess or residue on our hands.

We ARE in the 21st Century. We have the internet along with carefully focused radio and myriad other ways to reach people and mold thinking.

It moves like lightening and strikes with intensity, blasting me with adventure everywhere it finds it -- on top of the Rocky Mountains, in NORADs impregnible bunker city, and even inside Chicago's hundred-year-old water tunnels beneath Lake Michigan. This book steps far apart from the run of the mill techno-thriller to a much higher level of fun and adventure all to itself. This is the second book I have read by Mr. Massucci (\\"CODE:ALPHA\\" was the first) and I look forward to the next adventure. Excellent, excellent entertainment!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Masterpiece","review":"The Millenium Project is one of the best thrillers I have ever read.

Renee's vocals blend well into Pete's post-psychedelic guitar work, Matt's solid, phat bass-lines, and Rico's session-worthy drumming. Sunflower Girl is probably the EP's best demonstration of this band's range and accessibility.

I am not sure how up-to-date this information may be, so I wouldn't recommend taking it as a bible if you mean to join the Mafia, but it is fun as a reference book. Since the work is broken up into short, nonconsecutive chapters, it is little like Pistone's first novel, \\"Donnie Brasco\\" of which I am a fan. For a worth while and blunt- and I mean BLUNT (there is a great deal of swearing and coarse language)- account of wiseguy life, this is the best book I have found."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tired material, dubious delivery","review":"If you read Donnie Brasco - or know even a little bit about the prototypical wiseguy - you do not need to read this book. It essentially details the way mobsters live their daily lives, what's important to them (money), why they kill people (also money), etc. If you have a brain in your skull you could have gleaned that from Pistone's first book, or the film Donnie Brasco, or any of the Godfather movies. What's worse, the book is littered with profanity, something that was missing (or at least not gratuitous) from the Donnie Brasco book. And it also surprised me because when you see Pistone interviewed, he seems like a class act. The profanity seems highly contrived as to make you think Pistone has more credibility if he talks like a scumbag."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mob Culture 101","review":"Despite being a novelty book that can be read in its entirety on a lazy Sunday afternoon, Joe Pistone's \\"The Way of the Wiseguy\\" is as entertaining as it is insightful in allowing us to take a glimpse into the twisted world of the mafia. Expect no deep thoughts here though, just a series of anecdotes illustrating the basics of mob life (i.e. how to set up a racket, how hits are carried out, the mob hierarchy, etc). Some stories are hilarious, others are depressing, and some are just plain sick. Either way, anyone with the slightest interest in organized crime will surely not be able to resist at least browsing through, seeing how the story of Pistone's infiltration of the mob is legendary."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brasco does it again","review":"This book was an excellent read. Told in Joe Pistone?s authentic voice, it provides an alternative viewpoint to Hollywood?s glamorized version of the mafia?a viewpoint that we don?t see often enough.I particularly enjoyed the format. The book is interspersed with some shorter chapters and some longer ones, each consisting of anecdotes that teach lessons about the wiseguy?s lifestyle. So whether you?ve got an hour to sit down and read it, or whether you?ve only got 10 minutes here and there, you can pick up The Way of the Wiseguy at any point and be entertained and enlightened.Informative, funny, and poignant all at once, Pistone brought me closer to being inside the mafia than I'll ever be. And convinced me that I don't ever want to get any closer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time.","review":"The book has like 30 chapters whcih might make you think there is a lot of material. Not so. Many \\"Chapters\\" are 1 or less pages long. The whole book is basically anecdotal tales of Pistone's time in the Mafia. While it may be correct, it's very superficial. One or two stories per topic.The last reveiwer was right. Lot's of profanity. It's almost as if he's trying to talk to people who are thinking of joining the Mafia just to let them know how it is. Not a lot of big words if you get my idea.Also, for a < 200 page book, there is a lot of repetition. Each chapter could exist on it's own, so you end up reading about Joe/Donnie's sit-down more than once.If you have seen any mob movies and the Sopranos, you know everything this books tells you. Even worse, is that he mentions Godfather and Goodfellows several times and mentions the Sopranos only once. Not that I really care, just that it's current and obvious that he is just cashing in on Soprano's current popularity."},{"rating":"2","title":"NOW, JUST A MINUTE HERE...","review":"Strikes me that some reviewers are missing the point, but that may be in part because this book hasn't been properly marketed. This isn't another revelatory mob rehash, and it doesn't purport to be. Instead, it's a sharp, all-encompassing, witty and (dare I say) ultimately profound commentary not just on the mobsters' lifestyle, attitudes and mores, but on human nature itself. Parts of it are funny- - \\b hilarious, in fact; parts are breathtakingly cruel. But the big question this book raises is whether wiseguys (even undercover ones like Pistone) are better or worse than the rest of us- - or if they simply represent what the human animal is, stripped of all the frills. I'm a writer, and I loved this book. So does everyone I know."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad -period!","review":"This is all about $$$ and more $$$. His bank account must be getting low. It is has NO depth what so ever. Very very brief to say the least.

There is NO way he did not violate state & federal law to convince them he was a fellow criminal as well.If your invloved with law enforcement you can not become a criminal-or a criminal orginization to investigate criminals & associates.

But this knowledge doesn't prevent him from claiming that \\"all the characters in Tosca were true personages in history.\\" He goes on to give detailed biographical information about Tosca, Cavaradossi, Scarpia, and Angelotti as if they had actually existed, neglecting to mention that all of his material comes from Sardou's play, and that these are *fictional* characters.It's an amazing gaffe. Anyone who relies on this book as an introduction to Tosca will end up sadly misinformed."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book, a bit propagandistic","review":"coyote rising is a good sequel to the first book, _coyote_. the first book did a good job of weaving a handful of short stories into a coherent novel. the second book didn't pull this off quite so masterfully, but did it well enough. like the first book, _coyote rising_ pushes a political ideology and pushes it hard. it has the feeling of a book written during the cold war, and would've felt right at home during that era, as a polemic against the Soviet Union and socialism, whether real socialism or the fake, authoritarian variety of the CPSU. still a good book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't quite cut it","review":"\\"Coyote\\" was an impulse buy, and the \\"steal a starship\\" set-up was so contrived and preposterous that I almost gave up on the book - Amazon reviewers suggested I hold on for the Coyote part, which WAS a lot better, and I finally enjoyed the book enough to try this sequel.Although these stories are well crafted and generally connected to the rebellion plot in a \\"life on the hard frontier\\" context, they often felt more like writing exercises to me, especially the one about a bio-engineered bat/man vampire dude who arrives on Coyote leading his religious cult (as if someone said \\"I challenge you to write a Coyote story involving a vampire\\" - this is hard SF?!?). This book seems more like a Wild West story set on another planet, with rugged freedom-loving rebels fighting the oppressive, power-hungry socialist overlords. But there are weird animals and plants, and some strangely selective advanced technology thrown in for good measure. And a vampire. Oy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where Coyote Left Off.","review":"Coyote Rising picks up where Coyote left off. A new planet being dictated to by a remote by time and distance government has the story potential for rebellion. Steele depicts the different types and personalities of the citizens of the planet and what leads them to making their very personal choice regarding their future. Steele does good characterizations of people you could know and like or despise. I don't feel the book should be read as a stand alone. I would advise you to read Coyote prior to reading Coyote Rising. A good read, I look forward to the end of the trilogy and the ensuing two books that follow it. I recommend the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"very enjoyable and interesting","review":"I bought this because a friend had a copy.

I installed the muffler myself. I had to go pick up a few exhaust parts from Advance Autoparts, but I kept the factory layout of the exhaust. The muffler help very little on gas mileage. It sounded pretty good too. It doesn't have that annoying loud popping noise like some mufflers. A month later I installed a K&N cold air intake (part number 75-2556) and the new sound was awesome.

It is in no way annoying and when at idle, the sound is a wonderful deep rumble that you can only hear when behind the car. At wide open throttle, however, other know that you mean business. I would recommend these any day. I had plenty of aftermarket exhaust systems in the past, including much more expensive Borla stingers on my 03 Cobra and Corsa pace exhaust on my Z-06.

The band was the best Phil ever assembled and you can tell on every song. I can't say that I've ever heard as tight a band or one that seems to be as in touch with each other as this one. All of the songs have a retro-rock feel to them, harkening back to Keaggy's 1970's roots, with a good heavy rock sound that manages to lift itself above three power chords.

It is formatted completely wrong and the layout is absolutely horrible. It doesn't actually read like the book at all!!! It gives you the two page layout, then a repeat of each singular page, plus a transcription/caption/rewrite of what's written on each page!

It's much easier to measure the circumference of your leg or arm than using a traditional tape measure.

But this allows the ability for a single person to measure themselves accurately.Seems like most of the negative reviews are due to cheap construction or difficult to use, I'll address these now:-cheap construction - I have not had any troubles with my tape measurer and I've been using it weekly for a few months now. I haven't dropped the device onto hard surfaces, yet, but I also don't plan to. If you are used to taking care of your items then you'll be fine.- difficult to use - I'm guessing you're just using it wrong. I've found that it's easiest to hold the button in while adjusting and to make sure that you have the plastic pin facing up so that it doesn't fall out.All in all, I've been completely satisfied with this purchase.

I think that the accuracy of +/- half cm as discuss in other reviews is more dependable on your ability to place the tape over the exact part of your body rather than a mechanical problem of the myotape itself. It will be an excellent purchase as long as you remember it was cheap and try it gently. My recommendation, as you pull the tape make yourself sure to pressure the bottom to avoid breaking the internal machinery.I will recommended this product to anyone with a limited budget and a desire to measure their workout achievements."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great concept, poor execution","review":"I know it is just a measuring tape, but when you are losing weight, you really want/need an accurate body measurement. With most measuring tapes accuracy is fully dependent upon the user, but not so with this little gem. Unfortunately it seems to have preset intervals at which the scroll mechanism will stop - about every inch or so. So getting an accurate measurement is very difficult. This is such a great design - if more money was put into the production it would be a very handy little item. I definitely would not purchase again."},{"rating":"1","title":"I might be using it wrong because its difficult to use...","review":"i can't seem to use this accurately, and it doesn't help the product didnt' come with instructions.

Great idea, but just not very user-friendly to use out-of-box."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing product","review":"I absolutely love this. This body tape is very easy to use on any part of your body. Using measuring tape can be a difficult and annoying process, especially when it comes to the maneuverability of your hands. To use this body tape, all you have to do is wrap it around your body (it does not have to touch it) before inserting the end in an indent that keeps it in place (forming a circle, in essence). Place the solid portion on your side so that you can easily see the measurement, then press the button and the contraption will shorten until the circumference matches that of the body part you are measuring. The tightness of the circle should guarantee that the solid portion will be stable on the body part, preventing any hassle with having to hold on to it. I recommend this to anybody. It truly made my life easier since I am a fitness freak."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ingenious design","review":"The design of this tape is really brilliant. Anyone who is trying to lose weight should be tracking not only the pounds they are losing, but also the inches. Unfortunately, measuring yourself can be really awkward and it is hard to get accurate results, but asking someone else to do it can be really embarassing. This little measuring tape makes it much easier. You pull the tape out a little longer than you need it (the tape automatically locks in place), hook the little peg in the groove and then hold it against your body and push the button. The button causes the tape to retract until it is snug. Once you release the button the tape locks into place again. All you have to do at that point is slip the peg out of the groove and then look the markings. When you are done push the button again and the tape wraps up inside the handle. It is a simple design that really works. Anyone who is on a diet absolutely must get this tape. They will not regret it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little tape measure","review":"Easy to use and provides a consistent reading which is very helpful when trying to track weekly or monthly progress.

The little plastic cylinder on the end of the tape freely slides out of the main body. Therefore, the tape constantly slips out when holding with one hand to measure the opposite bicep. You know that's why you're buying this, so look for a better product.

I felt like I was getting a more 'accurate reading' of my body measurements by using this thing. However, after using it for several months, I've come to hate this device. I've gone back to just using a plain measuring tape. First, the numbers on the tape are ridiculously small. I usually measure in front of a mirror and I constantly have to keep bending down or unhooking it to see what it's at. Next, and most annoying, is that the little plastic cap keeps snapping out of the hand-held part every time I link them together! It's completely frustrating! I have to keep inserting it about three times before I can finally take my measurements.It's definitely not worth the money. If you can, just buy a regular tape measure from a craft or fabric store. Just remind yourself not to pull the tape too tight, and you won't need this thing. It's more hassle than it's worth...honestly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Product - Great Amazon Price!","review":"I bought this product to begin documenting the results of my exercise routine.

However, I don't consider this a con, as I used it to measure 7 body parts once a week for over 2 years, so that's a fair amount of time and use for such a cheap little device."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very convenient","review":"I got this to track muscle hypertrophy from weight training. It works very well. You basically just pull out the tape to an excessive length, and then put the small bar at the end into the notch in the body of the tape measure, creating a loop. Then press the button to retract the tape, tightening it around your body. This gives you very exact measures. The tape has both inches and centimeters.Pros:* Accurate.* Very easy to use, thanks to the way the end of the tape locks into a loop. Much easier than a loose measuring tape.* English and metric units.Cons:* None."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to use and accurate","review":"The measuring tape of this product pulls out in intervals allowing you to put the peg (that is attached to the end of the tape) into the device itself. Then you push the center button to tighten the tape to the accurate measurement of your waist. It works perfectly and helps you to keep track of weight loss when the pounds aren't coming off, but the inches are. This item is small and easy to store. It takes up next to no room and there is no mess of tape to get tangled in other objects."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great features for consistent tracking of weight loss or fitness improvement!","review":"The best feature of this tape measure is that if you use the button to retract the tape around your bicep (or whatever), you get a consistent tension each time you take a measurement. Great feature for those of us who struggle with getting consistent tension on the tape. I found that with my standard tape measure, my measurements were all over the place. This makes consistent tracking from week to week a piece of cake! Yes, the tip does tend to fall out, but as someone pointed out, that means you don't have the tape square and level and the measurement may be inaccurate. Best bang for the buck item I have purchased in a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Much Easier!","review":"Great product and simple to use. It makes taking your measurements much easier and you are more likely to get consistent results each time.

It tends to stick every once in awhile but really it's not that hard to pull a couple of times to get it started again. I would purchase again because of the convenience and easy to read numbers. I also like that it's not something my husband would grab and use instead of his metal tape measure so I have one on my own and he has his own and I don't have to hear, \\"what did you do with my tape measure this time\\"?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Meets expectations","review":"It is definitely better than regular tape measures.

It has a plastic pin at the end of the tape that you slide into a hole on the plastic holder, which would be MUCH better if the pin actually STAYED IN PLACE! Every time you tighten it, the pin pops right out. It's as if you need a third hand to hold the pin in the hole, and boy does it get frustrating. I'm surprised no one else has mentioned it! I'm looking forward to an improved design, because yes this is better, but not by much!EDIT: 8/3/2010...... I thought of an idea, MyoTape. Put a heavy duty magnet inside of the pin hole, and on the bottom of the pin. That will solve everything!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Get one for free with a scale","review":"I ordered the EatSmart scale for a decent price from Amazon, and it came with one of these (with the EatSmart logo on it) for free.

I was hoping that this device would eliminate that problem. It does help to some extent, but there can still be a discrepancy of around 1/2\\".

However, the connector sits in the slot too losely and frequently pops out, causing some frustration.

In case you don't already know how it works, you pull the roll of measuring tape from one side, wrap it around your body part to be measured, and then slide the end of the tape into the notch on the other side and it holds it in place.

I really wanted to like this gadget but I was like, \\"Come on, how hard can this be? Make the pin lock or something!\\"Anyway, I got the measurements I needed and will measure myself again in a month or so.

Just hook the end of the tape measure into the slot and push a button to tighten the tape. No longer do you need two free hands (or another person) to take a good measurement. The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5, is that I haven't had the tape measure too long and it seems like it might break easily. I'm trying to keep it out of the hands of my young kids.

After breaking open the case I found the reason very cheap metal was used and they didn't even wind the spring the correct way. Pure Junk!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not start from zero","review":"I had to return the tape because it does not start from zero but from 1 3/4\\". Am I supposed to add 1 3/4\\" every time I do the measurement? Return was handled fast with no problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"It does not start from zero !","review":"One of the things that I have notice is that the measuring tape starts in about 4.5 cm (1.75 inches), so be aware of that you have 4.5 cm or 1.75 inches extra to what you are measuring. I thought I got 2 more inches but that was only because the tape starts at 1.75 inch."},{"rating":"1","title":"inaccurate measuring tape","review":"Maybe I dont know how measuring tape is supposed to work but Ive always assumed that number would start at 0 then move to 1 then 2 and so forth. This tape starts at 2 inches. Go figure. Other than that, it's fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Product","review":"I am in the process of sending this product back. The tape doesn't even start at zero! It starts at about 1 3/4\\". How useless is that? I thought it might have been tucked into the little knob that was at the end of the tape, which you stick into the hole, so, I tugged on it and it fell off! Then, the tape disappeared into the housing! I would not recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective tape measure begins at 2\\"","review":"I was so happy to see the description of this tape measure, and it indeed works as described. However, there's a big problem. When you pull it out to measure, it actually starts at about 2 inches--making the accurate measuring of anything require subtraction. It's ridiculous! Whatever happened to quality control? If you look at the pictures, you can see that most of them only show it starting at 2\\". One reviewer even wondered if she had to add 2 inches to her measurement--which would end up with her getting it wrong by four inches. The trick is to subtract 2 inches. But why would they make it that way? It seems like, in wrapping the first part into the little anchor piece, they simply wound up too much. BUt it can't be unwound any more, at least the one I have can't. I'll probably keep it, because any tape measure is better than none. But it's too bad. They should fix this."},{"rating":"1","title":"IT starts from 2inch!","review":"Can you imagine that they were so reckless that the first inchs of the tape is missing! I through the box away and after a few hours I realized the tape begins with 2 not 0!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't like it","review":"This tape is fine for measuring around items, like measuring your waist, biceps, etc. But it stinks for making simple linear measurements, like for example, if you were trying to measure your inseam. You have to \\"dock\\" the end of the tape back into the frame to take a measurement. The frame adds approx. 2\\" to the measurement, and thus the tape starts at 1 3/4\\". So for a linear measurement, you have to try to start at 2\\", and subract 1\\" from the measurement observed. I don't like it -- an old fashioned cloth tape is better."},{"rating":"1","title":"One star for Amazon, not the product!","review":"Beware! Item is not as pictured!

Do NOT buy for the lectures.","review":"Please be warned that if your are purchasing this product for Bernstein's outstanding talk on the first movement, do not do so. All four tracks are defective. To put it simply, it is as though you are listening to two people talking over each other in two different languages. This is a shame. I listened to this talk a long time ago, and it is wonderful. What a shame that you cannot do so on this CD.To reiterate, the issue is the lecture, not the music.

But just before I started to wrap it, I thumbed through the booklet, and couldn't put it down. I'm not even a sports fan but this had me laughing out loud for a couple hours. It's also helped me snap my beau out of his sports watching haze by making him laugh with jokes and comments based on this book. My only critique is that the voodoo doll is in serious need of a makeover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick to Bridget Jones","review":"I expected a sweet and funny beach read. Unfortunately, this book turned out to be predictable and not too funny. The main character is obviously supposed to be an American Bridget Jones, but lacks her nerve and her humor. What we get instead is a weak heroine who spends most of the book feeling sorry for herself amidst \\"single girl\\" stereotypes- the interfering mother, the nasty boss, the gay friend, the good-on-paper-but-big-mistake boyfriend. The plot is resolved in a very formulaic and predictable way, and I was left feeling diappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A funny book.","review":"I heard some really great things about this book, and when I was finished I was a little disappointed. I had huge expectations due to what I had heard.This was an enjoyable read though. I wish the ending would have been a little more clear.

I think one of these days I may just begin reading them all over again.Yes, they are that good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mma Ramotswe never fails to delight","review":"In this installment of the enchanting #1 Ladies Detective Agency series, life under the acacia tree on Zebra Drive in Gaborone, Botswana continues with its usual rhythm. Several key characters step outside their traditional roles: Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni (Mma Ramotswe's husband and owner of Tlokweng Road Speedy Motors) takes an interest in detecting, Mma Makutsi (her assistant detective) considers another career and Charlie the automotive apprentice starts a small business. Three mysteries (perhaps four if the mysterious photograph is counted) are resolved and much bush tea is drunk.Each of these books - and this one is no exception - gives the reader a gentle vignette of life under the wide and empty African sky. They are written with great love and understanding of place and people. I eagerly await each new volume."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great insight into Botswana","review":"What can I say..I have read everyone of this series & I don't get tired."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast Shippping!","review":"I bought this book for my mom as her Christmas gift and if arrived very quickly.

But there is a bit of restlessness down at Tlokweng Road, where both Mma Makutsi and Charlie, the older apprentice start to think about new employment. And Mr J. L. B. Matekoni wonders if his life needs a new bit of excitement. The reader knows that all will work its way out, as it always does in these precious stories. Humerous endings occur to the mysteries brought to the detectives. Another excellent entry in this outstanding series."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Good Husband of Zebra Drive","review":"Another A.M.Smith's upbeat and sensible effort. Leaves one in a positive frame of mind. Another in the matchless No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent addition to the Series","review":"I thought The Good Husband was a great addition to the series. If you haven't read any other books in the series, I wouldn't advise that you start with this novel. In this story a majority of plot depends on the characters and their relationships that were developed in earlier stories. Alexander Smith does an excellent job of bringing out these characters and their relationships but in my opinion it still would be a cumbersome read if you have not been educated by the earlier books. This is just my opinion.This novel is another wonderful tribute to Botswana and to the values; loyalty, honesty, compassion that the characters hold dear. There are many reviews so in summary I would say this is a very entertaining read that will keep you reading page after page."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Husband of Zebra Drive - CD","review":"This is an excellent series of books (No.1 Ladies Detective Agency) to listen to on CD.

A quick and relatively easy read, the book does a pretty good job of explaining some more sophisticated aspects of investing. Cotsakos' analogy of purchasing a new car to explain options is particularly effective.

I did like it. Anatole was also nice (we both liked it). I Lost My Bear was THE WORST and NOT appropriate for little kids. An annoying little girl with a very obnoxius sister... bad attitudes and the use of the word \\"st*p*d\\".

Also, I've come down with a virus this week and have been pushing fluids resulting in many trips to the bathroom during the night. I don't know what I would have done without these nightlights.

So this was a great treat for him. We've got a couple of pieces of the Geo Trax world already, so this was just another add-in. It takes a little more effort to put together than the other sets we've bought so far, but no problems with it. We have a standard size train table, and adding a piece like this, or the elevated tracks (which we also have) is starting to push the limits of the train table. I guess that's an overall \\"warning\\" about the Geo Trax sets...if your kid likes them, the more you buy, the more space you need if you want to set up the whole thing. Our space is limited, so our son can only set up certain pieces at a time. And he is pretty astute to set stuff up himself.

Dipping from questions submitted to Evans the book is chock full of anecdotes, wit and pithy wisdom often presented in a humorous way. Evan's tone is of a cajoling mentor that manages to give some lessons while describing the world of chess. My 4-star rating is for the entertainment value. As an instruction book I'd give it a couple of stars. I read this when I was first beginning to delve more deeply into chess and when you know so very little, it's easy to quadruple your knowledge by reading and playing along with a book like 'Chess Catechism'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spoiled or old, Do not purchase!","review":"I was excited to see this for half the price it sells for other places.

Both Time Love And Tenderness and Timeless (The Classics) were #1 albums, and he was the biggest thing since sliced bread to housewives across the country.However, the release of \\"The One Thing\\" in late 1993 signalled a downturn in Bolton's career. The formula that was perfected on Soul Provider and was still successful on Time Love And Tenderness was running out of steam by this go-round. The only track on the album that scored was the leadoff single, \\"Said I Loved You But I Lied\\", which was a great record for him. However, the followup single \\"Completely\\" was stale and the Def Leppard-sounding \\"Ain't Got Nothing If You Ain't Got Love\\", the third single, was completely dated and unhip by it's release.The album did still sell decently though not in the league of his last couple albums, but it's also one of his poorest catalog sellers, Bolton did this one for the cash and without the heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Bolton album!","review":"Between his 1988-1992 success and the lawsuit that he had to deal with the Isley Brothers, this album to me is still his best one to date! Michael Bolton made a very good effort in The One Thing. It was a departure from his more bombastic power ballads that he's so good at as he shifted to a few rock-driven songs and different producers. And the songs have such smoother, dramatic landscapes. The songs he did with Mutt Lange were all good. Said I Loved You... But I Lied is much different from his other singles, but I love the bridges and nature-driven feel of the song. I still like Soul of My Soul, even though it clocks in at 5:42. Most of the album's songs average 5 minutes, but they are enjoyable to hear. Love his remake of Bill Withers' Lean on Me--he has such a soulful voice. Although his later albums haven't matched up to his early '90s hits, this album is really his best to me.

It goes through the process of how the Japanese blades/swords are manufactured from ore to final product with a sprinkle of the history and lore of these unique weapons. Lacking was the visual of the process of shaping an actual sword, they show how the iron is made and how the alloy used has welded but they show it with only 2-4 inch billets and you never see a full length sword manufactured which would have been interesting to see. Since there are probably many secrets to the process that the sword masters wish to maintain and therefore did not want to show how a full length sword is made in detail. Overall though a very good overview and worth renting to see once but probably not worth purchasing to add to your personal library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exelent reference","review":"This video is much longer than the play time indicates, because if you have more than a passing interest in the subject, you will re-watch a number of sections, pen in hand, getting down all the information that you need.

It was. I was frustrated especially by his example of the light experiment in a freely-falling elevator where he seemed to equate the bending of the light passing through the elevator's slot to gravity, but failed to connect it to the velocity of the elevator which would dictate how much time the light had to get to the other side. I hope the author is reading this.The quantum physics part started well but became too involved considering the latest discovered bits.

First off it is really hard to get the cds out of these cardboard sleeves. They cram the cd in the tightest fit possible. I struggled and struggled with it. When it finally came out some of the glue from the sleeve stuck to the cd. Let me tell you it aint fun to try getting the glue off without scratching the cd. So I then tried to get cd 1 out and same thing but it was even worse. Getting the cd out was hard and I now think I have to take that disc to a 'cd' doctor to fix it.Great music though. just trying to make a point with the cd companies trying to save a buck on extra cheap packaging.

This set is far better than the single disc titled \\"The Best That I could Do\\" which was release a few years ago. That one has a lot of great songs missing and with \\"Words and Music\\" you get the very best of John Mellencamp. There are no misses on this one, only great songs from a great singer and songwriter whose music has lasted for many years. Mellencamp is a poet at heart who has always had a good song up his sleeve. Get this one you will not be disappointed. Is definately a keeper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"This is a great CD.

From the brand-new opener, \\"Walk Tall\\", to the end you get pure affirmation that Mellencamp is often just as good a basic rocker as Springsteen, Seger, and Fogerty, with such songs as \\"I Need A Lover\\", \\"Hurts So Good\\", \\"Crumblin' Down\\", \\"Pink Houses\\", \\"Authority Song\\", \\"Paper In Fire\\", and \\"Check It Out\\" proving that even if he didn't always equal the aforementioned artists, he often did.

I like the non chronological order, it emphasizes how strong his music has been over his entire career. I'll enjoy listening to this album for many many years to come.The title Words and Music suggested to me that there would be lyrics included. I guess not!Not being a Democrat, Mellencamp's partisan political activism lately leaves a bad taste in my mouth, so I probably won't appreciate Walk Tall for awhile.

My main gripe is that you are supposed to squeeze the calipers together until you hear a click. Maybe my unit is defective, but the click is basically silent, and I almost always continue squeezing beyond where I should have stopped. I have resorted to trying to look at the calipers as I squeeze, although this is a little tricky. Tyring to stand up straight, pinch my skin, squeeze the calipers, and try and watch to know when to stop, all at the same time, is a little awkward and overwhelming. Would not recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not last","review":"I've had this caliper for two years now and it is not usable anymore.

The trick is measuring at the same time of day in the exact same location every time. Results can vary quite a bit if you are measuring even an inch off the original measurement site. Consistency is the key to success. Also, how far you pull the skin away and how far down the fold you measure are important. It's best if you have someone else to do the measurement for you and if you measure and record data for several different places on your body. The guide only tells you one site, but there are 8 different sites you can measure from (just Google skinfold caliper measurements)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay, I guess","review":"For an overall, general picture of body fat content, this caliper works well enough.

I used this 3 times and got consistent readings (that I thought were a bit low, but maybe they were right as I don't have a true recent measurement to compare against). After the third reading, however, the small tab required much less resistance to click to identify the right measurement and starting giving widely varying measurements.I shipped back and had no problems returning, so I would shop again from this seller as they stood behind the product.

It isn't worth sending it back.I found the website another reviewer posted that you could post your measurements on more useful, just using a tape measure, and then it generates an approximate body fat percentage.If you are disproportionate where you store fat, it is probably more accurate than an impedance device, and there is some use to it for giving you rough information but not for extreme accuracy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless","review":"The price enticed me to buy it.

It would have been better if the readout of the measurement locked into place on the scale, so that I could get an accurate reading, and then release it afterwards.

Beware though, there are a few statements Nee makes in this book that need to be further examined, and may be in error- but probably are not.My only complaint about this book is that it is highly repetitive. You will read many of the same statements over and over again, but that's because this is simply a collection of sermons/essays by Nee. He did not simply sit down and write a book.Also I find it of interest that Nee doesn't make very many personal references/examples in this work.

The Mafia formed to protect Sicilian people. It came to the United States because Sicilian people were being harassed and assaulted and could not get jobs. It was to prevent Sicilian people from getting harmed and abused. That's why the Sicilian people supported the Mafia. Eventually, and unfortunately, it deteriorated into a criminal organization, which is of popular attraction because there are a lot of people who wish they had what appears to be absolute power over others. They get it vicariously by watching movies like The Godfather and The Sopranos, or, in a lighter vein, from following the antics of J.R. Ewing.

Whoa! The new ones made me realize how much my originals had hardened.

She sensationalizes something that is rather mundane in many ways.Focusing on gay couples, HOMs, and other sensational stories while selecting inaccurate pictures of the current state of the ART business in the USA leads to a misleading book. A better book is The Baby Business by Debora Spar. Though, she does fall short, Ms. Spar's book is much more accurate and less sensationalistic."},{"rating":"2","title":"i love this book!!!!!!","review":"i love this book!!!! its about a girl named hannah who is sent by her horrid aunt pheobe to be a indengered servant. she loves horses and becomes friends with two stable boys named will and caleb. hannah hates being a servant, so to breakaway from the servant life, she goes on midnight rides on her beloved horse promise. i'm not gonna say anything else though!!!! read this book and find out what happens!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing","review":"i loved this book. i almost cried at the end. the ending was so sweet. i highly recomend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deserved more than what it got.","review":"If this cd was released in 1989, he would be right up there with Clint Black and Alan Jackson. But unfortunately this was released after all the fake country singers had came out and he got thrown in with them. This is a pure country album, complete with shuffles and plenty of steel guitar. After this cd, the quality of his music dropped, so grab this while you can and enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Original Is Still The Greatest","review":"No other version has the searing quality of Ormandy's finale. Chailly and Sanderling come close but they can't quite match this. No one has yet, though there are many good recordings out there. This is Mahler's triumph over death."},{"rating":"2","title":"Passionate Performance","review":"I really like a lot of things about this CD. I am anxious to hear other versions of Mahler's unfinished Tenth, but I like what Cooke has done based on what I hear in this recording. I will have to hear other recordings before I can conclude that this is in fact the best, and there are a few perhaps minor things that disappoint in this recording, mainly the vibrato used in the French Horn solos. I don't think the instrument should use vibrato, but I suppose that is a matter of personal taste.Other than that, the orchestra really lays into this one. Ormandy and the Philadelphia Orchestra have put out quite a lot of top-rate performances on vinyl, and it is comforting to know that many of these performances are being preserved. This is a feisty, vigorous performance, in spite of whatever flaws it might have. For historical preservation alone, I think it's worth a listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Holiday Book","review":"Eric Carle is on of my favorite children's authors.

Not worth the price in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review of Dream Snow","review":"I enjoyed this book more thatn any other Eric Carle books I've read. I love how the little old farmer names his animals, one, two, three, four, five because he can count them on his hand! After work he realizes Christmas is coming soon but there is no snow. While napping in his favorite chair he dreams of snow falling, covering him and all of his animals. Realizing when he awakens that it actually did snow he rushes out to the barn. While all the animals watch him wondering what it is he is doing he decorates a tree and puts presents for all the animals out. The song at the end also adds a fun touch to the book, that all children will enjoy! The pictures in this book represent Eric Carle's style, unique, colorful and interesting! This book is a great one to read with children around the holidays to get you into the Christmas spirit!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A let-down","review":"The illustrations enticed me to buy this book without reading it. As my family sat around the Christmas tree, warmed by the fire, we began reading the book only to be completely disappointed at the ending. \\"What,\\" cried the family, \\"was that all about?\\" With a great beginning, rather unique and interresting and wonderful illustrations, the story went nowhere and will be returned to the bookstore as soon as I get a chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful!","review":"I purchased this book for my 20 month old granddaughter.We both love it! The only reason I didn't give it a five star rating is because I am not quite sure the \\"mystical tinkling\\" at the end is working exactly right.

I had expected more of the collaboration between Sesame Street and Zero to Three. Where is the fun and cleverness of Sesame Street? Where is the variety and the creative graphic quality? This video was quite boring and preachy. Particularly Prairie Dawn's mother's comment about music helping with language development. Please, why add that? I was looking forward to a little wackiness from Wayne Brady, but he was dull and repressed as well. Too bad.

If you want to hear great music with a purpose, you will purchase Charity Von's self titled album and anxiously await her second album that is in progress now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This girl ROCKS!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Finally, something new and original. Man...can Charity Von sing! This record is diverse in musical appeal, yet consistent in sound. (FYI, my personal tastes range from Cheryl Crow to Switchfoot.) It's hard to believe that the power vocals on this record come from a barely 19-year old, and did I mention that Charity wrote most of the songs on this record?! Amazing. If the mainstream world catches wind of Charity Von's 'gift'...watch out Ashlee Simpson (and all the other 'wanabees'!!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"This chick sucks!!","review":"I discovered Charity Von on MySpace and thought the one song was interesting. After I purchased the record, I understood what a Christian wanna be Joss Stone would sound like. Her cover of Collective Soul's shine sounds like a demo.If you want something that is original in Christian music, but sounds like 10 other female artist in the mainstream and they sound better. If you like weak vocals, music, and band r&b; songs then buy this record today"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sleepy Tosca","review":"I have many recordings of Tosca, inevitably some are better than others but there is usually something in each one to make me want to hear it again. This recording offers nothing. The voices are passable but the real killer in this disc is the conducting. Michael Tillson Thomas(who I usually like) conducts as if he has just taken a sleeping pill is is trying to ward off the effects. Pacing is so slow you want to uger him on with a \\"Speed it up!\\". The pace picks up once in a while but the overall tone is lugubrious. Too bad as the disc is quite lengthy for highlights and could a been a welcome alternative to listening to a complete recording."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works fine","review":"This thing work fine.

The product works, the taste is horrible. The trick is a little goes a long way and you have to use it all the time. Careful not to eat food with your hands because the taste does transfer. I still chew, but only when I don't apply the cream. The 3 jars are actually a good thing too because I have one in my purse, another at work and the other at home...pretty much no excuse not to apply it!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Why didn't I find this stuff earlier?!","review":"Yikes, this stuff tastes TERRIBLE! It's true, I applied a very small amount on my nails and went about my day. Later, I needed to eat lunch, so I consciously washed my hands with soap and water. I then had the unfortunate experience of tasting this stuff while I was eating - kudos for not being a wimpy product. I'm very impressed. I'm guessing I'm going to have to use this stuff for a while. Yeah, it's pricey, but the cream is a lot more effective than the nail polish products out there. It's about time this 33 year old guy got his nail biting habit under control."},{"rating":"2","title":"Omega 3 is working","review":"My son has had a very bad nail biting/picking habit. I tried several different store brand products that didn't work. Frustrated that he continued to bite, I decided to go on line and try the Omega3 Extra Strength nail biting cream. He has been applying it regularly, and there is a definite improvement!! Each time he puts his hand into his mouth he gets this terrible taste which stops him from doing it. At this time I'm very happy with his progress."},{"rating":"2","title":"stop biting fingers","review":"If you have a problem with biting your cuticles, this is a great product and helped me stop my bad habit. It's much more expensive than nail-polish type aids, but it's the only one I've found that you can actually put on your skin. It works so well that you'll even stop eating finger foods like fries without a fork or knife because you can taste the strong, bitter flavor of the cream. Highly recommend, the product broke a habit I'd had for close to twenty years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"This is a great product and does exactly what it should. I chew my cuticles and when I have the product on I do not chew. Not only does it taste disgusting and bitter it also is hard to get the taste out of your mouth when you do chew and makes it that much more effective. Nail biting polish does nothing for us skin chewers!I recommend applying the product with a q-tip, when I first got it I applied it with my fingers and when you eat and lick your fingers, the yucky taste is there! For cuticles this product will last you for months!! With the three jars you can always have it with you, I have one at work, one in my purse and one in my gym bag. You will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"You have to constantly reapply this cream...and who wants that cream all over your fingers.

I am very disappointed in this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work at all!","review":"Put it on my daughter's fingernails, telling her it was a healing cream instead of a solution to stop nail biting. This way we wouldn't have to struggle. She was very willing. Within ten minutes I saw her biting her nails. I said, \\"doesn't the healing cream taste bad?\\" and she said, \\"No, not really... a little bit a first but then you get used to it really fast.\\" I continued putting it on for a week. Didn't make the slightest bit of difference!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just know it on your nails...","review":"I have been a lifelong, hardcore nail and cuticle biter and just knowing it was on my nails made me very conscious of keeping my hands away from my face. The taste is not that bad (got a taste while eating a sandwich) sort of tastes like antiperspirant, just unpleasant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work","review":"I've been biting my nails for 24 years. I have tried everything! This is yet another product that failed. The lotion makes your hands feel weird, and whenever you wash them or get them wet, the lotion comes off. I wash my hands several times a day and don't have time to keep reapplying this stuff. It also didn't taste as bad as the nail polishes so it didn't stop me. Def. not worth the money at all. Might work on a young kid who just needs to stop sucking their thumb, but if you're a serious nail biter... I would try something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nail biting solution","review":"This is a great product. Omega3 is a lotion that tastes terrible to help you stop biting your nails.

I would only recommend this product to those who really need it as it is quite pricey."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tastes awful but does the job","review":"I bought this stuff to break a long-time nail biting habit and boy, does it work. The cream itself really does the job of smoothing down and hang-nails. Even after washing my hands with soap, the taste of this stuff persists, and it's an instant reminder to keep your hands away from your mouth (which is a good thing, if you have a long-standing habit). It also seems to make my nails grow in stronger. I've used it about two weeks now and can see a definite improvement, much better than anything else I've tried."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breaking the nail-biting habit","review":"So far the product is adquate. I don't like the fact that it transfers to food if touched.........awful taste.

Has to be applied frequently because it washes off so easily. Application is a mess - have to clean up afterwards. Even when it was on it had no noticeable effect.

Yuck!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product","review":"I was recommended this product by a friend, so I ordered it; I felt that the description was very vague though. You get three jars but they are extremely small, about the size of most eye cream jars, so about 0.17 ounces. It's a white cream and seems to be odorless but tastes terrible, it's extremely bitter with a lingering taste; it reminds me of going to the dentist. It does withstand hand washings well and seems to last for the day, plus a little bit goes a long way. The only trick is to ensure it's always applied!"},{"rating":"2","title":"helped me stop biting my nails","review":"Being a nail biter, have tried and tried to stop biting, but could not.

I used it on my 9yr son and on myself. Neither of us had any problem biting our nails through the solution. I even tried putting a heavier amount on my own nails, yet caught myself biting my nails within 20min of applying it. I have attempted to contact the seller, but so far have not heard back from them about returning the product for a refund.

Unfortunately, every time he washed his hands the cream came off and would need to be re-applied. Since I am not with him during the day while he is at school, he can bite his nails all day!

My nails started growing back quickly too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so Great","review":"I was optimistic after reading the mostly positive reviews, however I was highly disappointed. If you don't apply the product several times in heavy coats you don't taste anything and it needs to be reapplied frequently (at least daily). Also, while using the product it seemed that the taste would happen several seconds after going to bite my nails which made it rather ineffective as a control mechanism. And when eating or drinking anything if you just so happen to touch or lick anywhere near your nail it gives your food what seems to be a more bitter and effective bad taste compared to your nails themselves. I started to use a similar nail polish product but did not like the shine and how frequently it needed to be applied but it was much more effective and much cheaper as well. I suggest the nail polish over this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Apparently I'm Immune?","review":"I've been biting my nails for nearly 20 years and I've tried everything to stop. From the nail paints, to filing them so low you'd think I couldn't bite them, to soaking my fingers in cayenne pepper solution. Nothing worked. I was really excited when I saw this online and it had so many high reviews. It had worked for so many people, but it didn't work for me.I can't taste the stuff. I thought that I had not put enough on, but I ended up just putting a good amount on my finger and then deliberately licking it off, and it didn't taste like anything for me. So it was really expensive and doesn't work, I'm quite disappointed. I tried all three containers (which are much MUCH smaller than I expected) thinking one might have been defective, but none of them tasted like anything.I guess just use caution since it's a good hunk of money and I noticed other people couldn't taste it either."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Collection of MP3","review":"What disappointment!!!Only the tracks 2, 5 and 6 of CD1, 4 and 5 of CD2 are sure WAV files.

Shocking. NOT for the weak of heart. I live around the Amish and not in my wildest dreams would i have imagined such perversions! And to think that this man admitted to doing all these things!! I sure would like to know the \\"rest of the story\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Graffic Account of Child Abuse","review":"Yes, I agree this book is graffic and I had a hard time reading certain parts and needed to put the book down. But it addresses a serious epidemic we as a society need to be aware of and address and that is Child Abuse. The author experienced traumatic experiences no human being deserves and I applaud the author for coming forward and more for changing his life when he became an adult. He is reaching out and trying to create awareness which is a good thing! I thought the book was well laid out and written and would of given 5 stars if it had not been for the graffic nature. I wish this Author well and hope he achieves his mission with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic!","review":"Chris Burkholder is a miscreant that lies about his family and the things they alledgedly did. He is the one who has the major problems. From the time he was a little boy, he got \\"release\\" and was \\"thrilled\\" when he killed chickens! And he just got worse from there. This book is a way for him to freak people out and make the Amish out to be bad people. Additionally, he has major issues and is an admitted animal abuser. I do know plenty of Amish families who are normal and happy people. They live green, off the grid, and leave others alone. They are better off without him.Don't waste your money on this one! I am going to use the pages from this book for scratch paper in my hobby room."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not about Amish, this is sick, perverse confession","review":"I wouldn't reconmend this book to ANYONE. I live in a conseritive Mennonite community and have New and Old order Amish friends. From my experence this would never be condoned, and delt with by the Staff and the community. As in most socities, we humans are pron to error, and things do accure,as in most socities, but certianly not the norm. I feel the author was gaining some sort of sick pleasure discribing the abuse and could have brought the issue to light with out the graphics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sensationalist tripe.","review":"This is book falls into the same category as \\"Devil's Playground\\" shockumentary: it represents 0.1% of the culture. If the details he describes are really true and not exaggerated or sensationalized, that's truly sad and unfortunate. Everyone is responsible for their own actions, regardless of what culture they have grown up in. Bottom line though, this is certainly NOT how the majority of the Amish behave.

To those of you who think all Amish are good people read this book its an eye opener and its all true...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disturbing","review":"I hate it when people write reviews for books they didn't finish, but I just couldn't complete this book. In fact, I only got through a few chapters.I was unable to feel any sympathy for the author. First he tries to castrate the family cat. This isn't a funny story. The cat's testicle is hanging out of his body. Then he steals chickens from the family chicken coop to take them down by the river to kill them for sport. He buries the corpses, knowing the family dog will dig them up and take the blame for the deaths, which will result in the dog being repeatedly beaten. Eventually the family shoots the dog for the author's transgressions. I can't help but feel the author deserved a couple of beatings for all this.Judging from other reviews, it only got worse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very strongly recommended to students of contemporary Amish or Mennonite culture","review":"Amish Confidential: The Bishop's Son Shatters The Silence by Chris Burkholder (the son of an Amish bishop) is the author's autobiography of his childhood and upbringing among the Amish. Delving deeply into the true terrors of the incest, child abuse, rape, bestiality, and terrifying violence that are the obscured realities and occasioned elements of Amish life, Amish Confidential defies the common view of the religion as non-violent, while defining its constructs as brainwashing based upon the first-hand experiences of the author whose excommunication from father, home, community, and faith sent him into a life amidst the 'sinful and condemned world'. Amish Confidential is very strongly recommended to students of contemporary Amish or Mennonite culture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amish Confidential","review":"This author's Amish background was nothing short of brutal, abusive, and perverse. It makes anyone who is enamored with the Plain life rethink the idea. The cruelity shown in equal measure to both children & animals is shocking. There is little room for respect of women among the Amish either in this story. This book gives a look on the flip-side of Amish life that is not all about whoopie pies, quilts, or horse & buggies. A disconcerting read to be sure, but worthwhile to know how the author fares despite his harsh upbringing. I hope there is a sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgusting!","review":"I am not Amish but live near Lancaster County PA. I have read several books about Amish culture and lifestyles. In some of those books there is verbiage on some child abuse. Do I believe it happens, yes...do I believe that Chris Burkholder was so abused...that is not something that I can say or not say. But what I do believe is that Chris Burkholder is using this book to make a couple of bucks and I was one of the fools who purchased it! How he repeatedly discusses the sexual activites in his book is digusting. I read the entire book hoping it would get better, it never did. I would not recommend this book to anyone..please do not help in Chris Burkholders get rich quick scheme like I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grossed out and disturbed!","review":"I can't believe that this guy is a good representative of the Amish people. Rather, it seemed to be an odd account of child abuse mixed in with sex with animals. Bizarre, disturbing, and something that's better left alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"The book was poorly written and repeatedly informed the reader of \\"doing it\\" with farm animals and beatings by his father. More details about daily life beyond sneaking out, getting drunk, and brawling would have been more interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes me sick!!","review":"Aside from the fact that this book is very poorly written, the author tells us of the abuse that he inflicted on others (human and animals). He doesn't give the reader any indication that he was ever sorry. The account of drowning the kitten made me have to stop reading. I can't imagine that this book has a happy ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!","review":"I have read the book, and can say that I am glad I did not waste my money buying it. The book is not well written and is not at all what I expected to read about. If you are thinking this will educate you as to the beliefs, rituals, and inner workings of the Amish community, then you are in for a rude awakening. Instead you read about one man's sexual depravity and deliquency growing up, a depravity and delinquency that could be found in any community not just the Amish. Those acts he described in the book served no purpose other than to embarrass himself and others.I live in one of the towns mentioned in the book, and know many of the people he refers to in the book. It is not impossible to imagine that many of the acts of abuse(physical and sexual) of both human and animal may have been embellished.If you feel the need to read the book I at least encourage you to borrow it. Put your money towards something more useful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Product to small","review":"I purchased this product, it was not fitted for size.

Now I need to wait a few months before I can continue on the exciting journey with Aiden and Meg. The Falconer children are resourceful and on the run. With two groups hunting them -- the police and an assasin, the action never stops.A very good choice for reluctant readers or middle schoolers looking for an adventure story.

I would recommend this to anyone even if you do not have any skin problems or sensitivities."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lightweight cleanser that is gentle","review":"Not the cheapest foaming cleanser on the block, especially since it dispenses foamed product. It'll last you about 3 weeks of twice daily use. It's very light but is able to provide a nice cleanse for morning use. Doesn't strip moisture so if you are used to that squeaky tight feeling (bad), this will not do it for you. Not really seeing any difference in complexion quality but at least it's maintaining and has a nice afterwash feel. It will not work for even light makeup and or high oil skin.

I mean at least world tour I got 20+ hours with and got half of the achievements but this one..I put 10-15 hours in and got nothing out of it.The achievements in this game are quite difficult and they require hours and hours of dedication and time.I got this game assuming it would be like Rumble Roses XX. Fun, good replay value, and grab some achievements along the way. Granted Rumble Roses achievements are hard too and require an ample amount of time to get but its no where close to this game. The only good thing about this game is that because it was so bad it was fun to show friends how bad it was and make them go down the terribly long and hard water slide."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a little upgrade from the first","review":"This game is the same like the first one for xbox. The only new thing is just jet raceing the rest are the same, they could had done more then just put partial nudity cause this game got boaring quick. When i first heard this game was comeing out i thought their was going to be more fun and exitment but when i played it i thought i was playing the first cause their was nothing really different exept jet raceing and some new music witch i did'nt really care for. The jet raceing was a little fun it was'nt that great but the rest was just the same. The same stuff include vollyball, pool hopskotch, relaxing near the water, buying new clothe's and figer and nail polish, and that's it they just added jet raceing. So this game was no good they should had done more in this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"DOA - Junk","review":"Okay, I picked this game up because the first one was so much fun and the graphics were awesome. This one however was a let down. They changed the game play of the volleyball so much that I don't enjoy playing that part of the game. They did however add jet skies and that takes up all my time on this game. They tried to do too much and changed what wasn't broken. Overall it's a let down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just doesn't work","review":"Don't bother. The best part of the game is the intro movie that leads up to the title screen. It goes all downhill from there. The controls of just about every game just don't really work all that well. Trying to get these girls to be your friends is just not worth the aggrevation as they always get mad and leave you for seemingly unknown reasons. And then you need to have friends to play volleyball, so you end up stuck just lapping around a lake in a jet ski.I will be honest in that I only gave this game about an hour of playtime. If there is more to unlock if you stick through the annoyances, I don't know... it isn't all that clear.

First the unit kept saying the battery was dead, I'd take the battery out and replace with a new one and a few days later it would read dead again. I'd check the batteries with a tester and they were perfect. Then the unit would reset itself right after I set the parameters. Then the memory would read \\"full\\" right after I downloaded the data. I think you get the picture. I sent it back with the $5.00 check and it cost me $5.00 to send it. This is 1/3 of the cost of the unit. I'm still waiting to get it back. I guess you could buy a cheaper pedometer and consider it disposable when it breaks. This unit is nice when it works but Mine stopped working. You'll have to make up your own mind because I'm still on the fence about this pedometer. I'm beginning to think everything made in China is disposable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to use, software lacks features","review":"This pedometer seems to be very accurate, and the software was a snap to install. They've made nice design improvements, such as putting the reset button in a recessed area on the back. Improvements that I would like to see are (1) it would be nice if the pedometer would track aerobic calories & miles separate from overall daily totals, and (2) the software does not allow for any manual adjustments to what the pedometer tracks. For example, if I did a stairmaster workout, which Omron's product does not track very well, I cannot enter that workout in the Omron software."},{"rating":"2","title":"Accurate and Easy - Get one and get moving!","review":"We got 2 of these about a month ago. We calibrated them easily using a measuring wheel to accurately assess distance. The units do a better job of counting steps than any other pedometers we have used. The unit comes with a holder with a built-in clip and a supplementary lanyard with a clip. I found out that I need both of them because I am pretty active and the built-in clip does not always stay attached to my pants. Be aware that pedometers are for walking. Use a Nike+ with your iPod or a Garmin when you go running. The software is pretty intuitive and the installation did not cause any problems on our computers, which are running Windows XP. If you are at least modestly computer literate, you should have no problems with it. The software is the reason why we bought these.

There is a little cord and that holds, so it doesn't fall to the ground, but it is a little annoying.

This one was so highly rated that I thought I had finally met \\"the one.\\" However, like all the cheap and free ones I've had in the past, this pedometer also disappointed. Things went well for our first few dates, but on our fourth day together I accidently knocked it, and it fell off my belt loop. The blasted thing lost not only my steps for the day, but all the programmed info, and it's no easy task setting the thing. So I packed it back up, and now it occupies space on my desk. I plan to donate it to Goodwill.Maybe a less clumsy and technologically challenged person will have better luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Serious design flaw","review":"From the first day that I used this unit, I could not keep it from falling out of the manufacturer provided belt clip. The unit does not \\"click\\" into place...it basically just sits there in the clip...my first day out with it, it fell out of the clip and I to go back, retracing my steps to find it in the grass...when it doesn't fall out of the clip, the clip and unit fall off whatever I try to clip it to...I have tried my belt, tried my pants pocket, tried the waist of my jeans with no belt...every time I used it, it fell off...I never used it for running...just walking...and it still fell off...the design is flawed and I would not recommend this to anyone until the design is changed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disppointed","review":"At first I was delighted. As advertised the Omron not only calculated the walking actvity on the unit,the software gave you the abilty to see on my PC a graph of my daily,weekly and total progress. After 2 weeks however, the Data download would not function. Despite several attempts to fix and uninstall,the data would download to 50% and then an error message would occur without explanation.I will be sending the unit back to Omron and hope that their customer service is better than their product has shown to be. I am keeping a manual log, but that is not what I envisioned when I ordered what I thought was a reliable product. Disapponted!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, but not at any angle.","review":"I really like the fact that this pedometer not only measures steps, but also aerobic steps, distance traveled, and calories consumed. I love the fact that I don't have to track my steps on a daily basis as the device remembers this data and I can log it when I get around to it. The software it comes with is decent and shows graphs of the data and lets me set goals for steps and aerobic steps.I was a little misled by the advertising that says you can simply throw it in your purse or pocket and it works just fine. It actually has to be upright by at least a 45 degree angle or it does not work. So I still clip it to my belt loop or pocket where there are already too many things attached."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay pedometer","review":"I landed up returning it...it was not accurate in my experience.

Works with Vista.","review":"I have never had a pedometer before and the only reason I got one was to get a more accurate daily calorie usage listing. I was worried this would be one of those things I would buy and eventually stop using. Its not going to be that way though. I just keep it with the rest of my stuff (keys, cell phone, wallet) throw it in my pocket and I am good to go. I usually sync it with my computer once or twice a day. Its actually really cool. I like knowing how many steps I take, and the included software breaks it down by hour, day, week, and month. It only takes about 5 seconds to sync and to my suprise it works on WINDOWS VISTA even though it did not say so and many users had said it wouldnt. I am running Windows Vista Ultimate 32 bit and it installed and works fine. One of the best buys I have made in a while and I definetly do not regret buying it.-David"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disapointed with this pedometer","review":"There are two things I really like about this product. The software works great and it is nice to be able to track your progress. I love the resetting itself at midnight.There are many things I do not like about it. It seems to \\"stall\\". It will not record steps and then suddenly takes a jump and adds lots at one time. You cannot track your excercise on a stationary bicycle no matter where you place it. If you are on your riding lawnmower, it adds steps like crazy.The size is too bulky. It is very awkward to wear. I wish I had not given my other pedometers away. They were much less expensive and I liked them better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not happy right now.","review":"Just received this product. Took 4 days even though its supposed to be 2 day prime.

Definitely worth the small extra price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missed Steps","review":"I had been using a cheap pedometer for a while and bought this one because I liked the uploadable tracking functions. The first couple of times I wore it, I periodically tested to see whether it was counting my steps correctly because my step count seemed really low and found out that it was missing a LOT of steps! It didn't count any steps when I went up or down stairs, and no matter where I clipped the thing, it counted steps inaccurately. I switched back to my $5 pedometer which never fails to count correctly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pedometer","review":"Loved this, it is what I was looking for UNTIL my husband wanted to try it and lost it on the 2nd day after I received it.

The clip that comes with this pedometer is of extremely poor design. It falls off of your waist band. The second day of use, I lost it. It was a busy day and I have no idea where it fell off. I contacted the company requesting a new one be sent or at least some sort of credit towards another one, explaining what had happened. Well, if you can't return the product they will do nothing for you. Of course it is impossible to return an item that has been lost due to poor design. I have no idea how good the product is.

I don't usually wear a watch, and this model also tells the time on its main screen - a little extra convenience for me.I recommend that the unit be secured secondarily with the clip-on strap that comes with it, in case the main clip happens to be knocked off (or if you carry the pedometer in your pocket - my husband had his pedometer fall out of his pocket and did not find it for a couple of days).I particularly like the fact that it can accurately record steps whether you have it attached to your clothing or even just in a pocket (or purse - have not tried using it in my purse, since I don't carry my purse with me all over the house!).GREAT pedometer - especially for the price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product!","review":"This product s great.

The reports are great and the upload of information is very simple. But that's the best that I can say right now. I thought it was a fluke when the pedometer stopped working the first time after about 6 weeks. There was no warning, the pedometer had not been abused or dropped and it simply quit working. Replaced the battery - nothing. Sent it back to the company for a replacement which came after 2 weeks.That one lasted for 4 weeks. It was working fine in the morning and after coming back from a 10 mile hike, the pedometer display was blank. No flashing display to warn me that the battery was going to die. It simply stopped working and I lost about 3 weeks of data. I'm not impressed with the lack of durability of the unit and am very disappointed. I've only had this since June!

Their download information states I can manually enter the data into their program. Are you kidding me?????? What a waste. I'm probably going to send this thing back. It's useless to me.

The software that comes with it shows me in a nice graph how many miles I've walked, how many I've calories burned, and how many fat calories I've burned. It's also handy for when I go to the gym and I'm doing a more strenuous workout; it will then count the aerobic steps I've done. I can also set a daily goal within the software of how many steps, aerobic steps, calories I want do or burn.I would say the only down fall is I wish the clip was little more secure.

I have also lost a lot of pedometers, so I appreciate the clip on the Omron. Although pedometers can be bulky, whether tucked in a pocket or clipped on a waistband, this is less cumbersome than most.The real benefit is that you download the information and have graphs to show the number of steps/aerobic steps/whether you've achieved your goal etc. This puts the accountability right out there: I find that very motivating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Instant motivation for walkers.","review":"Having a pedometer is a great motivation for getting you out to walk every day. Setting goals of 10000 steps is easier if you can measure what you do. Once you get started you relish being able to see what you've accomplished. Plus, it helps you get out there on the days when you don't really feel like it.What I really like about this one is that it has a clock so I know how much time I have left (before I have to get home and get ready for work) and I CAN SEE THE NUMBERS!!!My goal is 100 miles a month. What's yours?"},{"rating":"1","title":"stopped working 2 days past return window :-(","review":"This thing was pretty cool for about a month.

Basically, there are two reasons why this product wasn't granted 5 stars: 1)Units are only presented in their imperial form i.e. there is no provisions for the metric system and, 2) When it is stored in your pocket, the pedometer gets tricked when you unconsciously shake your leg."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy customer","review":"I am very happy with this product. Took me a moment to figure it out, but once I did, I was off and running - literally. I like the volume of info provided; total miles, calories burned, aerobic steps, and excursion time. What makes it worth its weight, is the database tracking software included with the device. It is Windows compatible (only) though, so be careful if you operate a MAC, UNIX or other platform.

I called Omron and they promised to send out two leashes. Never happened. And you can't buy them.So one of my pedometers finally fell out of my pocket and is gone. And another phone call and I'm told that there is only a one year warranty on the pedometer and that they don't expect it to last more than a year, so it's lasted far beyond what they would have expected. I feel that something I pay this amount of money for should last longer than a year, but evidently I'm wrong. So they wouldn't send me out another leash, so I guess I might as well toss this last pedometer out and buy another one, and you can bet it won't be an Omron.

Cuz lets admit it: sometimes you just don't want to go! But with my headset, and my Omron I get through all six miles. The excitement is seeing all those steps add up! And this one is incredible: it calculates how many FAT calories you've burned. My heart rate monitor doesn't even do that! It really is a great little gadget with this software program. I kept a log daily via Excel. Now I just download it into my laptop and its all calculated for me. How rewarding is that? I lost over 115lbs 24 years ago through hard core walking and proper nutrition so I wouldn't go a day without my Pedometer. It's like my 'best friend' when I walk.

It worked fine till the first battery change then, the device that detects movement, i.e., counts your steps, just quit working.

If one does not offload the data, it stops working. Moreover, if it is given as a gift and one has a Mac, the software is useless (and one cannot download the data and the item stops working). Another problem is that the software uses MS Access as a back end and Access database files of the vintage are highly likely to become corrupt (which it has several times over the last four years). By the way, it has been four years and they are yet to update the software, which should say something as well. So while I would say that it is a great pedometer, the promise behind the software is not worth the cost.

It tracks a lot of information: steps, arobic steps, distance, calories burned. It has a clock. It is streamlined and small. The belt clip is removable. The package also includes a CD that enables a person to hook up to the computer to keep track of the information over time. I have not tried that yet, but this is a feature that could be very useful.

The first one I accidentally washed and thinking it didn't survive, ordered another. After drying it out, it still works so I gave it to a close friend.

I'm looking forward to a summer of walking to better health."},{"rating":"2","title":"I am enjoying having this","review":"I am just starting to be able to walk and am enjoying that it tracks aerobic steps as well as daily steps. I love that I put in my pocket when I get up then look at it at night. My range is from 69 steps to 6000 steps, it has been wonderful to print reports (combined with my blood pressure) to show my dr how my leg has been doing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Omron HJ-720ITC pedometer","review":"This is a nice pedometer which accurately measures distance, and records number of steps taken, and the proportion of those steps taken that are aerobic. So, just walking about at work does not cut it. You have to do some extended walking before you see that you are doing some aerobic walking exercise. The software is PC only, but it will work in Windows running under bootcamp on an Intel Mac. It will not run under a PC emulator such as Parallels. This pedometer seems to work well whether you put it into a pocket, such as a shirt pocket or on your belt. Highly recommended. I only give it four stars, rather than five, because the software will not work on a Mac."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Pedometer!","review":"My husband and I recently purchased the Omron HJ-720ITC Pocket Pedometers and we love them.

I got it for my father how had a stroke about 18 months ago and now has came to some depression.

Now with pedometer he is moving/walking a little better and more with desire to see results. This pedometer comes with software which is great! Now we set every month new goals for my father and downloading results every week or even sooner. He likes to see how he does and software shows everyhting he wants to know.

I like that the pedometer resets itself each day. Having the device motivates me to get out and walk every day so I don't have a blank spot on my chart. Since I started using this device, my wife has purchased one and we purchased the heart rate monitor, all of which can download to the same program on my computer, making graphing progress and printing reports a breeze."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uses batteries like crazy","review":"The pedometer itself is OK. It tends to overestimate steps, but I don't think a perfect pedometer exists, short of attaching sensors to your legs. As long as you use the same one, it will presumably overestimate all the time, meaning you can at least compare measurements across the same pedometer.My main problem with this pedometer, and the cause for its low score, is how often this thing goes through batteries. I go through a battery every 3 weeks, so in a year, I expect I will go through almost 20 batteries. Yow! The pedometer itself may be relatively cheap, but 20 batteries a year for a glorified wrist watch is an amazing feat.I am not surprised to see that the Omron sometimes gets packaged with a set of replacement batteries. That's not a very good sign ...Anyway, buyer beware."},{"rating":"2","title":"pedometer","review":"I've used a lot of cheap pedometers, like give aways etc. and they haven't worked very well. I am very pleased with this one. The only frustration is that is doesn't stay clipped to a waistband very well. Thank goodness for the safety clip. It works great in a pocket.

Turns out it's because of my weight they don't sit right over my belly.this is built for overweight people and is worth every extra penny.The ability to track on the computer is even better.I've lost 4 pounds since I started using it.

The setup is a bit complicated, but if you read and follow the manual, it's not horrific. I do have a problem with the design of the belt clip. I find either the clip disengaging from my belt, or, the unit leaving the clip. The tether has saved me a few times from loosing the unit. Currently I'm using it by storing it in a small pouch that is attached firmly to my belt, but I continue to search for a bit better mechanism. It's the only thing keeping me from giving it 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Planned Self-destruction?","review":"I bought my pedometer in February 2008, and worked fine for about 20 months. That's when it chose to stop downloading any data, using their software program.I called Omron, who suggested that I try downloading the pedometer's data to Microsoft HealthVault. I tried, and it failed there, too. The site's diagnosis was a faulty memory in the pedometer.I called Omron back, and the cheerful lady observed that my one-year warranty had expired, and that it would probably be cheaper to buy a new one, rather than repair the one I had. She even gave me a phone number, where I could order a new one. I didn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Pedometer","review":"The pedometer is easy to use and seems to be accurate. I particularly like the fact that the pedometer stores daily data and resets itself at midnight. No need to clear out or reset each day. The software is also top notch and downloading the data from the pedometer is easy. My only negative thought is that the belt clip is a little small and is easily dislodged. Must be why they provide a safety clip to keep it from falling!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT product at a fantastic price","review":"I purchased this pedometer about a week ago. It looked to have all of the features and wanted and more. I chose this one because it was only 4-5 dollars more than without the software, so why not spend the extra few bucks? It also looked easy to use and I loved the PC software for it. I was not disappointed. The only thing I haven't done is put in the correct distance per step so my mileage is off, but that's not a big deal to me right now. It is really easy to use, and you can download and update your data at any time you want. Resets itself just as it should at midnight. I like that I can set goals and track what times during the day I was most active. The aerobic step counter and timer helps me see how long I have really been walking. A 15 minute walk is about 2,000 steps so if I am short that day, I just go for a brisk 15 min walk. It keeps me on top of how much I am moving on a daily basis and to get my big butt off of the couch and walk outside!"},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE THIS PRODUCT!","review":"I love this pedometer, it works great.

Its ease of changing between modes challenges me to do better each day.then every five or six days I hook it up to my pc and download the info for me to study and seek out improvements to my walks. I can count just the daily steps or change to an aerobic mode and count those steps so I am able to get in 30 min of cardio. or I can change the mode to mileage to see how far I have walked. and I love being able to just slide it into my pocket if I so wish and stll have it calculating my steps.

It was surprisingly difficult to find one that was for jogging versus walking but this one kept coming up. I received it be I am unable to install the software as I get an error. They have no support what so ever. There is a website but when you click on support you fill out a form that ends with 'suggestion form' and you never hear back from any one. So I cannot use the software. The other problem I have is I cannot find any way to start and stop it at a specific time, when I am excercising. It is designed to be worn all the time and just keeps adding up the days total steps. I would not recommend this to a walker or a runner based on the lack of support and limited capabilities."},{"rating":"1","title":"completely inadequate belt holder","review":"The belt holder has a very small clasp that's fairly low on the back of the pedometer.I had it for TWO DAYS and today it fell off without my noticing.

Its supposed to work like a digital watch except it also counts steps. I read somewhere (in the manual?) that the provided battery is good for 6 months for counting 10000 steps per day.After that you have to unscrew the screw and replace it.

This is good as the belt clip is worthless. If I had not tied on the strap, the pedometer would have been lost many times. Also, this pedometer is only compatible with older versions of Windows, not Vista, nor is it Macintosh compatible.

I have verified it's mileage accuracy against machines and trail posts, and it has matched every time to the tenths. The only negative is that minute running bursts are not recorded in the aerobic steps for correct calorie calculation, although, again, the mileage is correct.

Once I got it, I never stopped wearing it! I was trying to lose around 5-10 pounds and it was so motivating. I found myself walking more and more, even if it was just around the house. As a college student, I love it because I am more inclined to walk more to get more steps. The average amount of steps you should get a day is 10,000 but I often find myself getting 15,000 or even higher. It has a 7day memory, counts your steps, aerobic steps, calories burned, grams of fat burned, and distance. I'm not sure if it's 100% accurate but it seems pretty good.

Within three days I noticed that it needed to be reset so I had to go through the time set up and the stride calculations. ABout every day or two the screen would flash off and again I would reset the numbers. Within a week after this, it bummed out completely. I changed the battery. Still nothing.

I had 4 other pedometers previous to purchasing this one. The software is simple to use and save me the time of having to enter the daily data as I had to do with the others.As to its mechanical design, the only flaw is the holding clip. It will not hold the pedometer clipped to running shorts or a belt when running hard since it tends to slip, it is too short. I resolved the problem by drilling a small hole at the end of it and inserting a small screw with a sharp point so it can grab the cloth without slipping. As I mentioned before, it is extremelly accurate and silent except when used when exercising in an eliptical machine; it undercounts the number of steps by about 40%. But this problem was also experienced with the other pedometers I previously used.Despite the above shortfalls, it is best I have owned.Jose"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome buy for the price","review":"Pros: This product is easy to use and setup. The software is also easy to install and use...without the need of instructions.

It shows up later in the software, but not on the device itself.Used: while walking and running."},{"rating":"1","title":"bought for running, can be used for walking only","review":"I got this piece to measure mainly the distance and the calories burnt during my runs. It doesn't work this way. The maximum step is 4 feet, when my regular is 5 feet long average. It's showing incorrect data, i.e. when I run longer distances than a day before, it'd show otherwise.The software is not user friendly. It took me quite a while to find out how to switch from one screen to another. I am about to give it away to my kid to play with it.

With I know how far I walk/jog, the number of calories I burn (also grams of fat burned) and the time it took me to travel the distance. I can also store all that information on my computer in the form of an organized chart, for revision. It is easy to use too. Although setting it to zero before an activity is a bit of a challenge even if it comes with a manual. It auto sets to zero at 12 midnight. If I prematually start it and want to get back to zero it does not seem to be able to do that unless you reset it. Then you may have to reenter all your data. Other than that, I highly recommend this device."},{"rating":"2","title":"pedometer","review":"I like this pedometer for the fact that I can carry it in my pocket or my purse.

It is vertually care free as I can where it in multiple ways depending on what I am wearing from day to day. I love that I can set goals and the computer keeps track of how I am doing. I also like that it zeros out at midnight and keeps track of steps each day without my having to adjust anything. My only problem, which I hope they solve is this: I sometimes forget to take it off my clothes or out of my pocket and end up washing it. I have three jobs...it is inevitable that I will accidentally wash it again. So I would like to see the pedometer made water proof...not water resistant, but water proof. If I kill this one by washing I will not buy another until I can get one that can withstand my lifestyle.

Uploading data to a computer couldn't be easier, with the included USB cable. The included software keeps a record of your activity.

Easy to activate and setup, and tracking the week's steps with the \\"history\\" function is a snap. I have not used the computer transmission function, but plan to this summer. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the belt clip needs to be a little longer/tighter, in the event that you wear it on a waistband that isn't extremely sturdy. I have dropped mine SEVERAL times as a result of it slipping off my waistband from a sitting position (I wear it all day). When I wear with jeans or belted pants, its fine, but if I have on cotton running pants or some other light material, the belt clip is too loose to do the job. However, I suppose the good news is, even with all those \\"drops,\\" it still works great. As a bonus, I wasn't even sure my husband would use his, but he tracks his activity daily too because he likes it so much. Would recommend it to anyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Pedometer...

This device shows plenty on it's digital display, but the holder is poorly designed and in the 5 days since i have had it, it has fallen off my belt twice. the company provides a tether for the unit that you can clip to your pocket in case it falls off, but to me that is a band-aid and a bad one at that. the holder plan and simple should have a deep enough clip to sit over your belt or pocket instead of on top of it. that would minimize the danger of losing it. also, it comes with the tether which didn't seem clear since amazon noted that others bought a tether available separately (as did I only to find out i didn't need it since one was in the box)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very frustrating","review":"I love this product, but it keeps failing on me.

Why the History Channel continues to use this outmoded format for their DVD releases is a mystery. Even cheap direct to video DVD releases are in anamorphic format. I can author a disc in anamorphic format on my home PC so it can't be that hard or expensive to do.If you have an older home theater system, this disc being letterboxed may not matter to you but if you have a HDTV with your DVD player connected via HDMI, it is likely that you will not be able to watch this in other than letterbox format without lowering the resolution of your system.Come on, History Channel, move your DVD releases into the 21st Century."},{"rating":"2","title":"So worth it","review":"This is definitely a good buy.

My favorites are the title track, And our feelings, Never keeping secrets, and When can I see you again. He is one of the best songwriters and producers I have ever heard, however I have to say that his work for other artists(TLC, Boyz II Men, Whitney Houston, Mariah Carey, ect.) is better than the material he writes for himself. Overall a perfect album for cuddling up with your loved one or for weeping when relationships don't work out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Are you willing to Never Mind?","review":"\\"A man can do what he wants, but not want what he wants.\\" Arthur Schopenhauer"},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy Fast-faced read that keeps you guessing","review":"A fast paced suspense novel with cliff-hangers at the end of every short chapter that makes you keep turning the pages until you reach the end. Never disappointed by Mary Higgins Clark. Introduces a handful of characters, each with a motive and each with many secrets that slowly get unveiled throughout the book until the answers reveal itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mary Higgins Clark has lost her intrigue!","review":"I used to look forward to every new offering by MHC; however, in 'I HEARD THAT SONG BEFORE', she seems to have lost her ability to inspire.She only seems able to write about an 'elite society' that is foreign to most readers. The Carringtons are filty rich but her rambling on with familiar modifiers and boring details has finally taken its toll on this reader.She might only be able to recapture my interest IF she were to write about some 'ordinary folk' like those offered by the alphabet mystery heroine, Sue Grafton.This book was a waste of my time and, I suspect, that of many of her previous loyalists."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good MHC novel","review":"I have read almost all Mary Higgins Clark's books, and I couldn't hardly put this one down (except when I had to). There are many suspects, as well as some unexplained deaths (suicides or murders?). This does lead to many characters to keep track of, so if you don't keep up reading it; you may need to reread parts. I would recommend it for any Mary Higgins Clark fan or any fan of mystery/suspense novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been better","review":"I think the fact that I found the heroine, Kay rather vapid and her husband Peter Carrington, one dimensional, turned me off on this book. There was some suspense concerning who killed Susan Althorp and Grace Carrington and what happened to Kay's father. Kay was rabidly loyal to her husband arrested as a suspect for murder but there was little shown about their relationship and what led them to marry in the first place.It's a page turner but there are some long stretches and also the conclusion left (at least to me) some unresolved issues for Kay."},{"rating":"2","title":"Murder, Glitz, and Glamour","review":"A nice look into the life of two families living a glitz and glamorous life: Carrington vs. Althorp.(The names says it all). Nice historical link to the Lindbergh kidnapping. Very nice light reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heard that Song Before","review":"I've read all of MHC's books and this is pure drivel. I started reading this book back in March and probably won't finish it. I even went back to see if it was written by someone else and she just put her name on it. The characters are barely one dimensional. There is absolutely no interest sparked in finding out more about them. What I've read so far has been a total waste of time and certainly not in keeping with MHC's style."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Heard that song Before","review":"It's time for MHC to pack up her computer. She has lost the knack of writing good novels. The killer is obvious from the beginning; the motive is so obvious I wonder why I bothered to read it. Read instead, Karin Slaughter, Brian Freeman, Harlan Coben, Joy Fielding."},{"rating":"1","title":"Borrrring!!! Major Disappointment!","review":"I have read every Mary Higgins Clark book, and was anticipating reading this one. I didn't feel any attachment to any of the characters, and the story moved so slowly! Basically it was boring and not worth my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"No thanks.","review":"In the past, I have generally enjoyed reading Mary Higgins Clark books, but this one fell short of my expectations. The characters were unlikeable as well as unrealistic, the plot merely pieced together, the switch from first to third person annoying, and the ending abrupt with your typical \\"happily ever after\\". She has written other excellent books, but this is not one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I'm a huge MHC fan and have read all of her books, but this one was terribly disappointing.All the characters were unlikeable, none more so than the two leads, Peter and Kay. Their relationship was unrealistic and never developed past what seemed to be blind adoration over nothing. The PI everyone kept hiring seemed to pull theories out of thin air and then suddenly they were exactly what actually went down. This book was just totally not believable.A very disappointing effort by MHC."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been better edited","review":"This is the first book I have read by Mary Higgins. I am very fond of suspense novels and was eager to try one of her books. But I was left unsatisfied by the flow of this book.The plot, though straight forward, seemed convoluted for the purpose of audience. The story moves from a first person commentary to third person speech so fast that one needs to make sure to read the next line to realize who the speaker is. The biggest disappointment though was that the novel did not maintain integrity/continuity with the facts mentioned just a few pages earlier. A better proof reading needs to be done before publication.Although I have to admit that the suspense was taut, the above mentioned points kept spoiling my enthusiasm and I just hoped that Mary's next book will be better and crisply edited."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Heard That Song Before","review":"I enjoyed this book a bit more than my last by Mary Higgins Clark. I like a mystery that keeps me guessing and this one certainly did. I never did figure it out until they explain it in the book. The plot line was intriquing and the story moved at a decent pace. A good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Murder, She Wrote?","review":"This book was suspenseful enough to keep me reading it. I've never read any MHC books before, so I'm not sure if they're written the same. The story was good, but the writing was off. It felt like she switched perspective too often (never quite sure who \\"I\\" is, for example.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horribile!!","review":"This book was one of the worst I have ever attempted to read. The characters were flat. The plot was lame. I tried to read it but gave up after the female character married an older man without the author ever describing the romance. There are so many things wrong with this book.... Don't waste your time or money on this one!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Might have been a short story","review":"I have read all of Mary Higgins Clark's mysteries and found this one a huge disappointment. I found it almost totally lacking in the kind of tension and suspense that made her other books page turners. In fact i twice skipped 50 pages just to \\"get on with it.\\" I was curious who the real killer was but that question was raised at the beginning and resolved at the end with very little in between."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, No Depth, Easily Forgettable","review":"This book was awful. There was so many characters in the book it was hard to keep up. The book was just one big investigation with a different person being \\"interrogated\\" in just about every page. There was little on the relationship between the husband and wife. They just off and got married, there was no discussion of their dating and the true bond they supposedly created. Thus, the relationship seemed artificial and stupid. The whole book was just lame, the ending was just disappointing and the characters are easily forgettable. I'll never read it again"},{"rating":"2","title":"I Love Mary Higgins Clark","review":"I started buying only paperback books because I can donate them to the hospital afterwards. Sometimes the patients are too weak to hold a heavy hardbound book. However, I had to get this book as soon as it came out and I'm so glad I did. The author weaves new charcters in and out of the short chapters and then expertly ties it all together at the end. Perhaps I'm not much of a sleuth but I never \\"catch\\" the criminal and I enjoy being wrong every time. Keep up the good work Mary."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful","review":"This was a great book. I'm a big fan of Mary Higgins Clark.I would reccommend to all of her fans"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read for Mary Higgins Clark Fans","review":"I enjoyed the book, it kept me guessing most of the time. There were several threads to the mystery that were woven together well. While maybe not her best work, it was an interesting, enjoyable read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down","review":"It was better than expected. I have guessed the ending in almost all her books but this one was a bit of a surprize. As alway it was entertaining. Finished it in two days.

You were kept guessing with what was happening next.It was a hard book to put down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dreams Come True","review":"Kay's dreams of growing up and living in a mansion come true.I enjoyed this book very much and read it in one afternoon. I kept thinking I had it figured out and then something else would steer me in another direction.It seems that everyone figured it out at the same time, which was just in time to keep Kay safe.It was not as suspenseful as some of her other books, but it was definitely a page turner.If you liked any other Mary Higgins Clark book you will like this one as well.It earned 4.5 stars!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Her Best","review":"MHC tackles the subject of sleepwalking in this one - as well as sundry themes and ideas she has traversed extensively in her earlier books. This one is surprisingly unengaging. I never connected with the heroine at all. On one page, Kay Lansing tells us the cloud of suspicion following mega-rich Peter Carrington, the man she has met once.On the very next page, they get married.Huh?I am wondering if Clark was sleepwalking herself when she wrote this. I knew by page 20 who the bad guy was because she telegraphed it.The plot never really came together, but still I kept reading. Why? because I couldn't quite believe how bad it was.If she was a new writer, Clark wouldn't get past the publishing house's initial slush pile with a book as bizarre and half-baked as this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeps You Guessing","review":"This is typical Mary Higgins Clark, full of devious characters motivated to murder someone. The heroine, Kay, is married to the multi-millionaire suspected of murdering an ambassador's daughter years ago and later drowning his first wife.Although a newlywed, Kay feels she knows her husband well enough to know he wouldn't hurt anyone. Still evidence keeps pointing to him and he's in jail waiting for trial. As Kay searches for bits of clues, hoping to uncover another suspect, the danger increases for her.The author spices it up with enough hints to make the reader suspect everyone. Additional mysteries form subplots to keep readers intrigued. Did Kay's father commit suicide years ago or ??? What secret do the faithful servants hide? Did her husband marry Kay to prevent her from testifying to a childhood memory that might incriminate him? What was the meaning of the song she heard before the first murder?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great book from the Queen of Mystery","review":"Kay Lansing wants to know who she heard when she was a child in a chapel, and if her husband is involved.This book, the latest from Mary Higgins Clark, is a thrilling story. Clark continues her reign as the queen of mystery, although this isn't my favorite of her books. Her characters are well developed and the plot flows nicely.My own complaint is with the new use of first person- Clark began using it in her last novel, and to me it detracts from the otherwise great story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Page after Page kept my interest","review":"My close friend knew I was a fan of MHC and gave me this book to read. She insisted that I would truly enjoy it. I have a number of Mary Higgins Clark's novels and I enjoyed most of them. I didn't think this book was one of MHC better stories, but still it was a wonderful read. The descriptions and the personalities of the characters were a bit thin and it would have been nice if the author had included more descriptive characteristics, especially the main character. The plot was interesting and about half way through the book I was antsy trying to digest one clue after another and each time I thought I had discovered the villain. Overall, it was an easy read and there were a few surprises. A good book for the beach."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gripping until the End!","review":"Mary Higgins Clark is truly a gifted writer. She is one that I have been reading since my teens."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Sorry to say I am not thrilled with MHC's books anymore. Years ago I thought they were riveting. But lately, they characters are very flat and don't develop much at all. I didn't find the characters to be believable at all. It seemed Kay somehow found herself married to accused murderer Peter shortly after meeting him without witnessing how they became close enough for that. I got bored, put down the book to read another, came back for a second try but found I just had no interest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book came in great condition!","review":"The book came quickly and was in the condition it was described. I got it in time for christmas and my mom loved it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great bible for kids!","review":"My kids and I LOVE this bible.

Glad I purchased from this source."},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite Bible","review":"We have gone through a number of kid Bibles...most of them only have pictures every few pages or the illustration quality is pretty poor. This Bible and the Jesus Storybook Bible are our favorites. This is our favorite Bible illustration wise. The Jesus Storybook Bible is our favorite in that the Bible stories are told in more of an appealing story format that holds child attention for just a bit longer than the typical child Bible stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great stories and illustrations","review":"I highly recommend this starter Bible (Bible stories). It has well worded stories and fantastic illustrations. Even though not all the illustrations are allowed on Amazon.com, I can vouch that they are all very vivid and they seem to pop off the page. Of course, they are not verse for verse, they are stories, and as with all stories you get what the author thought was most important to have included in the story. Well worth the $$$."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful illustrations, good stories","review":"We bought this Bible simply because of its illustrations. They are so bright and colorful and sometimes downright hilarious. The stories are simple and DO sometimes skip certain details you'll find in Bibles for older kids or adults, but we think it's very age appropriate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unacceptable","review":"The bible is a very complex book written in a language that gives users latitude for interpretation. This book seems to focus on simplifying the language to describe the violence and makes it overly explicit with little focus on the message itself. This book is not for children or for adults - It misses the entire point of the bible. Also, extremely surprised by so many positive reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Product Quality Description Does not Match Product Received","review":"The product was described as a higher quality. Instead, it is dirty and is scribbled with colors by children in the inside pages. Very deceptive marketing on product description."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful young children's Bible","review":"My children ages 2 and 3 love this!! The pictures are especially toddler friendly and colorful. Beautiful little first Bible and pretty accurate. We just purchased our second because the other was falling apart from so much use. Great way to engage young children in Bible study, and I enjoy reading it too! I highly recommend to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ordering the 3rd copy...","review":"My daughter and I love this book. I like it better than any of the other childrens bibles I have looked at, which means all the ones at your Walmarts, various christian book stores, and plenty of thrift stores. It is more substantial than the toddler bibles, but simple enough for little ones. The illustrations are great, although I liked them better before they updated and revised this book:( If I could find the older edition, I would buy that. But I can't, so I am ordering the THIRD copy of this great book for us, because we have lost 2 of them now. I also really like the way this book FEELS...that may sound weird, but this book is one of those with the nice smooth shiny pages, not the scratchy pages with faded illustrations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Granite ware book 2","review":"This is a must for the Granite ware buyers prices are great and great learning instruction of what to look for and how to tell if it is old or new I love this book and look at it often as I am looking on ebay alot.

Now I can't find it at any of my local drugstores. It's great alone (how I wear it)or under foundation. You do have to blend it in pretty well or it does tend to look clumpy if you're lazy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Friendship Takes Work","review":"Dr. Yager's thoughtful and encouraging book about relationships and their complexity is oblviously the result of important research and an ability to synthesize information and take the step to original thinking. This book is not a rehash of old homilies about making friends and keeping them. It is an examination of our deepest desires and motivations in regard to friendship. It reveals to us the ways in which we can make friendships happen, helps us to understand why friendships fail, and almost certainly makes us better friends. I recommend this book to anyone who has questions about relating to others and hopes to enrich their lives and their friends' lives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Comfortable","review":"I like to wear slippers in the house and have a difficult time finding ones that retain their cushioned feeling.

Of course - it would be too long.Then, I noticed it did not feel all that comfortable.The \\"thong\\" part is very hard, not rounded for comfort, and this hardness can be FELT through the very thin \\"fur\\"! The edge that goes over the instep is also very tight and hard-edged. House slippers should be comfortable - at every level! The cushioning is also less supportive than I thought it'd be. If your floors are hard, and you need to STAND in them for a while (i.e.: working in the kitchen), these may not be the shoes for you either.I bought the Acorn Eco slipper, and it is a good fit. I needed a \\"thong\\" style- for while the weather is still warm.I am returning this \\"Spa\\" slipper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very comfortable","review":"I love these slippers so much I bought a pair for my mother to wear when she visits our house."},{"rating":"2","title":"soft, relaxing slipper","review":"I purchased these slippers for myself and love them.

I wear shoe size 5 1/2 and wide if it is available. The width on these slippers was a little wide, but the length was extremely longer than one would expect even for a size 6. My foot wanted to slide back toward the heel so it left more than 2 inches flopping in the front past my toes. Keep this in mind when ordering. A Real Trip Hazard!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Most comfortable slippers ever","review":"These are the most comfortable slippers on the market. They wear well and are easily washed.

I wear them all the time and only just now are they starting to fall apart, still as comfy as ever but the material has split open. I ordered a pair to replace them, same style, same size, and they are made differently now! The toe separator has moved further down on the slipper making it less comfortable. The strap laying over the foot is much tighter and the top edge of the strap is digging into the tops of my feet which is painful. They also have a funny smell to them and look and feel as if they are made more cheaply. For example, the seams do not look or feel as well put together. Even the foot padding, which was my favorite thing about my old pair, isn't as comfy and fluffy as before. I am quite disappointed and wish I would've tried these on in a store before buying online."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comfy, but dont wash them","review":"I loved these slippers, but I wish I had gotteen them in black.

Excellent service from Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would have liked them if....","review":"I was so wanting these slippers to work for me but when I tried them on the first thing I noticed was pain between my toes on both feet. I wear a women's size 8 so I got the medium and the length was perfect but they seemed a little tight across the foot, even though I wear a B width. I would expect them to loosen up with wear however they would still hurt between the toes.If Acorn would put a little padding in the thong that goes between the toes I think it would make a big difference but there is only what feels like a hard cord with a very thin terry cloth covering it.I will give them 2 stars because the padding on the bottom felt good and soft and they look nice.Too bad. I will now try the Acorn slippers that wrap around the foot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't fit me well...uncomfortable","review":"I found these slippers to be small on me, therefore, they were uncomfortable.I normally wear a 7.5M or an 8M. Most reviewers stated these slippers run large, so I ordered the 6.5 - 7.5 (M). When I put them on, the length of the shoes was more than long enough, but the band that goes over the top of my foot was way too tight. It was painful to walk and I didn't know if the material would stretch or not, so I returned them. My foot is not especially wide, so I am not sure why these didn't work for me. I definitely think the next size up would have been too long (in the length)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh so comfortable!","review":"This is the most comfortable slipper I've purchased in a long time.

I would purchase this slipper again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed: Cute, but not comfortable","review":"I loved the way these looked when I ordered them. I wear a 7.5 and ordered the 8-9M. The length is perfect. However, as other reviewers have mentioned the band across the width of the foot is tight and thong portion is uncomfortable. I would return these shoes but don't have the energy to deal with packing them up and shipping them, so I am keeping them. I am hoping that they will loosen up. Be warned, unless you have a narrow foot, the band across and thong portion of this slipper are likely to be uncomfortable."},{"rating":"2","title":"G8 for indoor or out","review":"I use these practically every day.

The fabric is real soft and nice and if feels kind of squishy between your toes which is great. The top strap is wider than some other brands, and it helps the slipper stay on your foot and it doesn't make flapping noises when you walk.I usually wear size 8 wide shoes, but I ordered size medium (6.5-7.5) and they fit great.I love these slippers! They are comfortable, and you can put them on quickly, and they don't make your feet hot. They are perfect!"},{"rating":"2","title":"love these slippers","review":"I bought these slippers a couple of years ago and I absolutely love them. They are SO comfortable. It's amazing the difference I feel between padding around the house in bare feet and wearing these slippers. I actually came back to buy a couple more pairs for Christmas gifts, but unfortunately I didn't pay even close to what they are currently going for (thirty five dollars!)and they're a bit over my gift budget, so I'll have to think of something else. I definitely recommend them though, assuming the quality is the same as when I bought them two years ago (I saw a review from someone who bought them recently who thought they were hard and stiff. My pair certainly aren't)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super comofrtable!","review":"I have just had these slippers for a few days, but found them super comfortable from the start. I hate to take them off my feet to put on regular shoes! My only issue with buying theses slippers was an issue with the SKU number and the wrong product was displayed on Amazon. The size and color that I wanted and ordered was not available but Hank's Clothing notified me right away. I definitely needed a size medium so I reluctantly agreed to let them send me a different color.

I also tend to suffer from foot pain due to my weight and again, the only time my feet don't hurt is when I wear these slippers.

Just because there are quirky keyboards and electronic beats mixed with rock n roll elements doesn't mean its experimental. Pink Floyd was experimental. The Flaming Lips are experimental.

Also, if you get the chance, see this band live. They have put on one of the most amazing shows I have ever seen. I saw them at The Howlin' Wolf in New Orleans and... Just go see them.1) Control - Happy flowing verses, driving chorus. 5/52) Peculiar People - Amazing vocals and keyboard work. 5/53) OK - This track kind of seems uneventful after Peculiar People. However, it reminds me of Radiohead. 4/54) Reset - Love at first note. 5/55) Plan B - Cool drum work, and tight sounding vocals. Also, my favorite guitar work (after Reset of course). 5/56) Progress - This is my least favorite track, but when they played it live and it really was moving. 4/57) Afterward - Just a keyboard outro. --"},{"rating":"2","title":"some of the most original tunes i've heard this year","review":"mutemath is quickly becoming one of my favorite bands. this ep is so inventive, mixing obviously different genres seamlessly, such a nice blend. i cannot wait for the full length! these guys are electric live! paul meany is jumping around, over his keyboard, playing a big akward red \\"keytar\\", just having a blast. darren king, drummer, duct tapes his headset to his face to keep it from flying off when he plays. i saw them this weekend at the atlanta christian music weekend @ six flags. energetic music reflected in a very energetic show! i would highly suggest investing in a ticket to one of mutemath's shows and buyin this here compact disc. you will not regret the purchase of either."},{"rating":"2","title":"wow","review":"Amazing.

That being said, Reset is an amazing debut. I can't recall when I last heard a band who sound this tight, skilled, or eclectic. They really don't sound like anything I've ever heard before, but if I had to try to describe them, I would say that I hear traces of Radiohead, Sting, Tricky, DC Talk, The Listening, Rush,... but only trace elements of each. If you like bands that are extremely difficult to label, you will love Mute Math. The title track is like a trip-hop symphony... Do yourself a favor and buy Reset and the new self titled album.

I thought I found it in Frog Holler, but not quite. Jayhawks? Almost. Say Zuzu? Getting closer.My search is over. Minor Enough is a roots/Americana tour de force. Touches of southern rock, bluegrass, Band-like shuffles and waltzes---it sounds more like a greatest hits album than a debut offering. A superbly played, great guitar album. Although hard to choose favorites, 'Sunday Special' and 'Pale Colored Hue' are wonderful creations. Even the attempt at something different sounding (Gold Dust Twins) is a winner.The overall mood is somewhat dark, but not mopey. WNM's greatest attribute is how they take a 19th Century backwoodsy, almost hick-like ethos and make it sound so cool, sophisticated and totally modern."},{"rating":"2","title":"something i missed.","review":"here's a pleasant surprise that i missed when it was 1st out. a fantastic alt-country album, filled with great hooks and all the other trappings that make this genre so enjoyable. highly recommended by me, for whatever that's worth?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better things to come...","review":"Amazon has not yet made \\"Pull The Brake\\" available (what's up with that?), WNM's new release (March 2006).

I can't even say it under-performed, rather, it didn't perform at all. I don't know what happened here, maybe it was stored at a weird temperature and it made the contents go bad, or it was a bogus batch... all I know is, I won't be ordering it thru Amazon again...

I can't figure it out. The creme is not smooth (as it was in my original bottle). It comes out in globs. And, it formed small balls of goo in my hair. To me this B&B; is worthless. Such a disappointment...I really think I should be reimbursed for this styling creme and would think that the company that made this would want it back (hopefully at their expense).

My stylist recently recommended Moroccan Oil and used it before a blow-out. Loved the way my hair looked and felt after that product. I'd recommend it or a few other cheaper products over this one.

What I ended up with was sticky hair which was almost impossible to comb through, felt stiff and looked dried-out, yet at the same time was FULL of unmanageable static.

The creme itself has a different texture as well, hard to describe except to say when you I look at the cremes side by side it has a look and feel of conditioner rather than the B and B direct styling creme which is slightly more tacky and gelatinous....the bottles themselves are different too (both in text and design)."},{"rating":"1","title":"alternative to bumble","review":"HEY EVERYONE, I KNOW IT SUCKS THAT BUMBLE REFORMULATED THEIR USED TO BE AWESOME STYLING CREME BUT I FOUND A GREAT ALTERNATIVE!

It feels like the original product when your hair is wet, but once it's dried, it feels like you have nothing on your hair...and I don't mean that in a good way.I've compared the new bottle with the old, and the ingredients are dramatically changed. The list of ingredients is also much shorter.Anyway, I requested a refund, and bumble and bumble sent me a prepaid envelope to send the product back.

The book flows smoothly, and is very clearly broken into several sections detailing the history, economics, and developing terrorism in each of the countries it describes. The only truly annoying thing in the format is the way the editors have taken one key sentence out of every paragraph and inserted it in the margin in a large font. It would be useful as a quick reference, but it seems forced and trivial most of the time, and is very distracting when you are just reading the book straight through, not stopping to take notes.Outside of the poor editing, the book contains tons of useful information, and is interesting without being too complex. I highly recommend it for anyone who hasn't studied the region and wants to get a good overview of what has been happening there."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Martins Have Landed","review":"Probably because I was so thoroughly sickened with McCauley's agit-prop epic \\"Bandits, Gangsters and the Mafia: Russia, the Baltic States and the CIS Since 1991,\\" I was fascinated to see what THIS book would be like. I thought, maybe he had a miss before, but this would be a hit. How silly I am!In the book cover, it is triumphantly said McCauley \\"draws on his vast knowledge.\\" He also draws on vast and bitter biases. McCauley seems to think anything he interprets as \\"bad\\" in history comes from the black hearts of those naughty Russkies in Moscow. This book is much less a study of Central Asia, and more a study of the extraordinary prejudice with which British scholars see Russia. McCauley also has a weird way of apologising for Islamist terrorism.Regardless, it is all very convenient for Mr. McCauley, who quite deliberately released this book not long after the Sept. 11 terrorist atrocities."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rue's fabulous!","review":"Rue is a one-of-a-kind gem, and she writes in a comfy style that brings you in almost as an active spectator.

The picture and audio quality is poor, and the films themselves aren't the cream of the crop when it comes to kaiju movies. \\"Gappa the Triphibian Monster\\" is a laughably bad movie, but I recommend buying the Media BLasters release instead. It has the original Japanese audio and the dubbed version, while also being of a better picture quality. The Gamera films are not as fun to laugh at, but rather just annoying. They are, however, great for the younger kaiju fans. These releases are in horrible condition, as the print is very grainy. So to be blunt, the films are bad and the DVD's are bad. I suggest that if the buyer wants some better, more serious kaiju movies they check out the Godzilla movies from the 50's and 60's as well as the newer ones, which have great special effects and much better acting than this trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"look closley","review":"do not buy this dvd if you are looking at picture on box or going by reviews,box reads vol.2 what you really get is vol.1.The reviews are for vol.2.sure it was only $3.00,but i wanted vol.2 (which is not available anywhere).buyer beware."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great new book","review":"This wonderful book tells the story of the elusive search for the Zoroastrians, the mystic monotheistic sec that arrived in Iran long ago prior to Islam and Christianity.

Very useful advices on how to keep your house clean using simple handy products such as baking soda, ice cubes, even banana peel.The design of the book, however, is not that \\"clean\\", but very noisy. This makes it hard to read - white font on pink page (p.55), white on dark yellow (p.58), white on brighter yellow (pp.62-63), white on colorful photo (p.150). To make a long story short - I would really like the designer of the book to be less creative. May be the book would look more formal, but much easier to read.

The book is an extension of this fantastic show that literally transforms people's lives. One can easily underestimate how much cleanliness and order contributes to a happy life. This book is a great guide to achieving and maintaining such order. The cleaning tips and methods are smart and easy and the cleaning solutions they use made from borax, salt, vinegar, baking soda, lemon to name a few are \\"cheap and cheerful\\". Cleaning made fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost Want to Clean My House","review":"I love this cleaning duo, and even more I love their household cleaners. They frequently suggest common household ingredients to use instead of expensive brand-name products.

I had expected a book that gave tips on how to clean, which to some extent it did, but nothing that was like their show. I had wanted some of their recipes for natural cleaners and none of those were given. Instead the book consisted of list up on list of directions on how to tackle various rooms in the house. If that is what you are looking for, then this is the book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as shown","review":"What I received contained only the piston and cylinder. It did not contain the resevoir and hose as shown. I requested a replacement, was told it was on backorder, so I held on to the first one just in case.

My main complaint is that I didn't get what was shown."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Fave Desk Lamp","review":"I own this desk lamp. I don't remember where I bought it or when. Currently, I use it at my makeup counter in order to illuminate my face during application of my cosmetics. It has been working so well for this purpose that I have been without a desk lamp on my actual desk! I went around to Office Max and Target and other places, but I couldn't find a desk lamp with the same great functions as this one - it has a dimmer switch, it swivels, you can move the actual light in any direction (that is why it works as a makeup lamp).

This video/cd is a great idea for exposing listeners to artists that they probably never heard or seen before. 911, G Squad, Worlds Apart, Dec & Ant and Espen Lind are artists that I am sure few people have heard in the US. But \\"Bop Boys\\" is definately one that people should have in their VCR's as well as CD players."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barely Legal","review":"This collection is a disappointment. The overall quality is poor; the come on of the \\"big names\\" is a farce. Two pages taken almost at random and out of context from John Grisham's \\"The Partner\\" do not constitute a \\"legal thriller.\\" An incident (not even a courtroom incident) from Scott Turow's \\"Pleading Guilty\\" is almost meaningless without background on the characters.Irwin Shaw and Louis Auchincloss had good selections, probably because both have excellent reputations as short story writers. \\"Speedball\\" by Brian Hedge was excellent, but it had everything to do with the death of John Belushi and nothing to do with lawyers, court, and legal matters.I am a fan of courtroom drama, and \\"Legal Thrillers\\" did not provide me with even one clever lawyer.

I have combination skin (mainly oily around the T-zone area) staying in a topical country. It is a little too oily for me, and the pump size is a little too big, each pump is way too much for my face and I practically have to apply the excess onto my husband.I haven't yet to see obvious improvement on my complexion yet, but I'm still hoping it will show me some results. It is a little too oily for day use, perhaps I will continue to use it as night cream. I think I have to keep my product search going again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too greasy, doesn't absorb well","review":"This moisturizer is so thick and sticky and leaves an oily residue. I have dry skin and you'd think this (being a heavier moisturizer) would be great but instead of hydrating the skin, it just leaves a thick layer of grease...feels \\"gooey\\". I even had to wash my hands to get it off. I guess if you have dry skin and you're looking for a moisturizer that doesn't absorb into the skin and feels more \\"lotiony\\" (vs. hydrating) then this is the product for you. But I wouldn't recommend this product if you're in the normal or oily category."},{"rating":"1","title":"did not work for me","review":"I purchased Aveeno Clear Complexion (no fragnance, natural...) I thought I made a good choice, but I was so mad- my face started to get worse and worse- meaning more pimples.

It doesn't even make me break out! Its PERFECT for me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work. Causes Acne!","review":"Aveeno must be paying people to write these reviews saying that this product works.

Save your money and go with Neutrogena. They have better products."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hate it!","review":"I have been trying to develop a skin care routine and was looking for a good moisturizer. I have oily acne prone skin and this made my skin burn and break out even worse. My face is red and dry now because of this. Cystic acne is not fun to deal with and this brought out too many cysts around my chin and cheeks. My face was doing great, clearing up before this. Waste of my money, but I guess it's all about trial and error. I take my time when adding a new product to my skincare routine so that I know if its going to break me out or not,"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very close to perfect lotion.","review":"I've been using this for about a month now, and have been very impressed. The only thing I have against it is that it does not have an alpha hydroxy solution in it, so sometimes I can get a little flaky from my over-drying acne medicine. I just mix in a little jojoba oil to fix this problem and it works great!My skin has cleared up drastically since using this product in combination with the Aveeno Clear Complexion Cleanser, benzoyl peroxide, and jojoba oil."},{"rating":"2","title":"The one and only!","review":"Love this moisturizer. It helps keep breakouts under control and doesn't cause over-drying like a lot of acne moisturizers do. Of course from time to time you will have some acne popup but overall it has reduced the occurrences. The only thing I wish it had was an SPF to protect against the harsh sun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aveeno Face moisturizer","review":"After finding the Aveeno scrub I mentioned (in another review) how it can dry out your skin without some kind of face moisturizer. Well, I looked into the same brand (Aveeno) and tried out this product. Within days my the skin on my cheeks felt like a babies butt! With both the Aveeno scrub and this lotion my skin (on my face) has been very healthy and soft. I recommend this product to those with very sensitive skin because it doesn't have all the extra ingredients that some products such as proactive or neutrogena has. It is just a very simple basic face lotion that makes your skin soft and healthy. So if you have sensitive, dry skin this is definitely worth trying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love love love!","review":"I'm 34 years old and still get random acne. This is still moisturizing but also has help with mild pimples or bumps. I'm VERY sensitive to smells for face cream and hate oily or thick on my face. This smells really good and is very light.

Thinking I just needed to sit a bit further away, the next night I tried again but nope, same thing happened. It's so frustrating, all these amazing shots but not one is one screen for more than 2 seconds before it fast cuts to another. What happened to watching a gently unfolding natural drama? Why can't we linger a while to drink in the beauty of a scene?This is documentary for the ADD generation. If your child has a problem concentrating on anything for more then 0.5 seconds, then this disc is ideal.

Filled with more similes than the genetic structure of identical twins, the watcher is inundated with long-winded phrases like a bad surfer is with waves. The scenes change quicker than a shy high-schooler in a locker room, or the promises of your local politician. With more flashing than a disco ball, the viewer becomes glad they do not suffer from epilepsy, unless they do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Graphics and Video","review":"I love national geographic, but this DVD was very disappointing.

So if you're really bored with nothing else to do, meh, give it a watch I guess."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's too bad, really.","review":"The excellent footage in this program is, sadly, presented with unbearable narration. It seems to be an attempt to make a nature show exciting, but instead... comes off with the personality of a second rate magician trying to sell up a bad act. The script really reminds me of the character \\"Gob\\" in the short run series \\"Arrested Development.\\" I've got to say, I'm disappointed with National Geographic for this one, it sure did have promise.

(like the 'Planet Earth' series or 'Yellowstone HD'). Those videos have nice easy panning, articulate narration, useful information, and the series allows you to enjoy earth as it is.I ended my subscriptions to National Geographic Magazine on the basis of how POORLY their documentaries (nature and animal coverage) have become.

I am adult, and I am European, and I can safely say this is not for anybody in my 'category'.First, the narrator voice is absolutely idiotic. She is whispering everything and describes everything as 'amazing', 'awesome', or something like that.Secondly, the soundtrack is just retarded. It is for an action movie - not for a nature documentary. Gimme a break.Go and buy a BBC documentary instead. They have brains and some good taste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame","review":"Seems like it was intended for a Grade 3 educational video.

Pretty pictures got it two stars rather than one."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible","review":"Watched about 10 mins and turned it off. I cant stand the narrator and the narration.

However, it is almost ruined by the melodramatic, fatalistic narration. Depicting the earth as something with \\"weapons and bombs\\" loaded and ready (volcanoes) marching us all to our demise. Perhaps the creators felt that earth on its own is not exciting enough so they needed to add Hollywood drama but for us, it caused us to turn the program off after a while."},{"rating":"1","title":"nauseating and poor education value","review":"Flying rapidly through multiple locations with poor narration, this series was of poor quality for teaching a coherent modern approach to scientific education/entertainment. The incredible visuals were hindered by incredibly rapid transitions, narration trying to use mild curse words and weak thoughtless descriptions, and music that does not fit the message. I don't mind some cursing, just have a point with it! It is a presentation gone terribly wrong....disappointing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"For the young and easily excitable","review":"The narrator is a well known actress who shouldn't have stooped to such blatent hysteria-mongering and pandering. I thought this would have the class and educational value of some of the similarly titled documentaries. Instead, I spent so much time sifting through the overblown language, immature metaphors and doom and gloom cliches, that I didn't take away anything beyond a refresher of few small facts I probably learned in elementary school.

I think the message that no one wants to play with you if you are ugly, and then when you are beautiful you can go back and snub them is a terrible one. With the many issues our children face today - inappropriate role models in the media, anorexia, teenagers having plastic surgery - this message just reinforces those same ideas \\"I must be beautiful to be popular.\\" I don't know why publishers feel they have to publish books by celebrities who are obviously not children's authors. I threw away all the copies of this book that we received. I would not recommend it to anyone, except as a lesson in why editors need to focus on what is good for children, not what celebrity names might sell books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Good Lesson for Children","review":"After hearing good things about this book, I decided to buy it to read to the young children at our school. When I received it in the mail, I read it immediately. While the illustrations were good, it was an extremely disappointing story. The story shows that unkind behavior and words should be returned with more unkind behavior and words.

My son spent time in the hospital during many surgeries and this was the one thing he wanted by his side when he awoke. He would smile that adorable smile of his and this book made him feel everything would be okay.

One of the finest musical compliations I have ever heard. Congratulations to London Records for resurfacing the incredible and mysterious mix of reggae, rock and roll, dance, and the pure joy that the English Beat delivered.Nothing new here, other than the experience of the 'Beat', an astonishing tribute to a band, probably unrecognized and unknown by many, but worthy of serious consideration by music historians as a truely unique.Just hear 'Sole Salvation' as it was originally played. This album delivers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunningly beautiful","review":"Jimmy Rushing, 'Mr. Five by Five', was a staple blues singer for many years. Some of my favorite recordings were made with Benny Goodman in the 1950s, and that's where I first encountered him. His work with Buck Clayton is terrific, too. Over the years I've worn out my recordings of 'I'm Coming Virginia' ('Foginia, my Dixieland Home') Of course, we all know Count Basie and the many recordings he made with his 'number one son' Joe Williams.Well, run out and get this one. It only takes a few seconds to download and enjoy. I won't go into very specific detail other than to say these performers just bring out the best in each other in a joyfully wonderful set of riffs. The Basie band, in fine fettle always, features that crackling brass and perfect rhythm section. The sound has held up well and, like me, you'll listen to this one over and over. Believe me, these guys feed on each other. You can feel the fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will not stay stuck to the wall.","review":"I bought this tub organizer for my first daughter thinking it would be a great way to keep all her toys out of the way when she was done bathing.

We tried everything to try and get this thing to stick to the wall and stay.

The one exception is \\"My Bloody Valentine.\\" That is a little much, but we talk about the music and it has been something that has help her so much that there is no one that could tell me that they are not a great band. They have fun at what they are doing, talk about real life, and they reach out to those who are not spoken for!The CD, Young & the Hopeless, I purchased originally for me. \\"Hold On\\" is one of the best messages that I have heard in years!

I heard BE cd but was unhappy because of its new direction. But seeing BE performed live in its entirety was an incredible experience I might say!!! I have no expectation whatsoever of BE being performed Live.... Here I am in front of my TV screen seeing BE performed in so many musical styles blended with theatrical, visual presentation and most of all Prog Metal being played in between songs.... I was taken back by this whole concept, new ideas that POS had in mind for a while now. I am glad that they were bold and did released it to the world regardless of what people might say. It's refreshing and put the meaning of prog to a whole new level.... I am extremely happy with BE!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"1/2 price and twice the effort","review":"I would give these one star, but they do work and work well once you've actually installed them.

Each DVD has 4 episodes on it, in order when they first aired. Each episode is around 45 min. long (3 hours total per DVD). If you add all the time in the episodes, you looking at around 21 hours of X-Files! Now on to the quality, for these episodes being around 6 years old and re-doing them in DVD really worked out great. I think this X-files DVD set has a better picture than the new 2000-2001 X-Files season currently on TV now! The sound is also great! I think if you like the X-Files, this is a great set to get.

We are introduced to some new characters and story lines that will be the mainstay for the show for seasons to come. Right off the bat in the first few episodes it is obvious that the Cigarette Smoking man played by William B. Davis has had his role greatly increased compared to the first season. In my opinion, the episode \\"One Breath\\" in which Mulder confronts the Smoking man, has to be one of the best scenes in the whole series. I thought that every filler episode that did not deal with the greater alien conspiracy was really well done too.I would highly recommend this season. Ideally you should start with the first season and go from there.

Chris Halls vocals are haunting and send chills down your spine but at the same time demand that you sing along and feel the way he is feeling. The lyrics are strongly artistic and powerful. My personal favs on the cd are ACF A song about remenesing of a love passed by. \\"Can't happen here\\" takes the spot light of this album I think. The tribal beat and the creepy static blured vocals of Chris makes this a true hit. With this aside this isn't even the best Stabbing westward album!

Simply put, both groups love the American songbook. This live set shows the Ramblers at their best, romping through old time fiddle tunes and songs (Paddy Won't you Drink Some), modern folk (Aragon Mill), Western swing (Wahoo, Wahoo, Wahoo), blues (Tilly Take Your Time), and wonderfully demented original music (Play Rocky Top (or I'll Punch Your Lights Out), Thoroughly African Man). Few groups have the musicianship or vision to put together a live set like this. This languished in the Flying Fish Vaults for too long. Great to have it on CD; the remaster sounds terrific. Best of all, the vendor is Mike Craver, the pianist on this CD. A huge influence on my own music for the last thirty-odd years.

This makes lining up your approaches crucial, and this jig is supposed to help. (I bought the #17105 - the version for wood doors).The problem is that there is too much wiggle in the apparatus, and sure enough, my holes did not line up. I think I could have done a better job freehanding it.There were more expensive jigs to choose from, but I thought \\"why spend a lot on a tool I'll only use a few time?\\" Now I have my answer - because replacing a door is expensive.Pass on this tool."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"The center drill portion of the hole saw was so far out of true that it could not be used. Some careful measuring and shimming got it near true, that's when I realized the hole saws were both oval, not round. The shaking due to being out-of-round made the face jig wander 1/4\\" too low during drilling (it is free to slide up and down even with the jig screwed down!). Because of the shape the saw cut a hole bigger than it should have, and because it wasn't round it had to cut a lot more wood than it should have. I got a hole the wrong size in the wrong location and it took me a long time to do it. Then I cut the 1\\" diameter edge hole and things went from bad to worse. The \\"self centering\\" jig cut a hole nearly 1/4\\" off center, too far off to mount the strike plate. It took hours to fix the door after using this tool.I threw this thing in the garbage.

I considered it, but after taking a close look at it, I decided I would not risk my 80 year old, just refinished, irreplaceable Dutch door (the existing hole in my door was too small, so I needed to enlarge it, which is considerably more difficult/risky than drilling a hole in the first instance). This model is clearly too flimsy, screwing it into place won't hold it taught, and it is just not worth the risk. I spent a little more ($25) for a similar contraption made by Blu-Mol on sale at my local Home Depot. You apply it to the door with a built in vice clamp; it comes with spacers to perfectly match the width of the door. It provides a guide on both sides of the door so when you saw halfway through, you only need to flip the door over and go the rest of the way. The hole saw that came with it is not top notch, but what do you expect for $25.

However, since it was straight, it didn't work to well when I used the 10-key. On the other hand, the handstands wrist rest perfectly fit this keyboard. The foam isn't too soft and isn't too hard. It's really comfortable.The only thing I don't like about it is that the bottom of the rest feels cheap and that it may fall apart after a while.

The author has thoroughly researched the food industry, retail, monopolies, and even the adulteration of our food to increase profit margins. She describes how 4 global food monopolies have cashed in on questionable World Bank and IMF policies imposed on poor countries and driven their farmers to bancruptcy. She also analyses the decline of farming in Europe due to the stranglehold that global retailers have on retail and the consequent paradox of government subsidised farming and rising food insecurity throughout the world. This is a magistral work that details the dangers of globalization, the folly of World Bank economics, and the failure of many states, including the US and many other industrialized nations, to protect their own food producers and thus jeopardize their food security, leading to the current global trend of skyrocketing food prices and subsequent poverty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe it's a gender thing","review":"I read this book for my book group (all female) and we unanimously disliked it.

Another scene that will remain in memory was when he was lobtser fishing with Nellie off the coast of Maine. His description of light, color and bouyancy is marvelous.This is not a book about cancer! In fact, I believe the publishers made an error on the coverleaf of the book when they said she was diagnosed as having cancer. Monninger did not want a diagnosis. Nellie is very much alive, and stays that way.Anyone who pays particular attention to their relationship with animals will be deeply moved by this tremendous story.

Nonetheless, this is a really entertaining and informative film on motogp. The bonus disc is really good too.Really good interviews. The on board camera on Rossi's M1 is great!

Mark Neale, who managed access to the riders on an intimate scale in Faster, here goes for inane comments and filler. Neale tries to create an epic out of a very ordinary GP race.

Although the book is lacking in photos, which are really necessary to guide the novice through the process, the explanations are concise and to the point.With all the books being published in China at incredible low prices today's publishers can afford to provide a multitude of color photos. However, when this book was published back in 1998 this new trend was not prevelant.Nevertheless, Elaine Gonzalez presents a wonderful guide for anyone desiring to learn about chocolate patisseire as this book is more of a technique book than a recipe book.I have used this book in conjunction with other books as I dabble in chocolate patisserie at home, such as making molded chocolates."},{"rating":"2","title":"A tale told across the decades","review":"There is something to be said for short stories and anthologies.Sometimes a spooky idea is just that, spooky.

These are not your expected political talking points stoking the race industry as a means to a political end. It's done from the perspective of a deeply spiritual man who searches his soul to integrate the spiritual with the political from his individual perspective on American history. He comes up with his own answers, rather than following what today's politicized media tells him he ought to think. There is no knee-jerk labeling of the Tea Party, for example. Rather, he keeps a thoughtful, open mind to all sides of the story. One needn't agree with everything to feel the resonance. Runaway Slave is chock-full of erudite black American sources with many good interviews and angles. It's a must for any open-minded, inclusive study of American history. The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is that it's a bit long and could stand some editing here and there. Otherwise, it'd be a solid five."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could Have Condensed Content","review":"Answered a lot of my questions about why the Democrat Party dominates the black voter bloc in the US.

The first thing I noticed when I opened it was, \\"Made under license in the USA\\" on the label. The second was a distinct lack of heady, fresh aroma from either bottle. It smelled more like scented rubbing alcohol. Royall Lyme was, without doubt, the finest men's fragrance in the world. Not anymore. Who at the helm of the company now? An accountant?

This book is well written and concise, but misleading on many levels. There are nine essays in this slim volume, and only one is on topic. On page 131, the author finally warms to the alleged subject. There he breathlessly informs us that \\"The cause of the Civil War\\" is a poor question. The causes of the war are many and nuanced. He has discovered something called \\"deep contingency\\". In other words, one thing leads to another. Yes, quite.This is a fascinating and important subject. The war was fought between two constitutional democracies. It was staggeringly bloody and vindictive. The issues leading up to it had been in contention for centuries. Why and how did this war happen?

He used the \\"slavery\\" issue as his political platform to gain the office and thus \\"led\\" the country into a Civil War which accomplished nothing but killing thousands of Americans in the North and South.Slavery was already on the way out in this country and we didn't need to fight a war to put the blacks out of work with no re-employment plans.

Tracy could get a sob in his voice for the benefit of his radio listeners - while grinning at his intimates! The columnist has a pet peeve: a bright-eyed young crooner with a moronic smile, played by Dick Powell.

Eckhart Tolle's works come close. So do Zen books and Taoist works and Buddhism. If there is one book that has come closest for me, it would be Radical Happiness.With this work, Gina goes right into the root causes of suffering, which is the ego's false perception of the world. Through her words she explains how this happens and what we can do to get out of it. Each chapter is featured with exercises, from meditation to questioning our thoughts. As we work on these, we become less attached to material things and closer to peace and happiness. This book works very well with Eckhart Tolle's and Byron Katie's works.Read this book once, then again and again. Forget about using a highlighter for the important parts. You'll end up marking every word."},{"rating":"2","title":"Radical Happiness","review":"With its simple suggestions and exercises Gina Lake's book, Radical Happiness, enables the reader to easily drop into the experience of an awakened life, perhaps never to return to the egoic state of consciousness. Its hopeful message is that our natural state is available to us whenever we place our attention there rather than on the contents of the mind. I wholeheartedly recommend this book for seekers who have tired of the search and are ready to become finders. If I had read Radical Happiness without knowing who authored it, I could have readily attributed it to Eckhart Tolle. In the genre of books on self-realization, it stands unmatched."},{"rating":"2","title":"Be Happy","review":"Gina Lake awakened into radical happiness after a deep exploration of psychology, metaphysics and astrology. Having walked that path to its end, Gina's heart-full story of what it is to be peacefully aware, loving and content in the midst of any life circumstance can serve as a bridge to countless others who share her background. Insightfully and eloquently written, Radical Happiness offers practical pointers and exercises that allow every reader to discover who they really are by their own experience.

Instead of explaining Sales and Leases, this editions tells us on every page to look at a provision of the UCC and discover the truth for ourselves.

I first heard that performance in the mid 1970s. For me, it was the perfect classical storm. All the ingredients were there: a top notch orchestra in great form, one of our nation's best conductors who was at home with the music, recording engineers who knew what they were doing, and playback on a component quality stereo. The sound sparkled and dazzled me. All I could say was \\"WOW\\" and \\"play it again\\" and \\"crank up the volume!\\" I went out and made that recording my first classical purchase.This Mussorgsky Pictures brought me back to the mid 70s and listening to the 1812 for the first time.

There is one excellent, truly \\"Kate Bush\\" song (Moments of Pleasure), a couple of OK songs (Eat the Music, You're the One) but rest of the songs are uninteresting and the album doens't hang together. It appears that Kate wanted to break out of her insularity and bring in some folks from the real world (Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck, Prince) but their presence is intrusive and detracts from her magic. The Prince collaboration would make a decent Prince song but is a mediocre Kate Bush song. The entire album has a profoundly unsatisfying feel to it. For hardcore fans only, and even then just buy it for Moments of Pleasure and to complete your collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most disappointing purchase ever made.","review":"First off, I am a huge fan of Kate Bush. The Kick Inside and Hounds of Love are two of my very favorite albums. I waited years and years for this album to arrive. I'd already been slightly disappointed by its predecessor, The Sensual World. But the Red Shoes sounds like it was recorded by a very good Kate Bush impostor who wrote a really bad bunch of songs. The genuine Kate Bush emerges only for Moments of Pleasure, which is a truly beautiful song stranded in a disc of mediocre to very bad music. Why bring in the Big Name guns (Eric Clapton, Prince (!), Jeff Beck)? In my opinion she'd been doing fine without them before this disastrous album came along. I almost fear that there will be another album in the future. Purchase this CD only if you're a completist. Otherwise you'll kick yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry; but this is a really bad album","review":"Kate Bush has produced much glorious music but The Red Shoes isn't one of those efforts. What's the problem(s)? Boring drum machines; uninspired singing; uninteresting songs. Sounds like a bunch of misshappen outtakes from Hounds of Love. Rubberband Girl is almost listenable, but the droning monotone drum machine kills any flexible sparkle it had. Sorry, Kate.I'm writing this to save you from buying this album. Don't.

It is very commercial, ridiculously over-produced and just could not have come from her heart. If you are a fan, you already own this. If you are looking for an introduction to Kate's music, buy \\"Hounds of Love\\". That CD is her masterpiece; \\"Red Shoes\\" should be veiwed as an asterisk in her amazing career."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kate's low point","review":"Let me start off by saying that Kate is among my favorite female artists and has released some of the most daring and expressive material throughout her career. Sadly this doesn't have any. It seems like she's trying become more commercially accessable while still remaining Kate (\\"The Sensual World\\" was more daring). The songs are uninspired and the collaberations fall flat (\\"Why Should I Love You?\\" springs to mind). The only interesting track is \\"White Stripey Lie\\" where she plays a rather twisted guitar solo (pretty good for a pianist).Kate is at her best when she takes risks and challenges her audience (I'm talking \\"The Dreaming\\" and \\"The Hounds Of Love\\"). The only challenge to \\"The Red Shoes\\" is how long it takes you to hit the eject button.If this CD was released by someone like... Oh... Pat Benetar, it would be considered an artistic triumph.

Much more."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wait worth endured","review":"All though the wait was long, it was not a dissapointment.

True, she obviously is a strong admirer and comes down gently on his faults, but she does give them. As for the Amazon review, I think it is wrong to say that the author does not show how deeply they cared for each other. She does through many of Isabel's writings and letters. Lovell fleshes out both characters so well you feel you know and understand them. I think it is one of the finest biographies I have ever read.

But WHY oh WHY are they charging 7.99 for an electronic copy when you can get TWO books in a single paperbook format for 8.99?? I mean seriously, with a paperback you need paper, ink, a physical building to create the books, a trucking delivery service to ship the books plus all the folks that involves. An electronic version, you make ONE single copy of the appropriate format and send it out on the internet, how can that POSSIBLY be equal costs?

I struggled deciding between it and the 4-slice because I have 3 boys. However, it only takes a little over a minute to toast 2 pieces, so it works out fine to run it several times to feed our family. I prefer having a smaller toaster that's easier to store or keep on your counter than having such a large 4-slice to deal with. That would have been overkill in my opinion. You need to following the instructions about initially running it without toast in it so it will function properly. We've toasted bread, bagels, and english muffins in it all very successfully. I like that it allows you to push the bread up higher when it's done. It easy to use. I'd buy it again and highly recommend it. I've had it for a year now and it was worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"cool design but a little too much thinking required before toasting","review":"Ok, I really love the toaster but when I stumble into the kitchen early in the morning, I just want to push one button and be assured that the toast turns out well. With this contraption, you have to set the desired browning grade by pushing one of two buttons (+ or -) and then you push down the lever. I love the browning feature for croissants or rolls on the top of the machine and the fact that you don't have an attachment to hunt for or fiddle with before browning. Also love that the toaster accepts bagles without any problems. What I don't like, however, is that the uninitiated houseguest may not have a clue how to use the toaster without a pretty detailed instruction."},{"rating":"2","title":"neat","review":"This is a simple introduction to quilting for kids. It starts out by telling a little history on quilt making. Then it goes on to tell about various quilt patterns. The book features a helpful page of pictures of items used in quilting such as quilting frames and rotary cutters. In the end of the book is a great idea we hope to use in our home school. A classroom quilt project is started by writing letter and mailing squares of fabric to children's book authors and illustrators. They are asked to decorate the square and mail it back to the student. The squares are made into a quilt.What did you like or not like about the book?I enjoyed sharing this book with my great grandmother.

Most of the photos look like newspaper print-- just awful! Someone needs to do the lovely Liz Montgomery justice and write a good book. It seems the author started trying to sell them on Ebay after it flopped. The reviews were probably written by her friends. The insane prices on this poor excuse for a biography are a joke. Don't fall for the supposed value.

Newspaper clippings are shown, but only headlines or cut off paragraphs. I can do without these. Also, there is a lot of typos that should have been edited, some paragraphs are repeated word for word, and the bibliography is improper, just a list of magazines and other sources that the author used, and even some of them are listed twice.

As a long-time Elizabeth Montgomery fan, I was looking forward to a real biography on her, with new information that can't already be found on the internet - exclusive interviews with people who knew her, newly discovered facts, original reviews of her movies, etc. - things that normally make a biography worth it for fans to buy.

MONTGOMERY","review":"I was too young to see Bewitched when it was on in the sixties, but I developed a crush on \\"Sam\\" in reruns, she was just so charming, sexy, and beautiful, I later saw her in a movie in which she played a woman that had been assaulted, I was like eight, and I was really upset, I mean my Sam was being beat up, but she was fantastic in the role, so different than her Bewiched part, then later on I saw her, in this movie that she played this shrew, she was mean as hell, and she was spectacular. This book is an odd mix of familar stories and it tries to get into what made this iconic woman tick..it's not a total success, Ms. Montgomery was a VERY private person and she gave very few interviews, I guess that comes from growing up with a famous father and her early huge success. At any rate, good read, but we really never understand the enigma that is Elizabeth Montgomery, but that is how she wanted it, it adds to her mystic I suppose."},{"rating":"2","title":"Symphony or Damn? - It's Both!","review":"A true original, this album is a maddeningly underrated gem of the 90's. Here, he leaves most of the funk/soul of his debut and symphonic psychadelia of his second ... and rocks HARD! Succomb to Me and She Kissed Me are crunchy, toe-tapping melodies. His strategy - throw two or three hooks in every song, hoping at least one sticks. But damn if sometimes they all do. And though his reach sometimes exceeds his grasp (the countryish \\"I Still Love You\\"), he still writes mighty fine tone poetry, as in \\"Turn The Page\\" (much better than the same-named Bob Seger weepie). In a better world, TTD would get bigger billing than Lenny Kravitz."},{"rating":"2","title":"His Masterwork","review":"After Mr. D'Arby's second album, I figured he had jettisoned all his pop sensibilities and was going to only head further into outer space. But this album finds the perfect place between the pop/rock/soul of his first album with the thought-provoking experimentation of his second. The best songs here provide both great music AND good lyrics - \\"Penelope Please\\", \\"Turn the Page\\", \\"She Kissed Me\\", \\"Let Her Down Easy\\". The only drawback here is the occasional twiddling of knobs, making songs sound like stereo effects records. Otherwise, highly recommended to anyone who like this sort of thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well....","review":"I can't blame Mr Darby for his musical ability or his voice, but i cannot understand why we need 16 songs on this effort. So many artists fall into this trap, they put out a few good tracks while we are forced to endure 30 minutes of meandering tunes to get anywhere. Tracks like Delicate, She kissed me and castillian have an appealing mix of rock, soul and R&B, but the album is long, loose and I have difficulty staying tuned in all the way.I can understand an artists craving to be adventureous, but more than often it comes across as overblown and incohesive as is the case with this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"OF A TRIBAL NATURE!!!","review":"\\"Essential Elements\\" is a healthy blend of Afro-rhythms with thumpin' basslines and dancefloor friendly beats sure to impress everyone at your next \\"house\\" party.

Examples of GREAT bands that should have been on here are The Cheepskates, LORD JOHN and MOD FUN (who were very active in the 80's NYC garage scene)from NYC and the surrounding area.The list goes on but at least these bands had some great rockers as opposed to some of the sleepers included on this compilation. There is some really good stuff on here but also some not so great stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mahna-tonous, doot doo dee doo-doo!","review":"How appropriate the set stops the canon in 1996 since those coming of age in the 1990s were concerned with not being able to live at the same standard as their parents. This does not measure up to the first Nuggets boxed set, mainly because a lot of this, isn't really all that garage-ish.If you bought the Post-Punk Chronicles and DiY series, or the Left of the Dial boxed set Rhino put out, you have a fair amount of these songs. Licensing fees must be getting ridiculous as this is the third appearance of \\"Tell Me When It's Over\\" by the Dream Syndicate on a Rhino release, and others fare similarly bad in terms of repeat appearances. Too much British stuff here falls into the canon of college rock.I really wanted to like this, and if you haven't been a big fan of this genre and the genres it sprang out of, you might find this boxed set useful, but I am, and I don't as I already have a lot of it and most of what I'm lacking, I don't want.Signed,epsteinsmutha"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this DVD unless you're a very experienced dancer","review":"I bought this DVD and the DVD-\\"start dancin' with jump5\\" Byou was very difficult and fast.

That way I am doing the exact same moves of them... not mirroring them, which is a much harder way to learn.Anyway, if you are a serious dancer, who is up on all the hip-hop moves, this vieo will work for you... otherwise you will end up being totally frustrated.

The set is really boring too."},{"rating":"2","title":"great!","review":"my 8 year old absolutely loves it! and she has no prior dance expereince..it is a little difficult in that they move fast but she still keeps trying!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too hard to follow -- even WITH dance training","review":"I bought this DVD so my daughter and I could dance along together and get some exercise -- however it is far too difficult for a young person to follow, and get this -- even with my many years of dance training, it was too difficult for ME to follow! The moves are NEVER broken down by count, and the instruction is incredibly poor. Virtually every dance class I've ever taken - including Master classes - broke down moves by count, so you can be on time, \\"on\\" the music. Not so here. It felt muddled and confusing. Additionally, in the \\"instruction\\" segment, the moves are shown just once, from one angle, so if you aren't already familiar with the move shown, the guidance is inadequate.It gets the two stars only for its appeal to teens & tweens, an underserved group when it comes to mixing exercise and fun. I'd like to see more dance/exercise videos for this age group, but PRODUCED BETTER."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and good exercise","review":"I don't like to exercise, but I do like dancing. I am out of the age range for this DVD, but I thought it looked like a fun way to learn dance steps. It is! As another reviewer mentioned, the steps are hard. The DVD obviously relies on viewers to pause and rewind, as it goes through many steps in a short period of time. That's ok -- it just means it will take longer for me to go through the DVD. Overall, I would definitely say it's worth the price and to just have a little patience learning the moves.The special features are a bit unnecessary, as I'm not really a fan of Sabrina Bryan and don't really need to see her music video or any behind the scenes footage. The shoe shopping extra is also a bit lacking, as it never really mentions that there are special sneakers for dancing that the viewer may want to buy, and only really talks about regular sneakers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"Two minutes into the video and my daughter as already given up. The moves are way too fast for anyone, who isn't already a trained dancer, to mimic. There is absolutely no instruction, and like another reviewer said, the dancers face you which is also hard to copy. I feel like it was a waste of money. A dance video marketed for girls shouldn't be so complicated. My daughter has wanted this video for a while and I am sad that she is so disappointed with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING! May result in injury!","review":"After seeing this DVD on TV, I thought it sounded really cool--a great way to work out and learn some dance moves. So, I bought it. It moves very fast--and the warm-up part seems like a full-blown work out in itself! I kept trying, though. Until I got to one move that involves twisting your legs to the side--your knees aren't supposed to go that way! I ended up seriously hurting my left knee from doing that move. Maybe I did it wrong--I don't know. But if I did, it was because I was trying to keep up with this high-speed work out, and didn't know what I was supposed to do. Buying this DVD is like spending $10 to sprain something."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's cute--but not for a beginning dancer","review":"I bought this for my niece who is 10 years old. She's so into the whole cheetah girls thing so I mainly bought it for that reason. Overall it is well-put together and very cute choreography. However, they do a *terrible* job breaking down the routine and actually teaching it. My niece was getting really, really frustrated, as they move lighting fast. I would expect with any of these type dvd's you would stop and start the dvd as needed to get the moves. However, I had to stop the dvd player, chunk the routine out myself and teach it to her just to keep her from crying, which is something I think a dvd targeted to kids should do on its own. If you have a dance background and plan to be around to help the kid learn the routine, I would recommend it. Otherwise don't buy it for a kid unless they have a good amount of dance/cheerleading experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Byou","review":"My 11 year old daughter found this too hard to keep up with.

Too fast to learn to slow to burn.","review":"I don't like to write negative reviews in general so please don't think I'm one of those people who has to find something wrong with everything. That said, I think this video is a great concept but fails in function. In order to be considered an exercise video it keeps moving and adding new steps too quickly to learn them before moving to the next sequence. On the other hand it still tries to \\"teach\\" the steps so it's too slow (and overwhelming) to keep up any kind of aerobic benefit. If your child isn't talented, experienced and/or willing to rewind the video to death to get it down you may fair better with another video. Read my review for Urban Jam with Laya Barak. She gets it right!"},{"rating":"2","title":"But where's the rest of season four?","review":"It's odd that a set like this does not contain the complete series. There are thirteen episodes from season four which have not been released on DVD yet. As far as I can tell, there's nothing new here.Hopefully we won't have to wait much longer for the rest of the series, but the lag between the release of season three volume two and season four volume one was nearly 18 months.I also see that MGM is listed as the producer of this set. Fox released the original movie, the TV series, all the DVD's up to this point. So while this doesn't quite make sense, I'll be happy if it gets the rest of the series released."},{"rating":"2","title":"SCI -FI adventure","review":"The submarine Seaview should have been built in real life to study & protect the oceans of the world.

Fortunately she did not wait to assemble it after the baby was born because if she did, she would have been in for a rude awaken.She stated this stroller doesn't turn, it just rolls straight. This is an inconvenience if you have to turn or veer in a certain direction because you would have to stop, move the stroller either left or right, and then gain your momentum back.I felt aweful when my friend stated she had to exchange this stroller for a totally different one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible purchase","review":"Save your money. This stroller is just too damn big to manage. The wheels don't turn well while navigating it either. We spent about $180 on this stroller and only used it a total of 3 times!

Stroller is easy to fold and unfold. Works great on grass and dirt roads, where I live. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that I wish the front tire had the option of moving/swiveling or locking instead of just not moving/swiveling at all, but it turns pretty easily and even my husband loves driving it."},{"rating":"2","title":"love it so far","review":"My husband and I love how durable it is, and we also love the quality.

Also has an excellent discussion of why exactly we use profanity. However, being a book on ancient Greek language necessitates having contents that are in ancient Greek.

Many of the arguments presented to support the (rather extreme) notions of the author were very sophistical, and they definitely did not hold up my own experience or the experiences of the men in my life (both the \\"regular\\" and \\"exceptional\\" varieties). In the end, some people are \\"swayed\\" by them, think they're proof for these extreme ideas being the only right ones, and then you get nasty fights among the faithful over stupid, unimportant things. We have much bigger fish to fry, thank you. Don't recommend this one at all - arguments for a more moderate position will sway people to appreciating modesty more reliably, permanently and intelligently."},{"rating":"1","title":"What planet does this repressed woman live on?!","review":"I'm what's referred to as a conservative Catholic, but Colleen Hammond's kind gives us an undeserved bad name. I can't stand the MTV/50-cent hooker-look either, but no way will I ever wear the latter-day burquas she recommends.A 1-star rating is way too high. This awful book is steeped in a poisonous brand of 19th century clericalism and the author's so-called fashion sense is mired in the worst of the 1950's. Worse yet, her scattershot forays into fringe-group conspiracy theories are downright sick.This is definitely not healthy reading. It's obvious that Colleen Hammond does not like men. Don't judge decent Catholic women by her twisted opinions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful and helpful!","review":"This book was such a jewel to find! It was so much more than just a \\"how-to\\" dress modestly; it delved into the history of immodest dressing and revealed some scary information about the Freemasons and their plans to undo the Catholic faith. Every woman and mother should read this book and heed its advice!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Misunderstanding Human Nature and the Role of Women","review":"I have several problems with the content of Colleen Hammond's book.1. She, like Freud, implies that all human interaction is based on sex.2. She encourages the false idea that women should do things in order to make men \\"take care\\" of them, as if they were children.3. She implies that she knows the preferences of every married man (i.e. old fashioned nightgowns and aprons)."},{"rating":"2","title":"try a challenge to conventional society for a change","review":"If you read this book without the expectation of hating it due to its conservative voice,and your capability to reason hasn't been completely destroyed, you may benefit from the reasoning and views found in the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great information, but I wish it appealed to a wider audience","review":"I read this book a few months ago and loved it. The information about the history of fashion gave me a whole new perspective on what should be \\"normal\\" women's attire. It amazes me how quickly fashion (and with it much respect for yourself, others, and God) went down the tubes. I had no idea! I have taken the author's recommendations to heart and love wearing dresses and skirts now.The only downside is that it is aimed specifically at a Catholic audience. Much of the information would be of little or no concern to someone who is not Catholic. Many of my friends are not Catholic and though I want to share the book with them, I don't think they will get as much benefit out of it as I did. I wish Colleen would write another book with similar information, but aimed at a general Christian audience."},{"rating":"1","title":"You'll love it . . . if you already agree with her!","review":"What struck me most about this book is that the author argues from emotion. If a reader is easily swayed by emotional arguments, or is already of the opinion that women should never wear anything but skirts & blouses or dresses (no pants, shorts, swimsuits etc.) then that reader will love this book. If a reader is not easily swayed by emotional arguments and is not already convinced of the morality of the author's dress code, then I seriously doubt that reader will be convinced by this book.The other thing which bothered me is the fact that, on the back cover of the book, the author is marketed as a \\"stay-at-home mother\\" while at the same time as \\"An award-winning writer, radio and television talk show host and speaker\\". She can't be a stay-at-home mom and at the same time a radio and TV talk show host and speaker. In my opinion this is a serious fumble which destroys much of the author's credibility."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dressing with Dumbness","review":"Colleen Hammond's book, dressing with Dignity, is the most poorly written book of it's kind I have seen. It destroys the entire purpose of old-fashioned dressing and Catholic way of life with slang words I will not repeat. It copies most of the exact same words of the superior book, \\"Immodesty, Satan's Virtue\\" by Rita Davidson (available at http://www.lffa-ollmpc.com ). Mrs. Davidson's book is much more informative, with sewing tips as well for making modest dresses. You can also buy modest dress paterns at the excellent above site. Hammond's book is trash which, if I were a mean old colledge professor, I would force my students to read for punishment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dressing With Dignity","review":"A wonderful guide for women of all ages who are fed up with Hollywood's fashion dictates. Sadly, in an era where the young are always trying to assert their individuality, their conformity to progressively degrading dress standards is the norm. Modesty and morality is now revolutionary, and \\"Dressing for Dignity\\" is an effective way of counteracting this spiral degradation of women. I can only hope and pray that more of us will take this book to heart and act upon it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is an 80's Classic","review":"While it does not star any of the *Brat Pack* this is definitely an 80's classic. It was one of those movies that used to come on HBO or Showtime like 4 times a day because there were no other movies to show...and I watched it every time. Then in the 90's it turned inot one of the movies that would come on at noon or 1:00 in the afternoon on Saturday on one of the low budget local stations that had no national affiliate (before upn and wb) and you just had to watch it. Now it makes a rare appearance on television, generally on the romance channel, and if you're lucky enough to catch it you just have to watch. It's a really bad story line and the acting isn't oscar calliber, but the cheesy background music and the weirdness of the plot keep you hooked. If you don't buy this video for yourself at least put it on your wish list and maybe someone will buy it for you....that's what I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could've Been Better","review":"I like Kristy McNichol's acting, but this movie was boring. There just isn't enough depth to any given character or scene for the viewer to connect with the movie in any way.The dance scene where Kristy and Patrick Cassidy dance is suppose to \\"symbolize\\" the main character loosening up. Instead, it's just goofy dancing to bad music, even for 1984 standards.I think the actors did their best with the material they were given. Sorry Kristy, it just wasn't enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow, can you say CONTRIVED?","review":"I can usually go for a romantic, feel-good movie but this movie was ridiculously contrived in the \\"love\\" department. This character had every man she ran into (and even her message takers) falling for her without any real motivation. In the real world, men don't fall at your feet or as this movie seemed to portray -- THROW themselves at your feet! I can believe that two men might fall for this character in the same timeframe but this bordered on ridiculous. And when she finally does get laid -- she says, \\"That was much better than fondue.\\" OMG -- pretty lame.And the soundtrack -- monotonous. Same musical phrasing played again and again. Uh, two ABBA songs at the dance party does not a soundtrack make! As for the person who recommended this as a rental for a date -- I have to disagree! Try SERENDIPITY if you want a fun romantic film for date night."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just the way you are","review":"I love Kristy in this movie. It's another simple feel good flick about not letting your disabilities get the better of you. Plus I love the setting in which the movie is filmed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Frank Look At Differently Abled Discrimination","review":"I found this movie to be very sweet, tender and thought provoking. Kristy goes from being frumpy and introverted to bubbly and outgoing and all with the aid of a cast. She uses this cast to make the world forget she has a leg brace due to a childhood illness. The movie does a great job at showing how the world treats her differently once they don't realize she is differently abled. Very 80's and no wonder, that's when it was filmed. The soundtrack is one of the lesser dated ones, due to all the Abba music. The ending is a little short, but promising none the less. On a personal observation: Why do people who hate movies so much they'd rather throw them off a cliff than watch bother to reveiw them? I mean they obviously have less boring lives than I do since I liked it and they didn't. Hmmmm.

No insights on how to market in this new digital age with all the various types of marketing media.Its too bad with all of the author's background he did not give us one example of how any corporate business is using each \\"marketing media\\" and with what results. While his remarks on how our brain works were interesting, it didn't reveal any startling revelations. This book only speculates that something never changes. The coverage of this topic was more suited to a lunch hour discussion than a whole book.

This would possibly be satisfactory if I were seasoned or an expert in the profession of marketing; but I am new to the \\"game.\\"The first four of the five chapters simply didn't flow. It is almost as if the author had started four separate books and decided he could combine his works and call it one. How else could the lack of continuity between the chapters be explained?

But I have found no explanation of what happened before, no complete end for the present plot. It stops and you don't know if somebody is dead or alive, nor if the heroes will escape the forest. Moreover, a lot of speculative theories borrowed from the worst Jung and the worst smoky psychology and anthropology. It is confuse, foggy, ununderstandable and I really can't understand why somebody can like it.

Holdstock has a wonderful imagination and talent for combining what is very close to if not an original myth to the subconscious perspective of his characters. I learned from his mythagos, and his view of the human mind or being. I met soldiers from ancient Rome, the Argonauts and legends I never even knew existed.

This is neither."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are better versions","review":"After making an honest attempt at reading Heffernan's account of the mutiny on the Globe I decided the story was much too interesting to be spoiled by his telling of events.Gregory Gibson's excellent book Demon of the Waters tells the same story in a far more exciting and informative manner, a real page-turner at the level of Junger and Philbrick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mostly filler","review":"There is simply not enough material here to justify a book. I got to the point where Comstock died and said, \\"That's it?\\" This should have been a magazine article at best. The actual mutiny and aftermath take up 50 pages or so. The majority of the book is two types of filler (along with several pointless appendices to get the page count up). The first is an excessively long rundown of the very few facts known about Samuel Comstock's prior life padded with a ton of speculation from the author. The second (and majority of the book) is an account of the two survivors living among the natives. This has some interesting points, but not enough, and is a completely separate and largely unrelated story from the mutiny itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Swiftly Flowing Narrative Equals a Good Summer Read","review":"Thomas Farel Heffernan has all the elements of a swift and exciting summer read in Mutiny on the Globe (The Fatal Voyage of Samuel Comstock). The author pares the story down to its essentials, the bloody mutiny and its aftermath. Some historical context is lost in the rush (for that readers should consult the excellent In the Heart of the Sea by Nathaniel Philbrick, a wonderfully detailed book covering the same historical period). What may be lacking in context is replaced by breathtaking, and often bloody, action. This is the perfect summery beach history book that provides thrills without sacrificing intelligence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather dissappointing","review":"The author's speculations were at times annoying.But what I disliked the most about this book wasit incomplete summary of the folks involved.The author wrote a good deal about the twostranded survivors.

This wasaggravating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thou Shalt Not Mutiny","review":"I have read a number of whaling/mutiny/lost at sea books in the last decade or so and was surprised as I trudged through this volume and found that the bits of fact and history were highly peppered with the author's own opinions and interjections. There is a lot of moralizing here, almost sermon like at times, and it completely gets in the way of the story. Heffernan may have been better served writing a novelization of this terrible and bloody event rather than a \\"history\\" as his histrionics many time take center stage. The book isn't terrible. It gets the facts across. But the best part of the book is actually the appendix that presents the actual journal of George Comstock (the mutineer's younger brother) as well as a few other historical tidbits. The story would have been much better served by a telling of the facts without all of the personal insight. I have purchased a copy of \\"Demon of the Waters\\" and am looking forward to a more direct approach to this wild story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Horror On The High Sea","review":"I read this book while sitting on a beach on Cape Cod, Massachusetts. As I gazed at the ocean in the direction of Nantucket, the bloody horror of this mutiny sent chills up my spin. Mutiny On The Globe is not for the weak at heart.

If for any reason you think Szell is too \\"cool\\" in this music, the sheer virtuosity of the orchestra should more than make up for it.In short, Szell offers a different view that's as enjoyable as Mravinsky's (to me, the reference version with its barely contained zeal) and that's probably more well played.

When I tried it out, the first time I had to stand on the scale for over TWENTY SECONDS before it would tell me that it couldn't get a reading for my weight. I finally got it to give me a weight, but it seemed a little off (182lbs). Decided to see what happens over 10 different weighings. I tried to stand as close to the same spot on the scale as possible. Ten tries and ten different weights, ranging from 165lbs (I liked that one!) to 212lbs!

Maybe my skin's too thick, or maybe the electrical charge it tries to send through your body is too weak.It's also inconvenient to use. To get your weight, all you have to do is step on it.

Secondly, they do not tear right after you pull the string to expose the new end. It is a pain to try to get all of the old paper off. The diameter of the wax is smaller than my old ones.

Unfortunately, the series ends there! This is a great book. It involves magic while not being cheesy and contains just the right amount of romance. The romance isn't heavy and is just lightly scattered throughout the book. Both those that enjoy romance and those that don't care for it would equally like this book.

I picture...I can't even rememer the country name, but all I can picture is a bunch of square Sectors divided up. EVERYTHING IS SO GENERIC.

She works under the (very sexy) talented warrior/assassin called Valek.The book is a wonderful mix of magic, action, romance, and charismatic, well developed characters to create the perfect read for a fantasy lover. The sequel, Magic Study, is a wonderful follow-up with a plot that is as just as, if not more, exciting than that of Poison Study, and leaves the reader hungry for the final installment of the trilogy (Fire Study)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasantly Surprised.","review":"I thought this book was going to be a bit boring being about a food taster because what could possibly be interesting about a food taster?...It wasn't boring at all.

Magic did play a role in the story, but it was more about the characters and their relationships, which is a nice change from fantasy where magic dominates the story. One minor complaint, I didn't believe that Valek would have accepted the Commander's order to execute Yelena at the end of the story, it really seemed to me that he loved her too much for that. Of course, we never find out what would have happened if the order was actually given to Valek, but it is implied that he would have carried it out. This was just a very minor flaw to me in an otherwise wonderful story. I will definitely be reading the sequel, \\"Magic Study\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"#1 favorite read","review":"I've purchased hundreds of ebooks, and this is my favorite book (and series) that I keep coming back to....

I have since read \\"Inside Out\\" and \\"Outside In\\" as well, and one thing that her boks all have in common is that her characters have depth and are in contstant change, learning from their experiences, chosing between right or wrong. There are consequences to every choice they make, and nothing is ever black or white.Poison Study was action packed and had me obsessing over it until it was finished. I think I read it in about a day, because I just couldn't put it down. The second book is just as good, but I have not read the third one yet, due to the reviews.

Then we have plots, assassination, magic,loyalty thrown into a fast moving and interesting novel. Many interesting characters abound and the plot unfolds out in a way you don't quite expect.As an aside, the UK cover is far more interesting, I would never have picked this up based on the US cover which seems aimed at female readers, this is good fantasy and should appeal to a much wider audience.Very enjoyable indeed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Pleasant Surprise","review":"This book was short and to the point. There was an adequate number of characters, easily remembered because they showed up quite a bit. The story was fun, (maybe not for Yelena), not dark and Yelena told her story of her past without whining. I went through this book quite quickly and enjoyed it. I look forward to the second book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining evening read","review":"A convicted murderess is given the opportunity to avoid hanging, by agreeing to be the commander's (ie socialist leader equivalent.. dictator would be a good modern day title) food tester. She can die by hanging, or slowly by poison.I quite enjoyed this book. It's not the best fantasy I've ever read, but it has elements of all the things that keep me interested. There is romance, intrigue, magic and some girl kick butt fighting. I like how the world is an apocalyptic socialist society, where you are identified by the colour and uniform you are wearing. While nothing is new in this novel, it will keep you entertained for an evening."},{"rating":"2","title":"hooked on Snyder!","review":"This was the first of her books that I read and am now a loyal fan of the author. She has created memorable characters and storylines that leave you wanting even more."},{"rating":"2","title":"COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN!","review":"A friend told me I would love this book -- and she was right. From the intriguing opening line, I was hooked and couldn't put the book down.The strong heroine and compelling writing reminds me of Madelaine Brent and Victoria Holt, but more mysterious. I can't wait to read MAGIC STUDY!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Recommended highly without spoilers","review":"Best read without even looking at the cover blurbs, this book grabbed me from the first paragraph. The writing flows easily; the characterization is good; the situations are intriguing. The closer I came to the end the more I hoped for a sequel. Fortunately, the sequel is already published. I have recommended this book to both my 18-year-old daughter and my 87-year-old father. Enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent plot line, but . . .","review":"The basic premise is decent, but the characterizations are cliche, the love story is very bad romance novel, the world is undeveloped and unclear, the protagonist wins too easily, and the text is filled with colloquialisms that jar the reader out of the story. *** SPOILERS *** The antagonist is using theobroma to drug the Commander? Has the author been reading a little too much Kage Baker? If the magic is like a blanket surrounding the world then are untrained magicians like CO2 and flouro-carbons waiting to eat up the ozone . . . I mean . . . magic blanket?In all fairness, Ms. Snyder had moments of truly fun writing, especially when Yelena was all by herself and working things out. But Valek, Ari, and Janco were characterizations and not real. And why do the bad guys like Rand always have some physical flaw that tips us off? Sorry, but I can't recommend this book and won't be buying the other two."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same old Luna","review":"I am disappointed that luna books does not recognize that there are other motivations for fantasy books starring women than sexual assault. Frankly, they present a story that is dark and un-satisfying, though it really did have potential. From my understanding, the Luna imprint was supposedly created to address women's interest in fantasy and romance. At this point, I actually hesitate to buy a Luna book because they have neglected the romance aspect, and honestly, any description of rape makes me very angry. Fantasy is about interest, and impossibility, something that is unreal, but desirable. I can't think of a single thing about this book that is desirable, and it seems a waste..."},{"rating":"1","title":"a little tiresome","review":"The story wasn't a particularly bad one, but neither was it good. A few plot twists, nothing unexpected. Pretty typical. The characterization wasn't enough to rise above the mediocrity of the plot. Still, I would have given it three stars except for the writing. The author was exceedingly fond of using subject-verb-object (he did this, she said that), with very little variation. After a while it becomes a little monotonous to read.If you're not very picky about what you read, this one isn't bad. Otherwise, I suggest looking elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea - mediocre writing skills","review":"I got this at the library and was glad it was free. I liked the plot and world the author has created, but her characters and dialogue are somewhat flat. Better execution would have made this a great book. I'll read the sequel - from the library as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly","review":"I read this and thought, \\"Wow, this is more like a romance novel than a fantasy.\\" I also found the characters and situations quite two-dimensional and shallow.I thought \\"Luna Publishing\\"? Never heard of it. It seems to be a division of Harlequin. Enough said.I can't imagine any guy enjoying this. Good for a quick beach read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was interested in the plot until half way through I came across a rather graphic rape scene. I couldn't take it and didn't finish the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I think I've had about enough","review":"I've bought three Luna books since the Harlequin division came out and Poison Study is the first book I actually read. I have to say that although Poison Study had a strong start, the story waned as it drew closer to the end. Those reading for romance will not be disappointed but for readers hoping to get something more, please look elswhere. This book is not for the faint of heart. There are vivid scenes of abuse and assault. The villians are evil for the sake of being evil. I guess you can't expect much for a Harlequin.This book is the last I will read from Luna. I've given them a chance by reading Poison Study and all I can say is that I was sorely disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yeah, I just don't get it either","review":"Nope, couldn't finish it. Nothing to hold my interest, absolutely nada. I need detail, characterization, something that makes me give a crap enough to finish it. I couldn't even skim for pete's sake and I returned it. I'm definitely going through a good book lull here. I guess I can't look at reviews cause I bought this one based on reviews and it sucked. The last good book I read was The Mark of Ran by Paul Kearney, and I mean wow-that's-good good, not just readable. Forget this. I haven't done well with Luna books either, so red flag 'em I guess, kick 'em to the curb, down the terlit. Now I'm going to tackle George R. R. Martin's latest. Will the wait be worth it? I'll report back..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than expected","review":"Strong character development, creating a connection between the reader and the characters. True to life that not everything works out perfectly. Would have liked to have more time spent going over what Yelena went through a youth. Hoping that some of the supporting characters develop more in the next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Idea, Weak Writing And Story Development","review":"As Young Adult fictional reading it might pass the test, but I'm afraid the novel \\"Poison Study\\" lost what little imaginative creativity it had going for it. The story became predictable and the characters came across as cardboard cutouts placed on a medieval stage with contemporary language. The author definitely has some talent for conceiving a story as there were glimmers of hope for a fantastic confrontational ending. Unfortunately, the creativity had run its course early on and the story ended with a harlequin romance whimper.The great thing about books is that one person's Poison can definitely be another's Medicine. Many reviewers seem to have found the antidote. Not I!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"Great book. Storyline so compelling that I finished the book in one sitting. Enjoyed the character development, plot line, love story, and writing style."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impossible to put down","review":"I was bored and looking for something to read until the next books in series I was already working on came out when I picked up Poison Study. Halfway through the first chapter, I was completely and totally hooked. I ended up staying up far later than I should have just so I could finish - and was both delighted and horrified to discover there's a sequel! Now I've got another series I'm anxiously waiting on! Excellent read, well developed characters and fast paced action. I highly recommend it - but make sure you have time to read it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book to start after the hunger games!","review":"So after The Hunger Games, I was in the slump of finding another trilogy to become engulfed in. I read Divergent, Crossed, Legend, Pandemonium & Delirium... And they all seemed too \\"young\\". I came across this book from a list of books that should be movies, I read the first couple pages from the AMAZON website and was immediately drawn in!!How it is similar to Hunger Games:- Trilogy ( Yay)- Powerful Female Protagonist- Love Story- Good pace that keeps you reading!I recommend this book!!! Great read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"Excellent story. I've read the whole series and eagerly look forward to the next one. And if you subscribe to her newsletter, you can get extra stories for free!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Smart, Feisty Female Lead","review":"I initially passed up this book because Maria V Snyder is (for me) a local author. When I started seeing it recommended on lists with alot of my current favorites, I couldn't pass it up any longer. In fact, I purchased the second book in the series while only halfway into the first.Maria Snyder has created an interesting world that contains interesting contradictions- It is a seemingly modern dictatorship with elements of medieval magic, pageantry and combat. Yelena's plight is worthy of sympathy, and watching her use her intelligence to thrive as the book unfolds is exciting. I can't wait to move on to the next!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Picked this up in NYC... and couldn't put it down","review":"While trying to rest my dogs in New York after hours of walking, I stopped in a bookstore. As I perused the SF shelf, this book stood out to me. I dropped to the floor with the copy in my hands... and walked out of the store having purchased a hard back (something I almost NEVER do).The story is a bit different than what I've read before. The universe is obviously ours in the renaissance, but changed just enough... The heroine is a fantastic character who goes through a complete revelation of self. She startes a condemned prisoner, and ends a condemned fugitive. But along the way, she makes friends and discoveries that have the reader in her corner, commisserating with her the whole time.My one problem with the book is the obvious set up for a sequel. Unfortunately, that doesn't come out for a year or so!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I think I have a new favorite author!","review":"I could not believe how quickly this book hooked my attention. It was definitely one of the best fantasy/romance books I've read in a very long time...The poisons really made the book intriguing to me. I've been interested in this kind of assasin/espionage plot line since The Belgariad and Mallorean (Eddings).The romantic plot line was also very well-written... and it wasn't necessary obvious that a relationship would develop, which keeps it interesting.READ THIS BOOK!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book! The next two in the series let you down though....","review":"The first book of this series was tremendous. I would give it a 5 star review. The next two books started to bore me. Each more than the next. SPOILER: The author took wonderful characters (Valek, Janco, Ari, the commander) and replaced them with some insignificant ones (the 4 magicians, various members of the Zaltana clan) and kept on going with the whole magic thing. I really miss the action, suspense, poison, 'knowledge' gained, and excitement of the first book in the next two. The magic didn't ruin the first book. It was just there. But it did get annoying in the next two books. IF anyone has a recommendation for a book similar to poison study but not magic or fire study, I would love to know."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book","review":"This book was a great introduction to the series. Like the other two, at times it was bogged down by too many people with too much going on, but overall it was an entertaining and quick read."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am SHOCKED I read the whole thing","review":"I adore a good disaster book, and I understand that with these kinds of books there is a level of chaos, quick character development and jumpy storytelling. With this particular book, even with those things in mind it was so boring and I actually wanted all these people (of which there were way too many to keep track of) to fall into a hole and die.

Quality sucks compared to previous belt","review":"Any 5 star reviews here were probably written when these belts were made with real neoprene. I had one of these I bought about six years ago and it was made of quality neoprene equivalent to wet suits. I only bought another one because it was tearing where the velcro attaches. THIS THING IS MADE OF THIN JUNK. It stretches out of shape immediately. It has no form at all.DO NOT BUY THIS PATHETIC THING. IT TOTALLY SUCKS.

But, where there's life (and presumably no whites) there's hope.OK, did you ever hear of the movie, Birth of a Nation? It was a shockingly racist movie that preached \\"white=good, black=bad.\\" Well, this is the modern day version.

Saxophonist T. Taylor and pianist Chris Forbes have recorded a cutting-edge jazz album of free improvisation coupled with sheer musical chemistry. Those with an ear and a taste for the complexities of assonance will find themselves engaged by the many levels the duo bring to their improvisation. Musical laments build to exuberance, and exuberance gives way to the hushed simplicity of a few isolated notes. The spectacular part of this CD is that the more you listen to it, the more you get out of it. I'm on my fourth listening, and I am still astonished by some of the musical turns. My favorite cut, \\"Petrin Hill,\\" is over twenty minutes of music that won't let go.I highly recommend this CD for jazz aficionados, particularly for those who appreciate the immediacy and power of improvisation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christie...more than Yellow River","review":"Christie was a group either behind or ahead of its time...depending on your perspective. They were out of step with the early 70s progressive rock movement...but pre-dated the rock revival and glam rock scene by several years.This reissue of their first album (plus bonus tracks) is a long overdue gem. The songs are all catchy and riff laden mini-masterpieces.

After 3 months my hair is thicker, I can see the little short new hair coming in, can't see my scalp when it is wet now. They said it may take up to 6 months to notice a change. I had used generic Minoxidil for women, it worked for me , but I did not like the feel of it on my hair and it made my hair dull, and it has to be put on 2 times a day.UPDATE 5/2012: I have to say that it seemed to work for the first 7 or 8 months, but my hair started to get thin again. I went back to the minoxidil and in about 3 months my hair started to get thicker. Using the Hair Laser still seems to give my hair more body and using both makes my hair look better."},{"rating":"1","title":"does not work at all","review":"yeah stay away from this i payed $1200 to buy it in 2005 and didn't work at all it may work for some but not in my case so i think stay away and save your moneyGary Buontempo"},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes you feel like it's doing something.","review":"Can't say that it grows your hair back, but it sure makes you feel like it's doing something.

Even the Nan King massacre is brought up. For you Japan hands, this title will provide little that is new. The book was written at the time Japan was at it's economic peak, before the bubble burst and before the 10 year long recession. Because of that, there are a lot of assumptions regarding how powerful Japan was/is going to be in the year 2000, predictions that really didn't come true.

So unless the book is used simply for instruction or study, or you go down the list vertically and conceal the answers as you do the puzzles, you will see the answers. The puzzle workbook answers should have been printed in a separate section in the back of the book. Despite this drawback, I think the book is a great study tool and I recommend it highly.

You can enjoy this book even if you have never read a poem, not even in high school. Pieces are very touching, other very funny. Heynen has a deep knowledge of the historical facts which contributes to his understanding and compassion. Most of the short poems resemble tiny stories, quick pictures of imaginary and true events, snapshots of Crazy Horse, his friends and enemies, all the Custers and those other folks from that time out there. These are uncomplicated and lovely prose poems. You don't need to know all about the Little Big Horn to enjoy Heyen's book, though it may help to know he has his facts right. His emotions are in the right place too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware!","review":"This is the BIGGEST night light I have ever seen...why does it need to be so large?

I had size limitations on what I could accomodate in a storage structure. It fits well, stores quite a bit, is very heavy duty, and was easy to assemble. My only frustration with the unit is that they do not offer an interior shelf package option. I ended up putting a small freestanding metal shelving unit inside to hold small hand tools and garden supplies, while the longer garden tools stand upright. I would purchase the unit again.....a good value for the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"No shelvings provided","review":"No shelvings are included despite what the picture shows. Also even you want to make shelvings by yourself, they are in a strange shape which will require some skills. So you can't really buy any rectangular shelvings from other manufacturer to go with it. I don't understand why Rubbermaid doesn't make those to go with the unit and make a profit off of them. So basically this item is only for storing long handled tools only."},{"rating":"1","title":"Falls Apart Easily","review":"I was so excited until I opened the box. I had to find the instructions online since none were provided. Easy to put together? no. It took 2 of us just to try to hold it together, while a third person set pieces in place.

I had a rubber hammer; it was helpful but I probably could have gotten the shed together without it. You need a flat surface at least eight feet long and five feet wide, and a wall or other solid surface to push against.The assembled cabinet is sturdy and very nice looking. I reccomend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"You can purchase shelves","review":"Most complaints are about not having the shelves. On the assembly instructions for this shed under the \\"Care and Use\\" section, there are instructions on how to make your own wood shelving and a template with measurements.You can also purchase metal wire shelves for $23 each by calling Rubbermaid Consumer Service at 888-895-2110, M-F 8:30am-5:00pm ET. Although you can't order any other way than by calling the manufacturer, it's not a big issue, it took only a couple of minutes to order. 5-7 days delivery time.One other thing to consider when purchasing this shed that I found out from Rubbermaid customer service - maximum weight of all items you can put inside should not exceed 100 lb. If total weight of contents exceeds this weight, the shed may fall apart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great - but no shelves","review":"Easy to put together - perfect size and shape - but no shelves is a bummer.

The lyrics sound as if they handed Bernadette Peters one of those \\"men are beasts\\" self-help books and told her to sing it to the audience. Also, you know the score is skimpy when they have to repeat the same melody three times before the end of the overture.There are a few bright spots--like the charming mother/daughter duet \\"Don't Follow in My Footsteps\\" and the junk food anthem \\"2 Good 2 Be Bad\\"--but I don't think they're worth the cost of the whole album. Maybe go to Rhapsody or Itunes so you can download just those songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it!","review":"Bernadette Peters and some minor humor are the only things that shine in this failure.

Big L is definately an amazing MC: tights flows, great ghetto stories, and devestating battle raps. Probably the best out-and-out blood-thirsty gangster rapper of his genre (and no, Jay-Z, Pac(what flow???), and post-Illmatic Nas don't compete, and can't rap about anything other than materialism over weak instrumental beats). The production's a real treat too, with some of the Diggin In The Crates' finest like Lord Finesse and Showbiz on the beats, so some great, menacing drawn-out jazz smapling setting the dark soundscapes for Big L's darker lyrics. While deliberately OTT, Big L's lyrics don't go far beyond disses and gangster glorification, but when done as fantastically as this, who cares?"},{"rating":"2","title":"DONNA HAYFORD STAY THA FU.CK AWAY FROM HIP HOP!","review":"DONNA HAYFORD YOU REMIND ME OF C...U...m!!!!!

The beeats here are terrible and the rhyming is pretty lame. To me this sounds like the typical NYC MC with one style and the whole album sounds like one long freestlye over weak beats.

The ground pin broke off the original the last time I used the trailer. The unit has always worked well with UHaul trailers and my own trailer. The original has had limited use so I was unhappy that the ground pin was not sturdier. I was always careful in plugging in the trailer connector so the only thing I don't like about this product is the fact that the connector is part of the molded rubber body of the converter (requiring replacement of the whole unit if the weak ground pin fails as in my case).

I made the check based on another review. It could be due to a defective chuck or gear box output shaft run out. The tool is well featured and those features are easy to use.

A must for novice investors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Mutual Fund Strategy","review":"The problem with this book is that it does not provide a selling strategy for Bear markets. Fortunately, I got completely out of the stock market and into money market funds shortly after Labor Day of 2000.

After a short professional autobiography, he explains his methodology for selecting stocks and explores a few dozen January 1992 stock picks in detail. Lynch wrote this book in the last days before the ubiquity of personal computers and the Internet's copious and accessible financial information. Still, Lynch offers pithy investment advice (each unfortunately titled with a boldface \\"Peter's Principle\\") that transcend the book's early-1990s setting. His enthusiasm should inspire most beginning to intermediate investors for whom this material is recommended. Due to its age, used copies of this book should be widely and cheaply available."},{"rating":"2","title":"Learn from the Master","review":"Lynch's success comes not from his complex algorithms and estoric financial modeling, but from opening his eyes to the world and noticing good businesses.His success at Magellan is attributed to his ability to find good companies, at reasonable valuations, and be patient enough to watch them climb.This book is much more specific than his other release. Here, he provides detailed accounts of stock picking strategy, including how to choose from different stocks, when to buy, when to buy more and when to sell.This is a quick read, but there is a huge amount of information that the average investor can use to their benefit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book, informative and educational","review":"Peter Lynch writes well and this book has some classic wisdom that lets you into his mind. One drawback is that Mr. Lynch may sometimes forget just how smart he is and tends to over simplify some aspects of investing analysis that come to him naturally. For example, asking a clerk at a retail store what sells well is a technique Mr. Lynch will use on occasion to evaluate a stock. However, it's key to note that he also has a great deal of resources in the form of advanced technology and research tools, not to mention personal genius.This book is highly recommended and can be a great tool for a business owner or investor but I'd caution most non-professionals on reading this and thinking they can become the next Peter Lynch with little more than a computer and a brokerage account. Good book, thanks Mr. Lynch."},{"rating":"2","title":"No formula but...","review":"If you want a checklist of items that you should review before buying a stock, forget it. The formulas aren't stated clearly in there. But if you read carefully and understand the message behind the words, you will learn how Lynch picks a stock. So, if you are a lazy reader and seldom take notes of what you read, this is not the book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a how-to book","review":"This book can be summarized as follows: \\"Whenever you personally observe a company to be successful or promising, go off and do fundamental research, and if the fundamentals look good, buy.\\" Other than that, there is no generally applicable stock-picking advice here, just a detailed post-mortem report of Lynch's 1992 stock-picking decisions. Imagine a book by a chess master which purports to provide winning chess-playing strategies but in fact provides just a move-by-move description of one particular chess game the author won. Save your money for buying stocks, or buy a useful book which actually contains stock-picking strategies, e.g. How to Make Money in Stocks by William J. O'Neil."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh...","review":"Not all that useful, really. Message is \\"buy mutual funds!\\". In general, since the vast majority of mutual funds underperform the market, just buy index funds would be the best advice. Most of the text is entirely useless to someone who might want to trade individual stocks. Passages suggest that if a company seems undervalued you might want to have lunch with the CEO to go over the financials and confirm your valuation. Oh, thanks Peter, what great advice...

About half way through though Lynch veers off and rambles on and on about SNLS and other obscure stocks thereby abandoning his \\"buy what you know\\" theory (unless, of course you are an investment banker and probably wouldn't need this book). A big letdown after loving his first book. Difficult to get through after first half. Better to re-read OUOWS again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lynch loves himself very much","review":"I can't believe this book has been reviewed 5 stars. It is horribly outdated (many companies it mentions are out of business), the writing is insubstancial and borders on join-my-Lynch-fan-club promotion. I didn't learn anything from it, other than the simple (and obvious) fact that you need to research companies before you buy into them. But when Lynch goes and tells up to call up a company CEO to ask them how things are going (as he recalls numerous times throughout the book), that's when it's worthless.Save your time and money and go with someone else."},{"rating":"1","title":"This review is for all of you new investors...","review":"This book is considered one of the best books for teaching the small investor how to pick stocks. Forget it! The market is in a mania (1994-1998?) the likes of which the capitalist world has never known. Instead, check out JK Galbraith's \\"The Great Crash\\", \\"A Short History of Financial Euphoria, Allen's \\"Only Yesterday...\\", and James Grant's \\"The Problem with Prosperity...\\" to understand why \\"small investors\\" should not delude themselves into thinking that they can \\"beat the market\\".

For each category (i.e. Art Noveau brooches) it gives one representative item in picture and description + estimation of value, and several similar ones (different craftmanship or designer than the main example) but without the value (which bugged me a little). If it also offered a comprehensive table with all/most info arranged in one place, for quick reference, it would be perfect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Take with a grain of salt","review":"Overall not a bad book as there is a shortage of books to tell you how to actually get into the business of antiques. It desperately needs updating; it has no mention of ebay or other Internet sources. I didn't like the authors advocation of rude behaviour at garage sales and other venues in pursuit of a \\"deal\\" or his obvious mistrust of auctioneers. Perhaps it's a regional thing. Don't make it your only source and read with an open mind.

The chuck does not hold drill bits well and allows them to slip. Now my drill bits look like I tried to cut screw threads on their shanks.The second issue with the chuck is that the bits (screwdriver or drill) never self-center in the chuck jaws when going from a larger diameter to smaller diameter bit.

It is an indespensible part of his other publications and brings them altogether for a much more complete understanding of what he does, why he does it, and how you can accomplish similar results if you want it bad enough.Esther E Zeman"},{"rating":"1","title":"This Is Far From Swing!","review":"The title track is not representive! Why? It's very good! This album is boring. It is mix of vocal groups sounds, pop of the eighties, shakin' stevens-wanna-be-rock'n'roll, a cover of Radiohead Creep (very boring cover),... If you like the title track you should buy a Swing compilation \\"Swing On The Wild Side\\", coz this album is not even worth listening."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spare your time and nerves...","review":"This book is neither intuitive nor funny...

I also followed your guidelines, what is up?Thank You Rob Fisher Programmer/Analyst"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Pleased with Item and Service","review":"My daughter loves Jessie from Toy Story 2, and we were very excited to find this playset on Amazon for her birthday. She really enjoys playing with this doll and is very proud of her (she is a frequent visitor to show and share at school.) The sleeves of the outfits are a little difficult for my 4 year old to manage when changing the clothes, but otherwise the clothing is very easy to change. The doll is very poseable. She can't really ride Bullseye very well, but she CAN ride Breyer horses quite well. This seller was GREAT! He got the item out very quickly-- we ordered a little last-minute and sent a message letting tyhem know we were trying to get it for a birthday and they sent personal emails to us to let us know we would have it-- and we did. The packaging was in mint condition so we were able to wrap it in the packaging (sometimes when we have bought toys from resellers we have found the packaging slightly damaged-- not this time!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but!","review":"Toys look great but 2 things that was not described well in the description. 1st Bullseye the horse can not be posed. he can only move his neck around. 2nd the height of the jessie doll is a little smaller than the woody and Buzz light year. I can best describe it close to a larger Barbie or Bratz doll. Other than that I was okay for the rest. This is really a Xmas gift and have not been given to the Kids. other than that and the price which I wish I found @ a cheaper price. Hopefully when Toys Story 3 comes out more new products come out at a better price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Handy","review":"I carry my Stanley pocket knife around with me at all times.

It doesn't have anything that is the slightest bit funny. I think the title \\"perfect holiday\\" refers to a black woman's idea of the perfect holiday. I'm not sure because I returned this movie to Netflix without finishing watching it. I didn't want to waste my valuable time on it. I couldn't care less about a black woman's idea of the perfect romantic holiday. I just wanted to see some hilarious ghetto comedy about Christmas. This is really a chick flick, so you'll probably like it better if you're a chick. I think it's a dumb movie. I thought it was really stupid and insane when the black lady said that all she wanted was a complement from a nice guy who wasn't after her for sex. Yeah and I want a 3 legged elephant with pink polka dots."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Perfect Holiday","review":"I was really excited to see this movie, not only because of the star power involved, but also because it is a Christmas movie.

When it comes to music, this record is my \\"desert island\\" choice. I've had my copy of the old original \\"red album\\" since it first came out, and after hundreds of listens, this sublime music keeps renewing itself.

She encourages the students to listen to other pieces as well, featuring the instrument they play. My daughter plays cello and I've always loved Bach and Yo Yo Ma, so this seemed like a good collection to have. We've been playing it non stop ever since! We both enjoy listening to the music and actually talk about the pieces. My daughter is 13, so anything that gets us to talk is a must have! The fact that the music is beautifully performed is a major bonus!"},{"rating":"2","title":"YoYo Ma","review":"Fabulous rendition of the Bach suites.

This highly talented artist dares to interpret his composer with elegance and exquisite technique. Feel his fingers detecting the notes as he plays. Lisaten to his heart beat as he stops... In this CD by Mr. Ma, the musical notes invite you to participate with the composer to dance amongst the Lilies, and pleasantly be taken in the air by wind and water. This CD is amongst my very favorites to do art work, oil painting or calligraphy. perfect for expectant mothers and new borns.. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Purchase the CD \\"That's All\\" instead","review":"I am a huge Mel Torme fan and the renditions on this \\"Most Requested\\" cd are some of his finest. However, you would do yourself a big favor by purchasing the CD \\"That's All\\" instead. Why? Because \\"That's All\\" contains all of the songs on this cd plus 8 more, and, because it was re-mastered in 1997, it sounds much better.All of the reviews for this cd are correct. It is a superb collection of songs performed by a true vocal master.

I didn't think my husband and I wasted shampoo and conditioner, but since it's premeasured, you do use less. I love the basket for holding the bar of soap and some shaving cream. My razor hangs between the hooks. We loved this so much, we bought another one with just the two pumps (no basket)."},{"rating":"2","title":"special gift","review":"my son and my daughter in law recently moved to a new house, for a present i bought them a bathroom set and this was part of it. it has 2 chambers which you can fill up with body lotion,liquid body soap, shampoo,and conditioner plus it has a shelf in between, on the shelf you can put a bar soap and some bottles of shampoo.... it also has some hooks for the wash clothes... i only bought one for my son he ordered another 2 for all his bathrooms."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defaective product","review":"This product is attractive, but one of the dispensers is defective.

I worked on the product and my plumber came back today to verify my conclusion that it is defective.[...]"},{"rating":"2","title":"AVIVA Dispenser Shower Basket, White","review":"This item is great. It holds shampoo and conditioner, or whatever liquids you need in the shower, and also has a handy basket that I use to keep the shower spray cleaner and my shaving cream. The handy hooks hold my razor and my washcloth. Really cuts down on the clutter and puts everything in one place. However, I had to buy this item from another vendor because Amazon kept delaying shipment. After the delays had exceeded a month, I finally cancelled my order and went elsewhere. Good product, bad transaction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chrome rusted after about 18 months","review":"This products is a great design and we liked it until the chrome shelf rusted very badly after about 18 months.

I would reccommend for anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"PUMPS FAIL QUICKLY","review":"I really liked these at first until they started failing one by one. The pumps just stop working and there is nothing you can do to fix them so they are useless. Very disappointing since they failed right after the warranty period."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rusty Mess","review":"This pump/shelf system was great at first but now less than i year later the shelf has almost rusted through. I thought this would be a somewhat permanent fixture in the shower and definitely did not expect to have to replace it yearly. We have a large, tile shower and the thing never even gets very wet. Disappointing for the amount of money spent. On the flip side, the pumps are OK. I have shoulder length hair, not too thick, and I have to pump 4 times for enough shampoo and 6 times for conditioner. Not what I expected but I have not had any problems with the pump."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Customer Service I've encountered in a long time AND faulty product.","review":"I had one of these before and loved it so we bought another. This one was mounted on the wall for the required time and when I loaded it up with products it crashed to the floor and busted EVERYTHING. Upon further inspection, I noticed that the silicone never hardened and felt it was faulty so I contacted the company. 2 months later I am still jumping thru hoops with these clowns. Twice they have said they sent out a replacement product and after waiting over a month both times to receive it they sent the wrong item!! This so easy to remedy: Replace it and I will get on Amazon and rave how great they are. Ask for countless pictures of the broken product, ship the wrong item twice and only answer every other email and watch me go crazy. It's things like this that make you lose faith that there are any companies left with worthy customer service. Don't give your money to these people. They truly do not deserve it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aviva Shower Dispenser","review":"This new version is excellent. I have owned this product before, and the older one was metal, and rusted after a few months. The new one has a brushed nickel coating to it, is much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Splish Splash","review":"We bought this unit somewhere in the 6 month ago range and it is superb. We did take note of some of the other reviews and have tried our best to keep the plated surfaces clean. We do not store the bar of soap in this rack but we have everything else. The two liquid dispensers have the standard shampoo and conditioner in them and have shown no sign of not doing exactly what they were intended to do. I would buy this again and probably will for gifts and a spare or two."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh Brave New World","review":"If nothing else this book reminds you of why you can't take blurbs seriously.As the excerpts fromthe review would have it this is a masterpiece.Not!The author throws too many chararacters at you too soon and you can't remeber whothey are or figure out why you should care.You quickly learn to distinguish goodies from badies.Good-Athieists,Gays,Progressives.Bad-everyone else.Wer'e in a shallow PC world here.Still the author can be pretty funny.I suspect this would be a much better book if it didn't try so hard.He is a good observer and clever but he is not a thinker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who Needs 50+ Medium Picks","review":"The photo in the write-up shows a thin, a medium and a heavy pick.

They were too big in the boxes for the stockings but they were very nice and my daughter (age 7) enjoyed the books that came with them as well. They are roughly the size of a Strawberry Shortcake doll if you are familiar."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adorable mini doll!","review":"The books are tiny and cute, but not pretend or toys. If you are looking for the book, you should get the full sized book. This book is more a toy for the full sized doll, as I believe the Samantha doll was meant to be the Nelly doll's toy doll and book. My daughter only has a Nelly and Samantha mini doll, however, and she loves them. Even when the hair gets all frizzy, all it takes is running your hand over it a few times to smooth it back down. High quality construction as expected from the American Dolls. A wonderful pocket doll!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute doll","review":"Very cute, like the mini dolls better than big dolls. Very detailed, would be nice if came with stand. Would recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Cute","review":"This is a very cute doll.

You can not read the book, but the doll is still very cute."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tiny, Tiny, Tiny!!!","review":"I got this and the Felicity Doll for my 5 and 6 year old girls for this Christmas. They wanted the real things but I didn't think they were ready for a doll at that price point. So, when I found these I was excited... Then SHOCKED, when they arrived!! Maybe it is my fault and I should have dug deeper in the item discriptions to see if they listed the measurements. I just went off of the cute picture and some of the other reviews. I'm telling you these dolls are ridiculously small! I am sure once out of the box they are cute and my girls will probably be excited but I don't feel they are worth the price. I should have just bought the real thing and at least felt good about the product for dollar value."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Misleading","review":"I knew the dolls were going to be small, but I think it is very misleading to not stipulate that the book is a MINI book. I actually thought 19.99 was a TERRIFIC price for the mini doll AND the hardcover book. I received my order and thought that my order was incomplete because I had no idea that the Meet Samantha book would actually be INSIDE the doll box. The dolls are cute and my daughters will love them...but I certainly wasn't expecting such a small book. The ones for 11.97 would be worthwhile. I wish I had read all the customer reviews ahead of time. I did read the reviews for some of the AG mini dolls, but unfortunately none of the ones I happened to read mentioned the MINI book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"While I love the American Girls, this doll was so small, it doesn't compare to the regular American Girls dolls that American Girls are known for. The book on the making of the movie was not very informative. It's better off being a dvd or being part of the dvd. I don't know why they made a book on the making of the movie nowadays when this is usually in the dvd itself. As for the doll, get the larger version instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"save up for a bigger version...","review":"My daughter is so in love with the American Girl series and when I researched the cost of the dolls I had a major case of sticker shock! I was excited that I found what I thought would be a good compromise. Boy was I disappointed when the doll barely fit in the palm of my hand. I wish I had spent the money on a few of their books instead.

The book is one of the more biased educational books I have ever read. Each chapter is an ideological text rather than a text book. There is one chapter that instructs teachers how, using different types of power, to teach what ever they want in violation of the local school board. Another point reiterated though out the book is how discrimination against females is one of the causes of our present poor educational system. If you have a open mind and want to read a book that will present both sides of an argument, this is not the book for you.

Also, the chapters are long."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vendor return policy","review":"The book was in reasonable shape. The problem was it was incorrectly listed on the syllabus, and then I dropped the class anyway. I have my drop class documentation. Vendor basically said they didn't make the mistake (like I did??),and maybe I should try to sell it on Amazon. Vendor only contacted me after I had had no success trying to contact them, called Amazon, and then vendor emailed me. I never have found their return policy. I won't buy anything from them again, that's for sure. I was especially angry because this Used book was $60."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Textbook","review":"School and Society by Tozer, Violas and Senese proved to a very interesting read. There was an enormous amount of information written in a style that gave you a sense of visiting the particular era about which, you were reading.There were times when the intensity became like a serial program. I could hardly wait to see what the next page encountered.I did feel the authors were not the least bit inhibited about their political views. Readers may have to be conscious of that issue.The book served well as a text and I have already used it as a reference for other classes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not helpful at all","review":"1/2 of the book is a historical account of, well, history! It supposedly focuses on the history of \\"education,\\" but it's actually just a giant history lesson that I didn't sign up for. Pretty lame. Textbooks about education are, once again, mostly useless. We need to pay attention to current events, and that can't be accomplished through a textbook. Textbooks are too slow, and can only really cover theoretical information. This wasn't a good book, and I'm mad that I spent so much money on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tozer is not a dozer! This book will help you out.","review":"School and Society by Steven E. Tozer et al was a well-written text that was easy to read.

It covered such topics as understanding school & society; liberty & literacy: the Jeffersonian Era; the common-school era; social diversity & differentiated schooling; diversity and equity; schooling & African-Americans; schooling & American Indians; national school reform; liberty & literacy today; the professionalization movement; vocational & liberal ideals; the post-cold war era; and school & contemporary society.

This is a book about friendship and shared life experiences, woven around poker and roshambo and the circle game. Once you understand the concept of \\"tilt\\" as a form of currency in the game of life (to be earned, spent, loved, leveraged and traded) you will ADORE every word of this funny, imaginative, entirely entertaining book. Kudos to Kim Scheinberg the editor. She did an admirable job.I smiled from the first page to the last. I laughed out loud - a lot. I identified with the camaraderie of people making and cherishing lifelong friendships. Anyone who has ever had a shared life experience with even one close friend will enjoy this book. It made me jealous - I wished I had been a Tiltboy. But, more than mere jealousy, I increased the value I put on my own friendships with every page I turned. I hated to reach the end.Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is awful","review":"I am sure this book would be very funny if you were a tiltboy or friend of the tiltboys.

If you spend a night reading, it will feel like you're out on the town. I enjoy reading for recreational pleasure and for factual education. Most of the time reading is work. I blew threw this book in about 5 days! I've also made it required reading for all of my poker friends.In reality, they are just a bunch of sick-smart guys (and gal) who love to play poker, gamble (yes, there IS a difference between the two!), and screw with each other. This book is a compilation of some of their shennanigans over the years. I'm sure some of their best material is in here. However, to really be a tiltboy, I'm sure this has to be an attitude, a way of life. I read somewhere that you should think of the guys in Animal House with an average IQ of 120. I'd say that this is a correct assessment. And I hope that someday that I will aspire well enough to have the honor of being called a Tiltboy.Great reading!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A book with a sly subliminal message","review":"This book is a ripoff of the Anthony Burgess \\"A Clockwork Orange\\" novel with \\"tilt\\" being substituted for \\"ultra-violence\\".

The simulation/flight control physics seem to be spot on. I have no problem trying to learn 75 different ways to lock at target. The problem I have with the game is the graphics are poor compared to Lock On and the only way to manipulate gages in the cockpit is with the 2D cockpit. I have Track IR and with all other sims (Lock On, Wings Over Vietnam, IL2, FS) you are able to see working gages in VC. So the lack of graphics, combined with the virtually unusable virtual cockpit make this game not worth the time to learn it.

It is stable and beautifully rendered. For me the big disappointment was that just like the original F4 this initial release does not support more than one controller. This means that I must choose between my HOTAS COUGAR Stick/Throttle or my CH Pro USB Rudder pedals. Even though the rudder action can be entered via the keyboard <,> and <.> keys and the CH Control manager will allow key mapping, the response is unacceptable loss of control during cross wind landings.Fortunately this deficiency is to be corrected in the near future - according to the manufacturer.Until I am able to fly this airplane properly I am not planning to explore the vast possibilities of this potentially awesome Flight Combat Sim"},{"rating":"1","title":"WAAAY too complicated","review":"This was a complete waste of money for me.

However, casual flight simmers should beware - this game is, just like its predecessor, is very in-depth and can be quite hard to grasp. If you're not a die-hard flight sim person, I would suggest items like Microsoft Flight Simulator. Short of the steep learning curve - F4:AF is incredible.

Be it known, it is not a simple jump in and fly type game but a game you need to have some patience with.

One voice is the biographical narrative. The second is gratuitous English 101 literary criticism. The third voice is even more intrusive, a psychological analysis that is apparently based on the author's politics, prejudices and enthusiasms.The second problem is this.When assuming the latter two voices, in particular, the text is shaded when not overwhelmed by the author's perceptions and opinions.As a result this is neither biography nor history.It's a personal assessment, a critique and a memoir.I'm still looking for a good bio of Rimbaud.Anybody know of one?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Life of the Man, Not Just the Poet","review":"Before this biography, my knowledge of Rimbaud's life was limited to the brief blurbs afforded him in anthologies and such.

However, if you have a large dog that is going to buck at the crate, you might need to find one that is a little sturdier, as I can't imagine putting a whole 100 pound dog in this crate.

I got my dog from the pound, and could have gotten a size smaller based on his weight, but decided to go ahead and get one size bigger in case he grew, and boy am I glad I did.This is a very study cage that is easy to set up and take down.

Putting the divider at half is perfect for his current size. I love how we'll be able to open it up more as he grows. My two complaints are: (1) the wires and (2) the slider latch. (1) Though the wires are painted and coated well, they still have sharp edges every now and again. The sharp edges aren't where my puppy will feel them, but when I put in and took out the divider, I got scratched. The second thing is that the door hinge is difficult to open and close. It's a slider latch and I have to really fight with the door to get the hole and latch to line up so I can secure it; the whole process is a little noisy and my puppy is sometimes startled (and the last thing I want is for him to associate fear with any parts of his home, especially the opening). So, overall, I like the crate. It serves its purpose and the divider is a really great perk. I would recommend it, but with the caveat of not expecting perfection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect training crate","review":"Setting up this crate was simple and straightforward.

The slide out tray is a nice feature but we rarely need to use it as our huge cushion-style bed we bought for use with this crate takes care of covering the entire floor of the crate. Our dog more importantly loves it too, we only close the door at night when we are sleeping and during the day while we are home the door is left open and our dog uses it like a doghouse going in and out as she pleases. She feels safe and secure which was most important to me since this is my first crate trained dog and I was worried if she'd even like it, she'll often go in to take a nap during the day, so I would say that means she likes it."},{"rating":"2","title":"iCrate dog crate","review":"This crate is easy to set up.

It's easy enough for the dog to simply undo the latches. If you padlock the latches, they can push out the side panel and go out that way. In order to make this work we had to put plastic tie-wraps all along all the \\"seams\\" where the sides meet every couple of inches, as well as three locks where the door meets the crate.

Hence, the need for a traveling crate big enough for our Schnauzer mix (30 lbs.) when we leave him in the hotel room, but also small enough to fit in the trunk of the car. My only reason for giving this a 4 star rating is the single latch. Our other crates, bigger ones, have dual latches. I felt that this crate should have had a dual latch, too.

Well made and easy to fold up. I use it every day and would only buy Midwest ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Impossible to Assemble","review":"This dog crate was nearly impossible to assemble. It looked as if the top may have been attached upside down. The panels fit so tightly that it was extremely difficult to hook the front and back panels to the top panel. I did finally get it assembled but the edges of the panels didn't really fit together quite right, and it would have been really hard to fold it up and reassemble it. The reason I purchased a wire collapsible crate is because I wanted to be able to fold it up to put it away or move it easily. Amazon was great with the return but I did not order a replacement from the Midwest company. Instead I've ordered a Pet Edge brand crate and am hoping it will work properly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great!","review":"My dog loves her new kennel.

This was easy to assemble and with a sheet at ther bottom they are very comfortable.

This was a good buy for the price, and cheaper than buying one big one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wouldn't buy another","review":"I bought this product for my 50lb Aussie mix that I rescued last week. After 5 days she figured out that she could ram herself through the seam at a corner and escape. The metal is now bent out of shape and she can get herself out at will..

It was easy to set up, it is well built, and is light enough to move around if needed. It comes with a divider which helps with house training. So far we haven't had any accidents in the house and it has become her den when she wants to get away and sleep. Great purchase.Btw, I recommend putting a light blanket over the crate to make it more like a cave."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product!!!","review":"I had never purchased a crate before, because of the cost. When I ordered this, it came within 4 days and only took me approximately 3 minutes to assemble. The crate sturdy and very well made. It is not intimidating to my dog (a ChiPom) and with a waving arm motion, a command and some treats, she walked right in. Within 10 minutes, she was comfortable enough to shut the door. Good training takes time and patience, and this will be work in progress, but the crate makes no strange noises and no smells.

We did not need the crate immediately, and after opening the box, we saw that the tray was broken. It was clear that this box had been going through some rough shipments.

We used a plastic crate first but he used to try and chew his way out. This crate is large for sure which is exactly what I wanted. He has enough space for his puffy bed and can easily stand, take a couple of steps and turn around. He goes into it without any problems and almost seems to view it as a den.

I did not give it a 5 out of 5 only because the latch is a little challenging to lock and unlock. I have a larger sized crate and the latches are very easy to use.

I have a 25lb cockapoo, and this was the perfect size for him. The assembly was simple, just unfold it, no instructions needed (although they are provided). It includes a partition (divider) so you can gradually increase your puppies living space has he grows. My dog is already grown so it was not needed, but it's a great feature for the puppy parents.

Got it for our new 3 mon old lab puppy...she looks TINY in it.

Folds up easily, but it is a bit heavy to transport. GREAT HUGE CRATE FOR THE MONEY for sure!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for our little chi","review":"We got this because the smallest plastic kennel we could find was way too big for our new Chihuahua puppy. The divider on this is awesome. The first day she stopped using the bathroom in her kennel. I guess the divider was the key.

This crate was the solution to my big problem with my newly adopted taco bell dog (can't spell the other!) He would have accidents all over the house at night when everyone was sleeping; he would chase the cats; was just completely out of hand. Several \\"time outs\\" in this crate solved the problem. When he first moved in here, he spent the hours no one was at home inside this crate. He,unfortunatly, was one who didn't really care where he was when he needed to pee or poop, so that theory animals don't pee or poop where they sleep he didn't know about! Or maybe just didn't care! but it helped to teach him some control and now he's only crazy when he wants to go for a walk. But it is still his \\"time out\\" spot, with the door open. If he is exceptionally bad, the door is closed so he can't sneak out.This is the best crate, not too small, not too big. Easy to set up. Easy to clean. Really thankful I found it, and Bailey is thankful too. Made his life a little more controlled!"},{"rating":"1","title":"My new dog is a Houdini","review":"You buy a crate expecting it will confine your dog; crates should be made with the expectation the animal will at least make a token attempt at escape. I adopted a 55-pound pit bull and purchased this crate. It took Gemma 15 minutes to work free the first time. I examined the crate and found I had assembled it correctly. By the fourth time, she'd determined a quick escape method and could escape in 5 minutes. At least I know she's intelligent and amenable to training."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"Needed a lighter weight crate for traveling but still very secure.

I would love to love this crate and give it five stars and would except for the fact that, unfortunately, as other viewers have mentioned, it is possible for a puppy or very anxious dog to catch their mouth or paw in the areas where the sides connect. As you can see in product photo, there are smaller spaces of wiring at top and bottom corners that connect the sides of cage. It would be better designed if there were smaller mesh for entire cage area preventing the dog from even being able to get mouth or paw into the spaces. My puppy yelped when he briefly caught his paw at the top front corner. He has calmed down enough now and is very comfortable in this crate with his ProSelect Pawprint Dog Cage Cover and Pad Set in black that I also purchased on Amazon for an amazing price, and is a very good match for this crate! A friend of mine also owns this crate (and same cover/pad set) but never mentioned this happening to her hyper Jack Russell or mini Aussie, so just be aware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really..?","review":"I bought one of these crates a few months back and was very happy with it. I'm getting another small dog so I decided to purchase another one. Well the sides on this one do not line up evenly, the divider doesn't fit, and the latch doesn't line up so it won't even close. I guess the exact same product doesn't always mean the exact same quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warped Crate/Quality Material","review":"I was very impressed upon opening the crate & seeing the quality of material. It did not however take long for disappointment to set it. It was difficult to get walls up because they were bent.

The door iis smooth to open and close."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor construction","review":"I gave this two stars because of the door construction. All the sides are not straight - and slightly tweeked just enough to make it hard to open and close the latch on the door.

I bought a suction one instead.Great price though. I would definitely buy this again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wobbly & Not as pictured","review":"I echo others' sentiments that this seat is wobbly. We have an old, traditional shaped toilet & I do not feel comfortable allowing my daughter to sit by herself. Once when she did use it, urine escaped out the front between the seat and the potty. I thought that only happened with little boys!!Also, the seat I received was not as pictured. Instead of yellow ducks and a blue handle, my seat has dark orange ducks and a purple handle. I would have returned it, unfortunately my husband opened the package before I looked at it. One further criticism: it comes shrink-wrapped and I couldn't easily remove all of the plastic, so there is a small piece still attached to the ring underneath - yucky when you think about it getting peed on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leave a ring of pee.","review":"The seat is inexpensive and soft. Also easy to clean. But it has to be cleaned every time its used, as well as the regular toilet seat underneath. It leaves a ring of urine around the regular toilet seat almost every time. Cleaning the toilet a half dozen times a day is driving me crazy. Maybe if you have a girl, this would be an okay seat, but not for little boys, even when they \\"point down\\" as best they can.The bjorn seat is more expensive, but definitely worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value!","review":"I was a bit worried about buying the cheapest potty seat available, but it turned out great. We never even had to buy a freestanding potty seat, just put out daughter right on the potty. I've since bought a second one for upstairs. I was dissappointed that it doesn't arrive exactly as it appears (the bubbles on both seats are red, rather than blue, the same color as the duck's beaks) it takes away from the attractiveness of the seat, but that is really the leat of my concerns. It works and my daughter likes it, so that's okay by me. It comes with a seldstick hook to put on the bathroom door so that it can be stored out of the way, nice touch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Picture not what was delivered","review":"I have now ordered this 3x and each time I am provided with one with orange ducks and a purple handle, instead of the pictured item of yellow ducks with a blue or white handle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsafe - don't buy","review":"This potty seat is designed poorly, with tabs facing inward from the seat... if a child slips the seat over their head (and they will; 2-year-olds slip everything over their heads), you won't be able to get it off without the seat clips cutting into their foreheads.

It was comparatively inexpensive and seemed a lot more comfortable than some of the other toilet seat adapters out there. She loves her duckie seat, which she easily puts on the potty by herself before climbing up and doing her business. Its easy to use, easy to clean, comfortable, unisex, and so great I went ahead and bought a second one now that my younger son is training and we want to be sure there is a seat in the upstairs and downstairs bathrooms available."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does NOT fit all seats!","review":"I just got this for our daughter because she is getting too big for her stand alone potty and she was saying it hurts her bottom. I got this and it does not fit our toilet seat, we have the longer seats and this potty seat just slides all over the place and it scares her to get on it and she also says it hurts her bottom.

I'm not sure which elongated toilets it would fit b/c it was way to short for ours. There was a gap of 1-2 inches between the front of the potty seat & our toilet seat.

The cushion makes it comfortable for my toddler and she can put the seat on and off herself. I gave it 4 stars because the stick on hook it comes with does not do the job, the seat is too heavy. We purchased hooks from Ikea that fold up and down and they work perfect with this seat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Potty Seat","review":"We've had 3 different potty seats and this is my favorite. The attached ring is really the biggest selling point. It gives you a way to pick up the seat (without touching where the seat did), and hang it out of the way. I have 2 - one for home and one for travel. Tip: I keep the travel one in an insulated reusable grocery bag (the bag and potty seat get cleaned regularly). The seat itself is nice and soft for little bottoms and every kid that has used ours loves the ducks. My son is big for his age and got to where we couldn't use it anymore (after a short time) because he would pee directly into the front of the seat (0bviously a boy issue not girl)."},{"rating":"2","title":"good idea","review":"My son loves this seat. He feels like a big boy when he gets to use the big potty all by himself. I put the hook for the seat so he can get to it on him own and so this is ideal for him and it is nice because I don't have to wash out a little potty chair. The only thing that would make it nicer is if it had handles. Not a big deal at my house because the toliet is close to a wall so he uses that for support but I think it would make him feel more secure. I would recommend this for anyone with a child who wants to use the big potty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gave my baby a rash.","review":"We started using the potty all of the time recently, and we purchased this seat.

We stopped using the potty seat and the rash went away."},{"rating":"2","title":"the bears picnic","review":"the book the Bears picnic is a really good children book. I don't think older kids would still like it that much, but it teaches a preally good lesson.

The album depicts the modern psychosis with powerful tunes about violence and drug use. Unlike the Smiths, Suede does not give the sensation of being jaded but utter despair. Between the tragic lines of the weeping guitar of Bernard Butler and intoxicating voice of Brett Anderson come an anger that is justified by a willingless to live.

The opening song (So Young) shows you both Butlers' talent on guitar, with the breakdown at the end, and his skill as a pianist. This song is followed by \\"Animal Nitrate\\", Suedes' best song to date. This is Bernard Butler at his best, never has a song made me feel so alive every time I listen to it. The album is a constant display of how good music can be. At no point will you find your self skipping over a track. At no point will you go on a long time without listening to it.

My first complaint was that the tongs have no ability to grab or hold onto things. These tongs are comparable to my Weber Professional Tongs because they both grab things by the tip. I ended up having to flatten out the tips so that they have a better ability to grab. My next complaint is the spring that makes these tongs function is cheap and unreliable. My Weber Tongs surpassed these tongs in quality hands down (Better spring, better design, more quality). I have a 12 inch lodge dutch oven and love it! I expected better quality products from lodge.

Horst Siebert traces the roots of Germany's problems to the student movements of the '60s with their emphasis on collectivism and hedonism. He provides a detailed, highly readable account of German economic history. He covers the great recovery and prosperity that followed Ludwig Erhard's reforms of 1948 and the lagging growth that seemed to begin with the oil shocks and recessions of the 1970s and 1980s, but that has roots far deeper than oil. Siebert says, Germany's problems have no win-win solution. Some interest groups must lose if Germany is to restore economic growth and leave subsequent generations more than the invoice for today's excesses."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't fit a 2006 Honda Accord EX-L V6 Auto","review":"This rotor is 12\\" in diameter, but the O.E. rotor is 11\\", therefore it doesn't fit.

Despite the fact that I am a fan and own a copy of Borrasca, a wonderful CD in its own right, I wasn't sure how I would feel about this particular collection. After listening to it only once, I was completely swept away. Unlike the more vibrant and catchy tunes of Borrasca, The Hours Between Day + Night is more mellow, smooth and laced with a very lovely jazz feel that blends seamlessly into a unique sound. With 19 songs, one of which is a Spanish language remake of Marvin Gaye's Mercy, Mercy Me (The Ecology), it is not only one of the longest CDs this listener has come across, but it's well worth the price. Do yourself a favor and add this to your collection. It's well worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing! Ottmar's greatest triumph!","review":"I happen to be quite a Liebert aficianado and I think that this album represents the hands-down best work he has ever done in his career. The haunting beauty of his Spanish guitar is here tempered with a charming lightheartedness that was no doubt inspired by the East-Indian locale. Works such as Neon-Ghost Sensei provide just the right touch of the experimental Ottmar that we experience in Opium. Alternately fiery and mellow, but always beautiful, Ottmar's composition and playing here display their strongest synergy. I HIGHLY recommend it, if you buy just one instrumental album in your life, you're reading its review."},{"rating":"2","title":"Olivia, My Life of Exile Kalaupapa","review":"Excellent book.

While it is not on the same level as \\"A Canticle for Leibowitz\\" it does address the concept of God/Deity/Cosmos in a SciFi setting much more closely than most sci-fi writers do. So, yes, each story may not be a Hugo or Nebula award winner, but taken together they certainly fulfill the title's description of \\"close encounters\\" with the deity. Did I come away awakened in a spiritual sense? No, but this is science fiction and not Dietrich Bonhoeffer, so it is important to recognize this as fiction with a religious bent to it. In that form, it is a great collection, which I recommend to anyone interested in the genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Theological science fiction","review":"Quite a few very unimpressive stories of theological sci fi. If you are interested in this subject, an anthology of exciting stories is that of Perpetual Light edited by Ryan or Wandering Stars edited by Dann. A theological sci fi novel that is well written is Robert Sawyer's Calculating God. If you like Bishop's idea of a verbal dog but in a far more exciting story, read Olaf Stapledon's short novel Sirius. If you prefer an anthology of such stories, read Sirius the Dog Star edited by Greenberg and Potter. Bishop's stories ramble on and on, often with unrelated tangents, and characteristically with boring endings."},{"rating":"2","title":"On personality","review":"Harris brings new ideas and theories on personality and individuality that, although appealing, remain to be proven correct.

It is a subject I am quite interested in, and know something about, being a professional psychologist. So I was looking forward to reading it. Let me tell you though, this book needed some serious editing. In just the first 30-40 pages there are so many repetitive sentences, gratuitous self-references, false starts, second starts, third starts...I don't know where to begin...so I won't. I will simply say that Ms. Harris should read \\"The Elements of Style\\" or some other book on writing or argumentation. Say it, Judith. Say it clearly and say it one time. And if you tell the story of the conjoined twins who had differing personalities one more time I will shoot myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"I dont get it!!","review":"Personally i did not enjoy reading Harris. I do not get what i am supposed to get after reading this, i am still confused about personality as i was before reading the book.

Was the writer's intent merely to sell books rather than tell a story based on a balanced view of facts? I don't know.

Harrison has a lot of fun making fun of modern foibles in the future, but the story is overly episodic, the technology of the future seems less advanced than our own (but for space travel), and the author's ideas about authority and responsibility come across as identical to those of a thirteen-year-old slacker.

Harrison is one of the funniest sci-fi authors of the past 30 years, probably best known for his novel, \\"Make Room! Make Room!\\" for which the movie Soylent Green was based upon. Harrison writes like a mutated Arthur Douglas/Larry Niven/Rex Stout mixture, and the reader will double over at the funny circumstances, the hilarious dialogues, and the quick but dry-witted narration of Slippery Jim DeGriz.

At first it seemed very promising in the beginning, reminded me of a classic 80s slasher flick, but as soon as they arrive at Pleasant Valley the film falls appart. The costumes sucked, the atmosphere was bad, there were no scares, the jokes weren't funny, the acting was horrible, (except for Robert's, of course.), the death scenes were stupid, and the story was just really bad. I enjoyed watching the making of than the actual movie, and for some strange reason the shots of the set looked spookier in the making of than in the film itself, go figure.

Stoopid movie, but at least some of the characters were fairly entertaining -- at least on the maniac side. Alas for the poor, dull victims. Robert Englund played it up pretty good as Mayor Buckman, as did Lyn Shaye as Granny Boone. Not a smidgin of tension, but a lot of black humor that worked to varying degrees. It's hardly going to replace the old classic in any fans' hearts and minds, I'm pretty sure.But there's some mighty fine lookin' southern belles a-hauntin' in Pleasant Valley, I can tell you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inersesting if silly little horror movie","review":"Bloody, disgusting and a little tongue-in-cheek.

We get the horse-quartering of a young nymphet; a spear up the butt of a bisexual hunk; acid down the throat of another stud; a bell dropped on a Chinese chick; and the cotton mashing death of another youth. And not to mention the devouring of the bodies.The movie is so over the top that it becomes humorous but even Robert Englund can't Freddy up any real terror. I dont mind gore and guts in a movie, but this one just has a little too much without offering anything new to the cannibal and/or zombie genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Gory Horror Fun!!","review":"I had watched 2001 Maniacs the other night for the first time. I have to say this was such a fun movie to watch! This film was funny and very gory. The film has a great cast including Robert Englund, Lin Shaye, Christa Campbell, Wendy Kremer and many more. I would say this was Robert Englund's best role in a film besides Freddy.A group of college kids on their way to Spring Break take a detour. They come upon the small southern town of Pleasant Valley. The people of the town and Mayor Buckman(Robert Englund) insist that the kids stay for their annual festival. The kids decide to stay and check it out and that's where the madness begins!Tim Sullivan did a great job sticking to the story of the original H.G. Lewis classic Two Thousand Maniacs. This is one of the best horror films of the past few years. It has some great gory death scenes too! I would recommend it highly to any horror fan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Nice....","review":"I'm a huge fan of the original Two Thousand Maniacs by HGL so I was a little nervous about the remake. I am happy to report that the new version actually IMPROVES on the original. This movie has a nice pedigree, with John Landis, HGL, David Friedman, and Eli Roth all having involvement in the making of the film. As far as the movie itself, it takes the same plot, sexes it up quite a bit with a liberal amount of toplessness on people you'd actually want to see nekkid, and amps up the gore from the already classic level of gore. It's absolutely disgusting, tasteless, and has very little redeemable value to the local PTA. In other words, you'll love it. There's a couple of missteps, such as an over-reliance on sheep sex jokes and a few over-acting southerners (HickiBilly, for instance). Overall, however, this is a MUST RENT for any fan of gore flicks, campy horror, or just plain fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Maniacs Are In","review":"I've waited a long time to see 2001 Maniacs.

They'll all welcomed by the town's population, including the town's mayor, Mayor Buckman (Englund).Also, 5 others enter Pleasant Valley and they're all welcome to stay for the BBQ. But what these visitors don't know is that they're going to be the the BBQ's main course.The gore factor in this film is cool. Robert Englund does another good job playing a satistic villian. Eli Roth even appears in this film replaying the role in Cabin Fever.2001 Maniacs does what it does for a horror film. It gives us the guts and glory. Also, the commentary with Robert Englund and Tim Sullivan is a very good commentary."},{"rating":"1","title":"See it for only one thing!","review":"The movie has a good plot but the editing was done by none other than a rank amateur.

This handle holder is on the thin side and while it fits nicely on the cast iron handles, it is not padded enough. It's probably ok to use on the tiny cast iron pans, but for the big ones, it didn't hold the heat back from coming thru the handles, besides the fact that the big cast iron pan has two handles of which one is U shaped.

A regular rectangular pot holder can be found for $1 or $2 at most stores. Fold one in half, stitch around the edges and you essentially have one of these outrageously priced single function pot holders.That silvery fabric on the top of this pot holder does nothing to protect the rest of the fabric from the heat. I only used the pot holder whenever I wanted to move the pan, and did not leave it on the handle during cooking. In spite of that, in less than a year, the silver fabric disintegrated, exposing the insulation inside the pot holder.This particular style of pot holder seems to be as scarce as hens teeth in stores and on the Internet, and I guess that is why the price is such a rip-off.

The best part of this DVD were the few interviews with the owner's of the \\"homes\\" of Bella, Edward and Jacob, the owner of Dazzled by Twilight, the owner of Bella Italia, and others who live in Forks. Had the entire dvd had this type of content, it would have been well worth it. Most of the rest of the video was people waiting in line for Twilight movies talking about the saga and then, the last 15-20 minutes of the dvd, it tried to be an art film. The shots of areas in Forks could have been great, but with frequent changes in focus, bad music, and effects that really were not needed, that part too was a let down. The dvd had no narration which I think would have added to it. It could have been great, but it was far from it.

(Actually, I only watched Twilight in Forks once too.) I am writing this while the DVD is still playing because I would hate for anyone to spend money on this. It seems to me it's just another attempt to cash in on the Twilight craze. I am currently on the last segment which as Dawn K.M. mentioned is just a bunch of outdoor scenes with weird new-agey music in the background and it's been going forever already (okay, maybe 15 minutes but it's not over yet).

If you like very wacky comedies and don't mind your humor being dumb, you may enjoy Odd Jobs. The charm of the film is difficult to describe, as the story is rather absurd, the situations are ridiculous, the writing is unsophisticated, and the characters are one-dimensional. Put all those together in this right combination though, and you get a very funny and memorable movie. The hightlights of Odd Jobs are Jake Steinfeld (the Body By Jake guy) as a villanous yet funny henchman, and Leo Burmeister as Wylie, a redneck greasy trucker with a heart of gold. The cast of comedians each has a distinct character, and each has several funny scenes to shine in.If you like Monty Python wackiness, and you like Airplane! type dumb yet funny comedy, give Odd Jobs a try. You may find a hidden comedy treasure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Customer service is horrible.","review":"This was a Christmast gift.

As an scholar the author performs a rather amateur work of collating news (specially from FOX and the O'Reilly Factor) and his own views. This book accuses many of the authors of being anti-Jewish, and this is where the book looses all the anti-bias he pretends to have when explaining his methodology in the first chapter.It is a shame that publishers are willing to let people critize others and fail to realize that the author himself incurs in the same kind of flaws."},{"rating":"1","title":"sad, pathetic right-wing ranting, fundamentally dishonest","review":"At least Paul Johnson had some wit and style in his The Intellectuals, another screed laying all the blame for what's wrong in the world at the feet of the left.

Not because his thesis is a bad one (it's spot-on), but because it's so poorly written and poorly argued. The book just turns into a rant.There are very good arguments to make against these professors: their self-serving motives; their outright lies for self-promotion; their violation of their own ideals of free speech; their lack of intellectual rigor applied to themselves; the list goes on and one.

Aside from this aspect, I would like to point out that the book was laden with grammatical and formatting errors, as well as a decent amount of factual errors.While I agree that many of these professors could be and are harmful to academia, there is no way that Horowitz could possibly have any solid institutional knowledge on this many professors, and as such he has compiled these profiles with the help of his staff and has written several profiles based on hearsay and second-hand information.This shoddy attempt at an expose may give heed about some of these people (and in all honesty, I hope it does) but I think Dr. Horow...I'm sorry, Mr. Horowitz needs another edit or two before he mass markets his propaganda."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish he knew how to write","review":"My mom brought this book home and I just finished reading the intro and some of the profiles.

The left is trying to perfect its control of our universities and schools, using techniques of agitprop, clannism and groupthink. As a baby boomer educated in the 70s I can see my left wing student peers in the universities as professors and educators. I was left wing at university but then grew up, moving away from immature Marxism as my views developed.This book explains how all the lefties of my university days have become the inmates in charge of the institution, with their pervasive marxism and anti-freedom-of-speech attitudes pervading academia, with their pursed lips and disapproving dry attitudes opposed to Americans and the West at large.Look at the media academic commentators, look at the standard party lines being pushed at many unversities discussed in the book and you'll see the proposition confirmed.[...]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Same old same old....!","review":"Yawn..!

I had an experience with one of the professors he mentions and I can attest to the truth of his words. This book sheds light on the dirty secrets of our \\"higher institutions of learning\\" and how the universities help protect these professors who push extremist thought and measures upon our young people. There is currently a professor at a major university who is pushing the idea that the Holocaust never occurred, he wouldn't even be the most shocking amongst this group.I recommend this book to all who want to see the kind's of extremists that our teaching their warped views to the next generation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where do they come up with this stuff?","review":"I'm a college student.

If you think there is some sort of weird political agenda that college professors have you need to remove your head from the sand. It is amazing that there are two reviews(positive) that admit this book was based on hearsay and that another person will still continue to pay for it. This is so blatenly not based on facts and is instead just a description of fear of the worst. It does not even give you a glimps of what college is really like. email me at rabruzzese@hotmail.com if you don't think so."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm Confused","review":"Hmm. Seems as if this \\"nasty, vicious little Republican hate tome\\" has quite a few readers spun up. But I'm confused - if this book is indeed \\"immoral, lying trash\\", then doesn't that imply that those who would describe it as such agree that academic activism would be a dangerous influence, just that they don't believe it exists? If, on the other hand, they're sympathetic to the proposition that \\"being an activist is a necessary prerequisite\\" for the professoriate (quoting from the book), then Horowitz is demonstrably not lying."},{"rating":"1","title":"A new form of PC","review":"For years, conservatives railed against leftist professors for being politically correct. Now Horowitz tries a new tactic, intimidation of those who do not share his views. He offers little evidence, despite the extreme views of some of these professors, that these views dominate discussion on university campuses. Instead, he tries to generalize based on anecdotal evidence. Further, he has been busy trying to take his scree on the road, getting conservative legislators to conduct hearings, another form of intimidation of those who do not agree with his perspective. Luckily, some of those hearings have backfired, for example, when he has failed to prove some of the charges that he makes in his book. My biggest regret in buying the book is that it added a small amount in royalties to Horowitz's pockets."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disturbing Book","review":"A very well documented book about the take over of our University System be ultra liberal professors. It is very discouraging and you may well question weather or not your child's education is worth the exhorbitant cost of today's University. The examples given in the book seem to the standard rather than the exception."},{"rating":"2","title":"Watch out!","review":"I'm just saying this now, although I've not actually read the book, I've heard of some of these guys. I must tell you, people out there, to be wary of psychos such as these. Particularly the infamous Amiri Baraka, whose poems, publications and lessons teach black people to kill non-black people and torture, rape, oppress, etc. Jews, Christians and non-Muslims. Of course, he also encourages students of all colors to join his cause. Like the young white student who asked what she could do to further his cause to which he responded \\"You can help by dying. You are a plague to the world, the only way you can help us is by being destroyed.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"An eye opening","review":"This book should be required reading for all freshman going into college. Some of these professors lie in wait for unsuspecting students. They preach their ideas hidden behind a course title unrelated to their drivel. They certainly have the right to teach but name the course for what it is \\"I hate America 101\\" or \\"Communism 101\\". Let kids knowingly take the class if they want to, rather then end up in the class unaware.Beware of the professor from Montclair that is in the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"It would be funny if it weren't so sad","review":"Probably the most (although certainly not the only) ludicrous part of this book is the entry on Caroline Higgins, a professor at Earlham College. Horowitz objects to Higgins because she teaches a course on peace activism -- a course taken by students in the Peace and Global Studies program, at a Quaker college. It seems odd, to say the least, for a supposed champion of religious freedom to object to people at a Quaker school voluntarily enrolling in classes devoted to a central Quaker value. That Horowitz resorted to including such a weak objection, and one involving such a tiny private college, shows that he really must have been stretching to get his list to 101."},{"rating":"1","title":"Invalid by Personal Experience","review":"The basic premise of the book is invalided by personal experience. As a student of Professor Targ, the sole Purdue University teacher listed, I can assure you there was no recruitment, indoctrination or any of the other horrors associated with him. Further, there were profs at Purdue that made Targ sound like Rush Limbaugh in comparison.

I have read as much of the book as most of those who gave it five stars, and find the constant whining tiresome.Oh, and David Horowitz, former darling of the left? Is that on his official bio? The fact that he joined other neo-Stalints in the neo-conservative movement is the left's gain, not the right's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helpful Guide for Choosing a College","review":"This book is a great idea! I have been searching for some kind of guide for graduate school that would identify professors who are interested in social justice and radical activism. David Horowitz has compiled a nice, though overly brief, list of professors who fit the bill. My only complaint is that I wish he had made a longer, more comprehensive list of leftist professors. I know that there are some really great professors who didn't make it on this list. For students deciding which college to go to, this book is pretty helpful, though it should have been much longer. Hopefully, the list will be expanded to a more comprehensive guide in the second edition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Semi-Fascist Claptrap, and Funny as Hell","review":"It doesn't take the intellect of any of the professors profiled in _The Professors_ to know that this conservative tract is little more than the insane rants of a very troubled man, or possibly his research assistants.Really, though, one can take two approaches to the book: one can either loathe the book for its inane vulgarity, or enjoy its humor. The book can be read, actually, as a comedic satire. Hopefully those angered by books contents can take the second approach, thus giving the book _some_ use."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is about time!","review":"It is about time someone exposed the frauds masquerading as academicians on our college and university campuses today. Most of the anti-American, socialist wide-eyed liberals listed in David Horowitz's book would not recognize reality if it hit them in the backside! Horowitz and his colleagues do a fine job in defining who these people are and what their perverted beliefs are. And, as Horowitz points out, it continues to be an outrage that convicted felons like Angela Davis are even alllowed on college campuses while military recruiters are treated like criminals!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Who is this Horowitz, anyway?","review":"How do books like this get written, much less purchased? This book is hard to get through unless you buy into a vast conspiracy on the left to infiltrate the minds of college students. What is interesting to know - and that Horowitz neglects to include in his rag: organizations pushing the Republican agenda are far more prevalent on our college campuses than Democratic organizations. The classroom simply doesn't promote that ideology and that's the missed point when addressing the hubris of this book. If it doesn't walk in lock-step with Horowitz's worldview, then it must be \\"liberal\\". When he writes about the overwhelming bias of rightwing talk radio, television and rabid pundits like Coulter, Hannity and O'Reilly then he'll have a legitimate gripe. Otherwise he is just stirring up a bitter pot of nothing much.Frankly, one star is too much for this propaganda-driven drivel."},{"rating":"1","title":"A worse crime than stupidity... it's so boring","review":"Man, you can always tell when a book is completely off the mark. Conservatives flood these pages with nonsensical five-star stupidity.Horowitz has nailed them (again) in this book, though we all know what we mean by \\"nailed\\", don't we? As an professor myself, I have seen some of what David exposes, and I only wish I was enjoying the same kind of life he's living.It just makes my blood become completely lethargic, coagulating in utter boredom, to read about how these unpatriotic anti-Americans area not collecting enough tax dollars.Horowitzs' writing style leaves something to be desired but, again, we're talking about desire, so you all know what I mean. He sometimes comes across as angry which is usually the methodology of the left, but he leave me breathless and wanting more, and more.Overall, a very poorly written book. Very uninformative and misleading.[...]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh no!!!","review":"Look out! The big bad communist professors are out to get you and your children!

Characterizations of prolific author Stanley Aronowitz as lazy and Norman Finkelstein as anti-semitic are simply absurd for anyone familiar with the work. What is more the book lumps together liberals with radicals and fails to honestly discuss the distinctions between different often incompatible ideological positions let alone advance serious or even frivilous arguments against the political perspectives.

I am a former student of one of the listed professors, and never has he said or done any of the things described in the book while teaching my class. In a recent article written about my university's faculty involvement in the text, Horowitz admits to not only not deeply researching the professor, he never even spoke to past and/or present students to see if our minds truly are being spoiled by one of the most dangerous professors of our time. In reality he is an admired professor, who is a wealth of knowledge.If you enjoy fiction, this is the book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Earns extra star for having good publicist","review":"I flipped through this book while at the bookstore. I recommend reading the writing of many of the people he pans and then judge for yourself whether he has a case.Especially focus on Howard Zinn and Noam Chomsky.Both men LOVE to be challenged and seem to be genuinely moral men. If Horowitz' goal is to extinguish lights as bright as these men, then I have to believe that his goal is to bring us to darkness. From Seinfeld: \\"You are a bad man Horowitz. A very bad man\\". and from me: \\"thanks for the lesson in propoganda.. too bad good people won't stoop so low\\".And for those who criticize the \\"left activist academia\\": There are egos everywhere in academia... keep to the merits of Horowitz' book.

Horowitz would rather that professors be stupid, have no opinions, and would have them not educate their students, such that the nation's universities could churn out legions of uneducated but credentialed pigeons, ripe for the rhetoric of the right.Horrowitz is horrified that educated people disagree with him, and that the tenure system actually protects qualified academics from removal by the uneducated proletariat masses.It's easy to dig up dirt on people. Is it fair for Horowitz to dig up a paper someone wrote decades ago and use it as evidence against a person today? Does Horowitz have no skeletons in his closet?The bottom line is that this book is just more right-wing political spew. The right hates the educated, and is running scared."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is dull","review":"Very unimaginative. For all of those reviewers who are assuming that anyone with anything negative to say has not read the book, I read it. It read pretty much like a Nora Roberts novel and about as educational. For all of those who are soooo impressed that Horowitz uses endnotes and footnotes, HELLO, that doesn't mean a thing! Just because something is contained in an endnote does not make it God's truth. If that is the case, all I need to do is write half my thesis in superscript and everyone will think I am a genius. I'm just disappointed that no one I worked with personally is listed. My entire goal in life is to be in a book just like this. You really know that you're changing the world when people call you dangerous.

As with all his works, \\"The Professors\\" is well written, if one is basing their purchase decision on the quality of writing alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inaccurate","review":"The book cites as one of its chief boogeymen a \\"Rutgers University professor\\" whose \\"early poems included lines like, 'Rape the white girls' and 'I got the extermination blues, jewboys.'\\" This would be the poet Amiri Baraka, formerly known as LeRoi Jones, and generally an odious figure. But why worry about him? I was a student at Rutgers in 1990, and I remember clearly: Amiri Baraka was denied tenure and left the university in an explosion of ruffled feathers. Why this book exists to grind an axe on him and the school -- 12+ years later -- I cannot guess, except that the author probably thought there'd be some money it. Save yours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warped.","review":"David Horowitz is a dangerous propagandist. He hosts huge workshops throughout the country whose purpose is to discredit & condone hatred for targeted American teachers & the educational institutions that employ & promote them. He claims Noam Chomsky, a political activist & intellectual, is the leader of a secular religious cult as the \\"Ayatollah of Anti-American Hate\\". While most people would find this outright lie highly laughable, this is the very venom of extremist talk that breeds violence by the masses. These unverifiable claims litter the pages of this book from front to back. He's basically saying that college professors who teach topics apart from the \\"suggested\\" referendum are turning \\"our\\" students against \\"Americans\\". I wonder which \\"Americans\\" he's referring to? Stop the hate.

Academia is teeming with fancy pants liberals with their uppidy reading and writing skills. I once had a professor who claimed conservative credentials. I almost believed him until he bad-mouthed Hitler and Franco. Sadly I can't rate this book higher than one as the author is frequently lax with the rules of grammar. I lost count of the number of infinitives he split! A true conservative knows rules MUST be followed. Always, and without question. Since I only read books that enforce my worldview, this one left me puzzled and somewhat disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the read","review":"Vast academic conspiracy to poison the minds of our youth? Tempest in a teapot? The truth, I suspect is (as always) somewhere in the middle. To most of us, the activities of university professors is generally off the radar screen of day to day life. I believe that they could bear some scrutiny. And why not, given that they are entrusted with nothing less than the minds of our young.I have heard it all before... the America haters, the whack jobs, etc. Are institutions of higher learning infested overwhelmingly with these types? I doubt it. Do they exist? Definitely. Some of the the revelations in \\"The Professors\\" produce yawns and others are startling, enraging and even frightening. If only one tenth of what Horowitz says is true, then shining a light into the professorial cubby holes of academia should not be an unwelcome exercise.

I'm thankful that none of these wackos ever taught me (though one of my former professors is a \\"disciple\\" of Eric Foner; ironically, he respected my conservative beliefs and encouraged his class to disagree with him if they felt so inclined).These people are a danger to true academia."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is your right as an American to read this immoral, lying trash.","review":"It is easy to read, I'll give it that.

In 'The Professors' he makes claims that is false to all our campus experiences.

I found it to be almost a parody of itself. As a person who has had to challenge lowered grades openly given for taking a moderate leftist position on papers when I was in college, I find it amazing that people will actually take these positions, especially considering the fact that the people who run both the public and private universities in the U.S. are almost exclusively conservative. Sure, there are liberal and leftist professors, and sometimes they do show a heavy bias in the classroom, but there are also quite a number of professors of a conservative ilk who, from my experience, are almost guranteed to show a heavy bias in their classrooms. That being as such, though, I still must give Mr. Horowitz credit for the quality of his writing. Hence the 2nd star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Hilarious","review":"This book is so bad it's hilarious.

But it's so ridiculous, it's basically a comedy book."},{"rating":"2","title":"University Embarrassment","review":"If there was ever a book written that should embarrass academia, this is it. As a collection of individual stories about tenured professors who in prior eras would be hanged for the murders they committed or for the treason they radically promoted and participated in, this book is a must read for all parents as they select schools for their own college age children. There were chapters that I found more interesting than others because of the shear madness of how such people could be embraced and protected as they are in the university culture. One need only look to the 2006 madness at once great schools like Columbia University in New York to understand the impact radicals have had on the young minds of this country."},{"rating":"1","title":"McCarthy lives","review":"Freud would have had a field day with this author. Rejecting his parent's Communist leanings to the extreme. Hmmm!This nutcase has written a book riddled with fraud and lies. He twisted facts to make his subjects seem more extreme when most merely believe in issues of peace, freedom, and equality. Freedom of expression, whether in the classroom or published in books, is integral to this country's founding and existence. The author should remember that if his subjects can't speak their mind and have an opinion, he wouldn't be able to either.Shame on Horowitz for trying to destroy people's lives through innuendo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trashy Hack-Job","review":"Total trash by a former liberal who discoverd profit in switching to the other side. He trashes these academics (most of whom are women and people of color) not on the basis of their scholarship but on what they say that contradicts his drivel. That he can't understand their work makes sense given his inability to produce anything of scholarly merit."},{"rating":"1","title":"chilling implications","review":"It is frightening indeed when they start coming after the intellectuals. The right-wing now controls all three branches of government as well as the media, and it would seem that Horowitz envisions a world where academia goose-step to the same tune. In this pivotal time, it is important to remember the words of Rev. Martin Niemoller who said in 1945, \\"First they came for the Communists, and I didn't speak up, because I wasn't a Communist. Then they came for the Jews, and I didn't speak up, because I wasn't a Jew. Then they came for the Catholics, and I didn't speak up, because I was a Protestant. Then they came for me, and by that time there was no one left to speak up for me.\\"As a side note, I think it's telling that some of the one-star reviews have been pulled while a reviewer who unabashedly uses verbal violence such as \\"die leftist scum\\" is free to post."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow.","review":"I must say, I'm proud: one of my former professors made the list!I took a course with him titled 'Global Politics of HIV/AIDS.' It's funny, because he wasn't controversial at all. It was a geography course that looked at the issue sociologically (in terms of gender, race, class, etc. and how these things facilitated the spread of the HIV/AIDS infection -- this definitely isn't a super controversial topic, lauded writers and doctors such as Paul Farmer write on similar topics).Maybe this is crazy, but I'm pretty proud. It means he succeeded in taking people out of their comfort zones, making people think in a new way -- which is what the university is about. He didn't tout communism or anti-war stuff, in general -- the class was specifically conducted to create a dialogue with the students, he wasn't inserting his opinions much if at all!

Apparently not, but should qualify. I mean, I LOVE westerns, and this abomination was an insult to the genre, which admittedly has pretty low standards. The script was terrible! The acting was ridiculously bad. The plot was idiotic. If I was to cite its better points, I guess I'd have to say the editing, cinematography and music and would qualify for at least two stars, but the rest of it was so far less than one star that the final rating has to be one star. The other reviewers who gave it more than one star, I'm guessing they must be little kids or something. Or maybe they know the producers and owe them some kind of favor.

Eccentric, muscular and, above all, witty, they were directed from the front by songwriter/bassist/producer Martin Gordon (see his 2003 solo release THE BABOON IN THE BASEMENT). They garnered a hit or two, played hundreds of gigs and then dissolved in a welter of ill-feeling. Here they reform, albeit temporarily. Now it gets confusing. For Radio Stars were also Jet, somewhat earlier (the mid-seventies, in fact) and, earlier still, most of them were John's Children. On this live recording, therefore, they go through material from all three bands, and even throw in stuff by Sparks (Gordon's first band) and a solo cut from Tee White, also, and incestuously, from Sparks.

It might not be as easy to clean as vinyl (I don't know yet - if it got really dirty I might try to hand wash it and hang it back on to dry) but it is definitely more breathable and nicer in general than vinyl tents. Also, the inside decor is just beautiful and offer tons of play space. My daughter just loved it and I can tell already she will get a lot of play use out of it, not just with her barbies, but all of her princess dolls. Unlike many toys in this price range, I do believe it was worth the money. You do need room for it, but it's perfect for a play room since it actually gives a nice amount of play area inside."},{"rating":"2","title":"Huge Castle!","review":"We first expected this tent/house to be a bit smaller for our daughter. Little did we know that we should have looked at the measurements! It's bigger than we could've thought by looking at the photo on the box.All the pieces snap in easily and haven't given us any problem in the months we've had the tent.The inside is nice. Also my husband, myself, and our daughter fit. My 4 yr old brings all her Barbies in there to play and she loves the pieces it comes with for Barbie.I'd recommend this for any Parent that already has a Barbie lover, or a parent of a daughter who's barely getting into Barbies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bigger than described...not a doll house, just a tent!","review":"I had to really search to find the Barbie Cloud Castle dollhouse so I could leave a review. It is no longer searchable by its title. I suspect that this item may have been discontinued due to customer dissatisfaction.We purchased this for our 5 year-old and 3 year-old this Christmas.The finished measurements are WAY over 4'x4'...they are 5'x5'.The floors and snap together parts are impossible to make stay in place, even using the helpful tips of other Amazon reviewers.My children had a lot of fun playing inside the castle, though. Unfortunately, they could only play with their Barbies on the ground, since the castle floors wouldn't stick. There was PLENTY of room in the castle to play games, puzzles, toys, etc. But that's a lot of money to pay for a tent! We wanted a Barbie doll house.We ended up taking it back to the store and waiting until another, more traditional style was in stock and purchased that instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was disappointed.","review":"This is an obscure theological book. The central core of it is about 50 or so pages long (written 1000 years ago or so, and translated). It gives some of the doctrinal beliefs of a non-Catholic Christian faction that existed hundreds of years before Martin Luther. Personally I was hoping for more and varied detail about their beliefs, and so was disappointed by the contents. But I would say it is a must have for a library that contains an extensive history of Christianity over the centuries."},{"rating":"1","title":"Indoor Outdoor Pre-lit Christms tree","review":"This tree is much skinnier and smaller than the photo made it look like.

Also the blue garland I purchased is an ugly off blue color instead of a softer blue I was hoping for. The same rating on the blue ornaments I purchased. My tree this year will be interesting with how it will look. I hope I'm not terribly disapointed because I'm stuck with all of it. If I had the choice, I would not have purchased any of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This garland is a must have!!!!!!","review":"I purchased this garland for my front door and it's absolutely beautiful.

You cannot see inside the box to see if the meds have been taken without opening up each portion of the box.

Every word is to the point. Very abstruse concepts are explained with beautiful clarity. The philosophy behind the various parts of set theory is presented in a very readable manner. This philosophical approach to set theory really helped me to understand the logic and meaning of the complex symbolism that I read in other books. The book has great personality and warmth. It talks to you if you listen. The very last pages are too hard for me to understand, but that's my problem. I recommend this book highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"10000 stars","review":"I sincerely regard this as probably the best album of popular music since the Beatles. The imaginative range could have been an embarrassment in less musically gifted hands - after all this is a concept album- but no-one puts a foot wrong in production or lyrical terms.Some bands have a sound and write in that idiom. Here Levi chooses whatever musical palette he needs to produce a song cycle that is complex yet emotionally direct and affecting.It seems though that it will remain a hidden masterpiece and that is a very great loss to popular culture. This is the real deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful and otherworldly","review":"Wonderful otherworldly music. You literally won't find anything like it anywhere else.

I will be reading more books by John Ortberg."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disapointment","review":"I loved Ortberg's - YOu can't walk on water....- so I thought this would be another great. I really could not get into it at all because it borders too much on pantheism - that God in IN everything. I can agree that God can be everywhere- he is Omnipresent. But I draw the line in that God is in the butterfly or in the tree. The Bible does not teach that.

At times, it can be laugh-out-loud funny, but one has to appreciate his style not to be distracted from his message.This book is pure vanilla orthodox Christianity, a book to confirm and affirm people who are Christian that all they already beleive is, in deed, true. Orthodox all the way.The last chapter \\"The Hedge\\" is worth reading and pondering. Did Jesus want us to worry about the life to come (as Paul would have us believe)or did He come to show us how we shosuld live in the here and now, then worry about the life to come?This last chapter alone is worth the price of the book and makes it worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"B&W budget version, but the same content is here.","review":"Great book so far.

Through a series of stories and simple lessons, the pastor leads us on an easy path to continue to open ourselves to our Creator. Though the principles behind the book are deep and profound, the text itself is so accessible and inviting. This book was a great gift, which has continued to be a part of my daily devotion and deepened relationship with our Father."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ortberg at his best","review":"Although I've enjoyed other writings of John Ortberg, I was thoroughly impressed with this book in the first couple of pages. I'm sure that my readiness for the material was enhanced by a recent reading of Brother Lawrence's, Practicing the Presence of God. The author is gifted at taking common circumstances (with unexpected humor) and applying spiritual truths. This book is not intended to be a \\"quick read\\". In fact, I recommend just one chapter a day to allow time for meditation. Since there are only 10 chapters - It only takes 10 days, but the material will enrich you for a lifetime! I cannot recommend this book highly enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"These are no ordinary pliers","review":"I bought both the 6\\" and the 8\\" after my 8\\" pair was lost, and am extremely happy with them. The self-adjusting part of these pliers is very cool. But the grip and the comfort are outstanding. After using these I would regret having to use my cold metal set. The rubberized handles give cushion and grip and the bite is outstanding. The unusual shape gives me the ability to add more pressure than the standard sets I have and used. I obviously have been won over by these an am looking at the other Stanley hand tools."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst Unix books for 'real' adminstration","review":"I have worked with almost every flavor of Unix. Bottom line, when you pickup a Unix administration book you want one thing, How do I get it done, quickly? In the Unix world, there are several interdependent text and binary files to do almost anything. It is key to completing any Unix task to know were those files are located in a standard setup. This book does not focus on that one important face. It is write from a general Unix level with little to no specifics on actual HP-Unix administration."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not For Experienced Sys Admins","review":"With its reprinted man page filler, screen shots of the ridiculous SAM GUI, and introduction to shell scripting, this book might be useful for the most junior of systems administrators. For those of us who already know what a subnet mask is, however, it leaves quite a lot to be desired.The author never really seems to go into great detail as to the 'why' of things. This might have something to do with the fact that the author has written very little original content for this book - again, it's almost all man pages and screen shots.This book receives two stars rather than just one, because it could conceivably be useful for someone who's never administered a Unix system before. Otherwise, I would recommend avoiding this book altogether."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total lack of detail","review":"The book constains too little useful information both for newbie and for experienced administrator. The author is running through the different parts without in-depth explanation or practically useful information. The only reasonable part is Chapter 1 which covers HP-UX installation. I bought this book as preparation tool for HP-UX test but it won't work. Also, about 1/2 of the boot itself consists of hardcopy of man pages. Probably this is the most expensive you to print the man pages. Conclusion - don't waste money on this book, use the books from LDP, HP Instant Information CD or buy \\"Unix System Administration Handbook\\" by Evi Nemeth, Garth Snyder, Scott Seebass, Trent R. Hein - the best overview of UNIX and it's flavours I have ever seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same book all over again","review":"I have a problem buying the same book over and over again. Marty re-uses the material from his earlier books without adding anything new or altering the material.And why should I pay for a book that is 20% man pages that are freely available to anyone who works on HP-UX.Tell Marty to stop writing the same book over and over again. Instead, he could concentrate on something far more interesting to his audience..like ServiceGuard and IT/Operations...stuff that people who work in the field would like to know more about. But then he'd have to actually spend time writing and researching...rather than reformating his old material.I'm sure there are many HP-UX horror stories out there...clients who don't know how to setup or administrate their million dollar systems....why dones't he write about that.....for a change."},{"rating":"1","title":"umm....","review":"ok, I just don't see why any non-Korean person would buy this CD.. vocal and arrangements are terrible and lyrics are horrible too.

After finishing the book, they remained quiet, absorbing all they had just heard.I highly recommend this to anyone of any age, and rate it on the same level as THE PRINCESS AND THE KISS and the WEIGHT OF A MASS.

Those days are gone. Mick Jones and Co.'s first album \`THIS IS BIG AUDIO DYNAMITE' was both a defining statement of purpose and a timeless dance masterpiece, it was a height they would never achieve again. They do keep trying. Now, instead of being trendsetters, they are simply dated. Their music is still lively, and Mick Jones' vocals are still as appealing as always but something has been lost in the translation. I have to give it credit; it's energetic and listenable, but not engaging. All but devotees should stick to \`THIS IS BAD' or \`THE GLOBE'. B"},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Audio a.k.a.

The band sounds the same and the songs remain the same. But unlike the other discs, this one is very over produced (I guess for the lack of music quality they decided to beef it up in the mixing process). The best tracks are Stone Age Blues and Looking for a Song. Bring back Don Letts and Leo Williams!The band made one more album (same band but they decided to rename themselves Big Audio Dynamite). I guess Mick's musical talent disappeared faster than his hair.

His habit of bringing artists in for a week's engagement meant that young artists like SRV and Doyle Bramhall Jr. could hang out with these cats and learn their riffs. This collection of jams, recollections, and pure blues energy will be a treat to any blues lover. Highly recommended.If you dig this, also check out Kenny Wayne Sheppard's new CD/DVD, 10 Days Out.

For most part, the author keeps you guessing and just when you think you have figured it out, he throws a curveball.

Vikram Suri is the picture of over-ambitious CEO's behind closed doors in corporate America."},{"rating":"2","title":"Prepare to be entertained!","review":"Couldn't be better-timed!!! Inspired no doubt by the chicanery of Enron and Worldcom, Merger is at heart a morality play between good and evil that delivers the message that \\"greed is NOT good\\". Shades of the movie Wall Street make this story an overdue addition to the current zeitgeist. Sure, corporate thrillers abound in the market, but this one really delivers! Sex, violence, corruption, ethical dilemmas, financial maneuverings, politics, corporate greed, it's all there. And it's all delivered as one larger-than-life tapestry of storytelling - much like those at the villain's Hamptons' home... Prepare to be entertained!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thriller","review":"MERGER is a well-plotted, entertaining thrill ride that also manages to be intelligent. In recent years, authors writing screenplays disguised as novels have soured the once hallowed genre of the corporate thriller. MERGER provides refreshing relief from this syndrome. Author Sanghoee's style is at times bombastic but he still manages to exploit the medium of the novel to take viewers behind the closed doors of Wall Street and Corporate America through meticulously crafted detail. There is substance to the tale, not just style. Corrupt CEO, Vikram Suri, is one of the most engaging villains in recent memory, ranking right up there with Michael Douglas' masterful Gordon Gekko. Through an intricate web of untraceable money laundering transactions and illicit dealmaking, Suri organizes an embezzlement scheme that makes WorldCom look like a big misunderstanding. Highly recommended reading for anyone who likes THRILLERS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre, at best. Dissapointing.","review":"Anyone who knows even a bit about the industry will find this dull. The plot is terribly transparent. The characters are either highly contrived or wholly forgettable. There's no suspense to it. Highly formulaic. Very, very dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A GREAT THRILLER","review":"Set during the 1980's, Merger is a thriller involving the corporate world. The plot was fantastic and terrifying. There was crime, greed, corruption,murder,deceit all rolled up into a great story. The author was able to take us on a journey through Wall Street and all of the happenings that occur there. I finished the book rather quickly and I was able to follow the storyline with ease.

In that time I have read quite a few books on the subject. I was surprised to find so many opinions, theories, teachers, schools, and styles. Yet they all seemed to fall short of giving really clear and understandable explanations of the mechanics of body movement. When I read \\"Yoga, Mind, Body &Spirit\\" I quickly recognized it to be, by far, the most logical and reasonable approach to yoga study that I had found. Exercises, refered to as Inquiries, help you to learn for yourself the principles that underlie the practice of yoga. This allows you to begin to fashion a practice tailored to your unique body and its current condition. If I had to choose one book to try and explain the techniqes and essence of yoga, this would be the one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reader from New York","review":"As a child I practices yoga for years, since then I grew up and became totally plugged and lazy to exercise. My job and life didn't allow for any kind of exercise. As my energy decreased I remembered my childohood. I bought this book and it changed my life. It is by far the best yoga book I have read. It gives full descritions for all levels of proficency, describing in detailed poses breaths and props that may be needed for each move. It also shows illustrations of what to do and what not to do. I liked the anatomy digrams that further explain what positions your body should be in. I also liked thefocus on getting to know your body, and yoga being a 'dance' rather than exercise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yoga","review":"Wonderful book. Donna Fahri explains yoga in its entirety.

At one point I used Ms Farhi's own words in class: my fellow trainee attempted to follow the instructions I was reading aloud. It was discovered that they didn't even work! No one would get into a shoulder stand in the real world the way the book instructs. Well, I guess you could follow the pictures. I can't recommend this book.I think the title is kind of silly too.

The Ultra Mini, costing anywhere from $25 (list) to $15 (various places online) fills the bill. It's not really \\"mini\\", being long and narrow, almost twice the size of my Flash, but it's a lot smaller than many other meters. It doesn't have a lot of bells and whistles, just the basics. No beeps, no computer interface; I don't need that for a backup anyway. What it does well is to give me an accurate reading. The test strips fill up fast, the sample needed is small,and you get readings in about 6 seconds on a nice, large display. I tested it against my Flash, and the readings were very close. (Full disclosure: I don't use the included lancet device, but a Bayer Vaculance that gives me great results when I test on my arm.)You might want more information from your main meter, but as a desk-drawer convenience, this one is hard to beat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Accuracy ?

CON: The big problem is that it requires lots and lots of blood. It is not unusual for me to have to use three strips. This completely wipes out the cost advantage. I have tried for months to use it but my hands are like pincushions. I recently had minor surgery and in the hospital they asked me about all the pinholes on my hands.

She is amazing, high energy, with fast music and her class always attracts a group of people who are really motivated to be there and to work out. She will walk around and demonstrate moves right next to you if you are doing it wrong. The video unfortunately was slow in comparison, with boring music and no energy.

Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought provoking quick read","review":"This book is a collection of essay/lectures Eco has presented. They range over a variety of interesting philosophical issues -- which are well presented and thought out. The theme throughout is that incorrect ideas can result in useful results. Like all of Eco's writing (with which I am familiar) his ideas require some attention and thought on the part of the reader. But this was for me a very accessible book, perhaps reflecting its origin as lectures, and well worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Food for thought","review":"Do you know what Christopher Columbus was trying to prove with his historic ocean voyage, and why the church elders insisted it couldn't be done? Eco asks this question in the first essay of this book, \\"The Force of Falsity\\", and you may be surprised by the answer. Throughout, Eco gives you that delightful taste of history that he's known for, while asking provocative questions about the philosophy of language and even the nature and value of truth itself.Language is definitely the focus of this book, but each essay is more of an examination than a thesis, and the material is not as heavy as Eco's essays about language often are. On the other hand it is not as light and playful as, for example, \\"Misreadings\\" (also a worthy read). It's a casual, engaging read with some substance to it, and well worth reading if you like to think."},{"rating":"2","title":"eco at his best","review":"very funny and delightful, illustrates his points very well, Great reading for smart people who want to know how ideas get teansmuted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Altec Lansing inMotion iM500 - Does NOT charge iPod Nano 5th Gen","review":"I'm absolutely disgusted with this purchase - the sounds quality, while not optimal, is the least of my problems. I plugged my iPod Nano (5th Generation) into it and found out (the HARD WAY!) that it will not charge my iPod. Now I must try to get my money back which I envision will be an uphill battle as this seller does NOT accept returns."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacking parts","review":"I purchased this item in August 2009 and it arrived without the plug to use in the USA. I was called about it and assured the correct plug would be forthcoming but it never arrived. I managed to use another universal plug and it worked for a few months before the ipod charger died. I would not buy it again. Buyer beware."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nano Speakers","review":"This was a present for my wife. She asked for a Nano IPOD with speakers for her to listen to at work as she prepares lesson plans. I looked a several models, brands and for the price and sound quality she likes it very much. About $45.00, so not the high end of $450.00 BOSE, but not the cheapest for $20.00. Priced right, new out of the box."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Expected More","review":"The doll was very small & I don't even know that the book was with the set, if it was, it was really small. I returned the product without fully opening, the doll alone wasn't what I was expecting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the price","review":"I was fine with the size of the doll. Small for easy take-along toy for travel. The book is a waste of money. The print is so small, almost impossible to read. I do not feel that this item is worth the money being charged for it. Would not purchase again."},{"rating":"2","title":"pre wax","review":"Thought I would try this and really think it does make a difference before you wax.

I've given it it's fair time with about 4 different bottles of application, but always keep handy the Turtle Polishing Compound to remove scratches that periodically appear."},{"rating":"2","title":"A new take","review":"This book answers a question that is a frequent topic of discussion in Christian circles. How do I recognize my spiritual gifts. The different gifts are cited and reviewed but it is the authors description of the use of gifts that varies from most. Very thoughtful presentation. Recommended to me by a friend. Definitely worth reading if you are studying gifts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasurable listening","review":"Another excellent release by Charles Bruffy with his forces from Phoenix and Kansas. This choir sounds great. The music is interesting, though not the best. This makes for pleasant listen of you like expressive and meaningful choral music."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a delightful book","review":"Dougal the Garbage Dump Bear is a wonderful, quintessentially Australian book. Quirky, whimsical yet down-to-earth, and incapable of taking itself seriously.Ignore the School Library Journal review by Sally R Dow. How anyone can criticise a children's book as \\"implausible\\" is beyond me. And as for \\"too long to use as a read-aloud\\" - my three-year-old daughter doesn't think so. In fact, when we read it she usually asks for it again and again.Yes, there are a few jokes for adults, but when did making a children's book enjoyable for both child and parent become a bad thing?We first came across this book at our local library. We now own a copy, and Dougal is this year's birthday present for all our godchildren."},{"rating":"2","title":"lovely book","review":"this book has become a favorite with my 4 year old granddaughter. She wants it read to her every day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Atrociously bad","review":"This tool is the worst tool I've ever purchased -- and I've bought Black & Decker!The nicest thing I can say about this item is that the saw itself is merely mediocre.The mitre box is offensively bad. It's flimsy, fragile, and useless. You can't clamp this thing down, because it's so weak that force sufficient to hold it in place would snap it. If you try to hold it by hand, it bows and flexes and wobbles all over the place, and you can't get a decent stable cut.This tool is a hate crime. Avoid it like the clap."},{"rating":"2","title":"moving, deep, fiery - touches many senses and emotions","review":"moving, fiery, deep - touches many senses and emotions"},{"rating":"2","title":"Squall Shoes by Nunn","review":"Excellent quality and foot support.

Great fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of junk - save your money","review":"I was hoping to use this miter box for some cuts to build a jewelry box. I tried 3 different types of saws, and none of them worked well. There was also way too much play in the angle resulting in an awful cut. The saws also dug easily into the plastic. I wish there was some redeeming quality about this miter box, but it is a complete waste of money. I'll be throwing it out after only the first use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clamping Pins Not Included","review":"I ordered this *clamping* miter box from Amazon. They shipped it without the clamping pins. The product wrapper and the Amazon description both clearly state that plastic clamping pins are included. I returned it and ordered another one from Amazon. They promptly shipped another one in a sealed plastic bag, but it still did not include the clamping pins.I've noticed that a major hardware store chain sells this miter box with a saw (and clamping pins) for less than the Amazon price, so I may try to get it locally."},{"rating":"1","title":"CHEAPLY MADE","review":"While this Stanley Mitre box does the job, the materials used are on the cheap size and it does not have a sturdy feel to it.

Also, we thought the story lacked continuity, which made it hard to follow historically. I would not spend the money on this film again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea, crappy execution","review":"The design of this shock-lok is what drew me to it, we're constantly pulling out the plugs in a couple of our outlets to vacuum, and then losing the plugs. However, the type of plastic they used is sooo cheap that I broke one putting in on (the screw tightening split it apart) and the rest broke after only 1-2 uses. The prongs would snap right out and stick in the outlet itself (wow and those little prongs are real safe to get out). Tried using extreme caution after I broke the second one but kept breaking them anyway. I would love to see this product again with better, stronger plastic because the design is fairly good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Bill Monroe Single CD Collection!","review":"This mid-line priced CD features 16 cuts by Bill Monroe & his Blue Grass Boys recorded for Columbia between 1945 and 1949. This CD has a solid selection of songs and is as good a place as any to listen closely to Monroe, the \\"Father of Bluegrass.\\" Recordings made in September of 1946 with Monroe, Lester Flatt, Earl Scruggs, Chubby Wise, and Howard Watts (Cedric Rainwater) are considered by many to be the first true bluegrass recordings. It was Scruggs' banjo playing in these 1946 sessions that set this band apart from earlier versions of the Blue Grass Boys. This CD ends with a couple of sides from 1949 featuring the incomparable Mac Wiseman on lead vocals and the great Rudy Lyle on banjo. This is a handsome CD with good notes by Mark A. Humphrey."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let There Be Quiet","review":"This is actually two albums in one. The first is incredibly bad. Why anyone, even back in the early 60s would start off a studio album with Bill Bailey is completely beyond me. It is an insipid song that should be used only as filler for a live performance. Montgomery, with her rhythmic insanity, made me feel as if someone were shooting at me with a nail gun. Then there is the exaggerated nasal delivery. Awful!!! Even though Montgomery's singing on the second album improves tremendously, the arrangements are horrible with their relentless, organ-driven \\"swing.\\" This album should definitely be among the first sent to the surface of the sun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great tool","review":"This is a great tool!

Now I can tell them that they can go to amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Functional","review":"This is a great wrench for the occasional time you need a locking wrench. It's long handle helps give you the torque you need to loosen a tough fastener and the locking mechanism makes sure it stays in place.

My vice grips do a great job, yet can be difficult to use when fixing large pipes that require a a solid grip when having to use brute force. This tool solved the problem with an adjustable whench head that locks to a specific size when fitted.
