While this device works, it's not a lot better than my old method. It is better than an ordinary plate because it is square and therefore holds more bacon without it draping off the ends. It also is a little slanted so grease is collected in a trough. Here is why it's not great. Because it's square it does not turn in average sized microwaves which results in uneven cooking (I rearrange pieces half way through cooking). Also, There is still a lot of grease trapped within the ridges the bacon rests on and some of this grease dries out and becomes difficult to wash off (the ridges get in the way of cleaning. Also, this tray becomes very hot and requires oven mitts. I think the round style microwave bacon makers may be better, but I've never tried one."},{"rating":"2","title":"good for the price","review":"I was looking for a basic microwavable bacon tray...I went with this for its large size and small price.

I am able to cook a lb. of bacon (5 or 6 slices at a time) without having to empty the hot grease in between, which can be perilous, and without the bacon grease overflowing the portion of the tray that it designed to collect the grease during cooking (unlike other versions)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"I had one of these bacon trays for over 20 years until it finally cracked and was no longer usable.

It took two days to get the smell out of the house. I have not contacted the seller, I figured there was probably no need to. I am just out the money. I wish I could post a picture to show just what it does look like. The microwave I was using is a new LG and I have not had any other problems with the microwave.

I have no particular complaints regarding either the works or the performances. My only concern, and thus the reason for four stars instead of five, is the lack of commonality between the selections in the program. I have yet to understand why the ethereal \\"Suite for Double Quartet\\"(the best of the CD by the way) was included with the highly percussive and, aside from \\"Xochiplli\\", somewhat serialistic works that compose the remainder of the program. While all the works have their merits, the lack of any logic in their inclusion on this disc is somewhat annoying. Yet for true Chavez fans this a must have all the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good exploration of Chavez' chamber works","review":"This is a consistently satisfying CD, and a good introduction to the music of Chavez. If you know Chavez only through his symphonies, then this will prove a worthy exploration indeed.It also serves a yet another reminder, if indeed we need one, of the great loss the music world has suffered in the premature death of Eduarto Mata.Like the previous reviewer, my only quibble with this CD is the arrangement of pieces. To place the Suite for Double Quartet right smack dab in the middle of a collection of works that are overwhelmingly percussive in nature simply makes no sense. When I play this CD, occasionally I will simply program the player to move past the Suite, so as to maintain a certain continuity. Perhaps it would have worked better to put the Suite at the end of the CD. How you program your concerts can be just as important as how the pieces are played."},{"rating":"1","title":"a disappointment","review":"What I really expected was a new book that would cover true \\"advanced\\" topics in Unix programming, like IPC and terminals in some extend.

Unfortunately this seems to be the case with most dinnerware as years go by. The plates no longer have the beautiful hand painted detail and delicacy that once made these plates beautiful. There is no comparison in quality. The older dishes were hand painted with shading and uniqueness and made in England. These plates are made in China and have lost their beauty.

With only one heating element on the top and bottom, it's really impossible to get things toasted evenly. Things come out with a toasted line right above/below the element, and the rest is untoasted.

Very small selection of comics, and each strip repeats twice (original & color).

He also adds some fun insights written below each of his strips. It's a nice touch to see them presented in both B&W and in full color. Shows how much life color can add to any presentation.Reason #2 - Well...Calvin of course. It's all here from the early days to the final days. Fights with Hobbes, Spaceman Spiff, advice from dad, and lunchtime with Calvin.

Came really fast and in great condition!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice fix for those of us missing C&H","review":"Wading through Watterson's pretensions has always been the only real down side of the Calvin and Hobbes collections, and this is no exception. But for every sardonic mention of his famous reproductions rights legalities, and self-congratulatory pat on the back, there are at least a couple eye-opening insights. The reproductions are also very nicely done, and the overall quality is quite high. However, this is ultimately a collectors item, and anyone new to Calvin and Hobs should buy all the other books first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Waterson Does It Again","review":"This book is awesome! If you are a true Calvin and Hobbes fan, you will get this. It has two versions of every 36 strips in the book, you can even see white-out and erase marks on the rough copies that are shown on the left side. Watterson talks about each strip, including a six page introduction.

However, it is a lousy instructional movie with low budget. From the picture quality to the clothes on the instructor is just plain - cheap. Curt Mitchell started off the DVD rambling on and on about Kurt Cobain for the first 5 mins, which does not have anything to do with Nirvana's guitar skills. The rest of the DVD just him played riffs after riffs. I doub other DVDs in this \\"Guitar Method\\" series worth any good either. This is just some cheap DVD made by this company to profit from huge bands. Save yourself some bucks. Instead purchase Nirvana sheet music and play along their CDs."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL GARBAGE!!!","review":"The guy just rambles on about his own band and what he tought of nirvana he is a real creepy guy. Plus it's so low budget and it's retarded it doesn't even say what songs he's playing. He just lables every thing by riffs.

The toy at the doctor's office was still made in Canada and that a huge discriminator for me. I am not opposed to Chinese manufacturing if it wouldn't be for frequent recalls due to poisonous paints or materials. Once or twice a year there are recalls.

It just doesn't make sense to see all these modern attitudes in a movie that takes place when attitudes were very different. Women were not overtly brash and bratty as depicted by a rather hum-drum Uma Thurman. Bergin acts more like a spoiled teenager making stupid insults that are bound to get him in trouble (who wrote this thing...6th graders?). On the positive side, the costumes were nice and the horses looked good.

To make it gritty, witty and humorous is an art. This film is sometimes gritty, rarely humorous and never witty.

It showed the whole story of Robin Hood as teenage boy who became a an outlaw for killing a deer to his most wonderfully depicted death.This movie is a primitive. In one scene there was a soldier who threw a big rock, that probably weights like half a ton, off the stairs as if it was a basketball. If this movie was true, there would be no legend of Robin Hood and it seemed at times it was made to mock that very person.

I agree very much with the customer who described the book as rambling and disjointed. Since the murdere was completely obvious in the first couple of chapters I spent the rest of the book wondering how the main character could be so dense. The subplots were left largely unfinished and unexplored and never interacted with the main plot. While the decriptions were beautiful and the protaganist was as likeable as before, the book was overshadowed by the everpresent almost pointless violence. People did not simply die; they were murdered or tortured in bloody ways involving all sorts of body fluids. The plot was sacrificed on the altar of violence!

The book started out slow (probably b/c it took me a while to get used to the narration), but the pace picked up about 1/4 through and flowed nicely after that. The ending wasn't very satisfying - lots of build-up to the big confrontation that ends more with a wimper than a bang.But, since I liked John & the world the author created has promise, I'll give the second book a try.

The description also tended to be along the lines of \\"you don't really want to know what's behind that door; it's really, really bad and will gross you out.\\" Yes, and? So? My imagination isn't that good; it's the author's job to fill in those blanks.And the dialogue! Talk about stilted. The female character actually says 'forfend' at one point. Come on!I know I'm one of the dissenters of this, but the author just didn't convince me about the setting or the characters.I bought this because 'someone' had thought enough about his writing that they had published more than one novel.

None of the characters are interesting enough that you would care anything about them and Joanna had more personality shifts than I care to discuss. I hated her, felt sorry for her, was confused by her in turns and then was relieved when she turned out not to actually exist.

Cryptic retorts are a constant. Every other sentence ends with \\"in the Nightside.\\" After about the fiftieth \\"in the Nightside\\" (about 46 pages in), I said to hell with this.

Initially, I had some doubts as this series sounded awfully similar to the Dresden Files. Well, after a chapter or two it was difficult to keep reading.

Sentences containing descriptions like \\"...an alien from and alien place.\\", duh, and \\"...the floor felt like sticky toffee.\\" What?? Come on, a first time novelist could come up with better descriptions than that. At times I found myself laughing out loud, and not because of a purposely written comedic sentence. It felt like the author just cut and paste from books you find free with a bottle of dish soap at the super market.For me, the initial book of any new series has to grab hold of you and keep your interest to even think about buying the second book.

For a much superior recording, pick up the Philadelphia Orchestra recording with Muti conducting. That is a much better value, and the recording is still budget. The excerpts from Damnation of Faust are about the same. The sluggish tempo of the March destroys its effect and the Dance never really gets dancing. The Romeo & Juliet is by far the best portion of this CD and I don't really have any particular complaints about it.

Granted, Seraphim is the \\"low budget\\" division of EMI, but that does not mean that Seraphim carries no great recordings. A brief glance at this CD will reveal its values. First of all, the performances were conducted by two of the greatest conductors of the 20th century, Boskovsky and Kempe. Also, the CDs were recorded by two great ensembles (the Vienna Johann Strauss Orchestra and the Vienna Philharmonic). The selections included are excellent, very much comparable to more pricey compilations. Lastly, the performances are elegant, exciting, and precise. Definitely a must-buy for waltz lovers. For the hardcore waltz lovers who just cannot get enough of J. Strauss's music, I recommend the budget-value CD set from Naxos. Top quality performances too, like many Naxos recordings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cthulhu Plush Doll is a Bit Weak But Fun","review":"I got this Cthulhu plush doll for my goddaughter, who is 3 years old and just getting into stuffed toys.

It generally costs about $10 higher than the AACS even though the specifications look exactly the same. What the extra $10 buy is special software engineering going into the firmware, which makes sure that the drive will not go incommunicado for longer than a few milliseconds. Ordinary drives have no such safeguards and the RAID controller can possibly mistaken the temporary lack of responsiveness as a drive failure. Once the controller marks the drive as failed, it has to be reformatted and everything on it is as good as gone. This is an inconvenience in RAID 5 or RAID 1, and a fatal blow in RAID 0.I bought two of these and put them in RAID 0 configuration. This RAID array serves as the only storage system.

Also the 2670 does not allow you to do MAC translation - for those who may need it for gaming beware. The only way to reboot is to unplug the freaky little cable at the back - which in my case is on top of the Xbox in a narrow shelf and it is not easily accessible.Regarding their other masterpice, the 2435 cardbus adapter - I tried to replace the 2632 with the 2435 - DONT.

I only had the pool up 6 weeks max, and then stored it, only to find, setting it up this year, that the pump won't pump water. It just makes a loud grinding noise.

The lowest price I could find at the time was $40, almost as much as the $50 we spent to buy the whole pool set. The replacement pump lasted about a month, just died doesn't make any sound. I just took the pool down and stored it for the fall. The next summer, we bought a whole new Intex pool set, the pump lasted almost 3 months.You should just expect these pumps to last 1 to 3 months, be sure to have a replacement pump ON HAND when you buy the pool.

I found that the plastic covering around the shaft of the impeller had simply come off over time. A loose piece was still remaining which made it clear the now bare metal was previously covered by plastic. There was no \\"fixing\\" this. After looking on the internet for a while, the part was not available either. Now I see that many people are complaining about it suddenly stopping. This is due to that design defect and it would be tolerable if the impeller was sold at a cheap price in packs of 3 or more with instruction that it should be changed every few months.

I was also interested to find out more about the Austrain-Hungary royalty that was famous to intermarry with other nation's royalty. Palmer answer my questions and succeeded in providing a different viewpoint of Franz Joeseph. History books portrayed him as an aged man who was interested in nothing but war and out of touch with the modernizing world. I learned this to be unfounded rhetoric.

On the contrary (but that's for you to check).The story is basically the life of a young and enchanting kid in the Bayou. His daily occupations, his relation with surrounding nature (its enchants and perils). It provokes an emotion similar to the reading of Huckelberry's adventures.Again, as in all of Mr. Flaherty's documentaries, it's the sheer beauty of the photography and the wonderful capture of the expression of people's faces, real people, that make the viewing a humanly enriching experience.I have to recommend, also of Mr. Flaherty, \\"The Man of Aran\\" and \\"Nanook of the North\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Noise Suppressor","review":"I use this on my cable connection between the cable company's wall outlet and my LCD TV set.

I went around whispering over and over, \\"Keoko. Kaneyama Keoko. Keoko.\\" I could think about \\"Kaneyama Keoko\\" as a name but not as my name.\\" When my name was Keoko makes reading enjoyable for kids eight and above.Linda Sue Park writes When my name was Keoko to help remind us what happened in Korea during WWII. She writes this book in two different points of view, Tae-yul's and Sun-hee's, a brother and sister. This book focuses on a their life in Korea when it was under Japan's occupation. Koreans are forced to do whatever the Japanese tell them to do. Seeing what the Japanese made the Koreans do like study Japanese at school and speak Japanese everywhere except at home made me realize how cruel some people can be.This historical fiction novel is filled with adventure. It is an interesting way to learn about a point in history that not many people know about. Change my name, I don't think so!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Innocent and touching","review":"This newest book by the VERY FIRST KOREAN NEWBERY WINNER is both innocent and touching. At first the split-narrative alternating between brother and sister put me off--and I do believe Park too neatly overlaps their entries instead of allowing a more natural rhythm--but the technique becomes quite effective once brother Tae-yul enlists in the army.As in her earlier books, Park's accurate incorporation of historical detail--such as the false announcement that \\"Kitei Son\\" of \\"Japan\\" had won a gold medal at the Olympics--is both stunning and stimulating. Few American readers will know of these details, and the tense dramatic unfolding of events will prompt many readers, both young and old, to go to their history books to learn more. A fine achievement which opens doors of discussion to these too-long-ignored issues."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flew by so fast, I wished it was longer...","review":"I read this book in one night. It was so easy to get into and the two characters that told the story, Tae-yul and Sun-hee, were very easy to move back and forth with. I liked how the author included the dates as well. Anyways, this book focuses on a brother and sister living in Korea during WWII, when it is under Japan's occupation. Seeing what the Japanese made the Koreans do, as well as seeing the wonderfully developed characters grow and change made this book so interesting. I only wish that the end wrapped up a few loose ends."},{"rating":"1","title":"When My Name was Keoko","review":"Maybe its because I only got to page 31 is the reason I did not like this book!

In the opening credits of the film, it says it is based on a true story and cites this book \\"The Scarlet Pimpernel of the Vatican\\" by J P Gallagher. Hence I was very keen to read the book. The book tells a somewhat different story - the film tends to attribute a lot of the actions to Hugh O'Flaherty but in the book it is discovered that is not always the case. Anyway, I found the book interesting to read and I really liked the photos showing some of the people who were part of the \\"organisation\\".

Most of it has been done (and done better) and that which is original simply isn't interesting.It's got some decent moments, but it seems the band realized that those were pretty good and decided to stretch them out for as long as possible without the song breaking into pieces.There might be some people that really end up liking this album, but if you're buying that they may sound like some blend of u2, sunny day real estate and cold play you've been fooled. Read past the reviews and realize that all of the reviewers that gave it 5 stars are from Indianapolis or the surrounding area (except for one that used to live there) and so is the band.I feel bad for writing such a mean review, but honestly this really this album simply does not deserve 5 stars and the average needs to be lowered."},{"rating":"1","title":"two good looking guys...that's it.","review":"After purchasing this movie, and watching it as soon as it arrived...I was quite disappointed with the outcome.

I was initially worried about the durability of cork, but I couldn't ignore the price. The bike shop put them on for free when I had them change my bars and cables, and even though they did crack on the underside, they haven't budged at all since, so I don't anticipate the problem getting any bigger. They have darkened nicely with use and are comfortable to hold on a long ride. I commute to work everyday for about 6 miles round trip, so they work well for me. I can't attest to heavier usage, but the look is nice and classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty and comfortable.","review":"I love these grips. They're very comfortable, unlike the silicone grips often installed on new bicycles. I have three pair of them now.I finish them with five or six coats of spar urethane before using them. I use the spray cans of MinWax Helmsman spar urethane, semi gloss or gloss (available at your Home Depot).For fixing them in place on the handlebar an adhesive is needed. I've used DAP Weldwood contact adhesive. This seems to work well and it's been durable.Just put a coating on the handlebars before installing the grip with a turning motion, then wipe off the excess cement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love these grips.","review":"I've purchased these cork grips for 5 bikes now. With a few coats of amber shellac, the natural colored ones look great and are weather and sweat-proof. The black ones look nice too.

Natural style and comfort for a great price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better to look at than to ride...","review":"I love the feeling of cork grips, but they just don't last. These are harder than average. It's funny, people reviewing these say to shellac them. What the hell? That pretty much defeats the purpose of having these, well, unless you just like to look at them. If you're gonna shellac them, you might as well carve your own grips from a shovel handle... I can't even imagine how well they would work wet or sweaty palmed. Probably quite slippery.So...Get these for the looks. If you want a trail worthy grip go for foam."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great","review":"These hand grips come looking quite nice in the packaging but in the end not so great. First of all the company is quite slow about processing things so don't try to expidte them as they take 4 days just to process your order and the only thing you are paying for is to shorten the actual time they are in the truck. The cork is neither as thick nor as cushioning as I had thought it would be. I had seen a set of these at the bike store for $10 more and loved the feel. Now I wish I had gotten the bike store ones. In addition, these are for large thick handle bars. I have standard Cruiser bike and my boyfriend has had to modify the product to get them to stay on.

The first CD features Andre Previn, digitally remastered from his 1970s stint with the London Symphony. The skimpy liner notes state this collections goal is to illustrate orchestral colors. Only Previn's performances somewhat accomplishes this as most are fireworks through music. A piece or two like \\"Greensleeves\\" is sneaked in for a more subtle coloring. Disc two abandons this premise entirely! It's bombs away with several loud staples of the orchestral genre(various artists). A nicely remastered 1959 interpretation of the underated \\"Russian Easter Overture\\" by Lovro von Matacic with the Philarmonia is included. As a whole these selections make an accessable introduction for ones first exposure to orchestral music. EMI's star artists make this preferable to other budget compilations usually featuring obscure Eastern European orchestras and conductors.

In short, I was expecting a lot from this material, hoping this would help me create NPC's (enemies or allies) using sound guidelines but rather the entire booklet is just full of silly and ridiculous samples.If you're not feeling creative, then this might help you.

While billed as a resource guide for dungeon masters, I think it's actually something more. Most of the campaigns I've seen are limited in the types and use of non-human races. In Enemies & Allies though all the gloves come off. Detailed information on a variety of different classes and races - an umber hulk monk, a minatour mage, etc. The information on the non human characters is what makes this book great. It's a way to start thinking in different directions, where to take your characters or campaign that's \\"out of the box\\". The only thing I could say bad about the book is there isn't enough of it. They could have added even more characters and ideas."},{"rating":"2","title":"major","review":"Dios (Malos) was one of the up and coming bands a few years ago in LA. They had to change their name and work on their live show. They lost one member and are back with a second album. They seemed much like Grandaddy and Elliot Smith. I saw them a few times over the years and they have improved. Recently I have seen them with M. Ward. They are able to combine memorable melodies with rocking folk music. The songs \\"Feels Good Being Somebody\\" and \\"I Want It All\\" explore the new sound. \\"Tokyo Sunrise\\" is a dynamic song. I often wonder why more people haven't heard these guys. They mix a little rocking folk with Mexican influences. Some of these songs seem big and very open. It is like party music for a big venue. They are doing their first headlining tour this month so that makes sense. We should have more bands like Dios (Malos).

The trick is to open the settings and have the bluetooth preference showing when you pair. Not as slick as some devices, but not that big a deal. While not audiophile, they sound a hell of a lot better than a couple of $100, in-ear units that I have. The only disappointment is that I couldn't get them working as plain vanilla wireless phones with my laptop. I succeeded in pairing them but was not able to hear audio from a CD or DVD.

With the pace of this story as slow as it was to begin with, this activity just made it worse.Also, the author likes to jump around from character to character a lot. In the hands of a more experienced/skilled writer, this is usually no problem.

I contacted the seller for information on returning the items (I had to pay to ship them back...fyi), and after I confirmed with the seller a week later that they had received the items, I was told they would process my refund. Two weeks and several emails after that, I only received the proper refund when I informed Webtreo that I had disputed the charge with my credit card company."},{"rating":"1","title":"This includes only ONE earbud.","review":"The design is nice and it's comfortable to wear, however, make sure you notice that it's only one earbud.

He's amazing, he sings, asks questions, giggles when you touch just about anywhere. The only bad thing is, good luck making your voice sound like Leap. It will be your voice saying your childs name and your name. I doubt my son will notice though, and after my husband and I played with Leap for about 20 minutes (without hearing the same phrase or song twice) we agreed to go out and buy a second one for my son's twin sister. This is bound to be a toy that neither will give up. FYI, he is completely erasable if you want to change the info you've given him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"My son is 2 1/2 and someone gave us the cartride to Leap about having a baby so I bought leap.

From the start of the song you already know its a song and has that acoustic-paul-wellar-ballad feel but now it has a full force sound. It hits you hard wanting more and \\"Carry Us All\\" creeps up. Another Noel Gallagher ballad which almost sounds like an echo of \\"Where did it all go wrong?\\" giving us that if we all work together it will be ok feeling. Too bad the gallaghers didn't look to their own lyrics fore advice. Sadly though the single falls at \\"Full On\\" which even for the new material is too far off and leaves the single on a bad note instead of uplifting. \\"Go Let It\\" however remains the best b-sides from \\"Standing on The Shoulder Of Giants\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Swinging pop classics","review":"Actually; the only reason I don't give this album 5 stars is the fact I'm a jazz fun:this is a nice piece of swinging popular music, but not only it is a waste to put Basie's orchestra in subservient role, I have heard older Mills Brothers' recordings with far more verve and versatility - in the swing era they were much more ready to imitate instruments and at least fake improvising. And what's with the \\"I dig rock and roll music\\" song?

My recollection is the drums used on this track were tuned by filling them with water. I believe they were called Aqua-Toms, but I can't be sure. Either way this is classic Billy, explosive power and exacting precision. Makes me want to get out my Mahavishnu Orchestra vinyl.

I keep one in the kitchen for knives because I hate dull knives. My only complaint is that it doesn't really stand out in color so if it is in a toolbox or drawer it's hard to spot.

Amongst them - chauvinism,racism,and the collective stupidity of blind adherence to regulations. Like Mill's previous book 'The Restraint of Beasts', the story is compelling reading even though there's no obvious direction (he presents a deliberately vague overall picture, while the simple details of day to day life are rendered with humor and crisp detail). Both books are very simply written, which is part of their charm. The cliche \\"Less is more\\" fits and works in these instances."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Pennies","review":"I'm a big Mills fan and loved Restraint of Beasts and Orient Express. This one was tedious and labored. It is parody of classic polar expedition books, but the real books are marvelous and describe real events. Their characters were more interesting and quirky than any of Mills fictional characters in this book and so it seems pointless to attempt to parody them. The whole book comes down to a one line joke and as I finished the book I felt like the office boor had cornered me and recanted an endless story at the office party. I was just glad when it ended. However, I remain a devoted Mills fan and look forward optimistically to any new works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Watch for spoilers in these reviews!","review":"Two groups of explorers set off toward the Agreed Furthest Point in a desolate wilderness.That's about all the information you start with; it's unclear where they are or even when. Mills slowly unfolds additional details in a series of carefully-planned Big Reveals. The ending misses a couple of minor details, but it's still a ton of fun to read - and it'll only take a couple of hours. It's really more of a novella. Fun way to spend an evening.Note that some of these reviews give away the big plot twist.

Dragon Harvest is just one of several of the Lanny Budd series. But I haven't read the others yet. This one is good. I found particularly interesting the information about the origins of the Christian Identity movement being connected with Henry Ford, a well-known facist. Although Sinclair never names the Christian Identity movement by name, it is nonetheless unmistakeable when he describes the actions of Ford and the infamous Father Coughlin in the Detroit area through Lanny Budd's eyes. And the part about Hitler's fascination with psychics is not only a hoot, but provides tremendous page-turning excitement as well. These books are hard to find, but when you do, snap it up.

Depending upon the severity of the bout our pup is having (if he managed to eat something off the ground we didn't see, for example) this stuff fully gets him back to normal within 1-2 days maximum.It's like every product in that it might work better for some dogs than others.

Reading that girls intentionally deceive their parents, are overly focused on their looks and are concerned how others view their bodies, not to mention learn about what 'baseball' REALLY means to boys is not what I expect for my elementary daughter and question whether it is a necessary way to attract the attention of even middle school aged girls.

Wilson achieves this with having so many characters just taking the way they do everyday. What's interesting is that each of the characters reads differently even though they all do the same thing, more or less. He achieves in intimacy with these characters and their scene while providing an understanding look into their lives.

Yet it fizzles when the editing jumps all too quickly to clothes falling on the floor and the girls throwing tinsle at each other. Great possibilities lost. The subsequent vignettes are, unlike the girls, flat. This is not a video of the caliber of other Playboy triumphs like Girlfriends. Very disappointing.

First the light stopped working, then the switch that opens it just came off entirely, the screw totally stripped so it couldn't be put back together.If you just want a display or costume piece this will do nicely (but don't expect its features to necessarily work).

It is a replica of a high tech instrument but the casing looks like prehistoric stone, like a \\"Flintstones\\" toy. If they made these smaller and out of metal with some quality sound I would buy it. I will keep this and put it on a shelf, but I wish they had put a little more quality and value into it.

To maximize the power of the steam, 8.5\\" or 9\\" inner right size is suggested; b) It will be desirable to create a 1/2 inch deep, 10\\" shoulder ring so the steamer set can sit tight on the ring; c) It will also be preferrable to increase the outter ring size for another inch so that the wet towel can be used to seal the bottom of the steamer set to prevent steam from escaping."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wagner Overtures and Preludes","review":"The selections on this CD are excellent.

The phone worked OK, and coverage was good for my area (SF Bay), but I won't get another Nextel product due to the response of their customer service department. I made about 6-8 calls to that department, and never once did they get my request for billing changes, service changes, or anything else right.

I loved it the first month because it was cool but the daily annoyances of the phone drove me crazy. The interface doesn't make any sense at all and you must use multiple key strokes to do simple funtctions like switching to vibrate mode. Motorola needs to take a look at samsung phones. You don't even need a manual to use it.Also, because Nextel service is power hungry, your battery will need to be charged daily. This is not a function of the phone so much as the service. There isn't away around this one. Unless you have a real need to use Direct Connect, don't get Nextel.

It's also not quite as skinny as the LG phone I had before but that is due to the advantage of it being a Nextel walky talky style phone. Don't get the extra belt clip because it comes with one.

I've gotten many many many complaints from people who tell me they called, but my phone never even rang! I think Nextel has way too many customers than they can handle, and us consumers have to suffer the consequences.Oh, and if you ever need to contact Nextel for any type of customer support, make sure you have at least 2 hours set aside for that ordeal because NO ONE WHO WORKS FOR NEXTEL KNOWS ANYTHING!

The voice dialing is a feature that just is not used by me because it does not perform as well as some Qualcomm phones I have owned. Illuminated display is good. The bad. It is not as easy to navigate as the old i1000. You have to push buttons, flip open the cover etc. to get to desired locations. i1000 was easy to dial as cell or connect with two way. this i90 phone is far more difflicult to navigate.

Note that ALL Discovery Stores have been closed. Okay, we're keeping it so let's try it.This rock tumbler takes several stages with exacting instructions to get a finished and polished stone - we are talking weeks.

It is, but everyone has to be patient. You are looking at @ 3 weeks between all 4 steps. The tumbler does make some noise, so try to find a out of the way location. Take caution not to overload the rocks... easy to do. We got the unit last summer and within the first 2 steps, the drum started leaking at the seam. The seams are thin compared to the drum itself (you can see light through it). It was replaced by the store. This summer, we got it out again. All together, we probably ran about 3 batches. The lid or cover has to be on for the tumbler to operate. There is a plastic tab that holds and releases the cover. That tab broke this summer. I have held it in place with tape. Now the drum is leaking again. I understand that it is a \\"toy\\" for a child, but I am a little disapointed with the durability.

We continued the tumbling and the rocks finished perfectly. We started another batch and again one day into the second tumble, the barrel started leaking from the side. So we returned it and got a replacement. On this one, the lights will turn on but when you push the On/Off button to start it, the lights blink and nothing happens. I've used the tumbler in the past so I know it isn't something we are doing wrong. I e-mailed the customer service e-mail they give in the box and have yet to hear from them after 5 days.

I then bought a Lortone tumbler, which was about twice the price of this tumbler (sold on many web sites). However, what a pleasure to use.

Then there is the terrible production style: extreme close-ups, dizzying jump-cuts, cuts from a nude Playmate to her fully clothed on a bicycle and back again until you want to scream. The crowning absurdity is the Brande Roderick sequence. She rolls about on a bed in a bra and panties while a voice-over reads bad erotic poetry in an English accent, while the video cuts to shots of the poetry and some middle-aged guy in 18th century dress that is supposed to be the poet.

Some of the material is covered quite well, but the rest is incomplete or completely absent.Syngress normally provides quality review materials, but I'd advise choosing an alternate for this exam."},{"rating":"2","title":"Knowledge is Power","review":"Everyone in the Afro American community needs to read this book.It's has helped me cope with the death of my son.It also addresses the slow suicide of drug, alcohol & sex addiction afflicting our most important resource; our youth.A grieving mother."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"This is a great stethoscope and blood pressure cuff. Seemes to be very good quality. I have duchenne muscular dystrophy is hard for my nurse to hear for my blood pressure because of weakening heart and this stethoscope picks up everything. The book pressure cuff is accurate as it was exactly or within a point of my automatic blood pressure cuff. I got this one as a backup.It is in my favorite color of orange although I don't know why they show a blue one. Throws you off after a little bit you see it says orange. I guess they have many other colors, but be careful don't just go by the picture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Genetics and evolution for the science-challenged","review":"If you have ever wished to find a cogent, but easy to understand discussion of genetics, evolution and human history, Nicholas Wade has done a great job in Before the Dawn. A great overview of human history (did we really intermarry with Neanderthals? Were Genghis Khan and his sons really that prolific in spreading their genes?)along with compelling genetic evidence, in dirt-simple terms, gives the reader a real foundation for independent thinking. Woven into the genetics is information on such subjects as polygamy, cannabilism, language evolution, archaeology, paleoanthropology and other subjects you wished you had studied in school."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comprehensive Summary of Human Prehistory","review":"This book is a tremendous overview of the evolution of mankind. It covers archeology, genetics, language evolution, geology and geohistory. If you want a serious review of the current knowledge of where we came from this book is a must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"How the world was populated","review":"A very nice review of how information is gathered. Written records, anthropology, genetic records. Comparison of hominids, chimp v. bonobo society, primitive cultures. evolution of languages. A wonderful survey of how civilizations are assessed after so many years and so little hard information."},{"rating":"1","title":"racist undertones","review":"this tone of the book regarding race is in my opinion, biased. for example he seems to have cherry picked a few genes such as microcephalin that occur in europeans and asians and not africans. This trying to suggest the genetic intellectual inferiority of africans and the superiority of westerners. What a pity that James Watson signed his name on it. If you read between the lines the rest of the book follows the same pattern, trying to find genetic reasons as to why the development of western civilizations. My advice is, be cautious not to take everything at face value with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worrying Lack of Disciplined Writing","review":"It is concerning that the publishers of Nicholas Wade's book (The Penguin Press) could allow this to go to print. Its lack of academic rigor, sloppy research and highly questionable generalisations make this a no go for any serious student. As a lay reader even my limited knowledge forces me to question the value of reading this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Move This To The Top OF Your Reading List. You Owe It To Yourself.","review":"There are many outstanding books this year. This is simply one of a handful that can change your outlook on mankind. It is about your close and distant relatives; it is about your nature. All the latest disciplines in the sciences are pooled together with the latest in research and conjecture. Abounding with facts from the most obsure & miniscule prions, to the whys & consequences of dialect, to the appearance & disappearance of Neanderthals, to the latest in tracing back in the unique DNA of Icelanders & Jews. An A to Z reflection of ourselves/revelation on every page. I can't emphasize enough that this is the latest, hot off the press, deepest reflection of our being, your going to find in print today. As one reviewer put it, \\"The Gold Standard\\". And it is truly gold! Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting History","review":"This is undoubtedly one of my favorite books of the last decade: I've read it twice, recommend it often. All the information in this book is fascinating, but particularly fascinating is the story of the emigration out of Africa and across the face of the earth. If you want drama on a sweeping historical scale, read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book. I really enjoyed it.","review":"There isn't much I can say about the content that hasn't already been covered in the synopsis. I will state, however, that the author has a knack of explaining concepts in layman's terms without losing out on the technical details. I am enjoying this book very much and learning a lot from it. Unfortunately, it is due back at the library and cannot be renewed, so I will try to source a copy for purchase. The subject matter of this book is a bit too heavy to read in one sitting, but it would be good to have on my shelf to read bit by bit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth reading","review":"In this truly fascinating book, Nicholas Wade tells the remarkable story of the human past. I learned a great deal and highly recommend reading it. Even though I didn't always agree with him on various points, the book is very well written and integrates the many aspects of humans' journeys over tens of thousands of years in an enjoyable format."},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally Fascinating","review":"A most amazing book on the subject of evolution bringing together the fields of paleoanthropology, archeaology, primatology, anthropology, linguistics, biology and most impotantly, recent understandings of genetics to paint a logically developed picture of where we have come from and how we got here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ehhh","review":"I had to read this for a school assignment over summer break, then write a 9 page essay on it, and honestly it ruined my summer. I could not get through the book without being confused or bored by unnecessary information that Wade gave. If you are some kind of scientists I'm sure you will love it, but if you are looking for information on the topic of evolution just google or read a textbook. Wade can also be very subjective and not objective on some topics, which was quite frustrating. I do not think he has the credentials to write the book because he is only a reporter for the New York Times. If you enjoy massive data dumping and unclear answers to questions on evolution then Before the Dawn is the perfect book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"More support to the \\"You're Only a Racehorse\\" hypothesis","review":"More crap from a \\"science\\" journalist supporting the meme that you're only as good as your genes. Sure sounds a lot like the Elizabethan Age: \\"you're only as good as your breeding\\".The rest of the book is basically just fallacious commentary supporting that thinly veiled elitist claim.On positive note, it very well-written (from a stylistic standpoint) and quite a smooth read - kinda like driving a Mercedes you just picked up from an uphosteler in Tijuana - only to find out the seats are stuffed with donkeyshit.Read at your own risk for becoming stupider - I sure feel that way after finishing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book on this subject since Carl Sagan","review":"The best book about our early ancestors I have read since Carl Sagan's Dragons of EdenThe Dragons of Eden: Speculations on the Evolution of Human Intelligenceand Shadows of Forgotten AncestorsShadows of Forgotten Ancestors"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is why you shouldn't trust journalists to do science","review":"Before the Dawn is reasonably well written and certainly makes itself understandable, but it suffers from Wade's rather limited and biased sampling of knowledge on his subject (he seems to be completely unaware of the existence of Namibian rock art for example) and his own personal wacky ideas. It's a classic case of a science journalist trying to write on science, and why they should be approached with extreme caution. Some interesting facts interspersed throughout it, but definitely wouldn't suggest to anyone without enough background to spot where Wade is full of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who we are, where we came from, & how we got here!","review":"This book is an accessible compilation of a huge amount of recently discovered material concerning the genetics of human history and how it squares with archaeology. It also puts to bed the myth that human evolution has stopped and shows how recent social developments may have led to changes in the human genome. This is a book for serious inquirers about human origins and makes the case for evolution in our hominid lineage. This is one of the best books I have read all year and I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought provoking and educational","review":"It's my view that non-fiction books such as this one should first and foremost get you to think, and then also educate you along the way. Before the Dawn certainly did both for me. Some of the thoughts it brought about were unsettling, to be sure, but that's part of the point. If all we ever read is stuff that won't challenge us and our beliefs, then there's no potential for growth.I won't claim any kind of expertise in the subject area. I do feel more educated on the subject now, though. Even without getting in to some of the more controversial elements, it was very interesting to hear of modern genetic developments, such as lactose tolerance, which strongly indicate the continued evolution of our species.Approach this book with an open mind and you will come away better for the experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really impressive","review":"Wade's book is really an impressive review of the new results of the science of human history. It is especially important that social scientists read it, as they have an enormous amount of mistaken notions about the possibility to know anything at all about human history before written documents came around. It has the advantage of avoiding the most controversial material (like what is known about IQ) which would turn some people immediately off. Even now we get reviews hinting at \\"racist undertones\\", which is really unfair. In any case, NYT has a great science journalist!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb review of new insights into our species given by genetics","review":"This book is an excellent review of the extraordinary new insights into the evolution of humans provided by the new understanding and control of DNA. It is very readable and complete and the best book on the subject that I have been able to find. I have this book on MP3 in my car and so far I have heard it 4 times to this facinating book over the past year and never been bored by it. The author has done a wonderful job of reveiwing the literature on the subject and presenting it in a very enjoyable and easy to undersand way. For anyone who is interested in the origins of our species be they scientist or layman I give this book my highest recomendation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nuthin' Like This","review":"You'd be hard-pressed to find the musicianship, versatility, and quality of composition anywhere. Sancious plays moog, piano, guitar, and other keys and percussion all with virtuosity and was only 24 when he did this. The speed, timing, and creativity of sound in his playing are amazing. It's jazz/rock/blues/classical fusion at its best accompanied by an amazing bass player Gerald Carboy and Cobham-esque drummer boom-boom Carter. His first effort 'Forest of Feelings\\" is the most similar of his other albums. I only wish he kept doing more of this stuff rather than playin with everyone else afterwards."},{"rating":"2","title":"A true collectible","review":"David Sancious is an awesome musician. Of the few CD's released by him, this one truly rocks. It's flavored with rock, jazz, and funk. His keyboard wizardry will leave you speechless. For those who may have never heard of him, he is a featured keyboardist on Lenny White's Venusian Summer CD. I would truly like to know: \\"Where is he now\\"????"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Long for Twin Bed","review":"I ordered these for my son's twin bed. They are too long. Twin bed rails should be 75-76 inches long. These are 81 inches long. That is long enough for a queen sized bed! I am now in the process of sending them back and trying to get a refund."},{"rating":"2","title":"Let's set the record straight (or flat, perhaps)","review":"Not necessarily the holy grail of hard rock, but damn fine and solid throughout. Very good songwriting, sense of dynamics and sense of overall heaviness. Not like the over the top metal stuff of recent years. Recommended for fans of midwest heavy rock with a somewhat prog twist ca. 60s-70s ala SRC, Third Power, etc. I prefer the MC5, Stooges, etc., but this is a cool listen nonetheless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very overated album","review":"I will be honest, I was completely looking forward to this disc arriving when I ordered it from Monster records. I had read a lot about it, and am a huge fan of heavy psych rock, especially the obscure stuff from the early to mid 70's. Looking at the cover and reading reviews, I was sure this will be a heavy monster rock winner.Boy was I wrong!! This release is lame. It has some instances where they rock, but overall it is boring, and the songs go nowhere. The vocals are incredibly lacking of power, and the heavyness for the most part just is not there. This is the only cd that I have from this time period and this style that I have since sold. Don't believe the hype on this one!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"agree with reviewer above","review":"i wholeheartidly agree with the above reviewer!..i was looking forward to this as well...but was wholly underimpressed!...i think monster records hype things beyond belief and all that i've gotten has failed to light any fire!..can't hold a candle to similar underground 70's acts like blues creation,night sun,bedemon,buffalo,etc!..pass on this one ERGO!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Visual Tennis","review":"Could have covered the overhead, lob and return of serve, but does a real good job on the basic stokes.

Plus it contains highly processed soy protein isolate which has been linked to cancers (all the studies showing a soy/cancer link involve people who eat a lot of this highly processed food product, rather than natural soy). Seriously NOT \\"all-natural\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works, as advertised, to mitigate tuning issues with a capo!","review":"This capos biggest strength, and it's only weakness, is that it has to be tightened each time you put it on. Get this capo if you're very aware of tuning issues that crop up when using one. With my old capo, which just clamps on at one tightness, my B string invariably gets too tight, bringing it noticeably sharp, even when I'm only capo-ing on the 2nd fret. With the NS, one can tighten it just enough to fret the strings without bringing them out of tune. I proved it to myself using a tuner. If you don't care about tuning to this extent, and you want ease of use, then you're probably better off with one of the other models. Since this is the only capo I know of that solves the tuning issue, and I found it in the process of trying to solve that problem, I give it five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty decent.","review":"my old capo was terrible, so i got this one and i think it works just fine. i like how i can make it really tight, so that it works on the first fret (unlike my previous one). the downsides are that i have to screw it on each time, and i also can't clamp it onto the head."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works great!","review":"These flags work perfectly for use inside a window - car, home, boat, whatever. They are large - 4x6 is a good size and will last for years."},{"rating":"1","title":"A GREAT example of a series that went way past its prime","review":"Seasons 1-5 are the defining seasons of The X-Files. All the episodes that happened after the mostly derivative film show what happens when a TV show goes **way** past its prime.And season 9 is basically, scraping at the bottom of the barrel with the attempt to recreate the show with new characters, the dumbing down of the Scully character and the stupid incorporation of a baby and romance between the Mulder and Scully. The creator of this show, destroyed what made the show unique and innovative and decided to pander to the lowest common denominator of fans , the type who want to see cliches because they're too close minded to accept anything else. Because of this, the show's place in history is tarnished, and I as well as MANY other former fans will NEVER watch anything from the creator of The X-Files again.My only hope is that future TV show creators learn from this and try not to make the same mistakes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easily the worst season of The X-Files.","review":"The ninth season of The X-Files is easily the weakest season of them all, regardless of one's opinion of the eigth season. It became very apparent that the writers had just run out of ideas with the introduction of the \\"Super-Soldier\\" story arc that went absolutely nowehere. On top of this is the \\"William the freak baby\\" story arc that ended with Scully ditching her and Mulder's child in \\"William\\", completing the destruction of her character begun in the eighth season, not to mention the idea that Mulder ditched his child and Scully because his life was in danger. How many times has Mulder gotten his butt kicked in the past, without chickening out? On top of the mythology going down the toilet, the \\"monster of the week\\" episodes struggled to tell a coherent story, let alone something as enjoyable as episodes from seasons past. No amount of extras is going to improve the content of this season. Do yourself a favor and buy one of the other X-Files sets."},{"rating":"2","title":"9TH SEASON OF THE X-FILES","review":"BOTH THE 8TH AND 9TH SEASON OF THE X-FILES ARRIVED ON THE SAME DAY AND WERE IN PERFECT CONDITION, THEY ARRIVED WITHIN 5 DAYS SO I AM A VERY HAPPY LADY. THANK YOU."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good ending... but bring on the next movie!","review":"Contrary to some beliefs, the majority of opinions on this final season seem to be that it's actually good: not the best season, but definitely overbashed by the (apparently really vocal)naysayers.Having finally watched all of Season 9's episodes on this DVD set for the first time since they aired in 2002, I have to agree with the majority opinion. Without giving away any spoilers, I thought the ending did a good job of both tying together the previous mythology story-arcs, and finish fleshing out the character development of Mulder and Scully. That being said, it wasn't so great an ending that I don't want them to continue the story in a hopefully not too distant feature film :)As for the Slimpack DVD set, the only thing you're missing is some featurettes from the original set. You still get the episode commentaries (including one for the final episode) which probably are more interesting anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid and Fun!!!","review":"The acting in these episodes is beautiful. Doggett is an extremely strong character and since the series had to go for a while without Mulder, Chris Carter did an admirable job. Gillian Anderson is always worth watching as an actor, no argument about it as far as I am concerned. Some eps may be stronger than others but it is the X-Files through and through. Enjoyable. I wish the show had continued with Doggett and Reyes in a spinoff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beyond Shark Bait","review":"Justifying this horrendous season by saying \\"well, its still better than most TV shows out there.\\" is like saying \\"Gee, it doesn't matter that our President is bad, no-one smart ever runs for president anyway.\\" Simply put, this season SUCKS. There is no X-Files without Mulder & Scully, period. Chris Carter jumped his shark sometime in season six. Super soldiers? A jesus/alien baby? Puh-leez, even the cheesiest moments of Buffy are better than this pablum. What a horrible way to end a once-fantastic series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Informative","review":"I enjoyed the movie. I am not usually a fan of Sci-Fi, however this one was different and very informative."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusion Reigns","review":"I asked continually for the full 7 disc version and I kept getting sent the 5 disc version. This caused me great annoyance and finally I got what I wanted by going out on ebay."},{"rating":"2","title":"Take no notice of the negative whining - watch it and enjoy.","review":"I watched this season after having read several negative comments here. While it may not have been the best of all the X-Files seasons, it was a worthy one, with its own ambience and is not to be missed. I wonder whether some of the whingers thought the X-Files was a documentary!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than you think","review":"Everyone hated the last season when it came out because they so wanted Mulder and Scully to return. Yet, when you watch the last season now, years later, they really breathed new life into a show that had lost its edge. The non-conspiracy episodes are MUCH better than they were on the original series."},{"rating":"1","title":"too bad","review":"ok I am a huge x-files fan i love the show, but season nine was by far the worst. This season lost a lot of what had made the show great in the past, and i think that it was because of the writing and because Duchovny was gone(ok so am a girl and i think he's hot but that has very little to do with this). With Duchovny gone for the second season in a row you lost a lot of the emontion that he(Molder) brought to the show we lost his passion to find the truth. so yes i did buy this but only because i love this show to much not to own every season but if you are not like me ( and lets hope you aren't) do not buy this season if you are a fan of the early ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shear stupidity","review":"As I stated at the 5th . season no tv series that I saw ever had a meaningful ending , but Moulder disappeared since the last episode of the 7th season the 2 new characters try hard but really cannot make up for Moulder ,this season is mostly about their accidents ,as Scully only appears in about 40% of the episodes and Moulder twice ? Really weak nonsesnse without any final meaning at all. The very last episode tries to overwiev the complete series but still this season is pee weak stay away from it .In comparision I gave both the 4th .and the 5th . 5 stars . Never could do even close to that here ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Gift","review":"This was a gift for my wife who is a great fan of the show.

Oh well, at least she is happy."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Agonizing decision, but I had to have it.","review":"I agonized many nights on whether to buy this season or not. Needless to say, I had to know what happened to Mulder and Scully. Generally, this season was not as bad as many of the reviews would have you believe. One thing left me wanting, though. Even though the X-Files is rarely about happy endings, I wanted one. I wanted Mulder, Scully and William to finally be together as a family after all they had been though, especially since their own families were decimated over the series. For Scully to give up William felt wrong. Need a movie to fix this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did the writers leave with Mulder?","review":"I own all nine episodes and have been watching them back to back over the last few weeks. I could usually handle four episodes a night, but now that I'm on season 9 it's hard to get thru two. They changed the music to some amped version that's annoying in my mind. The episodes, characters and acting are pretty poor. I don't find it amazing at all that this was the final season after watching season 9. I also find it hard to believe one man leaving the show could have such an effect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the best, but not the worst...","review":"I've been a huge X-Files fan since the shows inception way back in the day - and these were some of the best episodes in the series. The folks that immediately say that this season [...] are usually just David Duchvoney fanatics that weren't truly into the show. Episodes like 4-D, William, Trust No 1, Nothing Important Happened Today, and The Truth were some of the masterpieces of the series. Of course, you also had episodes like Jump The Shark which gave long-time fans a reason to go.Overall, this season was pretty good, even if it didn't have everybody's favorite conspiracy theorist.

That would be fine if a local store stocked it, but it won't be easy. Many manufacturers handle problems a lot better.

A great all in one lens that eliminates dust issues because I never have to change i! One small problem is the \\"zoom creep\\" when the lens if pointed down.

I was very intersted in the first half of the DVD, even though it felt like an ad for Coren's book, but I was truly disgusted with the \\"making of\\" nonsense that followed. We are guided through the process of design and creation of Tolkien-esque characters for the production of....THIS VIDEO. That's all it was. It would have been nice if they had even portrayed the FAKE characters correctly, but thier lawyers were too wise for that. The only reference to the real movie was by a comic-store-guy expecting a jump in bussiness. About 40% of the info is watchable, don't bother with the rest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"This video spends more time showing people designing costumes for an unidentified production of LOTR than time on Tolkien himself. The most ludicrous thing is the portion discussing the paintings of the Brothers Hildebrandt while showing totally unrelated artwork. The people who put this video together should have, at least, identified the artwork while acknowledging that they had no permission to show the actual Hildebrandt paintings. Instead it gives a false impression that the artwork being shown was by the Hildebrandts. Also the dramatic recreations featuring a man who looked nothing like Tolkien were not labeled as recreations and may be misconstrued by people with less knowledge of Tolkien. Almost a total waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I saw this on the web through a vendor I will not name here so as not to offend Amazon.

You can clearly see both of these flaws in the picture of this product.The first is that the cap at the top of the thermometer is made of plastic. It melted in the middle of my candy making when the cap touched the pot. I was stirring the candy with one hand and desperately trying to get hold of a potholder to hold up the thermometer and keep the melted cap out of my candy with the other hand.Second, the clip has a knob on it but the knob is at the top of the clip instead of the bottom, making it nearly impossible to open the clip up to reposition the thermometer in the middle of cooking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly design thermometer","review":"I bought two of these at walmart because it is cheap but both of them are now in the trash can after a few use.

I was extremely careful not to allow the tip to touch the bottom of the pot, so there was no reason for it to crack. The clip is poorly designed and is nearly impossible to open to attach to the side of a pot. Once I finally got the clip open and the thermometer secured to the pot it began to slide upwards (from the force of the clip) until it finally came off entirely. I suppose I could have found a jar grip or something to place between the clip and the pot to prevent slippage, but I shouldn't need to do that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"I was only able to use this thermometer twice. Very cheaply made and poorly designed. There is a hole in the plastic cap which is not noticeable.

It's not going to happen.It's got the sole of a cheap flip flop, true. I can live with that. These are still cheaper than my \\"cheap flip flops.\\" But, what's not being mentioned is that they are cute. I honestly didn't expect much out of shoes at this price, so I'm happy. If they hold together through the summer months I'll be thrilled. They're very similar to shoes I've gotten in Chinatown.Bottom line, I had two women walk up to me in Target telling me how much they loved my shoes and asked where I got them.

I would return them if the postage would not cost as much as the shoes. They do run large, I normally wear a 10 wide, or an 11 medium, so I ordered the extra large. When I have these on, I look like I am playing dress up in my \\"mommie's shoes\\". There is at least an inch or more of the foot bed sticking out at the back of my heel. Also, some of the knots that hold the sequins to the mesh upper, quickly rubbed sore spots on my feet. The shoes are plenty wide, so it was not a matter of them being too tight across, just painful little knots of thread digging into my foot. They are kind of cute, but not well constructed.

I followed The L.A.S.E.R Strategy for Next Generation Applying and got a job in 10 days as an Engineer onboard of Royal Caribbean Cruises.

They are not shipping well, however, as a lot of the crackers in the outside packages arrive broken. As I am not making a presentation with them but just consuming them at home, this isn't a big deal. If they were intended for a public offering, only part of them would qualify.

They are very hard to find in my local supermarkets(the unsalted kind). The only problem that I had was that 1/2 of the snaps in each package were broken. It's very hard to have crackers and cheese with broken crackers. It's hard to find packages of these snaps in the supermarket with all of the snaps intact. They are very delicate. There has to be a better way of packaging these snaps so that they won't get broken in shipping.

I first stumbled across \\"The Garden of Earthly Delights,\\" and from the first moments after putting it on, I knew that here was a group of people that did not just recreate early music, but breathed life into it and presented it with dimension, depth and sensitivity. I am utterly haunted by the harmonies and vocal interpretations on these discs. I consider the track \\"Reis Glorios\\" from \\"Montsegur\\" as simply one of the most moving songs that I have ever heard. Each of these discs simply sparkles; carrying for me a mixture of underlying sadness, joy and the mysterious.

Backstage footage was VERY limited to quick nano second shots between songs. THAT was it! I went to 3 of their Pop Odyssey concerts, so I was hoping for extra things from the guys. They are all so funny, and fun to watch especially when they aren't performing, it would have been way cooler if they would've included a little bit of them either before or after the show, even a measley 10 minutes would have satisfied me! I know Joey's brother tapes almost everything they do, how bout a cut from some of that footage???? I'd buy it!

A much -- vastly -- better recording is available on Hungaroton (HCD 12446-2) with the Hungarian State Orchestra conducted by Janos Ferencsik. It also includes the tone poems Orpheus and Tasso. All three tone poems are recorded in fine, full sonics, with wonderful hall sound, and receive committed, energetic recordings, just about the best I've found over the years. If you are serious about the Liszt tone poems, don't waste your money on this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written book on an excellent subject","review":"Wow...the opportunity was there but I felt this book was poorly written.

His analysis of \\"Blondness\\" is entertaining as well, and the chapter on \\"Human Obsolescence,\\" where he summarizes his observations in convalescent and retirement homes, are only too familiar to readers today given the scandals that have surfaced in this industry in recent years.

This time I took the gear box apart and found that 1/16th inch wear is all that's needed for the drive gear to strip. I am going to give up on this product and find another solution.

It's only other fault is keeping the sprinkler arms attached, they've come off 3 times now.Sorry I can not recommend this product. Can't say I hate because I love the idea.UPDATE:Contacted the manufacturers helpline, they responded almost immediately -they brag about their assistance- and asked that I send them some close-up pictures.

Curious George is the by far the best character and the one that is most engaging."},{"rating":"1","title":"We've come a long, not necessarily good, way./","review":"I wonder how many of the reviewers saw Curious George read on Captain Kangaroo. I did. It is my seminal experience with George, most closely resembling the creature in the books by the Reys. Suffice to say, this is not your Captain's George. Somewhere over the years, George, an animal whose curiosity landed him in one predicament after another and from which the human, his friend the Man in the Yellow Hat, repeatedly extricated him, has metamorphosed into a socially conscious being who has to overcome the random acts of irresponsibility of the human. This movie is a sad travesty of the Curious George penned by H.A. Rey and Margaret Rey.As a final note, my two year old grandson, who loves George, watched all of ten minutes, and then asked to go to the park."},{"rating":"2","title":"My toddler loves this, I hate it.","review":"This movie is a follow-up to the Curious George movie. While we both enjoyed the first movie, i found this second one SO much more annoying. However, my son LOVED it, so I'm still giving it 4 stars since it is primarily for him. I found the human characters so much more irritating and stupid in this movie than I did the previous movie (and yes, I watched them both in the same day, what joy) Still, if you need a way to entertain a toddler for an hour or so, it works. Still, this movie has very little in common with the TV show, though it is much closer than the first one."},{"rating":"2","title":"IT'S GEORGE!!!","review":"I would like to say I LOVE this movie and i probably did the first 10 times i HAD to watch it but now i try to hide the DVD.

What I really loved about the DVD is that I'm trying to teach only spanish to my daughter and this video has the spanish track so it was perfect for me. She has watched this movie so much that the disk is already scratched so I will be ordering a new one soon. It's the perfect little story, she loves George, Kayla and all their \\"travesuras\\" (Mischief) I would definitely recomend this DVD to anyone looking to entertain their little ones.

I have taken it hiking my kidshave played with it and it is still going. As far as the statements thisis a good lens for an armature but not a pro well check out Nikon's sitewere they have pros shoot with all different cameras and lenses and I feela true pro can work with anything handed to them. So in my opinion if youand looking for something to learn with this is a great lens and don't let all theso called pros out there scare you off. You don't have to spend thousandsof dollars to take good pics just believe in yourself and don't give up"},{"rating":"2","title":"well balanced and versatile","review":"I've had this lens for a couple of years, now, and have used it as a walkabout/travel lens on my D-80 for many thousands of pictures. It's not as sharp as the 70-300 VR, and much less sharp and accurate than the 1.8 50 mm. At the same time, it's taken a lot of really good pictures, and has made it down the Grand Canyon on a raft (with a dry bag), and memorialized the trip very well. I keep looking at the new 16-85 VR, but for the money, this is a really good lens. Outdoors, it has excellent sharpness, color rendition, and speed. I've also used it for interiors, where zoom framing is valuable, although it loses a bit in speed and aharpness without flash. Even there, it's way better than point-and-shoot quality.Still thinking about the 16-85.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Value for the price.","review":"So now you've got your Nikon DLSR and you've read the books and seen the videos. Wow your camera does all sorts of things. Three months later you are still taking all kinds of great pictures but you notice that 95% of the time the camera is in Auto mode. Welcome to the real world of photography. And that bag with all that stuff you just had to have ? Yeah, six months later you see that only dorks and noobs carry that crap around. So you only want one lens on your rig and some kind of filter- lens caps are silly too when outside. So which one lens ? Well The Nikon 18-200 would be the way to go, but maybe you don't want to drop $600 on a lens. So the next choice is this lens. At half the price its a great lens to leave on all the time. You won't miss the reach of the 200mm that much. Just be careful when you buy from Amazon shopping. Half the places selling are selling gray market. refurbs, demos , used , etc. You gotta read the fine print.

To the point when I had a one of a kind shot and the unit failed me. NOT GOOD. Today I noticed that the lense aperature is not shutting down. Took the lense off camera and can see a few fingers hanging down. I take very good care of my camera and am distressed - MAD - this is happening. I have had the camera for over 1.5 years. The lense should not fail like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pincushioned images","review":"Here's what Nikon won't tell you (unless you push the customer service agents): This lens distorts the imagery at every focal length--not just the extreme telephoto range. Take a photo of something squarely framed, or, say, the siding on a house, and you will see that the image is pulled towards the center; the top, bottom, and sides bow inwards. This is true for the lens I bought and for ALL others opened in the store. Nikon says that Photoshop can fix these errors, but who wants to \\"fix\\" every portrait? For a lens that costs several hundred dollars--and one that's most frequently packaged with the D80--this is astonishing and, at best, disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Breaks easily","review":"As stated in previous reviews, a small bump to the lens can cause major issues.

I have no idea what they changed but it is no longer something I can use.I wish that when a product is good they would simply leave it alone.

There is a scene where a mentally ill man laughs when someone is lying. To prove this the main character plays an old clip of President Bush, and said mental patient is laughing. Wouldn't a clip of President Obama been more timely? Or is this a jab of some sort that President Bush is a liar and President Obama is not. It would be nice if hollywood could learn how to entertain without inserting their political views. Even if I agreed with it, it is very inappropriate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Drama at its best!","review":"This series was refreshingly unique in its approach to crime solving. Its similar to The Closer with its lighthearted humor and incredible writing yet adds its own unique flair. I agree with the last reviewer that it handles the topic of schizophrenia with respect. It actually shows hope for a dx that they can be humanized and lead a very much needed and successful life as a professor and in this show an FBI specialist. I love learning about some of the psycological aspects to crime solving.

This is a good drama with also some funny parts."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Must Admit I'm Quite Possibly In Love With...","review":"Dr. Daniel Pierce. Eric McCormack has always been able to attract my eyes and ears to him. He puts a quirky cuteness into his characters (See: Will & Grace) and it makes him so lovable that a lot of people are hooked in an instant. Perception is no different. This show is absolutely brilliant and my attention never leaves the tv when its on. The DVD set is going to be a must have for the fans because you always see something different every time you watch. This has to be one of the most interesting, well written shows on TNT. A definite A+! I honestly can't wait to see what happens next. This is a must see for fans of that combination of drama, sarcastic comedy, and FBI that tend to turn out so well. The Bonus? This one has a very adorkable guy who plays a neuroscience professor and happens to have his own mental issues to work out."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD CONCEPT","review":"HAVE KNOWN PEEPS LIKE THIS....SCRUFFY LOOK IS GOOD...NOT ALL IN LIFE IS POLISHED...ALSO GOOD TO SEE IT FROM THE OTHER SIDE....NEEDS TO CONTINUE TO BE A \\"REALISTIC\\" CHARACTER THO...ACTING IS GREAT..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it !!!!!!!","review":"I can't wait until the next season comes out.

First of all it is NOT QUIET. Second, I have a wool rug and end up having some wool hairs all over, it does not pick it up. You have to go over an area at least twice for it to be cleaned. It is very heavy, and I mean VERY. After owning this for three monthes, vacuuming became a nightmare that I try to avoid, and this led to my apartment being filthy. I agree with the person that said that you will end up doing the cleaning manually, I sure did. It is really annoying that I am looking for a new vacuum just three monthes after I bought this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"COWABUNGA THIS IS KLEAN !!","review":"Have older Kenmore canister and was shopping for something withhepa filter and bagless,after first using the Kenmore used the Eureka.Wow it picked up so much more ground in dirt really did a great job with out throwing dust all over the place great machine for the price!

I love it and would recommend it to anybody looking for a vacuum."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Performance","review":"The price is right, but the overall performance is poor. When we fist used the machine it appeared we were getting more dirt than the previous vacuum we had. Additionally there were a lot of carpet fibers in the canister. Be warned if using on olefin carpet (Berber), the brush agitator will burn and melt it. Additionally edge cleaning is very poor, you will need to use the hose to get the edges clean. When using the tools and attachments the hose will collapse and restrict the airflow."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works like a charm","review":"I was amazed by the sheer power of this vacuum cleaner. After I had used my old vacuum cleaner (incidently from Eureka too), the carpet looked clean. And then when I used this one right after the old one, this machine sucked up so much dust and fiber from the carpet. It was simply unbelievable to see how much dirt it was able to suck.It is very easy to clean. Even my 2 year old daughter can clean it. Cleaning the filter, though, is a little messy.I would recommend this to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Buy for your $$$","review":"What are you waiting for? If you are in need of a great vacuum, at an incredible price - you have FOUND what you are looking for! I needed a vacuum to replace my Bissell that gave out on me. I was dreading finding a new vacuum, because I loved my old one so much. . I thought I'd never find one as good. I was so wrong! This is incredible. It picks up everything. The first time through my living room I was amazed at all the stuff it found (and a bit grossed out). I have an 80lb white dog and had just accepted the fact that white hair would be everywhere. Not anymore. This gets everything. . .absolutely everything. Its lightweight, comes with all the attachments you could ever need, bagless and has to be self-propelled because it takes off! There is only one problem with it - I love it so much that now I vacuum everyday!

After moving into my own place and away from my roommates second hand hunk of junk vacuum cleaner, I needed to buy one myself. The first time I used it I could not BELIEVE how much cat hair and dander this sucker managed to pull out of my couch (attachments are EXCELLENT....)and carpets. With three cats in the house we should have gotten this thing a long time ago. It gives you the best sense of satisfaction cleaning out that little canister when you're all done too, even though its only a matter of time before a cat hairs up your couch again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Vacuum on Earth","review":"When I first bought this product it was great but after about a month and half the hose started to clog up on every use. I hate that vacuum because I have to try to find something to unclog that stupid hose before I can even use it. And lord forbid I have had my danes in the house because then I have to stop mid-way through doing the living room and unclog the hose at least twice. I have had to use this thing now for almost a year because I have decided that I would save the money to buy a good vacuum and not blow my money on something that is going to take up room in my trash. Do not waste your money on this vacuum, save your money and get a good one."},{"rating":"1","title":"No pun intended, but this vacuum sucks!","review":"...it's going back today.While the vacuum is very quiet and very powerful, the hose makes it unusable.This hose is a very soft plastic, almost rubber-like. As a result it is very flexible - if the machine is off. Once you turn it on, the hose contracts to all of about 1'. It is VERY hard to stretch it when the machine is on.But the reason I'm returning it is the HOSE GETS CLOGGED very easily. In the past three weeks, I've come home FIVE times to a clogged hose...this is being used for carpet cleaning only.I have NEVER had a problem like this with any other cleaner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Amazing!","review":"... I originally had looked at high end Eureka Oxygen canisters, but settled on this one based on price and reputation.I'm glad I went this this one and saved [money]! We have five cats and I didn't realize how much fur was on the floor until I used this vacuum. It is incredible. It picks all the dirt and fur up, the carpeting has never looked better. I used to sneeze after using my old vacuum, but with the HEPA filtration on the Eureka, the dust doesn't get shot out into the air again! The wand and attachments work beautifully.The only drawback is having to clean out the filter after every use because it gets so dirty. Other than that, it's great to have a bagless system, so you don't have to worry about buying bags.If you have [money], and need a vacuum, get this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"unhappy with customer service and quality of vacuum","review":"When I received the vacuum cleaner, the box wasn't factory sealed and had no invoice inside. It wasn't factory wrapped and I feel it was a return that was reshipped to me. Unhappy with customer service, not friendly and supervisor that was supposed to call back in 1-2 days didn't call back. Had to look on the internet for a number to call. When someone contacted me she was unfriendly.The vacuum itself is too heavy for stairs and has nothing to hold on to going up the stairs and is plastic and cheaply made.I received it today and I'm sending it back tomorrow."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY THIS VACUUM","review":"I recieved this vacuum as a birthday gift from my mother. I picked it out because of all the good reviews. This vacuum worked really well for the first month, but then the belt started to burn. I was concerned and called Eureka and they guided me to my local service center. I took it there and they replaced my belt even though the belt wasn't broken and charged me $13. The problem continued and even got worse. Now the belt won't stay on at all. This is the worst vacuum I have ever used, and no customer service from Eureka."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great while it lasted","review":"I liked the convenience of this lightweight machine and the easy to use attachments.

I bought this vacuum cleaner in October 2003. I loved it for a while. It picked up wonderfully. I loved seeing how much dirt got sucked into the clear canister!However. Two months ago the ball bearings froze up and melted the beater bar. We bought a used Eureka cleaner as a temporary vacuum while we waited for the parts to come in. The same thing happened with that Eureka! My husband fixed the old one with the parts that came in, and then it happened again. I think this must be a defect with Eureka vacuum cleaners.The best part about coming back and writing this online review for me is seeing that I didn't pay very much for the vacuum cleaner. :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"inexpensive, works well, what are you waiting for?","review":"Why would anyone want to waste time writing a review to endorse some muliti million dollar company? \\"Well, to help others get an unbiased opinion on a particular product so they dont end up wasting their money\\", i say to myself.

I got one for my girlfriend and i when we lived together. She loved it. We split up and as a consulation prize i let her keep the vacuum.I got one for my grandmother and she immediately loved it.

When I finish vacuuming my floors are they supposed to look worse than they did when I started? With this vacuum they do. It can barely pick up sock lint. And anything it does pick up it just spits back out. It's the worst piece of s*** vacuum I've every owned. When we first got it home it worked great but after that first time it just completely let us down. I don't know about most people but $90 is a lot of money to spend for me and this was just a waste.

Better go see one before you order. I don't understand how it gets such high ratings. Mine is going back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really Disappointing","review":"This vacuum worked great maybe the first five times I used it, then it kept plugging up.

I mostly switched because of the bagless and Hepa features and because I have a cat who sheds quite a bit in the Summer.Most of the reviews I read about this product said this vacuum was the best for pulling up pet hair than most others out there. I was sold!I was so excited to receive my new vac, but was quickly disappointed. The vacuum worked like a charm the first two times and that's it. The vacuum now has a high pitch whistle and DOES NOT pick the cat hair up! Thankfully, the vacuum comes with a brush attachment which I connected to the hose and that FINALLY picked up the cat hair! But who enjoys vacuuming on their hands and knees??!!!I would not recommend this vacuum to anyone with pets and am replacing the Eureka with one that will work.My next vacuum will be a Hoover or Dirt Devil -- tried and true, they WORK!I hope this review helps someone! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product!","review":"Since I have three cats, I was looking for a vacuum that would adequately pick up the hair from the carpeting.

This is the first vacuum cleaner I have bought that does not come with an upholstery nozzle or an extension wand. The only attachments are a dust brush and a crevice tool nested inside the permanent wand. The parts and service reps at Eureka confirmed that there are no other attachments made that will fit this vacuum cleaner, so I cannot order the needed upholstery nozzle or extenstion wand.

I'm still disappointed that it failed to live up to the hype but this movie DVD does have some redeeming qualities, especially if you start it at the beginning and watch it all the way through as if you were at a drive in theater. I didn't do that the first time, I just watched the two featured movies and skipped the \\"extras\\". The trailers from other Doris Wishman movies were very good and I plan to buy some of them when they finally come out on DVD.

They played like a couple of features from somebody's film class with minimal plot, minimal acting, minimal nudity, minimal atmosphere, well, you get the idea. I don't get the hype at all.

If you had lost your partner that way--really watched him die, tried to save him and failed--would your responses and those around you be nothing but canned bromides? In real life, when people say the dumb things they know they shouldn't, what you say when you can't think of what to say or do, they say those dumb things in different ways because they're different people.

I would recommend this product to anybody who have alot of hair and body products that they use in the shower."},{"rating":"2","title":"holds a lot of bottles but tricky to keep in place on shower head arm","review":"bought this to replace an old & small shower caddy. the setup is great-we use one bucket for shampoos, then one is hers for washes & towel and one for him for soap & towel.the buckets have suction cups on the back to hold it to the wall, but our shower had a tile grout line straight down from teh shower head so applying the suction cups doesn't work so well (we can offset the buckets but then the caddy hangs askew and not straight down).also keeping the caddy hooked to the shower head arm can be tricky if your shower head arm slopes down. we solved it by tying a piece of wire or string around the 2 hooks and shower head arm. no slippage now.this would be great for anyone, espeically for bathrooms with muliple users/large family because of the storage space.another option is to hang the caddy on the shower curtain rod if it doesn't work on your shower head arm."},{"rating":"2","title":"good for college","review":"Bought it for my daughter to use at college i her dorm.

I love this one - it's great for draining water, the plastic doesn't rust, and things don't fall down or out of it. Only complaint is the hooks don't fit over my shower doors (I have the two sliding doors style) - it's not thick enough. All I did was install a small bar on the wall over the stall on the back wall - perfect. As you can see from the picture, you CAN use the hooks to hang on the shower head but I was really looking for something that wouldn't put weight on the shower head."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overpriced & holds only few items","review":"I paid $16.98 for this Umbra shower caddy. I believe you can get something similar if not a little bigger and cheaper elsewhere (ie: Ross, Marshalls, Burlington Coat Factory). I wanted something that I can place either in shower or on a door hook... for now it is place in the latter. This is what it holds for me: Top basket -3 washcloths, travel size baby wipes; Middle rack -Comet cleaner & Lysol spray; Bottom rack -a handful of plastic grocery bags that I use as trash bags. I don't plan to return this though, not worth the trouble."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap product","review":"I bought this and put it up in my shower. the chain snapped the next day.It looks nice online and in person, but the material is just not sturdy enough to hold even a generous amount of products."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"This item arrived in just a few days, in spite of what it says on the Amazon site about shipping in a week (and then once I ordered on about February 14, a notice that said it would arrive between Feb 24 and March 1).

My sons shower wouldn't hold anything, everything slid off and I didn't want to put a corner organizer pole thing in there. So I went with this. Let me just say, if you're using with a shower doo this item would be perfect. With a shower curtain, however, this item sticks out & creates a big bulge when your curtain is closed or open rather. When you walk into your bathroom all you see is this huge bulge in your shower curtain, if you use to it's fullest potential. Meaning I had big, heavy bottles of shampoo inside of this organizer. I'm picky so this didn't cut it for me. If you purchase this with the use of a shower curtain you will see what I am referring to. If you're as picky as some about the way their house looks, you won't like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing and simple!","review":"There are three of us women in the family so we each have an \\"assigned\\" basket - not that that stops us from \\"borrowing\\" items from the other baskets but it organizes our shower space very well.

I am a male who is a person of color. I resent the dispelling of my viewpoint because it disagrees with that of other reviewers, particularly on the grounds of some putative inherent gender/race difference.Schulman's fan appear to share a weakness with Schulman (at least the Schulman who wrote Stagestruck) -- the predilection to assert supposed truths without developing the given thought further.

Ms. Schulman is obviousley trying to make anyone that has seen the show and liked it ashamed of themselves. I found this book to be one long whinning rant. Why is it that everything has to be made into an \\"issue\\"? It is clear to me that the only that Ms. Schulman will bash ANY piece of work on the gay/lesbian culture except hers or other gay people, maybe not even them. While their may have been some similarities between 'People in Trouble' and RENT, they are obviousley not the same work. And incase Ms. Schulman doesn't realize, she is not the first to write about the gay culture and AIDS, nor will she be the last.

RENT was and is an amazing show that not only won the hearts of millions but was an inspiration to many, including myself. Like her book is the only work of art out there that has a story about people living in NYC and having the same hardships as the RENT characters! Wake up people!

It has 10 songs and is about 55 minutes. Most of the songs are around 4 to 5 minutes, except the first and last track that are 9 minutes each. The sound quality is OK but not great. It has that head banger live quaility to it. There is only a little audience clapping at the beginning and end of each track.Nazareth is a heavy metal band from Scotland. They had a couple of hit songs when heavy metal was big in the seventies, but they never really made it big. They always did a very nice version of Morning Dew.This album doesn't really contain any hits. I found the playing to be mediocre. There are a couple of ballads that are nice (every heavy album has to have one or two ballads). But the only track I really liked was Morning Dew.To calibrate, I am not a huge heavy metal fan. The hardest I get is Deep Purple or Led Zeppelin. So, someone with a better appreciation for the heavy metal art form may like this better than I do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best GREEN TEA ever!","review":"This is my favorite green tea ever.I've tried it once, and I'm hooked since then.I've tried a few other brand as well, but this is far the best in my opinion.I bought this Ahmad green tea at Tjmaxx, but they don't carry this item all the time.

Bravo, he did not sugar coat the prison or the prisoners, he merely did not mention the brutality or depravity.It was intriguing reading about the lack of clues and the little ity bity clues that finally started showing up.

So dont be surprised if yours stops working days or a season or two after you buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outdoor Heated Kitty Pad w/Fleece Cover","review":"I purchased this heated pad, along with heated bowl, for 1 of 4 feral cats I care for. The others will come inside, when necessary. 1 won't. This pad is in a doghouse. It's heated enough that, with the cat's body heat and it's heat, he stays toasty warm on very cold days. When he lets me pet him, after he's been on the mat, he's warm. I recommend this purchase. Some sort of shelter is recommended, as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Stray/Feral Kitties LOVE this!","review":"I have taken care of 2 stray/feral kitties for several years and bought one of these. I came back here tonight, to buy a second one, because the two kitties don't REALLY want to share the nice, warm bed to sleep on! I have them under my elevated deck and they are perfectly happy to lie there on colder nights. I am SO happy to have these, because I rest easier, knowing they have a tiny bit more comfort given to them, with these warming pads. The lambswool coverings are comfortable for them and I have few extra ones, in case it rains.Thanks for making these available!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kitty Pad","review":"A stray cat adopted us after surviving last winter outside and on her own. She would never alllow us to get within 100 yards, until one day decided we were \\"OK\\". What a sweet animal. But a cat and inside the house is not an option, so we got this pad and placed it inside a wooden cat carrier in the garage. She loves being on this pad, and now we know where to find her. We have many coyotes so keeping her wandering to a minimum was a good thing. Great idea, great product so far - had it about 3 months now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heated Kitty Pad","review":"When I ordered this product, I THOUGHT it would be a flexible pad that I could put down in my cat's bed. Instead, it was a HARD piece of plastic that didn't work at all, so I returned it. I will say there was no problem with the return, which I appreciated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Our cats love it","review":"Our two cats like to go outside even in the winter in Michigan (although they usually only stay out for a few minutes), and they love this. We actually bought two of these heated pads for our covered porch. One we put on the edge of the porch where the cats usually sit to look out in the yard, and one we put inside a SmartyKat Hammock House. It fits perfectly inside, and the cord for the pad fits conveniently through the zipper opening on the hammock house. The cats took to both pads right away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for feral or outdoor cat","review":"I placed this Extreme Weather Kitty Pad with Fleece Cover inside of a 4 x 4 wire enclosure, utilizing a proper outdoor extension cord. The pad is resting on several inches of straw, and the wire enclosure has been blanketed heavily on the outside. The little black feral cat with the most gorgeous green eyes spends each night in cozy comfort! When the weather is icky he stays in there all day! The way the pad is constructed it is perfectly safe. I highly recommend it be placed in some enclosure to eliminate wind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unit works wonderful","review":"We were replacing an older model from about 15 years ago. The new one works just as well for our outside cat, but the manufacturer made the fleece cover much smaller than the older model. The cover barely fits over the warming unit. It's great thought for keeping an outside pet warm in the extremely harsh winter nights."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what we needed !","review":"This is a great product for feral cats.It stays cool until they lay on it then warms up. My cats loves it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than expected","review":"I set up a plastic, weatherproof cat house outside for a feral cat that I didn't want in my house in December 2012. The cat used the cat house a little but the temps dropped down to 20 degrees here in Kentucky. I researched, bought and installed the Kitty heating pad in the floor of the cat house as I felt sorry for that poor cat. I placed a folded towel over the pad to give kitty a little cushion on the hard pad as the included fleece cover is very thin. Since then, kitty has used the pad every day in January, during which time the temps dropped down to 10 degrees twice. The heating pad is great so far. I wish the 5.5' cord was longer as I had to use an extension cord. Hopefully, this pad will last for several years."},{"rating":"1","title":"It broke after a week!","review":"I put this outside for my cat when she ran off before bedtime, when I came back in the morning, it was broken. Sitting in the same place, hadn't been touched- heat just stopped working. Pretty disappointed, but I haven't had any issues in returning it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cookie LOVES it!","review":"She is 8 years old and loves to be outside - we should have bought this years ago! The cover that comes with it is ok - thin and not great quality but it serves the purpose. I keep this plugged in all the time and it never feels overheated. Cannot go in a cat bed as it does not flex/bend. I actually have it sitting on top of a one-story cat condo. Overall, very worth the money and Cookie just loves it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what it looks like on computer screen","review":"This kitty pad with fleece cover looked nothing like the picture that was on the computer screen. It is very small for the price and if you have a large outdoor cat then forget it. It is barely big enough for a medium sized cat. Also, the cord on it isn't very long. I would not buy another one unless I bought it in person and was able to see the item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so Impressed","review":"Well, I read a few reviews and gotta admit that I was sold based on the manufacturers words rather than the folks who bought the product. Sure it warms up (and \\"warm\\" is really being generous) but it just doesn't stay warm, especially for outside use. My inside cat sat on it once (after I put pressure on the unit to get it to warm up) and my cat (who is super arthritic and loves heat) jumped right off. It just wasn't warm. I bought two extra pads for the ferals I take care of outside but we'll see. The cord is a good construction and nice and long. The pad cover is a good design, easy to remove/clean and soft. But, it's the actual function of the pad that sold me and it just doesn't deliver. The ferals may prefer their straw than the boxes with the pads. Will keep you posted but for the amount of money, I wouldn't buy this product again. I recommend you save your money and try something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kitty does,t like it","review":"I bought one of these for each of my two cats. They are really nice, soft and warm when touched. But neither of the cats will lay on them. They won't even get on it when I put catnip on it. I guess they're just set in their ways. Maybe when it gets colder. We'll see. Will update.Update: 12/21/12. Kittys finally decided it was OK to get on the pads and they like it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped working =(","review":"I bought this for my outdoor cat to keep her warm at night. It was placed in a cat house with minimal exposure to outside. The first night I used it, it worked very well and the cat slept on it. I plugged it in on the next cold night and it would not heat up...I may just have a defective product (as this product has many great reviews) but I was very disappointed. I am now looking at another brand heating pad for my cat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh","review":"It's hard as a rock even with the included pad. The surface is uneven and jagged.

Then they stopped using it. We thought nothing of it until we went to wash the fleece pad. The entire heavy plastic base had gotten SO HOT that it distorted and curled up! No extension cords were used and it was plugged directly to a 120V 15amp outlet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only lasted three months","review":"This was great for 3 months.

I plugged them in to test them and noticed after they started heating up that they made a low buzzing/humming sound. I called K&H, and they said this is normal and doesn't hurt anything.

If the author would have paid more attention to editing his book, the product may deliver adequate results. Due to a great number of mathematical errors, poor editing, and a lack of thoroughness, I spent countless hours trying to figure out why my answers often conflicted with the author's. After being frustrated too many times, I disposed of the book and purchased a different book. This book has been edited on a Friday afternoon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many errors and mistakes","review":"I agree with Benoit Launier; this book simply has too many errors and mistakes it makes it more difficult to learn Precalculus.

In the interest of full disclosure, I used the first edition from a library and it's possible a new and better version has been published.That said, I do not recommend this book. The author should be commended, but the editors fired. While an otherwise quite enjoyable (if basic) text, I couldn't believe how baltant the mistakes were. It's as though no one bothered to read through the final draft before sending it off.This is all too bad because the author actually did a fine job of presenting the material. If the errors were corrected, I'd recommend this as a great introduction (though a proper text is necessary for true mastery of the subject). As it is now, though, find something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrendous - inexcusable errors","review":"This book definitely has way too many errors - I pulled my hair out on a number of problems trying to make my answers work with what the book had.

It is tolerable for brushing bbq sauce on meat. Other than that, it is far too flippity floppity to do much of anything else. There is no way I could use it to grease or butter a pan, for example.On the plus side, it is nice to have such a well-made and soft brush that is reserved only for my pie crust coatings. :-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"glue smell","review":"The box smelled strongly of industrial strength glue when I opened it; I thought the smell must be from the warehouse it was shipped from. I took the brush out of the packaging and placed it in the dishwasher.

I washed the interior section and bristles and tried using it, and it does a poor job of holding butter and spreading it evenly. Plus, the idea that any of the residual glue might be getting into the food was too much. So I threw it out after using it once."},{"rating":"1","title":"TrippLite Touch Master Plus","review":"The unit functions fine but is not the quality I would expect from TrippLite. The case and switches are cheaply made. The outlets are too close together to plug in anything other than a standard cord. (Transformers from various computer devices either have to be plugged into extention cords or block more than one outlet. Since many computer peripherals use transformers this seems like an obvious improvement that could be made to the unit.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tripp Lite MT6PLUS ISPPar Suge Protector/Suppressor","review":"Our OTHER Tripp Lite Surge Protector/Suppressor finally died after over 20 years, and where we live we have 'dirty' power.

After the second day of use, the master switch on the two would not stay in the ON position when pushed in. Kept needing to do it numerous times till they finally stayed in for the protectors to stay on. Lucky for me, the wall switch controls the outlets to which these 2 are plugged into so I have to resort to that to turn them on and off. I did not want to return them for exchange or refund because I have no other monitor protectors and no one else seems to make them like in the old days. As long as I can use the light switch to control these protectors, that is the way it has to be. Hopefully no one else will have or does have the same problem as me. I do not blame Amazon for the defect - it is due to poor workmanship from Tripp."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surge Suppressor","review":"I've always used surge suppression and have never had a computer failure of any kind.

I never get the same temperature twice, it's always different from what another reliable temperature says, it's uncomfortable in the ear canal (I tried it on myself, my husband and our child), and putting the probe covers on is awkward when you're trying to watch a little one. I changed the batteries and it worked normal (giving accurate readings for a change) for about 1 day.

However... our pediatricians office requires that we take the temperature rectally before bring baby into the office. So, we started doing this with the $10 digital thermometer that we received in the hospital. It is so easy to take the temperature rectally once you learn how to do it. And, you have 100% assurance that you are capturing baby's real body temperature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I received this thermometer as a shower gift and was so excited because I had always heard how easy the ear thermometers were.

Now, it doesn't give a temperature any higher than 89 degrees! I have even tried it on myself thinking that maybe her ears were just too small, but I still had the same problems.

I've had it for a while now and have not used it much. My husband thought I was over-reacting when I insisted that our 21 month old felt hotter than what this digital read out was giving us. The home readout, taken 20 minutes before going to the doctor, registered 3 degrees lower than actual (home reading said 100, doctor said 103). I even took it two times in both ears to make sure I was getting a clear reading. That is distressing.

Now, it doesn't give a temperature any higher than 89 degrees! I have even tried it on myself thinking that maybe her ears were just too small, but I still had the same problems.

First, I have to say that there has to be a double standard if this movie almost got an NC-17 rating compared to most of the other trash out there. Second, being neither female, 18, nor extremely wealthy, I found it hard to connect with this movie. It is a fairly standard teenage sex comedy, which is sunk by its setting in upper class New York and its snotty insider attitude. It lost me with the line, \\"How do you know she's a lesbian?\\" \\"She went to Brearley\\", which is a joke which can only be appreciated by a group of people who grew up within a 20 block radius of each other on the Upper East Side. This would have been a cute movie if it had taken more of a middle American attitude."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie for girls.

I was pleasantly surprised to find that it works with Vista, both the 32 and 64-bit versions. To get it to work best, you need to download the latest drivers from Hauppauge's website. The only minor complaint that I have would be that some channels don't come in as well on the WinTV as they do on an actual television but the image is still viewable. Vista 64-bit users need to be aware that the WinTV2000 software does not work with 64-bit Windows, instead you will need to use the Media Center built into Windows to watch TV."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rotten customer support","review":"The included software is functional, but it is clunky.

This seemed like a natural step up for recording capability and USB2 speed. When it works, it works well. However the \\"power on\\" light almost never works whether the power is on or not. More annoyingly, the product is almost never recognized on Windows XP start up. If you try to turn it on, you get a \\"board not installed\\" type error. Then you have to either unplug the power or the usb cable to get Windows to recognize it - everytime you want to use it. Other reviews I have read make the same comments.

The author seems unaware of many developments in the behavioral, economic and social sciences during the last thirty years, and attempts overcome these shortcomings by declaring his \\"new\\" managerial strategies by declaring them to be \\"postmodern.\\" It would be interesting to know what Wallace makes of the post-internet economic collapse that he believed would make us all happy, well paid laborers.

It brings her joy and that's good enough for me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good choice.","review":"To the contrary of one of the other ratings, I think if you are new to opera, this is NOT the CD I would recommend as an introduction. While it DOES have many of the very well known, it is, in my opinion, very poor quality, done by people with hardly any feeling for the music. They are good singers, but that's all they are doing. Hearing someone sing words is much different than hearing someone accomplished sing the soul of the story. All in all, a very boring, poorly done CD. I guess you get what you pay for though. I just recived mine yesterday, and will probably return it. If you are new to opera, I would suggest Pavarotti. The 2 star rating is because the orchistra was good."},{"rating":"2","title":"First in a series","review":"My mother was looking for this book so she could begin the series in order.

From the picture it looked like a food grinder I used with my daughter in the late 70s, and I wanted to get one for my grandson.

The indigenous people, basically outcasts, move about in nomadic tribes, while the humans live in relatively primitive cities governed by a warlord who wants dominion over the whole planet.

Lucas in his interview on the DVD was asked why he used the FORCE as a spiritual source of power and why there was a dark side of it. Lucas said he wanted to reach as wide an audience as possible regarding good and evil and heroes and villains, but if he used God in the equation he would narrow his audience. Lucas wanted to use God and believes he has a personality--without such a belief there would be no good and evil just a compassion less and unforgiving mankind.The retelling and insights of myths Campbell explains are wonderful. However, the foundation upon which all this stands is Campbell's theological belief system in the divine. This foundation is flawed.

You didn't like it because it's brown and your kids will think it's too healthy? You don't like it so you throw out all 6 loaves? It's scary to me that children won't eat something because it's not white or artificially colored. It's also scary to me that an adult would throw away perfectly good food.I digress.I have been vegan for many years, and gluten-free for... well, long enough to find myself eyeballing freshly baked bread in the grocery store and feeling a hopeless longing for the good old days. The gluten-free baked goods options are slim to none for a vegan, even at Whole Foods. Alas, eggs. This is one of two brands that I can find locally that does not contain eggs. It's the better of the two.It's light and slightly spongy.

They love it toasted and for grilled sandwiches -- their strong preference is to toast the bread, but when the package is first opened, they do love to spread it with butter and eat it plain. The shelf-stability of the bread is a huge plus -- no need to freeze it to keep it fresh. Though I don't have celiac disease, I've tasted this bread toasted and it comes the closest of any gluten-free bread I've had to the texture and flavor of wheat bread."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!!","review":"I have two kids with celiac.

This is the best bread I've found, and Amazon has by far the best price I've found on it, through Subscribe and Save. The loaf is small, so 2 pieces are about the equivalent of one slice of regular wheat bread. The taste isn't great to someone like me who is used to wheat bread, but my toddlers don't mind. (Though ironically, my non-allergic toddler likes this bread much better than the allergic one does! Oh well.)

I will say that her ability to give the reader a unique slice of reality with each character and situation, makes for a great reading experience.

The first problem was the batteries only lasted 6 months. Now it has developed a problem where it keeps reseting (may be batery contacts became loose) so I have to set up the ID between the transmitter and the head unit. It is a PITA to do that everytime. Last few days it got even worst, now everytime I go over a pot hole or bump it resets. So I've stopped using it. I'll contact Cateye to see if they offer a service to repair or replace it. IEven if I did not have this reset issue I'd say stay away from this, it is very tedious to use, for example to reset the counters I have to press 3 buttons all at once and when you are wearing gloves you can for get it. Even when I am not wearing gloves it is not easy to reset the counters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cateye nailed it with this Double Wireless device!!","review":"I was hesitant at first to pay more that $40 for a bike computer but it had everything I needed; speed, cadence, distance, etc...etc... all in a completely wireless unit.

It feels and looks much cleaner now.It works like a charm, with a very interactive display and you can have some choice in what is displayed where on the unit. There are a lot of features so it is going to take you a few minutes to get it all set up and mounted, and it took me about three rides to really figure out how to navigate all the different menus, but I think that is half the fun...playing with your new toys!Overall, I love this thing! Not a single complaint...and I highly recommend this to any semi-serious riders and triathletes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very well-written","review":"Even though this book can be predictable, it's also well-written.

Dick's persistent theme of paranoia and the search for security makes it clear that most of the stories are all reflections of the Cold War but it would be nice to know just where on the timeline they fall.Because of frequent references to Russia as the enemy and the impending fall of atomic weapons alot of the work is dated, but only in the way that some of the great \\"Twilight Zone\\" episodes are dated: you know they are not new but the quality is still there.Most of the stories are real downers, grim tales with frequent ugly twists at the end but there is always a spark of real creativity. This book might not impress you terribly but it should make you want to try one of his novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid collection of PKD's works.","review":"I'm now about 1/2 of the way through all of Phillip K. Dick's works and feel this is a great sampling of his work. You can really see where Total Recall and Minority Report came from. It seems the further I read into the book, the better the stories became. I donated my copy to the library knowing I'll read it again and it will be there for me, and since reselling here just isn't worth the hassle. I suggest if you've not read these, pick up a copy here and do the same when you're finished. PKD should be required reading as it really does make you look at things differently after reading.

It was worth waiting for this one. Changing with the times, Anu introduced more pop influences into her sound, and the rap riffs of her first album are now replaced by dance. But the essentials are the same: spunky funk/pop (now more pop) based on the island/Aboriginal sounds of her Australian Torres Strait Island soul, rich rhythms, subtle arrangements. Some great songs there (Anu co-wrote most of them), and a truly great, silky voice. Exceptionally danceable. A very welcome inclusion of a new version of her 1995 hit \\"Island Home\\" as a bonus track. This is Christine Anu at her best yet. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"didn't work for me...","review":"Lock cover mechanism broke- cover fell off, parts bouncing around inside the cap.

However this one was a bit of a challenge to install. The geometry of my bike made it difficult to install the cadence sensor properly.

After the initial installation, the product worked flawlessly when I tested it around my neighborhood. The next day, I took my bike out on the trails and the computer would only work with cadence and the speed would not be displayed. After going through troubleshooting, the unit worked fine after testing the contacts. Apparently there is an internal break in the wire that would not allow the signal from the sensor to reach the computer when docked. This is my first product from Cateye and I'm not pleased.

I added the strada cadence computer and that added some pleasure. Its a great way to monitor your time spent in the saddle (time/cadence/speed/distance). I have not yet used this outdoors, but its great for indoor training since all the info is received from the rear end of the bike. The only feature missing is average cadence over the entire trip. It only offers instantaneous readings which for me are just fine. Overall, this is very versatile (indoor and outdoor use) and great product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cateye quality sinks to new low . . .","review":"I had a Cateye double wireless with cadence but got tired of replacing 4 batteries every few months so I purchased two of these Cateye Strada wired w/ cadence cyclometers, for two of my bikes. Both have the same problems, any little bump knocks them loose in the cradle. Then they cease working until you look down to notice what has happened and re-seat them. Also, the speed frequently bounces between 19 to 3 or 4 MPH, making me think both speed and distance are compromised. I have a friend who also has one of these with exactly the same problems. Cateye quality used to be great, but sadly seems to be ebbing as time goes by."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful Installation","review":"The unit works fine. However, the installation took forever. No one can install it without an additional (and inconvenient) part. The sensor and the magnet are supposed to be within 3mm of each other. The cadence sensor is supposed to be installed on the outside of the chain stay and the corresponding magnet on the inside of the crank arm. The problem is that the space between the crank arm and the chain arm is at least 1 inch. I had to use duct tape and some fillers to fill the gap to bring the sensor and magnet within the stated range. This is absolutely nonsense and extremely inconvenient. One will expect Cateye will provide everything you need. But this is simply not the case."},{"rating":"1","title":"What?","review":"This was all too complicated for what I needed.

My ride was always one of wondering which button do I access to go to \\"clear\\" time or access odo or clear odo.I eventually returned the computer because when I'd ride at night I put myself in danger off crashing several times as the screen light just wasn't enough to do the job. Finally, decided to try the Sigma brand and it has done everything perfectly..it has an intuitive interface,great light and button sequence. And I no longer feel like an idiot!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware","review":"Received Cateye Cadence Bike computer in mail from 'Buy New for Less /Regifters' and it was missing the pedal magnet and had frayed wires.

After wasting a few zip ties and wiggling the sensor magnet a bit, the speed function started working. Cadence was a different thing. My crank arm, where the cadence magnet is to be fixed is recessed. To get to the 1-3 mm distance, i had to squeeze it very close to the pedal. I am always watching cadence, not speed. But it was literally a touch and go affair. Now after 3 weeks both cadence and speed were gone. The display unit was perfect, easy to read and switch modes. The short circuit technique produced numbers. I checked the wires. To the naked eye it looked OK. But no sensor reading seemed to reach the display unit. I have asked for an replacement to give this product another chance. Amazon's return policy is awesome. Fingers crossed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great cycling computer, short wires.","review":"I have used Cateye cycling computers since their first one came out and have always been very happy.I got this one because I wanted cadence at a low price.I have a hybrid commuter bike with the handlebars adjusted as high as they can go, as I'm 6'2\\", older, and now find it difficult to lean on the bars.I was unable to mount this on my handlebars, as the wires were too short. Unable to mount is on the neck, due to it's design, not the Cateye's mount or wires fault. So, I mounted it on the front of my cross bar. Not ideal, but I am still very happy with it over all.Would recommend to anyone wanting cadence at an affordable price."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent computer","review":"This computer is easy to install, I had no flaws, it is easy to read and very accurate.

My computer arrived without the cadence magnet. So, I returned it with the appropriate explanation. I received a replacement within days. That was great. But, it was missing the cadence magnet too! So, I returned it and requested they make note of this problem so they didn't just ship me a 3rd defective unit. Instead, I received an email informing me that my order was canceled. (So I wouldn't have the same problem.) I felt a bit as though I was being blamed for an obvious error on the manufacturer's part. I wish I'd taken Ms. Gaitin's approach (see her review: she contacted Cateye and they sent her the magnet)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cadence sensor/magnet are too far","review":"When I tried to install the cadence magnet on my Fuji CCR3 road bike, I found that the magnet on the pedal was too far from the sensor no matter where I attach it to. So, I gave a lot of padding to the sensor using a styrofoam. But the cadence sensor fell off somewhere within a mile. Then, I took it to a pro shop to install it. They removed the sensor padding and installed a new magnet using a rubber padding. Again, the sensor fell off within a few miles. I bought this product mainly for cadence feedback. I would never buy this again. Nor, I would recommend this to a friend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Basic Bike Computer with Rear Tire Sensor","review":"I wanted a good basic (inexpensive) Bike Computer with an odometer, clock, speedometer, and most importantly able to function whenever bike is installed on an indoor trainer (which eliminated all front fork/tire computers). The Cateye CC-RD200 does all that (rear tire sensor computers appear to be less popular these days). This is my fourth Cateye product in the past 30 years and have never had a problem with them. Simple to install and use (even the wife is able to navigate the features of this Cateye!). Strongly recommended if you just want a basic bike computer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good while it lasted","review":"This computer was good while it lasted. I bought it in March. At the end of May the main sensor started to shut off sporadically - the speed indicator would go to 0 in the middle of the ride, then would turn back on 20 min later. This became progressively worse and by mid June it died completely. A week ago the cadence sensor bit the dust too. I expected a longer lasting piece of electronics from a Japanese company..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea -- unrealistic tolerances","review":"Excited to get my new Cateye Cycle Computer with the cadence feature. Be forwarned that to have it work the magnets that attach to your frame and spokes need to pass within 3mm of each other or you will not get any reading on the unit. For the life of me I could not find any way to rig them on my bike to get anywhere near that distance. In calling their tech support they agreed this probably will not work on anything other than the narrowest of racing bikes. It would have been great to see that fact illustrated in the product description on Amazon or from Cateye.Back it went to my disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good while it worked","review":"I used this product for about 3 months before it suddenly stopped working. I had it professionally installed at a local bike shop.

The music..in the original movie it had Nicolette Larson's Lotta Love.. In this video its been deleted, and that really pained me, because that was part of the reason I bought this movie.

Also, without a charged battery, the power needed to keep the date and time was not there. Now I have to reset the date and time each time I plug it in just to use it.

Basically when you stretch the earphone apart to put it over your head you're putting stress on the back part of the headphone. It works fine for a while so I'm guessing the 5 star reviews were written within a month after purchase and use.

I think the best feature is being able to unclip it from the bike and bring it inside so I can put my data on my spreadsheet and keep track of it easily.My only two complaints is that the bottom display can be hard to read, especially in mid/low light. This could be because I mounted it on the stem instead of the handlebars. My second complaint is that the light is reminiscent of a digital watch from the 80's.

Problem is, I can't remove it without cutting the nylon ties to remove the brackets. So before I can try it again, I will have to acquire more nylon ties.I am confused as to why the product attaches to the bike with this type of bracket.

The installation was a little challenging for me because the instructions are not clear. The drawings are a little crude and the English translation is awkward.

Set up was very fast and easy. Up and printing from everything (\\"I\\"everything and an old hp notebook ) within a half hour. Tried a few pics and quality is pretty good. It takes the 564 ink which is one of the cheaper inks hp sells at Walmart, that's Kodak, cannon, Epsom included. That and the fact it was on sale for $89 helped make the decision easy. Feels a little cheap and is a little on the loud side, but overall seems to be a pretty good printer for the money. Wish it had a separate tray for photo paper, but its $89.

(And what impacts our culture has had on the items - did you know that chocolate was a drink for monks and aristocrats before it became a snack for children?)But the book is far too short. Many subjects are merely glanced over, and the illustrations, in addition to being so numerous as to be suspected of being filler, are often dark and hard to make out.

I find myself humming the these versions of the traditional songs throughout the season. Although it does have a few secular songs, most of the the tracks are clearly Christian offerings. However, I have given this to friends who are not spiritually active and were thus reluctant to listen to it.

The descriptions of Amanda's mother are frightening but true - she seeks to create the 'perfect well-rounded child' in her daughter and is relentless in this pursuit.Any parent whose dreams include children at an Ivy League school should read this book - and heed Bunting's warnings as to the result of a neurotic ambition."},{"rating":"2","title":"A sensitive and compelling story","review":"In All Loves Excelling, author Josiah Bunting draws upon his experiences as a former headmaster at the Lawrenceville School (near Princeton) to craft a sensitive and compelling story of Amanda, a young female student trying to handle the pressures that beset teenagers today including the fierce competition for admission to leading colleges, the expectations of ambitious parents, the self-promoting agendas of school officials, and the definitions of success prevalent in contemporary society.

Hagstrom's examples of the companies Buffett has been with like: Net Jet, See's, Coca-Cola, Citigroup... teaches young investors Buffett's investment ideaology.

She is very active and likes to get into everything! When we opened up this toy, she played with it for over 30 minutes! She still likes to crawl around the house but then she goes back to the table. I agree with the other reviewers that the legs are short, they could be a bit longer for any growing baby. My daughter especially liked this table over the Leap Frog table because of the lights in the soup bowl. I think there could have been a few more toys on it but overall this is a great toy. My baby doesn't really like toys, she is more into exploring and making messes but this learning table has managed to keep her interest much to my amazement. I highly recommend this toy."},{"rating":"2","title":"If only the legs were longer!","review":"My baby loves the activities on the table top. Unfortunately, mt child is a big boy! At 8 months he is 30\\" and the table is too short. He is forced to hunch over it, and it isn't promoting standing, because he can't stand up straight while hanging on to it! The LeapStart Learning table is at least 2 inches taller, and the right size for my child. So if you have a big baby, be aware that this table might be too short!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING!!!!","review":"This toy is DANGEROUS!!!!!! My daughter got it when she was 10 months old and immediately tried to pull up on it and pulled it over on top of herself. It landed on her face. She loves it so I continue to let her use it while guarding her very closely. She also cut her lip on it during another fall, which I guess really could happen with anything that she pulled herself up on but the base isn't strong enough to keep them from pulling it over on herself. She will continue to use it but only when I am right next to her until she is more stable standing up."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE....READ ALL REVIEWS AND NO ONE MENTIONED THIS....","review":"MY 11 MONTH OLD DAUGHTER WAS DELIGHTED WITH THIS TOY...THEN ALL OF THE SUDDEN I HEARD HER CRYING AND LOOKED OVER FROM THE COMPUTER TO SEE HER HEAD CAUGHT IN THE LEGS...I AM ASSUMING THAT SHE DROPPED THE SPOON (THAT SHOULD BE ATTATCHED!!!)

This table is appropriate for younger babies, since the legs are easily removable and can sit on the floor. For my daughter, she'll spend 20 minutes playing with just this toy. It is the first thing she crawls to during playtime. It has made her standing more stable and she gets ready to walk!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Long lasting toy","review":"I bought this for my son as soon as he started pulling up to stand.

Since then he continues to be intrigued. I like how every object on the table produces a result. My baby can turn, push and rotate every object without assistance from me. The only \\"help\\" needed by an adult is choicing either music or educational words.I also like how this toy can be either a floor toy or table. At first, we used it as a floor toy. Now, it sits on the table legs and my nine month old tries to pull up reaching for this toy."},{"rating":"2","title":"fun but not very learning","review":"This toy is more fun than what is projected to be...ie., educative..but ofcourse all the kids love it for the fun it gives, if not for learning...i bought it for my son when he was 11/2 yrs old and he plays with it even now when he's three...it should have been tagged as fun table rather than learning.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun Music, Bright Colors, Not Sturdy!!","review":"I bought it for my 8 month old daughter.

The one we recieved as a gift, as well as every single unit at Wal-Mart and Target only go up to the letter \\"p\\" and stops. There is at least one other person in the review with the same complaint. We are unable to find a store that carries this toy with a complete alphabet. Buyer be warned!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment, hazardous when legs are installed","review":"My 10-mo-old son showed no particular interest in this \\"table\\". I did not like it much either. Why would a 10-mo-old show any interest in table items that sing? I have left it without legs. Two minutes after I installed the legs my son nearly fell with the \\"table\\" on his face. Had to uninstall them. Not good for active infants. Also not very entertaining. Buy the one from Leapfrog but still be careful when you have installed the legs because they say that that one is higher than this (might have more balance though but I do not know for sure)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun activity table!","review":"This is a really cute and fun toy.

I would definitely recommend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"We LOVE this adorable table!","review":"My daughter got the Laugh and Learn Table for Christmas when she was 9 months old. This by far was her favorite present as she was able to pull herself up and play with all the fun activities the table has to offer while learning to stand up. Her favorite thing to do was to hold on to the soup bowl and walk around and around the table. It was a great way for her to practice walking and at 10 1/2 months old she was able to walk across the room. Now just a few weeks away from her 1st birthday she still plays with the table multiple times a day. We bought her the Laugh and Learn House for her birthday and can't wait to give it to her. The Laugh and Learn line of products is GREAT and I highly reccommend the table!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"So much fun from 10 months on!","review":"Our 15 month old is still playing with this toy daily, and loves all of the music. I'm not sure why the table is so short, because now she has to kneel to play with it, but she just loves it. Great variety of noises so parents don't get sick of hearing the same old thing. It's also not too loud.

It lives up to its title, which is a hard enough act to follow, and takes readers through the splendor and tragedy of T'ang Dynasty China, including the revolt of An Lushan (Rokshan).He has another book out, THE VERMILION BIRD, which deals with Southeast Asia.Schafer strikes me as a sort of literary Marco Polo, opening up a strange new world for the specialist and nonspecialist alike.Five minutes after encountering his book in the NY Public Library (it had been recommended to me by a scholar at Columbia), I knew I was going to have to buy it. It has enriched my cultural life.Susan Shwartz"},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading Title -- All About Animals, Drugs, Foods, etc.","review":"The title to this book is truly misleading. All the book talks about are physical things (as opposed to ideas or thoughts) from Central Asia that were documented to have appeared in Tang China. The author has some interesting findings (on pronunciations and etymology, but the rest of the book is disappointing. Each of the 18 chapters is titled by one physical item (Men, Animals - domestic and wild, Birds, Furs, plants, woods, foods, aromatics, drugs, textiles, pirgments, minerals, jewels, metals, secular objects, sacred objects). The author basically did a search through a database of Tang Chinese writings and noted all the imports that fitted into the 18 categories. Not worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome debut CD!!","review":"This is the CD that leaves you wanting more. For the serious jazz guitar enthusiast, this first CD has all the elements of Roy Ayers, Stanley Clarke, and others from back in the day, but it's Ray's guitar style that keeps the flow upbeat and modern. Reminiscent of Metheny on his licks, and Benson or Jordan on his flavor, Jeff Ray has a rhythm all his own!His rendition of \\"Everybody Loves the Sunshine\\" sounds like a jam session made for a recording. That is my favorite selection on this CD. The artists featured on the CD with Ray definitely round out the songs and make them full and complete. This is one for the car, Ipod, MP3 player -- or an intimate social set. There is definitely something for every jazz ear. Looking forward to more from this artist.

When I hooked the audio outputs into my stereo system, I had to turn the bass all the way up on my stereo amp and the treble all the way down just to have an adequate amount of bass to enjoy hearing music on it. This TV is the quality that I expect to see in a motel room, but not what I am willing to live with for the next decade or two.The worst part is that when you are running the sound through the stereo, the TV volume control only controls the TV, not the sound that you are running through the stereo.

I LOVE IT! After putting it together, I figured I would turn it on just to make sure it worked since my carpets didn't look like they needed to be vacuumed yet. I did a small area rug (5'x8') that looked as if there was nothing on it and the cup was HALF FULL OF DOG HAIR AND FINE DUST/DIRT (and no carpet fibers so it wasn't just beating up the carpet)! I WAS AMAZED. We have 2 short haired dogs, a Boxer and Rottweiler mix. I then vacuumed the stairs with the strong little beater brush attachment and filled the cannister AGAIN just on my stairs! The people who have written these reviews are telling the truth! I can't imagine a better vacuum in the world for 99 bucks, free s/h and no tax! I am going to buy one for my parents for a Christmas present!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks like it cleans... but...","review":"Our Orek died and we needed a vacuum so with limited choices at the store, we went with this model. The dirt collects in the bin and that is great. What concerned me is the dirt that was spitting out the back.

I was a complete Dyson devotee, until it - oh yes - started losing suction!!! (WHAT??!!!) I tried everything - replaced parts, hoses, yadda yadda ya.

(I do, however, have 2 small boys, which at times act like wild animals, but that's neither here nor there.) I finally said \\"ENOUGH\\" and decided to replace my non-sucking Dyson. RUN, don't walk, and buy this Bissell! It is truly amazing - really! For $99 I could buy a new one every year, and still have a better vacuum than the Dyson. I researched Consumer Reports but really the best info came right from Amazon's reviews. A nice bonus was the fact that it is self-propelled (or at least feels that way - maybe I was just used to pushing around that other heavy, yellow, non-sucking pig.) You can't make a mistake with this vacuum. Seriously. Love it, love it, love it. Nuff said."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bissell Momentum 3910","review":"As of this writing, there have been 105 reviews on this product. here is my two cents after shopping for a vacuum; if tilting of the unit is an issue, just be aware of it and use it accordingly; if the rollerbar doesn't stop on the \\"bare floor\\" setting, continue anyway i doubt it will damage your floor unless you have wood from Borneo and it's an exotic wood costing \\"1 million dollars\\" which if it is, you wouldn't be looking at this review. if you complained about changing the dirct cup so often while vacuuming, the vacuum may not be the problem, use it more often or be neater. If you complained about no retractable cord, who cares? All in all, the unit is great for the money. easy to assemble (2 screws and a few snap on pieces).

Also, the HEPA filter is not seated as well as it should be and dust gets out around the edges of it. So please be aware of this problem if you choose to buy this vacuum.

Here's my 2 cents anyway:Pros:- The dirt container is quite large and easy to empty.- The power cord is really long.- Suction is as good as advertised.- Low maintenance. I won't have to spend a ton of money on bags/filters.Cons:- It's quite loud. I was expecting it to be more quiet.- The vacuum can tip over really easily when I use the hose but I guess this is related to the fact that it weights about 20 pounds.Overall, It looks like it's money well spent so far."},{"rating":"1","title":"After 3 month's use, a disappointment","review":"I've owned this vacuum for a year.I have a german shepherd who sheds constantly, a long haired cat, and I live in the country in an area with a lot of fine dusty dirt.I was extremely pleased with its cleaning power initially, but am ultimately very disappointed in it. It tends to clog constantly, spit back dirt on hard floors, and steadily lost suction. I cleaned the filters after each use -- the problem really seems to be one of poor manufacturing quality.After 6 months of weekly use it performed poorly. After 9 months the motor began shrieking like a dyspeptic banshee (it's not the belt). The vacuum finally gave up the ghost and I can buy a new one in good conscience.Not that I think anything else will do much better or last much longer.

We have to wipe it down after every other use because it is covered in dirt, which is strange to me but not that big of a deal. I clean out the filter after every use, along with the canister. This is the first bagless we have owned and for the price and the power we are very satisfied. I would definitely recommend this to anybody who was looking for a low priced powerful vacuum."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tremendous Suction Power","review":"Like nearly everyone else, I was appalled at the dirt and dog hair my Kirby had been leaving behind. This is a powerful vacuum and easy to use. I like having the attachments with me, but could wish for a little bit longer hose attachment and a soft dusting brush.One caveat: The filter light kept telling me a hose was plugged. I practically took the whole thing apart trying to find a plugged hose and none of them were plugged. Finally, I found its real problem was that the drive belt had broken, after about one month's use. I wish I had ordered belts originally because now I am paying for twice the cost of the belts for expedited shipping in hopes it will arrive before my guests get dog-haired this holiday."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work after 1 year","review":"When we first bought this vacuum, it worked great and I was very pleased with it.

The hose is plenty long to reach up half a flight of stairs. The hose and attachments store well on the base unit. I'm really pleased with this item - the only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because it tends to fall over backward fairly easily. As long as you don't pull on the hose to the back when you are vacuuming, it's fine.Also, make sure you empty the cannister before it gets too full. I have 3 dogs and I have accidentally completely clogged this vacuum up more than a few times. Once it is all cleaned out, though, (a process which can take 15 or 20 minutes if I've really overdone it) it works like a charm again.

I knew that the Dyson was a good vacuum, but decided to go with this one - boy am I happy I did. The suction is just amazing - I have never seen a vacuum pick up so much fine dust off of the floor. Also, this is the first vacuum that I have owned that does not throw fine dust into the air. This is because of the HEPA filter. I would recommend this vacuum to anyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good...","review":"This is a pretty good vaccum. The suction is strong, but be careful to leave a clear space around the vaccum while using the hose. I accidently pushed mine next to a quilt that was on my bed and it sucked up and melted the corner. It handles pet hair well, and glides over berber with ease. My favorite part is unlike my old bissell, there is no filter in the canister so I don't have to clean a filter every time I vaccum. So far the only downside I can find is that while using the hose, the vaccum falls over unless propped up against something.

Our last vacuum lasted 15 years with 4 or 5 belt changes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good for the carpet","review":"We were very impressed with the amount of dirt it picked up the first time we used it. We had a stick vacuum before, and was no match for the cleaning power of the 'Momentum'. It still gives a very clean feel; its been about 4 months now. The dirt cup is big enough for my 3 bedroom apartment. Overall it is a great buy for the price.It would have received 5 stars if not for some minor flaws:1. There is no separate switch to turn off the carpet brush. This means that you need to be careful about other cables that can get chewed up by the brush when you are using attachments. This is especially true if you need to do stairs, with the turbo-brush.2. The hose for attachments is smaller than I would have liked.3. I never had much success with cleaning the hard-floors with this vacuum. Maybe my carpet-height adjustment is broken. The hard floor area in my apartment is small, and I clean it separately."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great vacuum","review":"I never realized how awful my old vacuum was until I bought this vacuum cleaner. The first time I used it, it picked up more dust/dirt than I thought was there. It continues to deep clean my carpets. But, time will tell if it continues to do such a great job.Cindy"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well","review":"This vacuum works very well, it is easy to assemble and use. Cleaning it is also very easy. It will clog up with pet hair but once you find the 4-5 places it likes to clog it is very easy to unclog (look behind the filters). It picks up an amazing amount of pet hair compared to any other vacuum I have owned. It also decreases dust and allergens as advertised."},{"rating":"2","title":"This vaccum really sucks","review":"Now my kids love to vaccum; this thing gets so much dirt out of carpet it's not funny. You may not want to vaccum for the first time with this machine when you have guests. They will look at you like you have never vaccumed your floors before. It has a super long cord, a hepa filter, on board attachment, it's bagless, it's under $100 bucks! Two thumbs up."},{"rating":"2","title":"This vacuum rocks","review":"Everyone should have one of these! Only downside is the hose isn't long enough...but still a must have."},{"rating":"2","title":"great vacuum, great price, not too heavy","review":"I bought this for my mother, who is over seventy and not able to get around that easily. She has a cat, and wall-to-wall carpeting, so a vacuum cleaner was a must, but I didn't want her to have to mess with bags, or lug around some leviathan. This machine was perfect. She says her carpets have never been so clean--the thing filled up instantly, about three times in a row when she first started using it. She was surprised b/c the carpets didn't look that dirty! Anyway, this is highly recommended. Great price, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great vacuum for a $100","review":"After reading all the reviews on different vacuums, I came to the conclusion that there really is no \\"perfect\\" vacuum. I went with the Bissell 3910 because it appeared to have the best reviews for a vacuum in this price range.Pros: It was easy to assemble and light weight enough to carry up the stairs. I didn't have any problems detaching the hose from it's base like others have written nor did I mind the 35' cord. Ergonomically, it was was easier on my back and moved effortlessly as if it as self-propelled. If you are tall, you will like the height of this vacuum. The canister was easy to empty. I went from carpet to hardwood floors without any problems.Cons: The hose could be longer. The dial to set the vacuum level seems to vibrate to other settings. Also, the beater brush did not always stop in the bare floor mode which I think it should. Like I said, no vacuum is perfect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy. Not even used","review":"I'm with the other negative reviewers here. This vacuum, uh... sucks. After about 13 months, it got very loud, and stopped picking up dirt altogether shortly thereafter. Have always kept ours clean, filters changed, emptied the collection container after every run through the house and made sure all the suction spots were well clear of any obstructions. Don't waste your time on this. Broke right after the warranty was up. Go figure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless","review":"I purchased this item based on other reviews. When I first bought it I still had three months before I would be able to test it out to make sure I liked it...wrong move, now I cant return it. I have hardwood floors with area rugs, but my two bedrooms have carpet. When I actually got to use it the first time went ok, after that it went down hill. When I use it on my area rugs I can feel the thing spit the dirt right back out the back at my legs and onto my wood floor, which in turn I have to try to vacuum again but usually end up having to sweep the carpet and then my floors again.

The suction power is strong and the bagless container is easy to empty. It's helped control my allergies to the cat we live with."},{"rating":"1","title":"No so great","review":"Have had this vacuum a while and although it is easy to use and the bagless cup makes it easy to empty the dirt it does NOT do a good job. I have to go over places on my carpeting and area rugs numerous times especially if there is a higher pile. I have a long hair cat and it takes many, many runs to pick up the hair. Most of the time it turns the cat hair into balls and I hand pick it up. If you want an average-OK vacuum that is inexpensive then buy this one. If you want to spend a bit more for a better vacuuming experience I would look else where. Bottom line - do your research."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brush Failure","review":"Have been pleased with performance of this vacuum. Works good on pet hair.However, just had SECOND brush failure in 6 months. First failure happned within a week of purchasing. Have now suffered second brush failure. This in addition to a belt failure has made this vacuum a frustrating itme."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"I researched vacuums for several days and finally decided on this model due to the rave reviews. However, I had read several that were concerned about the canister leaking and that the suction was too alomst too strong. I thought that surely those instances were few and far between; however, mine does both. The suction is very powerful, which could be nice, but upon looking in the canister most of it is carptet fibers. It as also started unraveling my carpet where it meets the tile. Yikes! Furthermore, when dumping the canister the dirt gets caught in the top so when pulling it out, it makes a mess. The front of the vacuum stays dirty and constantly needs to be wiped down. This is going back!"},{"rating":"2","title":"AWSOME SUCTION!","review":"This Bissell 3910 Momentum has awsome sucking power. It even sucks up the small area rugs! This is not so great. We have 2 labs and a long hair cat, so we have lots of pet hair. This Bissell does a great job on the hair. We had a different model Bissell prior to this that was a little tired (our vacuums get quite a work out). This thing not only sucked up a ton of hair the first time we used it, but also lots of what appeared to be dust and dirt that evidentally had been down in the carpet. The dirt cup is also quite large. On a whole, we are happy with this model."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good for the price!","review":"This vacuum works quite well, especially for the price. I love that it is bagless (there is a filter than needs occasional replacing). I have seen it cost much more at stores, so compare prices before you buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Correction","review":"Reader Darren supplied incorrect credit for this book.

Though I only really started to notice the results towards the end.I never noticed a \\"bad taste\\" when using these stips, I don't know what everyone else was talking about.The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because the bottom strip is so aggrevating. I used it twice and never bothered w/ it agian (My bottom teeth don't really need whitening though), but if you can get them to work, good for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing results","review":"The Whitestrips didn't work nearly as well as I had hoped. I wasn't expecting glistening white teeth like the models in their commercials, but a noticeable improvement would have been nice.They weren't difficult to apply, but I did not like the way the strips tasted. I ended up trying to hold my tongue out of the way when they were in my mouth (not easy to do for 1/2 hour straight!). I also agree with a number of other reviewers in that there was a lot of waste, especially considering the strips don't cover all my teeth that show.Bottom line was that I bought them to whiten my teeth and if they did that, I could have put up with the bad taste and lack of full coverage. But they didn't. I would not use these again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love 'Em!","review":"I have previously tried dental trays and other over the counter treatments- including the original Whitestrips. Whitestrips Premium in hands down the best product out there. I tend to experiance tooth and gum sensitivity when whitening, but have slim to no pain or discomfort when wearing the Whitestrips Premium- even when I apply one strip right after another.(Limit 2 a day) My husband noticed the whitening after just one day, making me excited for the final result. The conveniance is wonderful, and I wear them while driving or running after the kids, and find no problem in talking while wearing them. The bottom strip isn't as wide as I would like, but I alternate placing them off-center to get the area covered, and has seemed to be effective in whitening. For the price and effectiveness, I don't think there is a better product on the market. It works for me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Is not worth the money!","review":"My teeth were not too far from white to begin with, but there was some yellowing from drinking coffee and red wine. The strips did not stay on very well at all - they felt uncomfortable, loose around teeth and I would try not to swallow so as not to put the chemicals into my body, but then the strips would get puffy with saliva! And also, they really hurt my gums and made my teeth super sensitive. My teeth saw no noticeable difference, and I completed the 7 day regiment. I have found some toothpaste that works extremely well, I saw an improvement in only a couple of days: Rembrandt Intense Stain Removal. It has whitened my teeth a lot, more than I expected really. I'd try the $6 toothpast before the $35 strips if I were you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What's The Point?","review":"Besides the fact that the strips don't stay in place, they don't cover all of the teeth that show in my smile either top or bottom."},{"rating":"1","title":"DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY","review":"First of all, after 7 days (really only 6 cause one set of strips were wasted) there was some white 'spots' on my teeth and if you look closely...they look very strange. Now I need to go and get another product or see a dentist. Second, the strips are awful fit and use. They just dont stay in place. I wasted 2 sets because they fell off and wouldnt go back on. DO NOT FALL FOR THIS PRODUCT. I have already asked Crest for my money back..which is a hassle unto itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"These will make dentists obsolete!","review":"These things are great! I have been using them for almost two years, and I have not had a single cavity, and I have saved hundreds in dentists bills. I only wish they made them in a larger size, because i have fairly large teeth, and in order to cover those \\"fangs\\" or whatever those teeth are (you know what i mean), i have to use the extra white-strip stuff that normally stays on the plastic backing. Also, I agree with the other reviewer to not get the whitening goo on your hands, it will make them white too. Also, you have to be very careful not to swallow these, I almost did once. And these white strips are for people only, pets will not tolerate them, and I don't think there are white strips available for pets."},{"rating":"2","title":"natural looking results","review":"I've been using this product for 4 days and I can see a result already. Not the glow in the dark, frighteningly unnatural white that you often see on people who have had a dental bleaching--you know that silvery white look that doesn't occur in nature. I think the strips have whitened my teeth without making it obvious I've been whitening them. It's how my teeth looked ten years ago, before ten years of coffee and soda buildup. Although I've read reviews that state people have had pain in their gums and teeth, I've not had a bit of trouble with pain. The only real caution is--DON'T SNEEZE. Or if you have to sneeze, keep your mouth firmly closed. When I sneezed, the strips came flying out of my mouth. Also, you really can't talk very well while they're in your mouth, and you feel a bit like you're foaming at the mouth. However, there is very little after taste--and my teeth look cleaner without look other worldly. I would definately recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"OUCH.....but whiter","review":"I must say, using the whitestrips definitely did whiten my teeth. I could see a difference after the first usage, and other people commented, too. The downside to them is the CONSTANT pain in my teeth and gums that I experienced during usage. Seriously---my lower teeth started hurting after the first set of strips, and my gums started hurting after the second. I never thought I had really sensitive teeth--I've never had problems eating ice cream or anything--but these hurt! And the pain wasn't just during the 30minutes of strip-on-the-teeth time: it bothered me around the clock! I would recommend these hesitantly, check out other options first. Like I said, they did work......but be prepared to deal with some pain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes your teeth whiter, but for me they REALLY HURT","review":"I couldn't do it in 7 days. The pain was constant, and distracting. Not everyone will hurt though, but be prepared....I think about a 3rd feel sensitivity, and not everyone feels pain that intensely. It definitely whitened my teeth quite a bit. MUCH better than whitening toothpastes."},{"rating":"1","title":"These do NOT work!","review":"These do NOT whiten teeth. I've tried them and the commercials are deceiving. You will NOT get the results they show on the commercials. I was very disappointed in this product.Save the money from these and go to the dentist and have a professional zoom whitening. There is no way you are going to whiten your teeth at home using these. The peroxide isn't strong enough. The dentist uses over twice the strength of these. I don't care how many packages of these you use, it will not work.Also...The bottom strips are too small to cover your teeth and they float off in your saliva. You're basically ingesting peroxide from them. I don't know how safe that could be, but it's not very promising to me. The dentist will cost more, but it will be what you are really expecting. Save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent achery target","review":"Like the other reviews, while the description states \\"toughenized... with nylon threads\\", the target is basically a plastic sheet.

It is made of a material that feels like flexible plastic. Currently, my son is using it with arrows that have suction cups at the end, so it hasn't been punctured, but I'd imagine with real arrows, this target will not last too long. For that purpose, I don't believe the price is justified. As for being a good target for suction arrows, it is not. The suction rarely holds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easily shreds, no better than paper","review":"Mounted target to a face of 2 stacked straw hay-bales.

It's tall enough to hold a decent amount of water, but my child is still able to step over the side by himself without help. I haven't put water in it yet, so I don't know how it will be to drain it. I think we'll just have to press down on the inflated sides to drain the water onto our lawn. Very pleased with the product so far. Only thing buyers should know is the size is not as listed. The box says it measures 58'' by 13'' and holds 76 gallons of water. For the price, it's a great deal and enough pool for us.

In my opinion, this book was not as great as the first one, but it is great nonetheless.Amber the Untouched and Duncan the Scots Hammer are a memorable couple. And I love how Lowell has Duncan remember bits and pieces but never a whole memory. Something will trigger a memory, but as quickly as it came, it is gone. The only thing I thought that would make the book more, would be if Amber was a little stronger. Though, I can understand why she did many things the way she did.This book also has one of the most memorable scenes from any book I have read.

I purchased this audioversion to listen to, as it was my favorite of the three. I am completely dissappointed, The verbal affect appeared flat, not much, if any, intonnation to differentiate male and female characters. I couldn't get a good feel for the characters or their personalities, not to mention the fact the narrator sounds to young to be reading the book at her home alone, let alone for the public! When purchasing an audiobook that involves Saxons and Scotts, Northern England and Scotland, one would assume they will not hear a contemporary American voice. I couldn't even finish listening. It sounded too absurd. While I know the narrator did her absolute best, unfortunately the person who convinced Lowell to go with a young American voice to represent the voice of the Scots Hammer should have to face him on the battlefield! Someone really wasn't thinking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful - Mystical - Most read","review":"Ms. Lowell has three books in this series - Untamed, Forbidden and Enchantment. All three is a must read for lovers of midieval romance. (Actually romance in general.)

I did not care for the plot which was about a man with amnesia, who falls in love, hates her after he regains his memory, but returns to her in the end. Maybe this plot would be ok if done by another author, but it was not enjoyable the way it was done here. I also found the ending too abrupt. I would have preferred knowing what their life was like after they got together and how the alliances among Dominic, Erik and other warlords worked out. This is the second book I've read by this author. The first book was The Secret Sister which I also did not like. I don't plan to read any more books by this author.

They concentrate on informing you of absolutely everything about everything that could ever conceivably pop up on an English Language exam, while not focusing on what actually appears on the test. Kaplan lead me to believe, through their obsession--yes obsession is the term--with rhetorical devices that the knowledge of them was what the test (in multiple choice and essay) primarily tested. In reality, in this year's AP exam most of the MC questions were standard reading comprehension and only one of three essays even vaguely dealt with rhetorical devices. In short, the book gets an F and was a waste of my time. Anyone who's taken 3-years of quality highschool English can easily get a 5 on this exam without Kaplan and their mis-guidance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never, ever let it cool!","review":"The P.E.

We always washed on cold, with Dreft, on delicate cycle, and air-fluff dried them. That's not many washes, when you consider how quickly babies grow out of clothes. Even with this gentle treatment, they went from soft out of the box to burlap after the first wash. After two washes, the little applique designs were rubbed off. After less than a month of once-weekly use and washing, the snaps were ripping out of the cloth, which felt like crunchy paper. They are choking hazard, so the two ones we have left that are usable are going in the trash instead of being passed on. Absolutely the worst quality baby clothes we received, bar none."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay fabric, horrible tagging!","review":"When I ordered these onesies, I considered the fact that they were made by SpaSilk. I thought perhaps they would be amazingly soft and tagless. Well, they were soft - not amazingly - and they were tagless; however, when I threw his onesies in the wash (on gentle, of course) the printed label on the inside peeled off after they had air dried. Not only that, but after the first was, one of them got a hole in it.I will admit, though, that they did serve their purpose for 2 months.

I bought this book because facility disturbances while part of prison lore often go completely unreported. The book reads more like a statistical data chart than personal accounts of what has happened. It basically flows like a string of Wikipedia articles and although seemingly very detailed I found information missing that correctional staff would be knowledgable enough to know is absent. I could only manage to get about half way through it and I actually gave the book away rather than offer it to another prison guard.

I would enjoy Emerson if his flowery dialogues were to the point. Instead he endlessly adds so much snow to fill fill up a chapter that some of his brilliant thoughts are dulled. In my opinion most of the chapters could have been reduced to a page or two. If you like long conversations with people who endlessly drone on to make their point; if you enjoy long winded discussions, Emerson will entertain you.Dr. Raymond DuRussel"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Dated","review":"This book discusses the cultural, historical, psychological, physiologicial, etc. connotations associated with colors. However, it seems as though most of this material was developed in the 1950's and has not been updated. (It looks like this book is a reprint of older material.) There are some interesting elements but it is likely that much of the psychological and physiological information does not reflect the current state of knowledge in those fields.However the book is easy to read and is a good overview on the topic for those who would like to pursue the interest further.

Lily is now working for the FBI with Rule as a consultant. We also have Cynna a powerful talent, Max a grouchy gnome, a demon, Cullen a striper sorcerer, and assorted other characters. Some humor as when Lily gets on a local cop who is less than helpful. Good characters, good plot, one good brief erotic scene. Just short of being excellent, marred by some typos (cold for could) and editorial inconsistencies. I strongly advise reading this series in order with Tempting Danger first.

Lily is mate-bound with Rule Turner - Werewolf Prince of his Clan and he shadows her everywhere to protect her.

Was it good? Yes. Like book 1, it was difficult to put down. However, It was confusing at times, but I think that was the point. Once you got used to the book being confusing, it wasn't so confusing anymore, if that makes any sense whatsoever. Like I said in my review of book 1, this is NOT a romance series. The romance is in the background of the much larger plot & the events that take place, especially the ones that took place in this book, are a necessary evil to help the relationship between the hero & heroine develop into something much more than the two of them thought possible. After the weirdness in this book, I am very interested to find out where the author will take us in future books... Where do authors come up with some of this stuff, is beyond me..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Series - book 2","review":"I first read this series a few years back, and the books kept coming up on my recommended reading lists, so I picked up a copy of Mortal Danger and Tempting Danger to re-read Lucy's story.

Both are awsome, but nothing compares to the 1979 WURMS. The guy that says this was an off night for them should really watch the 1999 show where they're as bland as ever. I mean this DVD is like watching Muhammad Ali in 1974. 1999 House of Blues is like watching Muhammad Ali try to fight today. No matter what anyone says the first 5 minutes of Philadelphia 1979 is better then all of Keys to Acension put together. How can anyone say that bland, lifeless performace is better than this. That's like saying you would rather have $100 in your bank account instead of $1,000,000. Maybe the quality of that DVD is better, but the playing, musicanship, instrumentation is crap compared to Philadelphia 1979. This was created from what was left of an 8mm movie.

Why not release that concert from the Union tour that they kept showing clips from on the YesYears video? They could have picked a better concert than this 1979 to release. What about the Keys To Ascension show? Even if you're a big Yes fan, you should skip Live In Philadelphia 1979 because it's a big disappointment.

Sonics are extremely poor - Howe's guitar playing comes through well, but in general there's no dynamic range, and little bass response. Probably worse though is the film itself. Made in low resolution video, most of the shots are far from the stage, making it largely impossible to see the individuals or, frankly, much of anything they're actually doing on stage. The stage itself is rotating, which completely confuses whoever's directing the cameras - we end up mostly watching the back of Anderson's head. The film is also slightly out of sync with the sound, negating the experience of watching a live experience. There are inexplicable cuts between numbers, and the video itself drops out at one point during \\"All Good People\\". There's nothing here you can't get better on the CDs themselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"What went wrong with the DVD transfer of this?","review":"I am a huge Yes fan(have been for around 23 years).This 1979 Philly performance has much better audio quality on the Japanese laserdisc,cause I own it on LD,too.On DVD,it is very muffled and lifeless.Live in Philly,on either DVD or LD,is way too short.I saw them 3 days after the Philly show,and they played just over 2 hours.I don't understand why we get a very abbreviated show."},{"rating":"2","title":"You wonder how they snuck Tormato in the lineup","review":"Sorry to bash Tormato you fans of that album but my point is that when it came out, people bought it because it was Yes period. I do not remember hearing any song off of it before it was on the shelves so that alone is a bad omen.I put this on and yes video and audio circa the late 70's. I expect that and have no problem, it is like idiots demanding we have pristine video quality from the movies filmed during action in WWII........it aint happening folks! WE CANT GO BACK IN TIME AND RESHOOT IT!!!!!Aside from that rant, song selection is OK but of course Circus of Heaven is at least played but thank god they didnt try to shove all of Tormato down the crowds throat.I would not and did not pay a whole lot for this but am glad I got it at the price I did.

Unfortunately the criticisms on the video and sound quality are, to be very generous, completely justified. If you're as much of a fan of Yes as I am, I'm sure that one more voice of warning here won't deter you from getting a copy anyway and seeing how disappointing it is for yourself any more than the voices before mine deterred me.

I cannot argue with the blurb on the box about this being Yes at their peak and with their greatest line-up of all time, but the sound and picture quality of this DVD are extremely disappointing. It really does look like a cheap bootleg done on cine film and with a mono cassette recorder. This is a great shame, as the group are clearly giving their all to delight the ecstatic crowd.The highlights for me were the spirited rendition of Roundabout and the marvellous duel between Rick and Steve in the extended outro of Starship Trooper, which just about make this DVD worthwhile. The brutal truncation of The Ancient was very disappointing though. The commentary option is uninspired and will never get a second airing.Get it, if you're a die-hard Yes fan, but get it on sale!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Obsolete sound,video; too short.","review":"Only for fans, archivists.

The thing that REALLY ticked me off was that I was expecting the Tormato show...not old songs like \\"roundabout\\" or \\"starship trooper\\". Instead...one song from Tor performed live! And it happens to be my least favorite song on this album(circus of heaven). Its a shame......BUT, there is hope. If you can find DVD 1 and 2 for the 1975 QPR show....then you are in luck.

That bland version of Starship Trooper from Keys or this mind boggling version from 1979.The picture & sound are more than tolerable. In fact 11 years ago a friend gave me a 8th generation VHS copy.

What surprised me the most, is that when the band finally got around to playing ROUNDABOUT, I thought Wakeman was going to fall off the stage. Who knows why? Either he was too tired of standing on his feet, maybe a little drunk, or all the above reasons. However, he still played his solo like the true master of the keyboards that he is. As for the rest of the band, a truly incredible show."},{"rating":"1","title":"cheap mat","review":"Don't buy this product. It's not even worth the money. First off, I wouldn't even say 'what you pay for is what you get.' This product is not worth the money. Second, after thirty minutes of playing it, the buttons weren't responding right. I'd have to slam my foot on the pad for goodness sake and that's ruining the pad! Third, some of the buttons do not operate right. For instance, I pressed the right arrow and it said on the screen that I pressed the up arrow. Also, my shoe size is eight and my feet barely fit without pressing a button. The buttons are too big and too far apart. Any movement triggers a button. If you are a serious DDR player, do not get this mat! Get a regular Konami or Redoctane mat!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best","review":"I have owned this pad (not exact one, in blue) for 5 months and all of my friends own this pad as well. This pad works well for beginners, but once you have reached light, standard, and difficult it begins to slide around because it doesn't have a grip. I once had a party and when we were playing it, by the end of the song the pad had slid up about 2 feet and turned diagnally. I have also slipped and fallen using this pad. If you fold the pad there is a good possiblity that the sensors will move and the pad will become useless, this happened to my friend, so don't fold it if you buy it. I suggest that you don't buy this pad because you can probably get a much better one for only a few dollars more. In the end, spending a few more extra dollars will be worth it and you'll be safer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beginners Start Here","review":"The Mad Catz dance mat is intended to be used with Dance Dance Revolution, a popular video game that \\"combines quick reflexes and timing with dance music\\".That being said, it is difficult for serious DDR players to make use of this dance mat. The pad tends to slip during play, so you'll probably have to tape it to the floor. The sensors can't really take much abuse, so the arrows will probably stop responding to steps within a few weeks of heavy play.Note that the above only applies to experienced and skilled DDR players. This dance mat is fine for beginning players who want to test the game without making a huge investment for a better pad. You get what you pay for, after all."},{"rating":"1","title":"***Update: Pad Sucks!***","review":"(...)Just to let you know, the pad that I bought died. I got it around June last year, and now the sensors either shifted too far out of place, respond too slowly, or don't respond at all. The slipping is outrageous; try doing Paranoia on this cheap pad, oh wait, you can't. The pad will slip from one side of the TV to another. And don't even think about buying two of these. In my opinion, this is a death trap. Think about it: if both pads slip, the players could get seriously hurt.Bottom line: don't buy yourself this pad, unless you like to waste money and regret purchases."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not happy with these mats..","review":"I bought 3 of these because they were on sale really cheap. One of the mats died within a week. They slip a lot on carpet so you need to put something under it or else you will be all over the place. At size 11.5 shoe (there were no show size warnings when I bought them) I tend to hit other buttons (which is not a problem with some other brand mats and the arcade). On my (old, original copy of DDR for the original ps) start+reset pressed simultanously resets the game and sometimes when I'm playing the game just resends. I'm assuming it's because the mat sends the wrong signals. Even in socks, I ended up having to tape the corners down to keep the mat straight and non-wrinkled. Spend the few extra dollars and get a higher quality mat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible mat","review":"I bought this mat to play ddrmax, but on standard and heavy mode (the only modes worth playing on) the surface of the mat runs so much. Halfway through a song and the mat is as wrinkled as a raisin. It gets really annoying when the surface runs and the arrows don't register. I guess this mat would be okay if you like playing really, really slow songs, but otherwise try some other brand and tell me how it went. I really regret buying this mat."},{"rating":"1","title":"ARRG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This pad is soo annoying! I have DDR Exteme 2 and it came with a really nice pad (the original, plus nonslip!) and I was so into it that I decided to buy another pad. I went to Target and they only had a few left--only this type. It looked pretty awesome so I spent my money on it. Big mistake! The little circle in the middle where you're supposed to stand is WAYYYYY to small for me (I'm size 12)-whenever I'm standing in the middle it's like I'm sitting on a button. It also crinkles up and is thinner and \\"crunchy\\". Whenever I play a song I find myself standing on a button!

The pad does have large areas to step, but they compensated the large pads to a very (and I do mean very) small center. I have a size 12 foot so my feet step on the other arrows when I stand in the center. If you have small feet or are a kid, this may work for you. But if you're an adult. look for another pad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hrm . . .","review":"Well, this certainly isn't the best purchase you could make. Soft mats generally tend to bunch up if you're really dancing hard on them, and this one is no exception. It doesn't pick up all of the steps you make, so you end up with a mediocre score. Of course, it can be modded to work better: just attach it to a large piece of plywood and it should work okay, but this mat is just not for those of us who intend to be *really* good at DDR. Good for beginners and occasional players, not for people who play in the arcades."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed!!","review":"I ordered 2 of the dance mats for my 4 children...I was very excited as they were to be Christmas presents.

Of the 729 pages only about 47 pages specifically list US Publishers, US Literary Agents, US Media Contacts(in the UK) and US Writing Courses. The generalized content is, of course, applicable to any writer anywhere but if you are looking for comprehensive details about UNITED STATES publishers, media resources, literary agents and all the other US based contacts where a writer might submit his work there are better books to deliver those options.However if you want a thorough resource for UNITED KINGDOM contacts then this is certainly a viable option."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad, but...","review":"The description lies, there are no minifigures, Elite or otherwise, included.

There is warning at the top of the story that says \\"Here is a sad story\\". I felt a little bad giving it to my two year old niece for Christmas, so I told her parents about it and they were a little put off by it.This book is everything the other reviewers say it is. The pictures are wonderful to look at, the prose is fun to read and it brings back thoughts of simpler childhood times.

Despite what this author may think 6X8 does not equal 40, its 48.I read some of the intro stuff in this book and I assume its correct, but the practice test (my major interest in the book) is a piece of junk. While reading through the vocabulary Powers selected for the text, it seemed a bit strange. After looking at one of the practice tests, I now have zero doubt the the author just picked random things out of a dictionary to include.I don't pretend to know what book might be the best for someone looking for info on Officer's tests, but from what I've seen of this book, it sucks.

Technical details don't help at all: for each lense used, I would like to have the 35mm equivalent, shutter speed / diaphragms, paper gradations are never mention, neither the why or how of the exposure. Discussion of low key & high key is a joke. The seeing/thinking/acting structure of the book got on my nerves very fast, as is the very bad use of typography.

It's got loads of attachments, but the problem is getting the thing where you need it. To say it's heavy is one whopper of an understatement. Since my house is carpeted upstairs only, that's where the thing lives. I've tried using it with the attachments on the stairs. but it tips over quite easily,so I find ways to keep it propped up. Assembly is easy if you have the right screwdriver for the job. I tried several, gave up for a few days, then lost the screw, so if you buy one, get that done ASAP. Also, if you're petite like I am, watch the cord. The suction is really strong, and since the thing is super heavy, it's easy to loose track of the cord and shred it. Exactly what I did. Also, the mini brush attachment on top falls off all the time. My home is not nearly as \\"healthy\\" as I thought it would be.

I gave it a fair shot and told myself I could get past how damn heavy it is and how my back ached when I had to vaccum. Omitting that off the bat...we move onto how annoying it is that it works intermantently. Sometime it works in the suction department but the brush won't work...then I have to run it back and forth a few times and sometimes the brush will finally kick in and by that time my back is breaking from the heaviness of it. Then I get scared to turn it off if I have to move something out of the way to vaccum for fear of having to start the whole process over again. It is a nightmare...the worst vaccum ever.

It is VERY, VERY heavy and hard to manuever. I am fairly strong but have to ask my husband or son to carry it up and down the stairs. And vacuuming the stairs is a real chore, as you have to carry it up and down, which is nearly impossible. But after about a year of owning this vacuum, it finally bit the dust. It just stopped working. It appears to be an electrical issue, because if I shake the cord and move it around near the connection, it starts working.

Hers has clogged, brush stopped working and now it smells like something is burning - yet she really likes it when it works. Mine didn't get as much use because I live in a 2 story house and after schlepping that monster up and down the stairs a 1/2 dozen times, I ended up using a portable vacuum upstairs and the Bissell downstairs. But even without having to carry it, it's bulk makes it difficult to maneuver. Emptying it was not easy and it is difficult to get all of the fuzz, etc. out of the tank. I ended up recently purchasing the basic model of the Hoover WindTunnel and it is so much easier to use, carry and store. It was also about 1/3 of the cost of the Bissell. I am sorry I bought the Bissell, but my daughter wants mine, and I will be glad to get rid of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blahh! Terrible vacuum","review":"This is just an awful vacuum. I have had mine for 3 years. If you read all of the one star reviews you will see the same things mentioned over and over...so here it goes. This thing is HEAVY. I mean HEAVY!! I don't even live in a two story house, but I still hate pushing this boulder around on one level. My roller brush only works intermittently, as well, so that makes it even harder to push. I can't imagine having to lug this thing up a flight of stairs all the time. Also, like the other reviewers said, it is a dirty mess to empty the canister. If you empty it over a trash can in your house (which you shouldn't do) dust billows everywhere, which is ironic. The other reviewers are correct in that you also have to take a stick or your hand and dig out what is stuck at the top of the canister. A truly awful product. The suction is just okay and I do like the length of the cord, but that is it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good for pet hair.","review":"I just purchased this vacuum to replace our old vacuum that gave out. I have a Bull Mastiff and a Boxer, and even though we only have two area rugs, they are covered in pet hair all the time. I didn't want to spend the $$ on a Dyson, so seeing the pretty good reviews for this one, I decided to give it a try. Plus I had one of those 20% off coupons from Bed, Bath, and Beyond. I just put it together and used it - there is still white hair (from my Mastiff) ALL over my darker carpet. There was some hair and dirt in the canister, so I know it picked up some stuff.

For the price, it is a great machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great - if you like legos","review":"This vacuum cleaner is a piece of junk: it is constantly falling apart, shutting off while I am vacuuming, and is overall a headache. The upper handle is constantly falling off causing the Turbobrush to crash to the ground and breaks apart into pieces - so if you need to use the upper handle to transfer the vacuum up/down stairs, be prepared for littering your home with Bissell pieces.

Now, 1.5 years later, the machine progressively gets louder and louder. I did some research and have found that other people have had their motors give out after 2 or 3 years.

After reading the reviews on the Bissell 5770, we decided to try it. The vacuum lived up to all the favorable reviews. Although I've not tried the more expensive pet hair vacuum to compare it with, I cannot imagine another vacuum performing any better than this one. Performance combined with the price, makes this a great buy! I was somewhat concerned about the weight and its maneuverability--my last vacuum was self propelled and had a retractable cord--but I didn't find it too heavy to maneuver and it almost seems self propelled, especially when the brush is engaged. However, it has a very long cord and I miss the retractable cord feature when I'm winding it up."},{"rating":"2","title":"my house is dustless!","review":"yes, buy this vacuum. it's excellent.

I loved my Dyson but accidently ruined it. My sister raved about her Bissell and after reading the great reviews I decided to give it a try. I must say I hated the vaccuum from Day 1. The tank is a nightmare to empty because it tapers at the bottom where the dirt comes out. It is extremely hard to push because it is manually adjusted. If it is adjusted to pick up dirt correctly it gives you a gymnastic workout. If it is adjusted to push/pull easily it doesn't pick up the dirt or pethair. The attachments fall off and break apart. They have to be reassembled which is no easy task. It is extremely loud. I could not get mine to turn on (sometimes it started and sometimes it didn't) so I was forced to run to the store and buy another Dyson. I salvaged the loose items for my sister because hers already broke too. I'm at a loss as to why this vaccuum is so popular."},{"rating":"2","title":"1st day","review":"I don't own a dyson.

The HEPA filtration system is fantastic. The HEPA filter (Model 3282) works great and I didn't even have to replace it for over a year which is much longer than the 6 months they recommend. I own the Bissell Healthy Home 6100 Vacuum and I can say it is the best vacuum cleaner I've ever purchase. I used to own Hoover products but they really went down hill as far as the quality of manufacturing goes along with many other problems.

This is a nice feature beacuse if you have a room with newer carpet then the higher settings are what you would use and if you have a room with older carpeting it will most likely be more worn and lower.*You can go from carpet to floor with the push of button as the rotating brush switch is right at your fingertip.Cons:*The vacuum is very heavy. But think of it as a work out.*And although I really like the fact that the rotating brush switch is at the top of the vacuum it is right by the handle so it's easy to push it off while your vacuuming. (but it's easy to switch it right back on too)*The vacuum will tumble if your stretching the hose to far, but I've had this problem with numerous vacuums.I definitely recommend this vacuum. But if your looking for something light weight this isn't the one for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best vacuum I've ever used","review":"After just one use, I was sold on this vacuum. I've used plenty over the past 20 years and have never had one that picked up as much as quickly as this one. Most specifically, pet hair is a cinch, even on furniture (with the powered attachment). Never really used the disinfectant stuff that came with it because it's kind of a hassle.Yeah, it is heavy, but it doesn't tip over when I use the attachments on the stairs or stretch it out anywhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bissell 5770 Healthy Home Bagless Upright","review":"This vacuum SUCKS!!! In the BEST WAY POSSIBLE. This vacuum was given to me by my mother in law because she said it was to heavy for her and difficult to handle. This would be the only drawback to this vacuum! I'm not going to get into all the other details you can read the other reviews. I consider myself to be a very clean person, I vacuum the main living rooms everyday, ie. family room, kitchen and mudroom area. When I cleaned these rooms with the new Bissell I had to unload the canister (simple and easy) 3 times! My family was shocked at what it picked up. I could never figure out why I had to windex the table tops every day. I had tried my sister-in=laws Dyson and was not impressed. I would absolutely recommend this vacuum. I would give this 5 stars but it is quite heavy. I decided to look at this the same as a previous reviewer, it is now a piece of workout equipment that happens to clean the house!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful Vacuum","review":"I never thought I had so much dirt to vacuum up until I received my Bissell 5770 Healthy Home Vacuum.

Need an acct with parts dept.","review":"We've owned this worthless vacuum about 3 years now. Unless you like replacing parts on your vacuum constantly I don't recommend this vacuum to anyone. The switch that turns the beater brush on has broke twice now. You have to buy a new handle to the tune of $40+ to fix it each time. For the amount of use it's gotten in the time we've owned it I find this totally unacceptable and will not be buying another Bissell product again.According to the parts dept. this is a common problem with these vacuum cleaners. Along with that it's top heavy and about took me down our stairs with it when I was vacuuming the staircase.I will be looking for a new one and I guarantee the next one won't be made by Bissell."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality Canister","review":"I have owned 2 of these now, and managed to break the canister on both of them in less than 1 year. Bissell will not sell you a new canister, and these are too expensive to buy one as a parts vac. At least wally has a good exchange policy, because you will need it.On the bright side, it does clean well, and the hose is a handy feature. But the quality of the canister makes this product a $200 paper weight in the end because once your can breaks.

The extra tools are easy to use and store right on the vacuum so you don't fumble around looking for them when you need them.

My cousin swears the Dyson doesn't live up to the hype, she has one. I put my Bissell to the test on cat hair, and the door mat, it looked like new, and I was ready to toss it!

I have terrible allergies, and an indoor dog, so I really needed a GOOD vacuum with a HEPA filter. This vacuum takes care of carpet and tile floors, and the attachments are handy and work well. I love the long cord - very convenient! This vacuum picks up more dust, dirt and fur than my more expensive Electrolux. I thought the bagless design would be gross to use, but it isn't. It's very easy to empty, and it's kind of cool in a weird way to SEE how much dirt the vacuum sucks up.This vacuum is harder to push and pull than many other vacuums, but I think it's because it has such strong suction. If someone has severe back problems, then this probably isn't the vacuum for them. But it IS the best vacuum for me, and I recommend it heartily."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Product and really worth it","review":"We've had cheaper vacuums in the past and we ended up spending more than 300 bucks on 3 different vacuums over the past 4 years. We bought a house this winter (yes, we were renting till then!) and decided to get ourselves a better vacuum cleaner. We got ourselves a Roomba IRobot Discovery Scheduler with Intellibin but we returned it after our first use. It just didnt work effectively.And then we got this vacuum - the Bissel 5770 - and what an awesome job it did. It sucked the life out of the carpet, tiles and everything we got it to run on. Some folks are saying that this vacuum has an awkward positioning for the ON/OFF switch but I dont really care (although you can be a little more careful). This vacuum rocks and we are proud of our purchase.

The long hose and attachments work very well!The dirt cup can be a bit awkward to empty without sending dust back into the air, but I found that enclosing it in a garbage bag prior to emptying it solves the problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cleans Great!","review":"This vacuum works great! I had read all the other reviews and agree that it is slightly heavy if you have to move it up and down stairs but if you have a one-floor home-it's no big deal at all. It's cleaning power is fantastic- at my work place we have dyson and I think this works 10x's better and it's 1/2 the cost. The only down side (and this is probably true of any bagless vacuum) is that the containter reaches it's max quickly and then emptying it out is kind of a dusty process that you want to do outdoors in my opinion. I found it easy to operation (removing canister, etc)- just a somewhat dirty job!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bissell HH Bagless Vac Really Sucks","review":"From our freshly vacuumed home, we quickly vacuumed up over a quart of crud with our new Bissell, emptied the canister, and kept on vacuuming. Where did it all come from??? WOW! I can't believe how much the other vacuum had left behind. My friend had brought her Windtunnel over to use because she didn't think my old Sharp upright was getting the carpets really clean. After seeing what the Bissell picked up, she doesn't like her Windtunnel anymore and she wants a Bissell like mine!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware","review":"Needed a new vacuum and lots of great reviews for this one. My experience just didn't seam quite as good. We got the first unit home and there were parts missing. You have to put the handle and Cord storage pieces on your self. The item didn't have any screws to do this so I took that one back for a new one. The new one did come with the screws but the brush would only work for about 30 seconds then stop. If you waited a few minutes, it would start working again. When it did work, it worked like a charm but I can't stop every 30 seconds to wait 2 minutes... I don't know if it overheated or was faulty but it would work and then, out of no where, stop. So, third time's a charm, I went back and got one more. The last one, the brush switch wouldn't turn off the brush. By now, I've had it. I took the last one in and just got the Dyson DC25 Animal.

However, the brushes stopped working recently so I ordered a replacement brush motor. When I took the thing to bits it was all rusty inside and more annoyingly the sprocket on the end of the brush motor was rusted onto the old non-working motor and I couldn't remove it at all. I tried WD40, pullers and even a hammer. I hate being beaten when repairing things and this beat me. For the dozen or so times that it cleaned the carpet it did a great job, but I'm not pleased with the build quality at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Messy Clean Up","review":"This unit was extremely heavy. It did vacuum well but the clean up was awful. When emptying the canister the dirt and dust would spill on the floor causing me to either vacuum or sweep it back up.

I retured the machine after 3 uses."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fragile piece of crap","review":"Worst vacuum ever! Had it a year and have hated it almost every day. Plastic is weak- the canister bottom broke off after two months and the front top latch followed a month later. Cleaning power is worst than the 20 year old Hoover I had years ago. Pet hair? Forget about it. Save yourself some time and use a lint brush on the carpet. The \\"turbo brush\\" attachment is even more useless than the vacuum itself.

Are you supposed to lift the whole thing by the dirt canister? I can just see the plastic parts breaking off.Next, it just doesn't suck. The suction is weak, and the brush is difficult to clean and remove wound on fibers (pet hair, etc). Do NOT use this if you've just replaced your carpet - all those fibers will completely clong the brush.Last, the canister has to be removed and taken apart to get pet hair out - the open the bottom you see in the commercials drops the dirt, but not the hair. Even then, you end up with dirt on the outside of the canister - kind of pointless.Do NOT buy this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Overpriced Piece of Junk","review":"I bought this vacuum to replace a \\"bottom of the barrel\\" vacuum that had given out after 5 years of constant use. Two months after purchasing the vacuum we decided to rip out the carpet and do hardwood floors. It was occasionally used to do bedrooms over the next year. From the start I disliked it because it would just push Cheerio's and crackers around the floor. I had to physically pick up the Cheerio's off the floor and throw them away. I've probably said 2 swear words in my entire life and now everytime I attempt to vacuum I want to curse like a sailor because the darn brush won't turn on.

Within 6 weeks, the vacuum would not turn on at all. Amazon would not stand behind my purchase, requiring me to run around to local repair shops to resolve my problem. I can get hassled for free. I don't need to pay amazon for the hassle. I don't think it unreasonable to expect that a purchase like this should work at least 1 year and I also don't think it unreasonable to ask that the organization that sold it to you and took your money should stand by it rather than rigidly restate their policy that regardless of the customer or their problem, after 30 days, the hassle is all yours.

(which I didn't see until after I finished vacuuming the living room and wondered why I couldn't see it rotating through the see-through window. Then one of the times I pushed that stupid 'power' button, I saw the 'brush' button below it)4) Does not suck that well. I've read the other reviews and mine just did not suck that good. I vacuumed my carpets, then used my carpet cleaner and it was disgusting how much dirt and hair it picked up that the Bissell didn't.Pros:1) Long cord2) its bagless3) pretty?Honestly there's too many cons than pros and I would NOT recomment this vacuum.

At the store it seemed kinda heavy, but I didn't think much about it and bought it anyway. However when I got it home and tried to use it it was SO heavy I could hardly push it. And all the weight is in the upper portion of the vacuum which you use to hold, not the bottom which goes on the floor. It was so heavy I could not see myself trying to vacuum my whole house with this vacuum. I was very disappointed with the weight and the fact that is was so hard to push/pull. It did seem to have good suction, but I didn't want to wear myself out everytime I vacuum, so I returned it.

For the first year things were good. My complaints were that it was quite heavy and often tipped over (usually hitting me in the back) when I used the attachments. The canister was also a little messy to empty. But it really did a great job cleaning. And then it started to fall apart. First the brush seized up & would not rotate. It has some kind of internal belt, that cannot be changed like the standard vacs. I had to pay $40 to buy a new brush and spend hours taking the thing apart and putting it all back together. A month later the self propel feature stopped working. Not the end of the world. But then the canister started falling apart piece by piece.

The vacuum has not been overworked, its just me and my husband in a two bedroom apartment with no pets. Ridiculous that is broke so soon, especially for the money. Evidently this is a common problem, Bissell's website has this as a FAQ. The only solution is to take it to an authorized repair shop. Tried taking it to the local shop to be fixed and told there is not one shop in the county that is \\"authorized\\" to fix it.

It also does an amazingly good job of cleaning. It is hard to maneuver though. I knocked the power roller off so many times that I ended up tossing it in the closet. Other than that, the onboard tools are very handy. One criticism of the brushes is they way they are angled, you can't effectively clean under sofas and chairs because you can't get the brush to go flat against the floor. I'm in my early 50's and can lug it upstairs so far, but I may invest in different vacuum for upstairs. It was hard to push on my carpets, but I adjusted the carpet height knob and that helped. I am amazed and somewhat grossed out by the amount of dog hair I collect in the cannister every week. If this thing used bags, I'd have to change the bag every time I vacuum.

The motor does not stay running, a loose connection somewhere inside is only fixed by beating on the housing.Emptying the canister is impossible, if the fight doesn't manage to land all the contents on the floor you will enjoy having to dig any sort of hair out of the top of the canister to empty it.The vacuum looks good but is a horrible investment.

Without power brush, vacuum is useless.3) Noisy and heavy. Wears you out if you have a house. Good luck on dragging up stairs.4) Cannot change brush belts or heads. Again, plan on shop visits.5) Turbobrush is useless. It won't stay on, so you will store it and forget it.6) Customer Service is overseas. For me, they answer soon but then you have all the usual overseas problemswhich irritate Americans.Otherwise - pickup is mediocre when hose clear, but again clogs easy.Only thing okay - wand has good suction when not clogged.

He has a beautiful style, literate without being polysyllabic, that is very relaxing to read.The theme of this particular book (set around Manchester and Cornwall, as so many of his are) is that there is no armour against fate; and the period it covers was certainly a fateful one, ranging as it does from the close of the Victorian era through two World Wars.

It was a learning process - turn the water on just enough to create the needed suction, not too hard so as to turn the bag into a rocket!

Each of the Christmas songs is performed in the style of a specific Beatles hit. For example, you hear what you think is the start to \\"I Saw Her Standing There\\" but when the vocals begin the song becomes \\"Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree\\"My only complaint is that the lead vocalist (who sounds a lot like Paul McCartney) at times has an accent that sounds more American than British. Still, overall they do a great job at recreating the sound (especially the guitars) of those Beatles songs we know so well. If you are a big Beatles fan, this is really a fun recording. The group who recorded this, Rubber Band, has been a popular Beatles tribute band in Europe for many years and has their own web site."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beatmas","review":"This Swedish Beatles cover band(don't worry, they sing in English and sound English) is excellent. It is readily apparent they can handle the vocal and musical challenges of the Beatles earlier to mid-60's sound. Very clever arrangements of Christmas songs with a heavy Beatles flavor. Examples: White X-mas with a Ticket to Ride guitar riff, Santa Claus is Coming to Town ala Eight Days A Week. They borrow from the Beatles without ever completely ripping off the songs they are emulating. Most entertaining, though some choices are bit in-your-face however, most notably Rudolf the Red Nose ala Taxman is a bit much.

Sugarman can't write fiction (that this largely nonfiction book was in the guise of.) He should stick to nonfiction. It read like a novel written by a 16 year old...and not a Thomas Chatterton or an S.E. Hinton, either. And if he reveals in the book that Pamela Courson told him that Jim O.D.ed on her heroin, why didn't he put that fact in NO ONE HERE GETS OUT ALIVE? He co-wrote that book with Jerry Hopkins, and Hopkins was angry to find out that Sugerman had kept it from him. If you want to read a high-octane novel (that this one tries to be), read instead ON THE ROAD by Jack Keroac (if you haven't already). Jim Morrison worshiped that novel, and even copied the laugh of the character Dean Moriarty. Morrison himself would prefer you to read ON THE ROAD, I'm sure of it!!

This concert is based on the The Very Best ... and Beyond Tour, and I watched them in Caracas, Venezuela during this tour. It was an amazing concert.

In theory this is good for a dive knife, except for when its cheap rubber. I've had this knife for less than a month and the rubber is seperating from where I only adjusted the straps. Also, if you dive in a shorty suit, then the rubber will grab ALL of the hair on your leg if you wear it on your calf.

The title is totally misleading-where is the mention of tupperware's famous return policy? What about the effect that it had on food and food preparation? What about the copy-cats?

While I understand that the conditions of Mr. Douglass' life were neither fun nor friendly, as the dvd is meant to both educate and entertain. This dvd is just too slow, too uninteresting, and not student friendly. This of course does not demean in any way the physical and mental hardships Mr. Douglass suffered. Showing this dvd to my 11th grade high school students, I fear, for them, would feel like the equivalent of a different kind of torture than Douglas endured.

The gadget works fine and it hasn't affected my systems performances.The selector is easy to use, convenient and inexpensive. You just plug in your A/V cords and then plug it into your TV.

The fact that the UFC didn't allow them to use fight footage is fairly maddening.

The sound is just a little bit thin, but all the instruments and voices are clear and the balance is quite good--much better than most of the others currently available.

The music, the sound, the stage, the lighting, the registration, the colors are all great indeed, but the editing is all wrong and annoying. A lot of the time the music and film are out of sync, but what is worse is that more than once shots belonging to an other part of the concert are used to fill up gaps elsewhere. I cannot believe that the editor actually thinks that the viewer is stupid enough to fall for these cheap solutions. The mistakes are often so obvious! It is not enough to show, let's say, a drummer who is drumming. NO!

The animation itself wasn't terrible but it's plot and characters were. The plot was about some wizard who showed Hitler films and was trying to conquer the world. This in itself might have been mildly ok but then they added in fairys and elves. In the end it seemed to be all one (bad) joke to me anyway. The scenes of cartoon characters watching Hitler stll make me want to laugh. As for the characters, they weren't very good either. The so called good wizard just laughed about everything and the so called president looked like a clown. The worst part of the movie was the very (bad) ending. I thought, you can't even comepensate your audience with a good ending? Overall I think this movie could have had potential but I feel that for whatever reasons the makers just didn't try hard enough on this film. Because of that and since I don't rate on potential but how things are, I believe this movie deserves the 1 star rating I have given it."},{"rating":"2","title":"wierd but fun","review":"this is a strange story of 2 wizards and thier struggle for power... it was fun to watch and thats why i bought it foo....:)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wizards Memiors","review":"When I was a kid, there was this seedy neighborhood theater that allowed us kids to see rated R movies... double-features for a buck.

It takes place after a global nuclear war. Two brothers, each a wizard in his own right, go toe to toe in their final confrontation. The film uses a lot of slapstick for comic relief mainly because some of the subject matter is so serious. Bakshi juxtaposes magic against technology and sixties style love against Nazi style hate. The overlying message is that somtimes when it comes down to it, the ends may very well justify the means, and that those who hate cause their own destruction.Bakshi's use of stock footage is masterful, and his animation is top notch. The characters are very archetypal, but each has a quirk or flaw that makes them unique. Also the voice acting is quite good.This is probably one of the most misunderstood fantasy films ever made. But once you get past the presentation and look at it on a deeper level, you realise that it is a stroke of genius."},{"rating":"2","title":"Midnite Madness!!!","review":"A movie lost between others, this feature used to be a staple \\"Midnight Show\\" along with Clockwork Orange & Rocky Horror. Its a simple tale that is easy to follow and exemplifies one of the oldest lessons learnable. Those who choose to forget the past are doomed to repeat it. As the evil wizard comes across ancient film of the 3rd Reich, he sees the discipline & motivation as a way to train his own (formerly inept) army. But the world (post apocolypse) has become a better, quieter, more beautiful place & most folks don't want to change. Enter the younger, seemingly simple wizard brother to \\"fix\\" the problem once and for all.Simple to follow, an easy movie to enjoy with friends/family or even alone.

Throw in just a little bit of technology, and you have the makings of a well-crafted movie. One even tends to lose the sense that this is a cartoon. This is due, in part, to the fact that Ralph Bakshi is famous for cartooning over live actors. This makes for a very believable movie.Without going into detail - I wouldn't want to spoil your fun by telling you too much (heh, heh) - the title comes from the battle between too wizards - brothers - one good, one irretrievably evil, and the methods they employ to achieve their separate ends.

Fresh from his amazing version of \\"The Lord of the Rings,\\" Bakshi creates his own fantasy world filled with elves, trolls, and the like. Avatar, a cute gnome-looking wizard, who fancies science and magic, is trying valiantly to keep serenity amidst chaos. The problem is his twin bro, Blackthorne, an ugly cross between Gandolf and Skeletor, who is hell-bent on destruction by using technological warfare. Get the innuendo? Ever a relevant theme, even today, technology is bad. Bakshi's animation style is brilliant, by coloring and painting actual live-action backdrops, he creates an unusual feeling of reality. Also incorporated is real Nazi propaganda footage used to intimidate and terrify the elfling folk. You wanna see some rockin' battles?

I admire this movie mostly for its edge, panache, artisrty, and setting. There isn't anything quite like it. It has an enjoyable fantasy setting (Technology vs. Magic) and fairly eerie tone throughout, considering it roughly falls into the \\"post-apocolypse\\" genre. The only down side to Wizards?

Avatar and his allies are simply just there and that's about it. The film itself is also just a huge mess, it goes back and forth between poorly animated battle sequences then to boring and barely coherent situations Avatar and the gang get into.They are small attempts at humor here and there which overall fail and just doesn't make any sense.I think Ralph Bakshi should stick to what he knows, cold hard street life like in \\"Heavy Traffic\\" because fantasy is definetly not his area of expertise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth It","review":"When I watched this film 10 years ago, I really hoped for the spectacular piece of art everyone told me it would be. So, my friends and I gathered around the TV on our normal Saturday Anime Night and witnessed what turned out to be the biggest waste of an hour and a half we had ever incountered. Besides the \\"revolutionary\\" style of animation, which was choppy and poorly constructed, the dialog was sketchy, and the story near impossible to follow. Not to give away the ending, but the only thing that made the excruciating veiwing of this film worth while, is when Avatar finally grows a set and takes out this brother. Needless to say, I have never, nor will I ever watch this film again. I was just too disappointed, as were all of my friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"My dad rented this movie for me when I was 8 years old.

This is worse than the Super-8 \\"movie\\" my friends and I made in 9th grade, and I didn't think it could get worse than that. Just to make it even worse, there is just enough actually striking rotoscope imagery to give the viewer a hint of the potential that was blown in this project. If I were Ralph Bakshi or anyone else associated with this, I would change my name and pretend I'd never heard of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different, yet Brilliant!","review":"In short, Wizards ain't your typical watered-down Disney classic animated film. Wizards is not for the faint-of-heard. The protagonist himself is a bit of an anti-hero; a cigar smoking, dishevled old wizard with the sex drive of your typical wildebeest. Coming from the 1970s, the film is a sample of the best of the decade's independent animation. Incredibly unique (less formulated than even today's animated films), the film is horrifying, hilarious, and thought-provoking, often at the same time. If the tried-and-true formula for a \\"successful\\" movie is all you're open for, then this film will probably not appeal to you because Wizards breaks all the pre-set rules. However, if you're big on individuality, I highly recommend you give this gem a chance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh","review":"Got this movie for Christmas...can't say enough bad things about it.The animation is often about as good as in the Smurfs (I.e., not that good), and it usually does not mix well with the retroscoping at all.The story's message is muddled at best. There is a strong peace and no technology message to it, until the end when the \\"hero\\" uses violence and technology to win.The \\"hero\\" of this story was supposed to be funny, but I found him incredibly unlikable. I liked the villain far more and was hoping that evil won at the end of this movie. Sadly, it didn't.For some reason you can see the heroine's nipples through her shirt. Then they put her in bandage where she struggles and heaves her bosums. It seems like the animators were horny.

It stars Yul Brynner, Marlon Brando, and Janet Margolin who all play anti-Nazi Germans during WWII. Brynner is a sea captain, Brando a pacifist forced by the British to help get the boat into Allied hands, and Margolin as the American-German-Jewish prisoner. It's good to see Janet in one of her few leading roles a few years after David and Lisa.This scenario has all the ingredients of greatness, yet the film never rises to it as the plot is ill-concieved with an unfinished feel to it. However it's well worth watching rare performances by these actors.DVD contains original teaser and trailer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceptional war drama","review":"Marlon Brando plays a German deserter and ex-patriot living in British occupied India unwillingly drawn into a war he doesn't believe in.

The hardnosed Captain (Yul Brynner) has Allied prisoners and a concentration camp survivor (Janet Margolin)that he's ferrying from Japan to German. More importantly, his precious cargo is desperately needed to fuel the war effort in Germany.Fox has done a great job transferring this fine film to DVD.

Spivak cleary seeks to empower women and individuals of color oppressed by Western hegemony -- ttself a jargon phrase-- yet no one she seeks to liberate could remotely understand her text. Nor could many scholars like myself, who seek to learn from her infinite wisdom.At some point, I would hope that scholars like Spivak would take a page from the Lawrence Grossbergs of the world and begin to write in more accessible languageTo do so is not anti-intelectual -- it is indeed an attempt to ADVANCE scholarship."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gardening is not a bad idea for academics.","review":"the subdurban mall is something like a model/symptom of Spivak's recent attempt to think. The book is big and vacant, like an old shopping mall waiting to be turned into an unhabited parking space. The most vexing part of the text, a text full of them, is the tired way she attempts to analyze the consequences of the Bandung conference, an event she obviously knows nothing about. Furthermore, it appears that many of the citations mention are never read or, if they were she had no time to understand them. This is an unelegent and flawed parody of CRITIQUE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's hope the field can do better than this","review":"This book is about 400 pages too long.

I got by myself and popped it in. I felt to go to the song \\"Blessing in the Thorn\\". I'd heard it before, as one of my friends sings it often, but it really never meant as much as it did the other day. I sat there and completely lost it. It was just that good.*Pray Me Home is just gorgeous.*New Mercy reminded me that whatever I may do, God's grace covers me even then.And as for upbeat songs, there's plenty of them, but I think the best PCD ones are the worshipful songs to be really honest. There's just something about them.This is incredible and I encourage you to experience them for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply wonderful! This group's music is a great blessing.","review":"Once again, PC&D has touched my heart with their inspired lyrics and unique and beautiful harmonies.

I believe God uses music to minister to our soul. He is using these men in a mighty way."},{"rating":"2","title":"worth every cent","review":"This CD is by far one of the most incredible that I have heard so far. Not only is the music well done, but the lyrics are far superior to even some of the popular Christian music out today. There is a depth to the theology that isn't commonly seen. I highly reccommend this CD to anyone looking for music that will speak to them, in addition to being entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best music I have ever heared.","review":"This CD has not only great music, but each song has a wonderfull story to tell. \\"This is How it Feels to Be Free\\", one of the most amazing songs I heared.

The tracks explore interpersonal relationships that bring the singer closer to Jesus. The album's showpiece is definitely the stunning BLESSING IN THE THORN, an ode to finding the good in even the worst of times---get out the Kleenex!Close behind is the simple but moving PRAY ME HOME. I also like the feel of GRACE WILL MEET YOU THERE. The trio sings with passion and conviction and have beautiful harmonies. Contemporary Christian music is most effective when the artist moves you to share in their faith-something PC&D; have done with this inspirational experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't get into this book","review":"I had alot of hope for this book , but I just couldn't get past the first few chapters.

My particular interest was how well Python integrated with Java and that is my only use for it. Python, however, must compete with other scripting languages, particularily Perl. Users of other scripting languages site the large libraries available for their language. This book did the best job of presenting the numerous areas that Python has been used in."},{"rating":"1","title":"why is this book still in print?","review":"There might be some need for a book that covers intesively py 1.5.2, which I think was released in 1997 or so, but aside from that, you will read about code and libraries that are no longer maintained, or even available."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb playing! Madeleine Forte: Barber, Bartok, Liszt, Beethoven","review":"Superb playing! Impeccable clarity, magnificent tone, breathtaking virtuosity! The Barber Sonata is one of the most difficult works in the piano repertoire and Forte plays it with spine-tingling conviction, driving rhythmic force, and tremendous stylistic authenticity. When Samuel Barber wrote this piece, he could not have asked for a better performance of it. The Beethoven is Appassionata at it's best! Again, stunning virtuosity, magnificent tone, and sparkling clarity that comes from French technique. The Liszt is perfect & balanced - cascading octaves in Liszt's more difficult transcendental etude. Bartok is as if Bartok himsself was playing it - again, complete stylistic authenticity which Mrs. Forte is known for.This is a must buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Some good movies","review":"Catherine Cookson has some really good books. I have to say I like the movies better than the books as they are a little hard to get through at times...at least for me.I really liked The Glass Virgin and The Dwelling Place.The Glass Virgin is about a young girl that grows up believing she is the daughter of her parents. When the truth comes out her life changes dramatically. She goes through much hardship with a special friend.The Dwelling Place is again about hardship and making choices. The young girl is raped. Other reviewers have stated the unlikelyhood of her marrying the rapist. I have to disagree to some degree because it was a different time and place then. There are historical accounts of women doing just that and living their lives out together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self-Indulgence, Anyone?","review":"I've enjoyed the earlier books in this series, but this one sounds as if the author was plum out of fresh ideas and dug up Victor, Jemmy et. al. as well as reprising undigested lumps of Jake Tiptree's past history. The book rambles on and on, trying to write cute but not succeeding, and getting nowhere. Some tired plot elements (mob hit man, mystery book etc.) and old Maine caricatures only make things worse.It's annoying because the author can do much better. Maybe she just needs a sabbatical."},{"rating":"1","title":"Come on now.","review":"This is the first Sarah Graves book I've read, and the last. It is full of adverbs which should have been my first clue of a poor writer. Secondly, the \\"plot\\" jumps back and forth between try to solve a mystery and applying Spackle to a wall. The plot was week, the delivery was worse yet and I kept thinking something is going to develop here, but never does.Maybe she should take up home repairs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Once you start reading, you will not be able to put it down!","review":"I did not want the book to end. The moment you start reading the first page you will feel transported to 13th Century Scotland and it is like you were there!!. The book is so magnificently written that you are going to feel the wind blowing, and the rain pouring. The characters will make you cry, will make you laugh, they will make you fell sad and will make you feel happy. Like I said, it is like if you were part of that world. After a tiresome day at my office all I wanted to do was go back to the book (of course my husband does not understand this). The love Diarmid and Michael share is beautiful, deep, and full of magic, it grows between them as an incredible force that they cannot fight against. I have read already, from Susan King, \\"Laird of the Wind\\" and \\"Angel Knight\\" and I cannot wait for her next release."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding...except for the NAMES","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book, but the names of the characters kept distracting me. First of all, how DOES one pronounce \\"Diarmid\\"? And I didn't much care for \\"Michaelmas\\" for a heroine, maybe because my son's name is Michael or maybe I kept forgetting it was the GIRL's name while trying to read this.There is one more thing I dislike and it occurs in most S.K. novels. If a villain is bad, keep him bad. Don't give him brief moments of kindness unless he's to change from bad to good altogether. Heck, I kind of look forward to the evil characters getting their due."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work for me, but maybe for someone else.","review":"I bought 10 of these.

It is a comfortable alternative to the regular office for those of us who want to pay tribute to Our Blessed Mother with \\"her\\" office. It is particularly \\"Marian\\" while telling the \\"greatest story ever told\\" of her Son, Jesus Christ, through its holy psalms and verses. It is shorter and simpler than the regular office and offers great glory to God by honoring and giving praise to His holy Mother. I would give this particular version a \\"5 star\\" but it lacks one thing-- the Latin version with the English but the content is pure and good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Daily prayer","review":"Inexpensive alternative to the Liturgy of the Hours or for those who have devotion to the Virgin Mary."},{"rating":"2","title":"Little Office of the Blessed Virgin, Mary","review":"Well done book. Great cover and binding. Clear instructions. Some options of prayers and antiphons. Good printing. Ribbon included."},{"rating":"2","title":"Little Office of the Blessed Virgin Mary","review":"This is a wonderful little book, which matches quite nicely with my Imitation of Mary ISBN 0899423175 book, although the cover thickness and quality is not as good on the Little Office of the Blessed Virgin Mary. The paper on the pages, the printed font size and the blue edging seem totally the same though. Little Office of the Blessed Virgin Mary also differs in that it has a ribbon for knowing where one left off.The content for prayer is wonderful. The morning and evening prayer sections are longer than I imagined. It really does help one focus on the Lord and the Virgin Mary. The messages within tend stay with you. The more I read this book as I should, the more it grows in me and the more I enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent devotion","review":"I purchased this in anticipation of being enrolled in the brown scapular. It is an excellent prayer book to help someone pray the Little Office. It is an attractive little book with nice font, etc. The book is very easy to use (much easier than praying the Divine Office). Definitely recommend taking up this devotion to anyone who wants to cultivate their relationship with the Blessed Mother of God."},{"rating":"1","title":"LIttle Office of BVM","review":"This edition of the Little Office of the BVM is a post-Vatican II version. I hate to admit it, but I don't know how to say the Little Office to benefit from the Brown Scapular. Sure, there are morning and evening prayers for the days of the week, but the other \\"hours\\" seem to reside in a rather long Office of Readings. So I donated my two copies to my parish church and ordered a traditional version from another source."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get the Pre-Vatican II version","review":"Get the pre-Vatican II version of the Little Office instead. Why? First of all, the proper number of hours for an office is eight: Matins, Lauds, Prime, Terce, Sext, None, Vespers, and Compline. This number fulfills what is written in the book of Psalms, \\"At midnight I rise to thank thee\\" (corresponding to Matins), and \\"Seven times a day I praise Thee\\" (corresponding to Lauds through Compline). This is how all Offices, for any religious order, were constructed since the Church was founded. As Yogi would say, \\"you can look it up!\\". In addition, the language in the older versions is much richer and more reverent as compared to the trite and banal drivel found in the Modernist translations. All Vatican II reforms are trash, brought to you by the Modernist cabal trying to destroy the Church."},{"rating":"1","title":"Little Breviary","review":"I have a 1956 copy of this gem printed by J.H.

Knox's scripture translations, which my breviary contains, I still prefer it to the edition you're selling here and will continue searching for it because I want nothing to do with liturgical books up-dated by Vativan II \\"scholars.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Recommended Daily Office Book","review":"I highly recommend the Little Office of the Blessed Virgin Mary for use in Daily Prayer. It is Spiritually enriching and very easy to use and follow. It is in complete accord with Vatican II and joins the full Divine Office as part of today's official daily prayer of the Church. Its Marian theme is part of a tradition dating back to the early church and is a good companion to daily recitation of the Rosary. It contains every hour of the liturgical day with each \\"hour\\" containing all you need to complete it. You won't have to refer to other sections of the book to find the various parts of the daily office as you would in the Liturgy of the Hours, which can be very confusing to use. The size of this book makes it easy to carry in a coat pocket or purse for use anywhere. This is a fine little Book with a lot in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST have.....literally","review":"An awesome book, nearly comparable to the Divine Office.

I've never shot with the 580ex, so I don't know how it compares, but this is a super flash!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Does the job.","review":"I bought the 430EX as my first flash. I wanted something that I could bounce off the ceiling and walls, but I couldn't really afford the 580. This flash greatly improved the quality of my pictures, because even if it's quite dim in a room I can point the flash at the ceiling and *click* get the shot without it even looking like I used a flash.The 580 is better than the 430 because it is more powerful, and can be used as a master. (the 430 can only be used as a slave.)But if you only have one flash then you can't use the 580 as a master anyway, so that means that for $250 more dollars all you get is some extra power. What I recommend is buy the 430 and then if you decide that you want more than one flash, you can always buy a 580, then you will have a master and a slave. But if you choose to only use the one flash then you can put the extra $150 toward a new lens. :P That's what I did, I bought the 430, and then later bought the 580 and am now using them both.

Easy to use. Great quality pictures. The light quality is good; doesn't give you that blast of harsh light like the on camera flash. I tend to like the more golden pics in low light and this seems to maintain some of those tones when bouncing off ceiling. It does make the camera a little xtra heavy though - really noticed it when I put on my zoom lens. That will take some getting used to...and a little muscle building :).

Actually it is more powerful than I expected from other reviews. The build quality is on par with other Canon products, and the fit and finish is good.

It's cheaper and smaller than the 580EX II, but it packs quite a punch. the configuration is simpler and the flash range is less than that of the EX II...that being said I'm still impressed with it's power.It doesn't have a 360 degree swivel head for backwards bounce flash, and it feels lighter and is smaller than the 580EX II, so that makes it more ideal if you don't have a big camera bag or are planning to travel as light as you can (which I am this summer).I bought this mainly to be a slave unit for my 580EX II, whether you are buying this as a slave unit or your first flashgun, go for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"What more needs to be said...","review":"Well, what more needs to be said that hasn't been said in the last 100+ reviews...The flash is well built and seems to work great with the Canon 40D. It does add a fair amount of weight to an already heavy camera. I haven't used it enough to really know what I'm doing, so I can't give it a full review.I took advantage of 'super saver' shipping I was worried that my order would take a back seat to the paying customers. Amazon shipped my order right away! I have my new flash in three days!! My only complaint is the packaging. The box it was shipped in was only slightly larger than the box the flash comes in. There was very little padding in the box, only two of the six sides. The flash seems to be fine, but only time will tell.The flash (so far) gets 5 stars, only because of the packaging did I not give a full 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great unit, great price","review":"This flash makes great light. In my apartment we pretty much get nothing but nasty, dim, yellow light. The pictures I take with this flash make a world of difference. The thing rotates nearly 360 degrees, so you have the option to bounce it just about any kind of way you can imagine. Very flexible.This flash comes with a little stand that is great if you're using it remotely. Use a 580EXII flash or an STE-2 transmitter for that. It sucks that Canon's DSLRs don't have a commander mode for the pop-up flash, but that's not fault on the 430EX.Anyway, what else is there to say? It's a great unit. There's no real need to spend more money on the 580EXII unless you need the transmitter option, IMHO."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Flash","review":"An external flash is so important to good photographs and this one is great.

I would highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Pleased","review":"I haven't used the flash very much yet, but the photos I have taken are dramatically better than indoor photos with the built in flash on the Canon Rebel.

If you need a flash for a Canon Digital SLR, try this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What an improvment","review":"After taking just a few pictures with the 430ex I knew I made a great decision to get an upgrade to the built in flash on my Canon XTi. There is full communication between the flash and the camera so the exposure is right on. You can take full manual control for more creativity. My favorite thing to do is bounce the flash off the ceiling for a soft lighting effect. Aside from my new Sigma lens, this is the best investment I've made for my camera.Only word of caution is the built in diffuser. Make sure it is tucked away after use with a firm click. Even if it is slightly out of it's housing the camera will compensate for it and your exposure will be wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great listening....to Taylor Music","review":"Livingston Taylor is the brother of James Taylor...except Livingston is a professor at a college in New England...he is a Doctor for heavens sake.

They absolutely loved it! As I read the story of a day in the life of a homeschooling family, I kept hearing a chorus of \\"We do that, too!\\" from my kids. We read a lot of older books to our children, and while the morals and language of those stories are just what we like, they do, almost without exception, show the children going to school. How lovely to have a story about a family whose lifestyle mirrors our own! The children loved the detail in the illustrations and spent a long time looking at them. As soon as I was finished, they asked if I could read it again.The only reservation some parents might have is that the book mentions that the family is reading The Hobbit. Families who avoid fantasy-type books might find that objectionable. Otherwise, I think it is a wonderful addition to any homeschooling family's library."},{"rating":"1","title":"An experiment gone wrong.","review":"An interesting concept-- Adrian Belew using his guitar and processors peforms music that sounds as if it was performed by an orchestra. It opens with a witty moment, crowd applause and the sound of the guitar tuning before walking into a splashing piano part.Unfortunately, the record pretty much falls apart after that-- the arrangements are sparse (sounding as if they could be played on six strings), and Belew sometimes forgets that pianos can't do bends. The music itself seems sparsely composed (\\"Piano Ballet\\") if at all (\\"Portrait of the Guitarist as a Young Drum\\"), but as an improvised piece, it feels totally unfocused (\\"Seven E Flat Elephants Eating Acacia of a C# minor Forest\\"), with a few rare exceptions (\\"Rings Around the Moon\\").Certainly I'm glad I heard it, but I haven't actually listened to this in several years, and giving it another listen today, I remember why."},{"rating":"1","title":"A failed experiment","review":"I file this with my \\"failed experiment\\" music (Lucier's 'Amplified Brain Waves and Percussion' et al)..stuff that is interesting in inspiration or execution , but leaves me with no real interest in hearing again.

The author illustrates the simple wire wrapping techniques (some I've never seen before) used in Make Wire Beads quite well upfront in the book and then gives \\"recipes\\" for making each of the kinds of beads using those techniques. The book is designed in such a way to drive your own inspiration for making wire beads as well as giving you detailed instructions for the different beads.This isn't your usual how-to book: it's better because of the way Van Herik presents the information, providing tips and comments for the bulk of her \\"recipes\\" as well to prevent mistakes.

The difference is, she is a stunningly talented actress who is afforded the opportunity to try the avenue of music.

Other recipes require things like toasted coriander seeds, toasted allspice, etc. that take a lot of time to prepare.

He tells a simple story : how a young boy's life changes forever because of his favorite uncle's sudden death, and more importantly, how one event can shape the remainder of a person's life. In these days of relentless, horrific tragedies which are never fully assimilated or understood, Berry sets a timeless stage in the small town of Port William, Kentucky, where the same events are felt for generations. In his books there is all the time in the world, to feel, to adjust, to accept. He uses just the right words and not too many of them. His language has a clarity and spaciousness that leaves a reader deeply refreshed. I would highly recommend his book of short stories, \\"Fidelity\\" ( and that story in particular).

My fellow Americans: why didn't we get it? Here they were mostly known as a one-hit wonder but practically every track here coulda-shoulda been a smash hit- as many of these were in the UK. All these accolades aside though I'd recommend \\"The Lot\\" or \\"Complete Madness\\" over this album since those titles give more focus to the band's earlier \\"nutty\\" sound of the Two Tone ska era. Ultimate Collection spans the whole career and in so doing seems to give more equal treatment to the less interesting later electro-pop tunes.

It was a pleasure working with those two and observing them in action to see what it takes to make a \\"top notch\\" product.There was a lot of positive energy throughout the recording of this.My favorites, in order are \\"Do all I can for the Lord\\", \\"In the presence of the Lord\\" then \\"Take a look at the Cross\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Cd's","review":"the cds came in a new package and looked professional.

I found the Secrets of the Power of Intention to be a long version of the Power of Intention, by far the Power of Intention is a disc that will fire up ones sense and the drive to learn more and more.

I hadn't picked up anything by him for a long time but the title of this set seemed to strike me as just what I was looking for and I was glad it was by someone I had once read and enjoyed. But, alas, religious rhetoric abounds and, for me, that means all his credibility is now gone. If you are one of the faithful I am sure you will enjoy these narratives that will undoubtedly confirm all your hopes and beliefs. But, however, if you are, like me, searching for some academic wisdom and insight from a trained and learned professional on how to move forward in this life with peace and understanding of the far too many who profess peace, love, and understanding and yet vote for violence, fear, and hate, then move on, for Dr. Dyer has now joined the ranks of those who would somehow prefer to believe in their ghost stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dis-Appointed with my purchase.","review":"The product I received from vender was missing Disk 2.

If you DO read the book, I believe you'll get even more from Dyer's teachings about intention, and how to make it work in your life.There have been hundreds of reviews written here on Amazon about the book. Lots of those reviews focused on Wayne Dyer himself, and not on the message he tries to convey. That's unfortunate, I think, because the message itself is important.My interpretation of Dyer's message in \\"The Power of Intention\\" (both the CD's and the book) is: Intention is really all about ATTITUDE. YOUR attitude, and how you choose to look at, and think about, life.Hey, we can ALL use an \\"attitude adjustment\\" from time to time. For that reason alone, the book is worth a read, and the CD's are worth a listen.Reviewer: Linda Painchaud-Steinman, Park Edge Books"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple and Fun","review":"Email Games: NASCAR is an enjoyable game. The game plan reminds me of some early auto racing board games that I played when I was a youngster. The install is simple for those with the CD and those invited to play.

If you are looking for instant gratification, this game is not the proper choice, but if you want a nice social game...I highly recommend it.

A Contradiction in Terms","review":"I was excited when I found this book on Amazon, as I have been looking for a primer on critical thinking skills for my elementary school age nephews. Schools are not set up to teach thinking skills, but rather tend to \\"teach to the test,\\" which tends to make them susceptible to suggestion and to the mindless right-wing propaganda that passes for television journalism on FOX NEWS and talk radio these days. Unfortunately, as I read further; I discovered that several reviews reported a \\"Christian perspective\\" and a \\"Christian worldview\\" in the book. The publisher is even named \\"Christian Logic,\\" an obvious contradiction in terms. There is nothing logical about accepting, on faith, the unprovable tenets of religious dogma.Does anyone know of a similar book, suitable for bright 8 and 11 year olds, which is free of religious bias?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bizarre Book","review":"So full of fallacies (by the authors, in their writing) and meandering examples that I couldn't read it beyond a couple of chapters.

Once I reached chapter two, our conversation turned to how the authors used so many fallacies themselves. In the first two paragraphs of chapter two, where the lessons begin, they used three fallacies, one in the first sentence.The writing is also lacking. For example, these homeschooled authors improperly used \\"which\\" multiple times. As a homeschooling dad, I found it troubling that they displayed such a lack of basic skills.I gave the book two stars instead of one, because their ideas are solid.

They come across as the kind of people one would enjoy having next door.Although Tom has gone through two sergeants and is now on his third, played by John Hopkins, Tom is still the glue which holds all of the detecting together and his quiet, laid back manner is easy to watch.

Michael was delicious, and Kylie was a great match for them, with both pushing each other to be more than they were.In the end, though, there was just something missing. I'm not quite sure if it was a pacing issue, or a few of the plot threads being left unfinished, but while this book was a decent way to pass the time, it wasn't one that I'll likely be rereading in the future.Recommended for fans of virgin heroines, heroines with a traumatic past, and of reaching for happiness even when everyone seems determined to keep you down.3.5/5 Stars{Full review appears on The Romanceaholic}"},{"rating":"1","title":"Last Bride of Ballymuir","review":"Ok, but can definitely put it down and forget that I was reading it.

For once, I lucked out and found an excellent book. This is an author worth pursuing. I was delighted to find that this is the first in a trilogy. It was a beautifully written book. The main characters are very human. Their tragic pasts are overcome by the end of the book without syrupy prose and syrupy sweet or too-quaint characterizations of small town village people. The description of life in West Ireland felt realistic. The main and supporting characters had flaws and shared an ironic sense of humor which I found refreshing. Beware, this is a very quick read. You will be left wanting more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much vulgarity","review":"I enjoyed the story of Michael and Kylie and was rooting for them.

Kudos to the author for reminding g us of these lessons."},{"rating":"2","title":"True Irish voice","review":"This is a lovely read, with a true Irish voice and storyline.

Also recommeded to fans of 70's Popol Vuh. But they go a little further out on the ragged psychedelic edge than any of those bands except maybe latter Third Ear Band, and add a little of the 90's trance sound in with the 70's space psyche and ethnic grooves."},{"rating":"1","title":"They changed the recipe!

Most of your readership probably would also wonder why someone would kill turtles. DEAD TURTLES are TURN-OFFS. Having said guy strip the girl of her \\"windbreaker\\" and see her \\"orange tank top\\" is not sexy. Said clothing combination is not hot. Not to anyone.

I rushed to finish it so that I could readLBGL 2. Between the 2 books, it made me angry, alittle teary eyedand somewhat anxious.As I got to the ending of LBGL 2 I tried to slow my reading down because I didn't want the story to end.Now what I need to know is....Is there a part 3 in the making and if not , please, please,please consider it for us readers who simply adore your creativity.........I'm ready to discuss the book now....lol"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read","review":"I read part 1 and 2 and really enjoyed reading about Ms. Johnnie and problems.

This is an extreme exception. The book was very predictable and was just not a good sequel for such a great novel. Suspicion was the only reason why I read and finished this book.The events between Johnnie and Napoleon were predictable along with the events between her Lucas. Johnnie getting to know her family was the most interesting part of the novel and even how that ended was overdramatic and was like watching a \\"soap opera\\"! Good things never need to be fixed and the novel \\"Little Black Girl Lost 2\\" definitely proves that theory. One disappointment won't stir me away from Keith Lee Johnson though I will still purchase his future novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost Time Reading This One....","review":"I read LBGL and it left me wanting more.

At last! A down to the point and powerful experience","review":"I have bought the CD version of this extraordinary work. I haven't done any serious meditation in the past, but this CD has really helped me to focus on what I think my Inner Self might be, throughout the entire day. The morning meditation which uses the 'AH' sound extensively, vibrates through the whole body. You can literally feel yourself manifesting your desires through your 'Third Eye'. How wonderfully exciting! To me it feels like tuning in to the band of Infinite Good, or like logging on to the main server of all Good, every morning. I would highly recommend this tape or CD to literally anyone who understands English. No, in fact, this surpasses language. Everyone should experience it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Meditation CD","review":"I have been meditating for around a year and have found this CD with its two meditations a great addition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Done","review":"I thought this was very poorly done. He does not tell a person how this meditation is usually done. His voice is horrible! It is as if he was in a hurry to make a few dollars and did it without any format or thought into how to present it professionally or with any regard to those who have never meditated before. If I had not read other books on meditation, this would sure be a turn off to meditation. I hope it wasn't just the money. He should be ashamed. I will no longer order his books as I have in the past. Big let down!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Snookered Again by Wayne Dyer","review":"I listened to the first track of the CD. My red flag went up when Dr. Dyer said that these meditations have been secrets for centuries. Of the many marketing seminars I have been in, one of the first things they teach you is to let your buyers know that they are getting in on a secret.The explanation of the Ah meditation continued with meaningless psychobabble. This is the kind of stuff that Gregg Braden uses. Oh, I forgot the Dr. Dyer is very complementary of the charlatan Gregg Braden, and considers him a friend. (You can look Braden's debunkment on YouTube).Dr. Dyer's last book (Wishes Fulfilled: Mastering the Art of Manifesting) was a sincere disappointment to me as his fact checking fell short. I knew then that Dr. Dyer had sold out to the mass market, jump on manifestation topics crowd. He is now like Joe Vitale who just rewarms the last book to come up with another title.But hope springs eternal, and I thought this might work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"Dr. Dyer has produced a simple and effective way of using sound to achieve your desires.

Hasn't this man made enough money yet?","review":"The Wayne Dyer one-man self-help industry never rests it seems!

So I stopped using them. You chant OMMMM over and over .... It's an awful mediation and an awful mediatation. It will put you to sleep. Did nothing for me I threw it out. Wayne Dyer doesn't do much for me. He stole the prayer from St. Francis and made it into a song and refused to pay the Catholic Church. He should practice what he preaches."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hire it Done.","review":"I guess I'm too far in the hole to wish myself out,best get a lawyer and hire it done."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Equalizer","review":"From now on, I'm only reading the 4 star reviews, never the 5 star reviews.It's so fascinating how Dyer manifested so many 5 star reviews from ppl with only 1 review to their name; and so many 1 star reviews with dozens of reviews to their name.Amazon should weigh the sum of the reviews according to how many reviewers have. Simple formula--any reviewer of a book with fewer than 5 reviews to their name doesn't get included in the review avg.On this tape, Dr. Dyer claims that the names of various gods contain the same sound, \\"Ah.\\" Krishna, Allah, Buddha, Ra, God. The problem with that claim is that it is false. Only those who don't read the scriptures believe the name of their god is \\"God.\\" \\"God\\" is the title and office of anybody's god. The name of the Jewish god is \\"Yahweh,\\" or \\"Elohim,\\" or \\"Jehovah.\\" The name for the Christian god is \\"Jesus.\\" Even \\"Christ\\" is not his name, but his title, meaning \\"the savior.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"I could not even start to meditate to this CD.

I find Wayne Dyer very motivating and inspirational. I find the affirmations on the CD to be a helpful way to focus... which is a skill I'm working to improve.

This is my 3rd disc/tape."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I love Wayne Dyer's books and watch his videos on youtube. So I expected a great deal from this CD. I really thought it would be a guided meditation for AM and PM. If this is what you are expecting you will be disappointed. The AM meditaion is 20 mins of literally \\"ah\\" being said over and over... and for the night meditation, 20 mins of \\"om\\" being said over and over. I could have recorded this myself and saved some $$. Buy his books but skip this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love Dyer's work, but not thrilled with this CD","review":"I really like the chanting. It makes it easier for me than just staying quiet. What irks me is that he has a negative affirmation that says, and I'm paraphrasing, \\"my prejudices stop me from seeing the good in other people.\\" I think he meant to say, \\"do not,\\" but reaffirming the negative is not a good thing. Someone should have caught this. Also, he says \\"we're not going to do this the way I do it every day.\\" What's the point in telling the listener that? Aren't we spiritually evolved enough to do it the way he does it? Comes across as condescending. Given the quality of his work, I was really unimpressed with this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"wow...JP OBERG said it best in his review...OM my God AH","review":"coulda done this myself.......

I can't do the meditation at the moment, but just hearing Dr. Dyer's calm voice, his deep breaths, and the sound of AHHHHHHHH is already soothing my stressed out brain.

Not this time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insincere and contrived","review":"I have used meditation tapes and CDs before and this is the worst one I have ever heard.

Very weird...you are just suppose to make ummmmmmmmm noises."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could be better","review":"You only need to listen to Wayne's explanation of the meditation a few times--then make a tape of just the meditation so you don't have to hear the \\"introduction\\" each time. At the end of the meditation I added a chant (Allejuia for the a.m. and Om Nama Shiva for the p.m.) The chants continue the sounds \\"ah\\" for creation and \\"om\\" for gratitude. Then when the meditation is done I can either continue in meditative bliss through the chant or get up and go about my business while listening to the chant. I do wish his chanting of the sounds was more uniform. Some are real short and some long--however I find I just do what I feel comfortable with and it's all good. Japa is a powerful technique and so to get hung up with what Dyer is doing or how or what he is saying is only your own inability to focus. I mean--read the reviews and what great things people are experiencing. The others need to quit whining and just wait until they are more spiritually ready."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for every Day","review":"When I was using this every day I got some incredible results - simply incredible...."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD really works if you do it correctly and every day!","review":"In 1999, I was 40 pounds overweight, had just lost my boyfriend of 5 years to another woman.

You have a morning and an evening meditation...saying 'Ah' and 'Om' along with Dr Wayne Dyer (soothing voice is a big plus)I tried meditating on my own and found it so hard to focus and keep with it. I found that this CD really starts you off on meditation and done over time can greatly improve the whole of your life! Don't be cynical about this, there is such a thing as life after pain~!So highly recommended for anyone looking for true peace and a wonderful life!"},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointed","review":"Let me start by saying that I have read and enjoyed a number of Dyer's books. I was really excited to receive my CD in the mail and listened to it immediately. It was so disappointing to realize that the majority of this meditation is simply composed of the sounds of AH or OM. I had thought it would be something more on the order of guided imagery.Still, I was willing to give it a try until I realized that it would require listening to (seemingly) endless minutes of tone-deaf chanting. I hate to sound petty but the wandering pitch was enough to set my teeth on edge and was distracting to the point that I could not focus on anything else.Those who are not bothered by that sort of thing might find this to be a powerful tool to start a meditation practice. Those who are experienced or who are sensitive to pitch can save themselves $10 and a headache by chanting AH in the morning while focusing on creating your day and OM in the evening while focusing on being grateful for your day."},{"rating":"2","title":"FUN AND EFFECTIVE","review":"I also found this cassette strange at first, but soon started to enjoy the ?ahing? and ?auming.? Side A is the ?ah? side for manifesting what you want via Siddhi Consciousness which is induced by controlled breathing and repeating the ?ah? sound while imagining an energy flow between your root and third eye chakras. (Interesting that the name of the deity has this sound in most languages - God, Brahma, Shiva, Krishna, Allah, Tao, Ra etc.) Side B is expressing gratitude through the ?aum? sound. Soon I had some transcendent (and scary) moments because you can feel something happening at the third eye - my dogs who meditate on top of and around me, also got a bit frightened once or twice. But it was worth the effort because the manifestation did take place. Now I use this tape perhaps once a month for the pleasure of it. I can understand that some people might find it a bit weird but I'm all the richer for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I am a newby to meditation. What I got from this CD could've been said in 1 sentence - chant 'AHhhhhhhhhhhhh' in the morning and 'Ohmmmmmmmm' at night. This is a huge waste of money. This is not a guided meditation. The author chants 'Ah' and 'Ohm' throughout. The voice is too loud and distracting."},{"rating":"2","title":"What an amazing experience!","review":"This tape surpasses words. It is extradinary and done with such simplicity. The morning meditation help me learn what I wanted to manifest in my life and see it happen. The evening meditation left me with absolute peace."},{"rating":"1","title":"This will work on your l-a-s-t nerve!!","review":"Basically I agree with the others who gave this a one-star review.Wayne Dyer begins this piece fine by talking about how we can manifest good things by the thoughts in our minds. Then he goes on to demonstrate how to meditate by repeating the chant \\"A-h-h-h-h\\" for half the CD, then by chanting \\"O-m-m-m-m-m\\" for the second half.This is NOT a tape or CD to listen to on the way to work or while jogging. Being stuck in a car with Dr. Dyer repeating a mantra non-stop for 45 minutes will make anyone go postal. If I hadn't ejected this tape, rolled down the window and tossed it into the high-density lane, I would have become an axe murderer by the end of my commute."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made Me Lose Confidence in PBS","review":"I bought this a while back after seeing a presentation by Wayne Dyer as part of a pledge program on PBS. After listening to the CD, I realized that the fact that something is on public television is no guarantee that the subject matter is well-researched or scientifically valid. I gave up after Dyer started a meditation exercise citing various words for God in various languages observing that they sounded alike -- they sounded nothing alike.The only heart's desire created in me by this product was to stop listening to this nonsense forthwith.I also realized that those PBS programs with therapists and doctors should be treated with the same skepticism I reserve for infomercials."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"One of the main tenets of meditation is to become quite within and concentrate on the inner being. Quite the conscious mind and connect with one's inner being. Dr. Dyer on this CD attempts to rewrite 5,000 years of meditation practices. Dr. Dyer is the only person that I am aware of that suggests that chanting is a form of meditation - I wonder what Gandhi would think? I am greatly disappointed with this CD and if I had known what was on it I would never have purchased it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weird","review":"I didn't like this one bit. The meditations are just too weird. He uses the sounds ohm and ahh. It's hard to get into and a bit uncomfortable. Since he leads the meditation, it was too personal and I kept feeling like I was spying on him in his bedroom. He has other much better CDs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"I bought this hoping that it would help me learn to meditate and help me with my manifestations. However, as other reviewers have already noted, it is nothing but Dr. Dyer saying AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH and UUUUUUUUUUUMMMMMMMMM. The \\"evening\\" side had him giving 14 (it seemed like 1400) ways to get close to God. I was so annoyed that I certainly didn't feel any closer to God.I listed to it once and am returning it to Amazon. Don't waste your time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It must work, it manifested my money!","review":"I have nothing against Mr. Dyer and if it works for you, then that is more than you can ever ask. My personal experience was I bought this at a down time in my life. I tried Dr. Dyer's formula religiously morning and night for 3 months. I found nothing different happening especially in the specific areas that I was focusing. Do you know what I ended up finding out ... There is no magic pills. Bad things happen to good people. If you persever long enough, you can reinvent yourself and pick yourself up by your bootstraps. Then as you finally think you are making progress... things are going well, you get knocked back down and kicked around. Looking back, I've found that my beatings were actually preparing me for future successes. Meditation, Prayer, and thoughtful planning help, but... there are no magic pills.May you find the answers to your problems!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Chi Congestion Anyone","review":"This CD teaches one to raise the Chi up the spine without also teaching that the Chi must descend the spine. This course of action can cause serious damage you. I do not recommend it to people unless they are very experienced in yoga. Also, the manifestations I was hoping for did not occur. There is hope, however, look up psycho-cybernetics, matt furey, and zero resistance living. A little costly, however, Matt Furey's \\"Magnetic Mind Power\\" has already got me past the first round of interviews with Morgan Stanley after five days of practice."},{"rating":"1","title":"This guy writes too many books","review":"I hate it when an author has too many books. Why can't they just combine some volumes and get their point across and stop leaching money from people. You have to chant with this, its AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUUUUUU in the morning while thinking of the feeling you would have when whatever you want to happen happens, and then AAAAAAAAAAUUUUUUUUUUUUMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM in the evening to say thanks (that's all). This is a rehash of positive thinking or affirmations with some chanting thrown in to keep the mind on track - your roommates will hate this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Refreshing","review":"This is such a nice break from what other Egyptian artists are doing. Amr Diab has lost all sense of what is good and the Rai artists are starting to sound alike. I haven't heard anything this refreshing since Khaled's \\"Sahra\\" when it was new. Definitely a must buy for anyone interested or already into middle eastern rhythms."},{"rating":"1","title":"IT'S A TRAP","review":"DO NOT BUY THIS! It is the biggest rip off I have found on amazon. I got a single bracelet and I paid TEN DOLLARS for it. It isn't even that great a product. Don't waist your money like I did!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Low Price, Works Great","review":"I've been using this card for about a month now. It was easy to install and cost about half the price of similar cards. Overall, a good buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great card for the price","review":"I have been using this card for about a month & all is well so far. My transfer speed before was 80 mbps & now it's 300 mbps. I am limited by the hard drive speed.I set it up by first disabling the on board ethernet via the bios before I installed the software. I then installed the card..no problems on 64 bit vista.The inital setup was the default with dhcp enabled and it worked fine.I then set up a static ip with no problems like one of the reviewers had. Possibly he made the same mistake I initially did...you have to set up a gateway and dns server manually when you use a static ip.The gateway is the ip address of your router.The dns can be set to the same address and it will use whatever is used by the router."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"Excellent Ethernet Card.Installation couldn't have been easier: I plugged it in the PCI slot, booted up and Windows 7 installed the driver (I don't know if it was downloaded or if windows used a generic driver and then upgraded the driver; the card comes with an installation CD so you should be fine).I haven't played with the settings yet but I'm getting around 80MB/s on file transfers. It bursts at around 120/130 MB/s for a few seconds then goes \\"down\\" to 80MB/s (on a gigabit network of course).I use it for my server/media center. File transfers and HD streaming are no problems : a 11.5GB mkv video streams perfectly, I don't have anything bigger.I'm very happy with my purchase, I wasn't expecting it to be this fast. I don't think you can find a better performance/price ratio anywhere else.Well done Trendnet, well done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid and cheap","review":"We used this adapter as our second NIC for our DMZ. Plugged it in and it worked just fine. Solid performance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Did what it is supposed to do...","review":"My pc's mobo had gigabit LAN & it stopped working, checked the reviews on Amazon for a card & this one seemed like a good pick. Installed it & booted the pc up & connected the cat6 & it worked immediately, no need to even load the drivers from the included dvd - excellent!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer beware!","review":"The product may or may not have worked but it cost me over half the price of the item just to view it. I probably could have gone to a regular retailer and seen an unopened package for free."},{"rating":"2","title":"hate wireless","review":"At first I could not get it to go in my computer,contacted the technical dept. In the mean time my nephew got it in for me. So by the time tech sent an email I didn't need them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Average Gigabit PCI Adapter","review":"It is a pretty good adapter. I didn't use the driver software that it came with because it was outdated instead It automatically found the necessary driver it needed on my pc and updated the driver using windows update. I haven't had any problems with it and it seems like it does just as good as the more expensive brands out there. I would recommend buying this one before wasting your money on something that costs twice as much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Windows Home Server","review":"I purchased this card for installation in my WHS machine (an old HP Pavilion a775c Desktop PC. One of the easiest installs. Follow directions and voila!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Had to Return","review":"I couldn't get Windows XP to recognize the card.
