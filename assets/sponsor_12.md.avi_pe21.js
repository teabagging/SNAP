The work is superbly written to be enjoyed and understood by all readers. The artwork presented within the book is reason enough to own the book. Add to this the fact that you are supporting a great cause and probably gaining information you have never thought about before and you have a real winner. I am still amazed at the way Riki manages to get the names(sometimes in Latin)of all the flora and fauna included in the text while still maintaining the reader's interest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perpetual tangents","review":"The title of this book should read \\"I Love Orffyreus.\\" After reading this book, and being sorely disappointed with the last chapter, I felt compelled to warn others that this highly subjective book is neither revealing, nor solving. The author offers nothing in the way of physics to make a case for his speculation on gravity, and how it might provide a loophole in the conservation of energy. It reminds me of 17th century patent filers who offered nothing but drawings and thoughts."},{"rating":"1","title":"sorry","review":"I understand that fans want to love everything Fogerty does, cause I'm a fan and I do as well. But this is repetitive and inferior stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"Did anyone at Geffen Records actually LISTEN to this collection before giving it the thumbs-up? Could someone not have said, \\"John! We gave you seven years, and THIS is what you deliver?\\" I am giving it a maximum of two stars out of genuine goodwill. I'm a lifelong Fogerty fan, and I admire his body of work. But this CD ranges from blatant copies of his earlier songs, to repetitious tuneless pop. With all due respect, Fogerty's fans who counted down the days to this release are owed an apology."},{"rating":"1","title":"what exactly is the point..","review":"After several decades of entertaining it's obvious that Fogerty doesn't have much to say anymore. The songs I listened to, only six of them before I ejected the disc, are predictable and mediocre. Kudos for the musicianship, but I'll stick with a few CCR discs and \\"Centerfield.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"I love old CCR but this CD is not very good","review":"Seven years between albums and this is the best Mr. Fogerty can come up with? I would be hard pressed to pick more than one, much less two songs, off this CD for any homemade complilation disc. I read a few reviews today before picking this up and wasn't expecting much but I really like most everything John Fogerty has done in the past so I took a chance on it. Needless to say, it's much worse than I was even prepared for. I figured if half the songs were decent than it'd be worth it, but sorry to say, that's not the case at all here. John Fogerty may be in a happy place in his life and good for him. It just doesn't translate into very interesting music I'm afraid. Don't be fooled by all the four and five star Fogerty slappy reviews, this disc isn't worth the price of admission. Save your money and pick up a copy of Centerfield, Blue Moon Swamp, or any CCR disc you might not already own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seven Years For This?","review":"It's been seven years since John Fogerty released the excellent 'Blue Moon Swamp' and the thought that kept going through my head as I listened to this CD for the first time was \\"It took him 7 years to come up with this mess?\\" There are certainly some good songs on the CD...the title track is a catchy, poignant and melodic song that sounds exactly like CCR, which is not a bad thing. But songs such as 'Radar' and \\"She Got Baggage' are simply horrible - like something a band of 13 year olds would come up with in their garage. Even the songs that are musically pleasing ('Honey Do' 'I Will Walk With You' 'Nobody Here Anymore') are filled with the type of inane lyrics you would expect from a teenager, not the creator of 'Fortunate Son.' If it is taking John Fogerty 7 years to comeup with this type of music and lyrics, he might want to give it up now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deja Vu'd out!","review":"If after waiting 7 years for a new Fogerty studio album, the best adjective I can ascribe to it is 'pleasant' then by John's exacting standards ( and indeed by the equally stringent expectations of his loyal fans) then this album is pretty much a flop. 'Pleasant' in this instance is a euphemism for colourless and unexciting, and in the case of most of the tracks, downright boring. John has always, quite rightly, delved deeply into his musical past, much to the delight of us old CCR fans. It worked admirably on albums like Centrefield and Blue Moon Swamp, but I fear the previously unexhaustable well of musical talent may now have dried up. I hope not. I love John Fogerty's music but if this is all that remains then now is the time to retire gracefully, rather than just fading away. 'Pleasant' is not a word I want to describe John by."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious Familiarity All Over Again","review":"I am a life long fan of CCR and John Fogerty but this is definitely one to avoid. There is only one good song - the title track. The rest is a mixture of familar CCR riffs and immediately forgettable country/folk/rock influenced songs with absolutely terrible lyrics. Mark Knopfler plays the Sultans Of Swing riff in the background on one track and that was probably the lowpoint of the album. Even John's thoughts on today's world are immature and unoriginal. Listen to Don Henley or Jackson Browne. I wanted to like the album but after repeated listenings it actually gets worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uggh!","review":"Maybe two good songs including the title track, but the rest is very weak. I can't bear to listen to this again. I will remain a fan of his earlier work, but this effort is extremely disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's just bad","review":"Where can I start talking about how dissapointed I am with this album. The title track, although slightly copying \\"Who Will Stop the Rain\\", was fairly good....I've never been more disgusted than when I heard the gut-wrenchingly bad Ramones rip-off \\"She's Got Baggage\\". Only the title track, \\"I will walk with you\\" and \\"Wicked Old Witch\\" (which I liked the first time......when it was called \\"Green River\\" sound like John Fogerty, and lyrically, all of the other songs on this album are some of the most shallow and vapid things I've ever heard the man produce.Considering Blue Moon Swamp was the album that inspired me to play guitar, I feel horribly let down by this album"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth every penny","review":"It may not be his best ever but when you hold it up to the dim light of what is being produced in music these days it shines very brightly, indeed. John avoids over-thinking and over-producing these clever and well thought-out songs. The guitar playing is excellent throughout, as usual. Overall, it's a good listen and easily one of his better efforts. One note, though. John, why not write a song protesting the ruthless terrorists?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fogerty rules","review":"The greatest rock legend ever strikes back with another amazing record. Pure roots rock, the way it was ment to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Short Sweet and To The Point","review":"If you like John C. Fogerty / CCR then you will like this CD. If you don't, then nothing on this disc will change your mind. Saw this man in concert in KC in 2006 with Willie Nelson and he puts on a good show. The title track and Nobody's Here Anymore are vintage Fogerty and are the two best tracks on the disc. The rest are good for any Fogerty fan. My only complaint is that the disc is too short."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 great song-rest forgettable","review":"There is no doubt that the title track is exceptional and about as good anyhting Fogerty has ever recorded. However, the rest of the Cd is just bland. By no means are the remaining nine songs lousy, just instantly forgettable. While I think this release will please Fogerty fans, I doubt the typical listener will enjoy more than the 1st song on this so-so album."},{"rating":"1","title":"one good song","review":"This cd has only one good song. Definitely not worth the full price and a disappointment for a long time Fogerty fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dear John","review":"Is it just me or is this an experiment of some sort to see if John still has what it takes? Aside from Rhubarb Pie and Wicked Old Witch I found the fare to be bland at best, lacking the fullness of Johns previous work both solo and with CCR. Not to demean John's guitar work in any way but who is he trying to be? I could swear I heard Clapton and Knopfler in there. That driving beat that was CCR is missing and I think that's what the real fans were looking for. In any case John you still get E for effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Fogerty Album Ever","review":"Seven years for this? Its hard to belive that Deja Vu came the same man behind the brilliant Blue Moon Swamp. Save for one track, Wicked Old Witch, this is a truly horrible album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deja Vu Misses the Mark","review":"This record is a MAJOR disappointment. John is showing his age by recording mostly insipid acoustic disasters incorporated with unusually shallow lyrics. The album's highlight is Wicked Old Witch which is the only song that comes close to what we would normally expect from John, but then the poor arrangement (the song is far too short) ruins it. Unless you are a die-hard fan, do yourself a favor and don't waste your money on this half-hearted effort. For you die-hards (myself included), we just have to shake our heads and wonder how an artist with John's ability can spend seven years working on a record and still have it come out sounding like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only 'cause I remember when","review":"I would have thought J.C. would have grown up by now, with his immature political views. That being said, What's up with this 35 minutes, for $15-20 Crap?!? Wonder why people are pirating music on the internet? There's your answer!!The songs on this CD wouldn't even make good b-sides of Creedence singles. It's very sad to see my inspiration to be a singer decline like this. With any luck, sales will suck so bad, it'll wake him up. He'll get more chances, because he's politically correct, so we may get more good music out of him.We can only pray. (OOPS! Didn't mean to mention God!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic!","review":"I love Creedence, and love John's solo music.HOWEVER, this is a total piece of s***. Devu Ju is trying to tie the Iraq war to Vietinam, but sounds like a whining coward afraid of standing up to a bully. Honey Do is just plain stupid, and none of the songs stand out.This is a guy who's written dozens of the greatest songs in our lives, and this is the best he can do? Pathetic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The album of the year!","review":"I've been a John Fogerty fan since 1968. Creedence was my favorite band and I've also loved all of John's solo work. Deja Vu All Over Again may be his best solo collection yet. Some listeners may initially be put off by the variety of styles represented here (there are songs that don't have that signature Fogerty sound) but everything works. After a week of living with the new CD, I find that almost every song sticks in my head. Deja Vu All Over Again is a real treat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Melodic Metal/Hard Rock","review":"This is about as good as it gets in the melodic metal and hard rock category. Every song is catchy and Rob has one the best voices in any form of music period! Fans of his work with Impellitteri will not be disappointed. Producer Roy Z puts in a solid performace on guitar and former Ozzy guitarist Jake E. Lee turns up on two tracks. One of the best albums of 2000!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Authoritarian to the extreme","review":"I used to read the paperback version of Analog which I enjoyed very much. One of the reasons that I bought a Kindle is to read Analog. Although the Kindle format is great, I am extremely disappointed in the degeneration of Analog content. It's editorials have taken an extreme authoritarian bent - hackers are evil, always obey the government, you need to give up civil liberties so you can be protected from the other etc. The story quality is poor as well. Thanks to Kindle, I have discovered Light Speed magazine which contains much higher quality stories. I can highly recommend Light Speed magazine as an antidote to the poor writing, extreme authoritarian bent and incoherent editorials of Analog."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absurd Price!!!","review":"$5.99 per month, without images.

This is just absurd pricing."},{"rating":"2","title":"New to Analog - experienced Kindly version only","review":"As I say in the title, I'm new to Analog having subscribed to it only by Kindle. I'm loving it. I had no idea the Kindle version was more expensive than the print version. While I find this curious, I don't have a preexisting view of a fair price for this magazine. As such, I think the $2.99 per month with instant delivery to a much more pleasant reading format (Kindly versus paper), I'm pretty happy.My delight in Analog is a credit both to the magazine and to the Kindle.

At one point I had a back issue collection with over half the issues published in the nineteen thirties alone. I had every issue published in the fifties. It was great.I love the magazine.I love the Kindle.I will NEVER buy Analog from Amazon as long as they continue the abominable practice of deleting back issues. Just yesterday I downloaded issues from another site I bought in 2006.All I want is for back issues of Analog to be treated like any normal kindle book. I buy them, I keep them. End of story.Why is it so incredibly hard for Amazon to understand that people want to keep what they pay for?Buy Analog, read Analog, but if you want to do so from Amazon get the paper copies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Caveat Emptor - This is Not a Subscription, It's a Rental Agreement","review":"For all those of you who were, like me, considering replacing your subscription to the physical copy of the magazine with a Kindle supscription, think twice.As things are on April 28th 2011, you will not be able to keep your magazine collection anywhere else except on the Kindle, which will eventually fill your Kindle's memory and make it unusable for anything else.I believe that subscription means that every issue of the magazine I buy is mine to keep and store as I please. If there are restrictions to this, than I do not really own the copy. I own the right to keep it for a certain time.

You cannot use ANY of the features common to other magazines (I also get the Atlantic and Readers Digest.You can't search, go to the index, skip and article or story, etc. I e-mailed the publisher and they said they were aware of the problem and were working on a fix.

There was no table of contents. No way to go to the next article or story without hitting next page repeatedly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overpriced","review":"No other way to put it, this is grossly overpriced. It's much more expensive than a standard subscription.I can understand that maybe Dell is doing this intentionally, because if everyone dumped their paper subscriptions for the kindle version, they'd have trouble making ends meet for the remaining print subscribers. Maybe it's just doomed to fail anyhow.I suppose that puts me in the terrible position of hoping the print circulation drops enough that they have to drop paper subscriptions entirely, and switch to the lower-cost e-publishing distribution method. Maybe then the price will come down to something reasonable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't get if using Kindle for iPad","review":"I tried purchasing Analog using Kindle on my iPad. I got the message that I must have a Kindle to purchase this. To lock content like this to only your device seems to be a poor business decision. I'm not going to buy another (limited) reading device for one type of content. Amazon, do you want to sell content or do you want to sell hardware? You seem to be doing a poor job at doing both."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overpriced and delayed delivery killed my interest","review":"I've been a subscriber to the paper version of Analog for many years and love the magazine. However, my 3 year subscription to the paper version only cost me $86. The Kindle subscription would cost me $36/year or $107.64!!! This is $21 MORE than my paper subscription. If the price were more like $2.00/month, I'd get it ($72/3 years).Then, the delivered issue was the May 1st issue when I'd just read the June issue. A one month delay did not excite me at all and has been mentioned by other reviewers.I'd really like to have all my magazines on my Kindle. BUT, I will not be sc....d over on the price and delivery. Amazon can do without this sale.PS: Love the 14 day trial periods. This was just a bad choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"New Format","review":"With the newest issue, which I received last night on my Kindle, the formatting has been updated and greatly improved. There is now a great and wonderful menu for the whole issue. Really looking forward to reading it!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pricing makes no sense","review":"If you submitted a short story to Analog about a dystopian future where ephemeral and unlimited digital copies of actual physical items cost more than the originals, they'd reject it for being completely nonsensical.Yet at six bucks an issue from Canada, its actually significantly cheaper to just subscribe directly and get the physical version mailed to your door from the publisher.Publishers like Dell get their act together and work with Amazon to ensure their pricing reflects the reality of their (essentially non-existent) digital distribution costs. This type of punitive pricing does nothing but insult your potential readership and encourage them to pirate your content rather than buying it at a fair market price. Until then, the minor convenience of having an automatic subscription just can't compete with the minimal effort it takes to find a pirated version for free."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful book","review":"Growing up I had access to many books of many types; I remember loving G'Dee.I recently had my first child, and while there are many things I want to give her and share with her, this book is at the top of the list!

Nick meets Amanda Van Patton and quickly convinces her to marry him. But, although he has the bride he doesn't have the marriage in the more traditional sense. Amanda discovers the bet Nick made and their marriage turns from one of possible happiness to avoidance and unwillingness to be together. Their relationship is actually funny and Amanda isn't the typical Harlequin female - she has a brain and a sharp wit and uses both. This book is far from great, but it provides some entertainment and is slightly better (and longer) than the average Harlequin. The book cover says it's a Harlequin Western, but it's not at all western."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Work","review":"I just got these and can't make them work.

Even more amazing after I realized it was based on a true story."},{"rating":"1","title":"No sympathy no surprise","review":"One of the worst films I have seen about children suffering. I am sorry maybe it is because I have not been in dire straits before, but I sat down thinking this movie was about boys being prepared to enter Hitler's army (horrfic), or about boys in some concentration camp (Profoundly sad). The only thing this movie was about was boys in a Juvenile delinquent type facility and the people in charge not properly taking care of them. Yes, the dude molested the boys but that was one person. You mean to tell me he molested every single one of them? Another thing when they took over the camp didn't they think the brigade would come in? And since the governor brought it up in one of the conversations, would the boys prefer prison instead of the facility? To me in prison their arse would of been raped most likely as well.How about making a film about black boys being arrested falsely and sent to prison. Not juvenile hall but jail with the big bad monsters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ives seems to have bought the farm.","review":"For a mystery book, this novel fails at every turn. The main character, a young boy named Charlie, begins his life growing up on a farm where his father attacks him with terrible non-harmonies and atrocities music was never intended to produce. Soon, Charlie is swept up by the idea that music need not to sound pretty, and that life be filled with hesitance and incompletion. This novel falls short when it start to focus, only a few pages in, on Charlie's Second Piano Sonata. Why the auther chose this, the most unanticipated work since Garfunkel's \\"Songs From a Parent to a Child\\", on which to base a story of suspense is beyond me. The most disappointing point to all of this is that Geoffrey Block, a man with so promising a name, could fall so far from genius. Don't let his IQ fool you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good field guide for edible mushrooms","review":"Great book, sized for easy packing in a knap sack (5.5 x 8.5). It's the nice photographs with complete descriptions that makes this the right book to pick edible mushrooms, or collect mushroom photos and know what you have. Although this book is geared for the New England Region, it also is applicable to the Northeastern US and Canada. His details include: cap color, edibility, size, spore print, shape, gills, texture, flesh, stalk, habit/habitat, distrubution and season, with photo of each. One to keep if you can find it."},{"rating":"1","title":"WTH?","review":"How do you get money out of a failed sex video project? One answer is to make some kind of documentary out of it. I figured this might not be everything I was hoping for. I got that right. If you are looking for nudity, acting, dialogue, story, some kind of significant documentary, or even entertainment, you would do better with a bowl of cold oatmeal. However, if you are inspired by half an hour of a red plastic shirt and you have two dollars that you can't think of anything else to do with, then this is your video. Sometimes there is almost a kind of pathetic humor in how the guy describes what happened, but not enough to make me watch more than a few minutes at a stretch. This could have been funny, but by the time he gets to the cops coming in, I was hoping they would just shoot him, and apparently it wasn't even worth getting excited about anyway. You are in no danger of prosecution for anything with this, or of staying awake either."},{"rating":"2","title":"An enthusiastic guide for your first trip","review":"This book is for everyone who wants to be like Dennis Tito and Mark Shuttleworth but doesn't have the millions to spend yet. Because this book tells what it must have felt like for them to be genuine space tourists, and at the same time gives all potential space tourists good hopes for regular affordable trips to space in the near future. It is enthusiastically written, with lots of details about what each space tourist should know and be prepared for, with the occassional twink of the eye, or a critical look where that is needed."},{"rating":"2","title":"a sensitive memoir of a difficult childhood , followed by a rewarding adulthood.","review":"Fernando Colon tells of a childhood in a nurturing foster home, occasional visits by his father, success in schools, achieving a PHD in Clinical Psychology and becoming a professor in a prestigious university. It focuses on his need to search for his Puerto Rican roots and the truth about the mother he never knew. Throughout the narrative his love for his wife and children shines through. It is a very touching story."},{"rating":"1","title":"some real gems, but some paste","review":"This album was released back in 1988, by which time Aerosmith were signed to Geffen, and their former label Columbia were understandably keen to capitalise on the band's resurgence. They'd already put out a pair of \\"Classics Live\\" albums, which were good enough, but this collection is nothing short of a cynical cash-in.With such a wealth of material at hand, the previous \\"Greatest Hits\\" compilation was bound to overlook a number of classics, but there's no excuse for this second anthology to do just the same. Sure, there are some good songs on here, but there are plenty of better ones that aren't: what about S.O.S (Too Bad), Lightning Strikes, Seasons of Wither, Sight for Sore Eyes?What you actually get is a seemingly random selection of album tracks with a few genuine \\"gems\\" scattered throughout. If you already have the \\"Greatest Hits\\" and want to investigate more of the early material you should just buy \\"Toys in the Attic\\" and \\"Rocks\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Expected","review":"I have listened to the 3 cd box set that has self titled aerosmith, get your wings, and toys in the attic. This album didn't compare to those and was totally disappointed. Get those three and their current albums, this album belongs in the waste of money bin."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Much-Needed Counterpart To Greatest Hits","review":"Although Gems was created purely for money-making purposes (well sorta) it is worthwhile if you don't already own these songs. This is sorta a collection of some of Aerosmith's most underrated songs (the band chose them), with \\"Round And Round\\" and one of the band's better but underrated cuts \\"Nobody's Fault\\" among others on the album. This, like I said before, is a good album if you don't already own these songs, but if you do, then the only reason you'd want it is to complete your Aerosmith album collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the beef?","review":"Anderson and Beason try unsuccessfully to combine the particle physics subject matter of hard sci-fi author Gregory Benford with the \\"I'm just a good-old FBI agent\\" narrative approach of Tom Clancy.While the story successfully presents a mystery involving high-energy particle physicists, there is very little technical content to go along with it. Besides having predictable 1-dimensional characters (just like Clancy) the book has its share of other aggravations. For starters, it contains a critical overuse of the unheard of term, \\"towelhead\\", describing East Indians that wear turbans. And let's not forget the \\"sepia-eyed\\" nurse whose too often quoted expression is that she \\"never felt this helpless since Chernobyl\\" and did we mention that she was \\"sepia-eyed\\"? Oh yes and just in case you didn't get it before, her eyes are the color of, what's that, oh yes \\"sepia\\". ARRGGG!!

The movie also came well in advance of when they said it would so that was great as well!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe not completely worthless... (2 STARS)","review":"Yes this album does only have 8 tracks (7 of them live), the quality of the performance and the production is pretty poor, but it does include some interesting tunes, namely \\"Three Mile Smile\\" and \\"Train Kept a Rollin'\\" that fans wouldn't expect them to put on the record. That still isn't enough to make a potential listener want to buy, much less create a new Aerosmith fan. In essence, your money is much better spent on \\"Bootleg\\" which is a more complete performance and collection of songs (but still only rates 5 out of 10). They need to go through old master tapes of performances and make a killer two disc live set from the 70's a la Zeppelin's \\"How the West Was Won.\\"The real attraction is the definitive recording of \\"Major Barbara.\\" It's better than the recording used on the \\"Pandora Box Set.\\" That still doesn't make it worth your 10 dollars. \\"Classics Live 2\\" is better, but not by much.Overall: 4 out of 10."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Bad... pretty good actually","review":"I Like this album... the only thing that is bad about it is that it was too short for a live album... also it didn't have alot of the really good songs... though it did have some good ones like Dream On, Sweet Emotion, and Kings and Queens. Dream on is my favorite Aerosmith song and for some reason i liked the way it counded on this album... I actually like the way it sounds on this album better than the origional recording... same thing goes for kings and queens... anyway.. it sounds good but it's too short."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Must\\" reading for all parents of argumentative kids.","review":"As every parent learns, disagreements with their children are inevitable and can lead to exasperated feelings and harsh, life affecting disputations.

In Tired Of Arguing With Your Kids? she shares the best and most effective of these. Arguing with kids may be inevitable, but it doesn't have to be exhausting, emotionally scarring, unproductive, or futile.

I am new to meditation, but Bodhipaksa makes it simple and accessible. There is no background music (which is really a good thing), and his voice is very soothing and pleasant. He also allows you to count your breaths at your own pace, instead of counting out loud the entire time, which can make you feel rushed or distracted. The Metta Bhavana is my favorite. It helps you cultivate \\"lovingkindness\\" towards yourself and others, and it is very effective.The title says it all: \\"For calmness, awareness, and love.\\"Bodhipaksa also has a really great website listed on the cd cover. I found very helpful information on meditation posture and other things.I would recommend this to anyone interested in meditation. I can't say enough about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good","review":"Good introduction to meditation. The narrator's voice is soothing and has a calming feeling to it. I have fallen asleep listening to this Cd and quite honestly have never made it to the walking meditation.Although as others mention, it is absent of music, I found it barely noticeable.I also highly recommend Deepak's Healing of the Soul, and Lite's Indigo Dreams:Adult Relaxation. All of these CDs have been helping me to lower my anxiety levels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't get better than this","review":"I've listened to many guided meditation CD's, including some by Joseph Goldstein and Sharon Salzburg, but even those teachers can't compare with this CD. There's something incredibly relaxing about Bodhipaksa's voice that guides you easily and quickly into a relaxed state.I'll come back to this CD over and over again.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Guided Meditation for Calmness and Awareness","review":"Very nice. Calming. Both his gentle voice and manner as well as his understanding of the process help you to comfortably move to a new level.Thanks. PS, after listening to this CD several times I plan to order other works that they also do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anything but relaxing","review":"This seemed to be very highly rated and my own doctor recommended it but I could NOT get into this CD at all. There is no music, which for some may be great, but for others like me is just distracting. Listen to the clip first carefully before you consider buying; if the gentleman's voice seems to go in one ear and out the other, then beware. I could not concentrate on his voice in the least. I've listened to many guided meditations before and never had that problem. I really enjoy guided meditation but this CD did nothing but raise my blood pressure. It just did not click with me and I'm still surprised at how many people liked it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nicely done","review":"Agree with all of the positive comments. The speaker has a lovely, gentle Scottish lilt and a very calming \\"way with him\\".It would be nice to have two versions of the guided breathing meditation, the 2nd one having a little less coaching, but that is about the only criticism I would have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good","review":"Although I haven't listened to the CD in full, I can tell you that this guy is very good, and I will actually listen to this one again, and again....especially since I just quit smoking! Good voice, techniques, very therapeutic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for beginners, yet excellent for everyone","review":"This CD is very calming--the first meditation focuses on breathing, the second guides you through the Buddhist metta bhavana--loving kindness toall, and the third is a meditation to be used when walking. Bodhipaksa is originally from Scotland, so there is a little accent to his voice, but it is very soothing and not at all distracting. If you are a beginner to meditation, this CD will walk you through all the steps of relaxing and breathing as well as sending out the positive thoughts of love and kindness that will be returned to you. We have several CD's, but this one is a favorite that we choose most often."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I've used guided meditations in the past. This is not a meditation guide, it's a breathing guide.

I always begin each session with a shavasana guided orally by me. I recommend this CD I purchased through Amazon to give the yoga leader a chance to listen to someone else's soothing voice. I have thus far only listened to the beginning portion which breaks just at a good time space for a short beginning meditation. I am sure the rest of the CD is adaptable for all kinds of meditation needs.

With all the rave reviews I thought it would be wonderful, but I found it only average. I was dissapointed that there wasn't any music, no sound in the silence (I can do that without the CD). Also, I had a bit of trouble understanding him. I don't know if it's the quality of the recording or his accent, but I felt like I had to work really hard to figure out what he was saying.

It is the same style as this 803, but the 801 appears to be unavailable now--I bought mine on Amazon. It is at least as loud as my fridge, which makes it marginally quieter than my Whisper 20, but still way too loud to live in the same house with. I have an ancient Tetra pump that is quiet, but I haven't been able to find any modern pumps nearly so tolerable.

Yet what makes Iceland a fascinating piece of literature is that it appears to withstand any form of categorization. It seems to lack genre, blending the realistic and mundane with the absurd and allegorical.I take this as an indication of an author who is unafraid of taking risks. Krusoe seems uninterested in catering to the need, that many readers have, of being able to categorize a literary composition. By refusing to commit to any genre, Krusoe's writing does not supply the means for the reader to produce a schema. This might frustrate some readers, as they won't have a clue to where the writing will lead them. However, this will stimulate many other readers, as they will regard it as liberation from a dogmatic rule of writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"the vacation every mind can use","review":"jim krusoe's iceland pulls us far from the linear, upwardly mobile, have-to-hurry-to-get-to-the-next-meeting life that so many americans lead. his meditations bring out the poetry of such things as the stain in a carpet, or the scar on the girl youre naked in a swimming pool with, surrounded by real live organs. ... theres enough imagination in this book, coupled with original prose, to qualify it as virtual travel, to list it not with the book reviews but with the accounts of exotic destinations. paul, the novel's narrator, takes his cues from the idiosyncratic, the arcane, the things we have to squint to see in the background of a painting on a wall, and lets this be the guiding light. a great book. can not say enough good things about it.-jamie brisick"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ambiguous - and not in a good way.","review":"I found this book to be extremely pretentious and uninspiring.

There's many other publications out there that will give you better advice on retirement. It seemed like the writers attempted to make up for this by injecting a heavy dose of humor into their articles, unfortunately the jokes often fell well short of their mark.

Although it's always funny, this season is more of a drama with wit.And people say they can't relate?! Puh-lease! I totally identified with the characters this season. Steve moves in with Miranda--who hasn't had those same feelings (i.e., will this really work? Are we moving too fast?). Who doesn't have the same hopes of a relationship working out?

I can hardly wait for the next season!"},{"rating":"2","title":"this show rocks!!","review":"I own the first two seasons of Sex and the City, and I think the third season is the best. I like it because it is not all about sex in this season. It is about actuall relationships and what can go wrong with them. Of course Sam does not change. She just continues to have sex and that's about it. I think if you have just one season of Sex and the City, you need to get them all. You can just follow the story line better.

Some of the most important developments of Season Three include: Carrie's relationship with Aidan, Mr. Big's marriage to Natasha, Miranda's break-up with Steve and Charlotte's marriage to Trey. All of these developments are enthralling and wonderful to see played out. The only reason I don't give five stars is that Season Three is melodramatic compared to past seasons. The chase scene at Mr. Big's apartment and Carrie's (temporary) loss of Aidan's dog are two examples. I found those scenes, and others like them, to be a bit too over-the-top.

I agree with the other reviews that this season is the better of the three because it lets us view Samantha's dealings with a man she actually loves, and Miranda's dealings with her pregnancy.

However, the more I watched the more i found myself disgusted by the show. It has zero substance.Every episode is the same thing, Carrie attracted to a non-attractive man and stressed over overpriced clothes and shoes while trying to write some sex column.The other characters on the show importance seems to be diminished by the minute.By the end, my freind had to convince me to continue watching.If you are a die-hard fan, go ahead and watch, if not, go floss your teeth, it will be more entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Show","review":"I have always been a fan of this show, though they need to show more cultural diversity in their characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"I purchased this item because it marked as \\"like new\\" in condition and was very disappointed to find that when it arrived the case was broken and more than one of the DVD's did not work I ended up replacing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Great Argument for Celibacy","review":"Have you ever wondered why most men aren't into this show? I mean, you'd think that we'd be glued to the set drooling over a show about a bunch of chicks talking about sex all the time, not to mention a few softcore porn scenes thrown in.The answer to the dearth of male viewers is actually quite simple: It's because its \\"star\\" is Sarah Jessica Parker. \\"Sex and the City\\"? That is false advertising. With Parker at the helm of personnae dramatis, it ought to have been called \\"Skank and the City.\\"I was as aroused by this show as I was by staring at yesterday's pizza.

Together with ist supplement this 1970 book has something to offer, it becomes 90 pages of information together with good photographs and a good text. Without the supplement it loses much informational value about the units who flew this plane, where and when, something the Squadron/Signal book can't offer in its 49 densely photo-packed pages.

My mood fluctuated with the music, going from steamy hot to soul searching, from feeling light on my feet to feeling comfortably blue. The music was varied and interesting, certainly never boring. A great CD to mix in with other styles of music on a Sunday afternoon whether it be gray or sunny!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Smooth Jazz at its best","review":"Hiroshima is a wonderful smooth jazz fusion group. This group is original because it combines elements of western and Japanese music in a very unique fusion. The trademark of this group is the sound of the traditional Japanese instrument, the \\"koto\\", which can be heard in each song. For those of you who are already familiar with smooth jazz, this group stays true to the traditioanl smooth jazz sound, but the Japanese elements make it more interesting. The only unfortunate part of this CD is that after a few songs it may start sounding like background music (ex: the kind of music you might listen to in a contemporary Japanese restaurant or in an office), but overall it is a very refreshing CD, which I think is especially good as background music for parties, get togethers, studying, relaxing, or thinking. This is low calorie music, meaning that it is not heavy, very intricate or complicated like many forms of jazz (ex: be bop)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Sound Quality","review":"I wholeheartedly agree with the 5-star reviews of the music and performances on the two LPs included on this CCM remastered CD. However, I rate this particular CD 2 stars (or even 1 star) due to the weak, shoddy remastering. If you want this music to sound as marvelous as it sounded on pristine copies of the original vinyl LPs in the late 1960s, get the two Buddha Records CD reissues from year 2000 (or: a good turntable + eBay + mint copies of LPs that originally sold in the millions = pure joy). The Buddha reissues include all the bonus tracks that appear on the CCM reissue. You have to ask yourself, how can CCM reissue music in 2007 that sounds significantly worse than when it was reissued by the original label in 2000? The artists originally involved in the production and performance of this music must be disgusted."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm Prejudiced...","review":"I actually read this book before it was submitted [having 'Mike' live with me helped], and was disappointed that he was asked to take a great deal of the meat out of the story.

Also, it isn't quite big enough for little boys - My 2 year old has to scoot all the way back onto the back of the ring in order to avoid peeing over the front of it onto the floor.

Problems: 1) not secure on elongated toilet seat because the insert/lip is narrow and it doesn't set deep enough into the elongated toilet seat, moves easily and has potential for nasty tumbles off the toilet when child attempts to get on/off seat; 2) the soft plastic ring easily comes out of the blue frame with just a little wiggling around, again not very \\"safe\\", 3) you have to be sure to take it apart and clean it thoroughly after each use because urine and feces can get between the soft plastic ring and the frame, also there is a seam in the soft plastic ring that allows urine and feces to become trapped and is very difficult to clean.

I thought it was fine for the first few weeks, then I noticed a horrible odor in my bathroom- it always smelled like urine and I could not figure out why. The one day, my daughter was putting her potty seat on our toilet. She tipped it up and all of this urine poured out onto her pants and socks. Unknown to me, urine had been collecting between the white soft seat and the blue base of this product- the source of the horrible odor. I've made it part of my cleaning rituals to take the seat apart and clean it every week- yet the smell still lingers. Every time I use my bathroom, I can smell that awful smell- I hate it.

I can't say if other people do have the same problem but it takes ages to get the pump into the right angle to actually pump the air inside.Like almost everything which is manufactured from Everlast, buy the more expensive brands because Everlast produces cheap stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inflating It???????","review":"I have been busy at work for the last week or so, so I've not had an opportunity to call the seller to ask how to pump up the Toner.

Save your time reading something else"},{"rating":"1","title":"A huge disappointment","review":"I had previously read Me and Mr Darcy and thought I'd give this a go. However, I have been struggling to finish it. For chick fiction it is very long winded and the best part of the story happens in the flashback section early on. There is a lot spent on set up and links that are in the end pointless and don't develop the characters much. I remembered half way through why I only liked Me and Mr Darcy, it is her writing style. Great ideas over worked. If you are looking for a fun light read, avoid this and read something like Twenties Girl by Sophie Kinsella instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bully NB-113 Stainless Steel Side Step","review":"When i recieved the product it was not what the picture showed it would be.

Not really an enjoyable read. Doesn't seem to be any reason to believe any of the things he says. It all comes across as a bunch of opinions with his own thrown in there as well. Also has the annoying habit of saying \\"Next we're going to talk about X\\". You get to the next section and he says, \\"Now we're going to talk about X\\". I've read \\"The Cambridge Quintet\\" which was a very enjoyable discussion of the philosophy of AI. Also Godel, Escher, Bach is an excellent read for philosophy.

I hope that Mr. Edwards gets a good chance to listen to his mix album _New Trend Sounds 2004_, because I'm convinced that he'll hear how much he needs to add some diversity to his sound.

I tend to prefer heavier watches (I have a Bulova BVA, Wittnauer Ambassador and various others), but this is probably the most \\"dressy\\" watch I own. Most of my others (including Seiko and Stuhrling) have larger bands than this one. I called to order a few links (nearly $9 each!), but found out Bulova will send you two links for free if the watch is new, that should be enough.

It is fantastic and without question one of the best metal records of the '90's. Entirely composed and produced by Rob Halford, it shows the genius which helped make Priest one of the definitive metal bands. The songs are catchy and some of them fairly melodic, but the CD has a number of memorably brutal and raw thrashy tracks, and it is mostly significantly heavier than Priest at its heaviest. The lyrics are deep and well-written. Crunchy riffing and great song concepts that carry you right along. Halford's vocal power and range are as evident here as anywhere. Powerful, sharp and extremely satisfying. The better of the two Fight CD's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fight - 'War Of Words' (Epic)","review":"As most of you do know,Fight was,of course the band that Rob Halford formed after twenty years of fronting Judas Priest,along with Priest drummer Scott Travis.Bassist Jay Jay and guitarists Brian Tilse&Russ Parrish round out the group's line-up.The killer tracks are easy to spot here,like \\"Into The Pit\\",the in-your-gut \\"Nailed To The Gun\\",the heavily riffed \\"Immortal Sin\\",\\"Contortion\\" and \\"Reality,A New Beginning\\".Plain and simple,a truly great '90's metal release.The follow-up to this effort,'Small Deadly Space' isn't as good.Thank goodness Halford has now rejoined Priest.I ALWAYS thought he would have,eventually."},{"rating":"2","title":"obvious release of tension causedby the breakup of JP","review":"rob halford shows once again that he was meant to be the frontman of heavy metal with wailing vocals and non-stop new grunge metal sound. halford vents his frustrations in this album caused by the dismantling of JP. some songs do become repititious and mono tone but are only saved by the never ending creativity and consistency of his superb voice. if they ever come to town, i'm there!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NO BIG DEAl","review":"Sorry, but no big deal here, other than good professional musicians. Halford suely tried to \\"modernize\\" his sound and wrote some intelligent lyrics, but the great ammount of aggressions is lost due to bad vocals. No wonder FIGHT lasted so few."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fighting a Losing Battle","review":"There's something faintly hilarious about an early 80s metal icon who looks like Wallace (of Wallace and Gromit fame) trying to look tough, whilst dressed like he's auditioning for Rage Against the Machine. Rob Halford was the screamer with THE metal band to end all metal bands, Judas Priest. His mid-90s band Fight attempted to merge that pure metal sound of the 80s with a little of that belligerent hardcore approach of the 90s. If you get off on twiddly, searing, metallic riffs, chanted choruses, and vocals that, for the most part, veer from a growl to a scream, then this is probably for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"very niiiice!!!","review":"It looks very attractive outside.

The first JAVOScreen protector I bought was for the Treo 650. Most screen protectors are a big let down, but I was suprised at how well it's work.

Overall product quality is good, and the priceseems appropriate for the item."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for work!","review":"Finding clothes suitable for hard physical labor is difficult. I have tried pants, shirts, T-shirts, belts, suspenders, coveralls, Carhart overalls, other brands of overalls, and now Dickies overalls. Dickies overalls arent altogether satisfactory either, but they are about as suitable as anything I have tried. The high slender back keeps the galluses on my shoulders pretty well; I think it would be better if the bib were somewhat narrower.I could not get a leg length short enough for my size, and had to turn the legs under and fasten with fabric glue. I can carry rules, pruning shears, cell phone, nails, etc in the various pockets. I grew up wearing overalls, and now in my second childhood I actually enjoy wearing them again."},{"rating":"2","title":"should have followed my instinct","review":"After reading several reviews of this product I was convinced to order the overalls in one size larger than what I normally do because they would shrink.

I will likely purchase them again. Great product for a great value."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overalls","review":"These overalls are very nice. Worth every penny, my dad loves them!

Now, if they'd only still make their 5 pocket twill jeans!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sizing is wrong","review":"Like most of the other reviewers noted, \\"order the next larger size as they tend to run small.\\" The real reason they appear to run small is that they are not made in the United States, and the sizing is backwards from what we are used to seeing. For instance, I ordered a 34X32. Since I usually wear a 32 waist, I took everyone's advice and ordered a 40\\" waist since in the U.S. we size men's garments with waist size first and length second. Well, guess what? The length of these is exactly 34\\" and the waist is just right, maybe a little snug, but almost perfect. Since it's really difficult to measure the waist size accurately, it's easy to measure the inseam and it's definitely 34\\" right on the button. And I have to turn about a 4\\" cuff on them (I normally order 32 length in denim because they shrink at least an inch with repeated washings and I really need a 31 length or less). Anyway, I have to return them and get a much shorter size."},{"rating":"2","title":"Birthday present a success","review":"Great product delivered just in time for my boyfriend's birthday.

It is mostly fine but there is no way to stop the alarm from ringing.One of the highlights of my week is when I get to turn the alarm off first thing on Friday morning and not have to worry about the alarm until Monday.With this clock, the alarm will ring every day. There is a switch with AL ON and OFF but that turns a Z on and off on the display. I am guessing this is the snooze feature. Even with the AL in the OFF position, it still rings. I will have to take the battery out in order to sleep it on the weekend.The fact that there were two in the box and I only ordered one does not make up for the very bad design.That I ordered an Elgin clock and got a Timex is just confusing.Not good."},{"rating":"2","title":"I have to buy it again!..","review":"I bought it a few years ago.

That said, Building Craft Equipment is worth a modest investment for its value as a thought starter. Rag shuttles are $14 on the open market, and I can make a dozen for that amount of money if I simply buy the lumber and dowels and make my own.I wish the Abrams had provided a bit more information about how to use the equipment they describe. For example, I don't know what a warping paddle is used for, so why would I want to make one? Their book presumes more knowledge of the craft than some of us have.

Yes, the ending was a bit of a letdown, but that's mostly because there's so many deaths/attacks up to that point that the climax did seem rather miniscule and rushed. There's also some in-jokes that lighten the mood but at the same time just makes the reader envision the author patting himself on the back, which momentarily took me out of the story. Also, the words spoor and annelid did become a bit tiring after constantly popping up.

Once a year, I pull them out of the drawer in an attempt to prove my money was not wasted on this purchase.These whisks have a very soft silicon coating on the beater portion that tends to drag on the non-stick surface of the pans. It is like you are dragging rubber against rubber. There is way too much friction to actually whip anything in a pan. It definitely does not work well in a mixing bowl - there is too much friction.PROS:- Soft silicon coating on the beater will not scratch.CONS:- Beater is way too flexible. It can not be used effectively to whip any ingredients.- Soft silicon coating creates a drag against any surface which it comes in contact.SUMMARY:These silicon whisks can not replace a regular stiff wire whisk.

Alma Mater is both of those all grown up. It is all the good parts of those books and more. Set in 1980, two girls at the end of their time in college meet and, in a suprise for both of them, they fall in love. What happens around that and the characters that inhabit their lives makes for an incredible read.Once I read it, I wanted to be able to read it again for the first time."},{"rating":"1","title":"The research is lacking","review":"As someone who graduated from William and Mary in 1979, about the same year that some of the characters in this book are supposed to have graduated, I had a hard time with the fundamental lack of understanding of the W&M; experience displayed in the book. In particular, the football team (and a major character is a football star) was not considered to be a dominant and organizing force at the College. In fact, many people in my class remember protesting at Board of Visitors meetings when the board was considering expanding the football stadium in order to accommodate an expanded football program that would play bigger and better teams. We didn't want it. Rich football star boyfriend? Oh, puh-lease.It may be a small thing to point out, but, if you're going to set a book in a particular location at a particular time, it would take next to no effort to do a little research to see what was going on there at that time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lazy writing, lazy dialog","review":"Don't waste your money. Rita Mae's writing has been going steadily down hill, in my opinion, and this one is my \\"last straw\\". I'm writing her off for good after this last embarrassment. All her protagonists are the same--strong, attractive, sensual, smart and southern. The endings wrap up with unnecessary speed & awkwardness, as if she just got bored with it and wanted it over (I don't blame her; I wanted it over too). Her writing is just plain lazy.

That's not because they do not fit, but they look ugly on me. The leather is so soft and it shows any flaws other shoes would normally hide. To be specific I normally wear 7.5 or 8 in medium width in other brands. Unless the shoe fit is extremely narrow, medium widths do fit me well. In this model I got an 8 blue pair to be on the safe side and I realized that 7.5 would fit better in length. But in terms of width they do look ugly. I missed the return period and am stuck with these shoes. Probably will be wearing them around home as slippers. They do look comfortable, but no arch support and overall cheap looking.

These are folders I take to customers and one of the purposes of having the folders (aside from the obvious use of organizing materials) is to convey to the customer that we are organized and prepared. A sloppy looking folder conveys the opposite.One caveat - we ordered the 1/3 cut tabs which means each tab is 1/3 of the width of the folder in length. We use Dymo labels to label the files, and the label is a tiny bit longer than the tab. When we reordered we got the 1/2 tab which extends half way across the top of the folder, and I much prefer this configuration."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was fooled!!","review":"This was not identified as green leaf Stevia.

The group also seems to be socially and politically conscience. In the songs \\"10 minute high\\" and \\"boy at the window\\" Cornell West could not have been more profound or articulate in expressing the plight of some of our youth. I would like to end this review by trying to describe Amel Larrieux beautifully sculptured voice. I could probably use 1000 adjectives to describe her voice, but the only way to truly get a sense of her hypnotic voice is to sit down in a dark room, and throw your CD player on surround sound and let Amel do the rest. My last thought is this, I don't know if the artist read these review's but if you do I beseech the two of you to work with the jazz group \\"four play\\", your talents would work perfectly with their style of play (just ask El! DeBarge)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amel's debut with Bryce was a bangin joint","review":"This was the first taste that I got of Amel. Her voice alone had me during the first 10 sec of the first track. An unknown producer (Bryce) took a chance on an unknown artist (Amel) and struck GOLD with this debut release. When \\"Tell Me\\" dropped in 95, I thought the entire R&B world would have to go back to the drawing board. That track had me turning my radio off, buying the single and playing it continuously on repeat. When the CD finally dropped, I didn't purchase another for awhile. Some of my favorite tracks are: \\"didja know\\", \\"hey you\\", \\"angel\\", \\"tell me\\"................. ahh! to hell with it! all the songs are my favorites.oNe"},{"rating":"2","title":"The cool side of groove","review":"I really enjoyed this group's first album offering because it gives the contemporary R&B listener something different to consume.Escapes from the usual over production techniques of today's dance music, but still will get you moving to the more uptempo tunes such as \\"Tell Me\\".The ballads are very good too but the favourites for me are \\"Hey U\\" and \\"Hello\\", where the lead singer's unique,breathy style of singing really gets to me in those relaxing moments. But don't mistake me, Amiel can rip too!!The other thing I like about this group is the cool, unposing look they have:let the music do the talking not our good looks.

I'm trying to track a possible issue with my blood pressure medication wearing off in the evening hours, so finding out this meter is way off is serious business, as it could have caused my doctor to have adjusted my medication way too high based on my night time readings.

Positioning of your arm is critical to getting a good reading - however, I found that an immediate comparison with a cuff type device (upper arm cuff), showed the readings on the Panasonic to be inaccurate by a wide margin.

Sandra has captured my heart, along with the lovable Betty White. A pure joy to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"Cute movie as far as chick flicks go. More men like this one than most other girly movies. Surprisingly funny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marry me!","review":"Margaret Tate (Sandra Bullock), a high-powered and much disliked editor, is facing deportation back to Canada unless she can force her assistant (Ryan Reynolds) to marry her in a hurry. He reluctantly agrees and takes her to Alaska to meet his family which includes his 90-year old grandmother (Betty White).I liked this movie a lot. Bullock is talented, mature, and naturally funny and Reynolds is very likable. On the down side, Bullock almost looks old enough to be his mother and that was a bit distracting. The story has certainly been done before, but the actors' charm makes it feel fresh and Betty White provides some really belly laughs. The exquisite Sitka scenery really had me fooled; I read that it was filmed in Massachusetts with CGI mountains.This rom-com has a familiar plot but clever writing and an appealing cast. Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved It!","review":"I thought this movie was hilarious, great relationship between Bullock and Reynolds and Betty White was fantasic. Great date movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak Chick Flick","review":"This is the quintessential chick flick. The primary roles are female. No big deal. The same was mostly true of \\"A League of Their Own.\\" But, what's missing here is anything resembling a male with much testosterone. In addition, the character development and especially the shift in feelings between Bullock and Reynolds is lacking. For women looking for something to watch on a Saturday night \\"The Proposal\\" might fit the bill. On the other hand, this movie brings to bare the lyrics to the ballad \\"Where Have All the Cowboys Gone.\\" As a guy, my only excuse for watching this movie is that my girlfriend really wanted to see it so I went along with her. That takes care of the chick flicks for a while."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weird Movie","review":"This was about some woman with a personality disorder who has a hard time holding onto her job because of it. She makes a sexual arrangement with a co-worker per doctors orders. The couple flies to Alaska together. This is where the story goes off-track. There is a lot of confusion and misunderstandings between the gentlemen's family over this woman. They're on and off boats and planes many times. It is hard to make heads or tails out of much of this film. I think it would be best suited as an art house feature."},{"rating":"1","title":"yeech","review":"One of the worst romantic comedies I've ever seen.I found this movie to be completely unconvincing. Or, rather, too convincing. Sara Bullock plays a heartless, manipulative witch so believably at the beginning of the movie, that it's just impossible to swallow when she starts warming up to her co-star, as she of course does (beginning in the scene where she starts rubbing his shoulders).This movie is so full of hatred, phoniness, and predictability, Sandra Bullock should have been pre-barred from receiving an Oscar with this on her record."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Proposal","review":"Well, I watched The Proposal one time.

Sandra Bullock is as charming as ever, Ryan Reynolds is bitingly funny, the supporting cast is very good, and the movie itself has enough funny moments to be worthwhile. The downside is that it is extremely formulaic and predictable. You will know what to expect from this movie from the very beginning, with every cliche played out in full. I think the cast saves the movie, they are funny enough to make it work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"I was so looking forward to viewing this because I like both Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds (and of course Betty White!) and I was expecting a great time since it was a huge box office hit and had good buzz. After 30 minutes, I started wondering when the hysterical moments would begin. Unfortunately they never do. Sure, there are a few scenes that are mildly funny but I found most of the film awkward and strained. The leads are attractive, the setting is gorgeous, and the photography is outstanding but the movie fails to get off the ground and the whole scenario is just unbelievable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely moronic!","review":"I watched this only because a lot of it was filmed in my area (Rockport, MA). Even though I like Sandra, I suspected it might be stupid -- and it certainly was. The male stripper scene was so awful I ff'd through it -- and then the scene involving the eagle and the cellphone was so stupid, contrived and over-long that I gave up on the movie at that point. Ryan Reynolds's acting seemed totally wooden to me, too. The only character I liked was Malin Akerman's."},{"rating":"2","title":"sandra bullock rocks it again","review":"Sandra Bullock is a favorite actress of mine. Therefore I might be a bit biased, but I think this is one of the best (or maybe I should just say my personal favorite) movies made in the past couple years. A very fresh comedy. Plus, you have Betty White. How can you go wrong? Betty White is phenomenal. When this came out, I was obsessed wit the Golden Girls, so it was perfect. The ending is superb."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Much Better Green Card","review":"WE love this movie. Even the minor character's are well done, although it seemed to me that Nelson, who plays the father in this film, did not have his heart in it- maybe because his character was so one sided.

Some people wont get some of the humor, because Alaskan based humor is quite different. Until you have lived in Alaska and experience some of the experiences shown in this movie, you can't fully appreciate how funny it is. Even with the Alaska humor, it is a great movie for all Non-Alaskans. Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds deliver a great performance and very funny production."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mindless","review":"It was hard to keep watching it. We didn't stop because it was too late tto start another movie. Otherwise, we would have bailed out."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Guaranteed Good Time","review":"Sometimes you watch a movie just for the fun of it. This is one of those movies. It will never rank alongside \\"Gone with the Wind\\" or \\"A Streetcar Named Desire\\" as a great movie, but damn, it's fun. Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds are completely hilarious (not to mention very easy on the eyes) and have absolutely great chemistry. Both are at the top of their game and turn in exceptional comedic performances. Toss in an award-winning performance by the amazing Betty White, a solid cast of outstanding actors and you're guaranteed a good time. Sure, the plot is predictable, but who cares? When you have all that talent on the screen in one movies, and are too busy laughing to analyze it, it doesn't matter. I rented the movie, but now I intend to buy it. It was that good!If I were just rating the actors, it would be a five-star movie in my book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Actress Bad Movie","review":"This is a typical Sandra Bullock movie which is a little tiring.

Throughout the whole movie, things kept happening that happened in while you were sleeping! Like when she said she couldn't marry him at the alter, here we go again! Anyways, it was kinda annoying.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing something","review":"I love Sandra Bullock, and most of her movies. This movie was not that good. Beautiful location, beautiful people,etc... BUT there was no spark between the two leads. It just did not work. I fell asleep, rewound, and fell asleepagain. Sandra you need more serious roles, you are getting to old for the cutesy girl roles."},{"rating":"2","title":"I really liked this movie","review":"I have seen a lot of romantic comedies and they are all the same, this was predictable obviously we all knew that Ryan and Sandra were going to really fall in love but it was still funny and Betty White is still great. I am going to buy this movie to add to my collection there were several really cute parts that made me laugh out loud. It's worth a watch!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"DVD The Proposal","review":"Having rented this movie twice, I decided that buying it made sense. I would categorize it as a \\"feel good\\" movie. Light, but pleasant story with wonderful performance by Betty While. There are movies that do not require suspense as to the ending, and The Proposal is certainly one of them. As usual, when I enjoy a movie which I have rented, I go to Amazon to buy it, as well as almost anything that we may need or want, or even about which we may have questions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious Movie","review":"Great quality, shipped quickly, this was a hilarious movie, probably one of my favorite movies. It's a romantic comedy, if you like those, you'll like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Four stars","review":"I'm giving this chick flick four stars rather than five stars because, although Sandra Bullock is brilliant in it, the movie isn't amoung the best I've ever seen. The story is about a high powered book editor from Canada whose visa has just run out so she needs to get married to stay in the US. She sets her sight on her PA who has no choice but to pretend that he and she are madly in love. Not a brilliant film but very enjoyable way to spend a night in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Romantic Comedy","review":"I just watched this movie two nights ago by myself. I don't know Guys; I really think it could have been better. I really don't like the way they portrayed Ryan Reynolds's character. I'm so much happier when he can be himself or some other version of \\"Van Wilder.\\" Sandra Bullock was funny? I don't know I think I giggle like five times through out the whole movie. The story was cute and predictable. The story is that Sandra's character is from Canada and is getting deported. Ryan's character is her assistant and is forced to marry her or loose his job. I just wish Ryan was more sarcastic and funny like he's known for. Sandra plays a good hard arss but not really believable. All in all I give this movie a three out of five. If Ryan was topless more often maybe there were be a higher score."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad even by the standards of rom-coms","review":"The Bottom Line:Much as I hate formula, I have a soft spot for romantic comedies because the ones which feature good chemistry between the leads always offer some interesting character interaction; that said, it is my displeasure to inform you that The Proposal hastily skips past all of that pesky character bonding--save for one scene with the two leads in their bedroom talking--to focus on the stupid formula hijinx, resulting in a pretty bad film.2/4"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie","review":"Good movie. Very funny. Arrived quickly, but Blueray is starting to annoy me because there is always an issue with them. This one stuck at times on the one player but not on the other."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny & Entertaining","review":"Sandra Bullock is a great actress and she really knows what she is doing. I have respect for her movies and her business savvy. I loved the location of the filming. The Proposal is very esay to watch and relate to, for both men & women. Lots of funny parts and could be viewed as somewhat educational if viewed between the lines.I enjoyed the movie quite well. But I am an avid Sandra Bullock fan, so I guess I'm a bit biased."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Sandra Bullick Movie","review":"I love to watch romantic comedies and this one is definitely one of my favorites, particularly because my favorite actress, Sandra Bullick, is mean and snarly and sharp witted in the beginning and gradually softens up in her adventure in Alaska with her entrapped engagement partner (Ryan Reynolds), her office assistant. For me this movie is smartly done with the help of a great cast and superb lead actors and a fresh storyline in a fabulous environment. I received my own Cd less than a month ago and have watched this movie at least eight time since."},{"rating":"2","title":"Proposal review","review":"At first I was skeptical about the movie because it was sooo predictable. Everyone and their grandma knew these two would somehow get together. What was entertaining to see was HOW they ended up together. I was always curious to see who would \\"give in\\" first. If you iike Romanic Comdey, you will enjoy this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chick flick with a twist","review":"I'm a long time Sandra Bullock fan and expected Ryan Reynolds to pale beside her. Surprisingly, this wasn't the case. Ryan reminds me of Meryl Streep in that he can effectively convey feelings, thoughts and emotions with subtle facial shifts. This film also was a pleasant surprise for a male viewer in that Ryan was the emotionally available half of the duo. Don't know about the rest of you but I'm tired of seeing images of feckless males in movies and The Proposal was a breath of fresh air in this regard. I found the pairing of a younger man with an obviously older woman a delightful twist because the movie showed them both getting past age issues and finding each other's underlying qualities and beautiful hearts. The reason I didn't give it five stars is that the script is a bit too formulaic. With a bit more imagination in the screen writing this would merit five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun romantic comedy!","review":"I like this movie mostly for the actors. The story line could be stronger and less predictable, but it's still a fun romantic comedy. Betty White and Sandra Bullock are hysterical--all of the actors are interesting and funny to see together. Nice light humor to help you have an affordable laugh when money's tight. Buy this and have a good laugh. Great for a moms night out gathering."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Romantic Comedy of 2009!","review":"This movie has to be the best romantic comedy i have seen in a long time. It's basically about an assistant who marries his overbearing boss so she can stay in the country. And of course they fall madly in love. I honestly was not expecting much from this movie. I thought the age difference between these two would make this seem awkward. I was so wrong. The chemistry between Sandra and Ryan was amazing. And is it just me or was Sandra Bullock made for this type of movie. She also stars in \\"The Lake House\\" which was an amazing movie. I loved this movie. It's this scene where Sandra Bullock is dancing off that song by Lil John and the Eastside Boys, hilarious! This is a must see."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny date movie","review":"I love Ryan Reynolds and Sandra Bullock; so putting them in a movie together was a pretty great idea.I was skeptical about this movie, but it surprised me. I'm gonna add this movie to my collection because it's a great date movie that a couple can watch and both enjoy. Usually, I get dragged into watching things that have nothing for me in it (for example, The Notebook... sweet lord; that was horrible). Yet, this movie has enough comedy that it made me laugh out loud at a few parts. I was shocked that Betty White is still alive, actually, haha! But she's really funny in it too, shockingly enough.So all in all, it's worth buying. I wouldn't buy it new. It's one of those movies that I wouldn't spend more then ten dollars for, but all the same, it's worth adding to your collection if you like funny date movies. It's a date movie that even a guy would like and not be ashamed to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Proposal","review":"Sandra Bullock is as funny and enjoyable as ever. She brings a lot to all of her movies. She is funny, beautiful and puts her all in what she does. Great, Great movie. To Funny. Betty White as always hysterical. Ryan Reynolds Charming, and really funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"I HOPE this isn't THE funniest movie of the year...","review":"I couldn't wait to see this movie! I love Sandra Bullock. I can't think of a movie of hers I haven't enjoyed. I even liked \\"Miss Cong. 2 Armed & Fabulous\\". Not her best but still better than The Proposal.The movie wasn't horrible, but it wasn't very funny either. A few smiles maybe and \\"It was cute\\" at the end was about it. Her character was unlikable (that was the point, but it didn't improve much over the course of the movie) and with such a great cast, I had hoped for better. I can't really pinpoint a bunch of negatives about the movie. I just didn't like it. Not funny, their relationship progressed painfully slowly, and you just really didn't get into the movie. All the funny scenes were in the trailers."},{"rating":"2","title":"All I Can Say Is Funny!","review":"I was not sure if this was going to be a typical Ryan Reynolds movie and if Sandra Bullock was going to be able to impress me with a comeback.

I would definately recommend this romantic comedy to anyone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have saved my money","review":"Very disappointed.

I'm a sucker for a happy ending what can I say?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Disappointing","review":"The basics of this movie has been done several times before but just with a little twist. Two people pretending to be engaged for ulterior motives. Betty White stole the movie -- she was great. I was very disappointed in Sandra Bullock doing a nude scene - she's too good of an actress to have to do that. She is the boss lady and her visa is up so she needs to either marry an American or be deported. Naturally, the latter is not to her liking so she enlists the (unwilling) assistance of her assistant. As part of the ploy they have to visit his family for his grandmother's birthday (played by Betty White). At first his family is a little too country for the sophisticated boss lady but as she gets to know them, she takes another look at her too structured and perfect life and decides that she likes them. The usual last minute detractors pop up but all's well that ends well. Sandra Bullock could have done better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie !!!","review":"This is great movie.

The chemistry just wasn't there for the main characters Andrew and Margaret. Their bickering, which was I think supposed to be funny, seemed more like real arguing and quickly became tiresome. I would have just turned the movie off, but I wanted to see if they could pull it out of the scrap heap at the end. There was one scene that made me laugh, but the rest of the movie was a wash out. If I had known it was this stupid, I would have saved myself $15. Now maybe you'll have that opportunity."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Chemistry between Bullock & Reynolds","review":"I was disappointed in this movie. There is absolutely no chemistry between Bullock and Reynolds. He also looks and appears 10 years younger than her. None of the actors/actresses played their roles well. Betty White's character was a typical Betty White character but silly to the point of ridiculous. The tribal scene in the woods was pointless. Craig Nelson was not convincing as the overbearing dad. The dude from The Office who played the male stripper/minister was disgusting. I did not laugh a single time in the movie. The best thing about the movie was the Alaskan scenery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of Sandra's best movies!","review":"I found this movie very predictable that they were going to fall in love at the end. And find it hard to believe that they would actually fall in love over those few days at his parents house. I don't know.... it just doesn't seem like they spent enough time togather to of fallen in love. Like Jack and Rose from Titanic you could tell that they really loved each other over those few days, but I didn't get that sense of true love from this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nope.","review":"I love Sandra Bullock, but this was not one of her best roles. I don't like seeing her as the 'witch' that she portrayed. But mainly 2 stars b/c the writers didn't dwell long enough on WHY she did the 'turn around' personality. I thought this was quite dull but I truly enjoy whatever Betty White is in. She is great. Ryan Reynolds is a cutie, very sweet in this one but again, not enough story line on the transition of the hate to love scenario.

Who goes to Sitka from New York for the weekend, and believes they will be back for a morning appointment on Monday? These are examples of the leaps of logic expected from viewers of this rubbish.Weak writing, poor character development, and a useless Bonus feature of a self serving narrative by the writers of The Proposal, left me bewildered and disappointed.There are huge holes in the script, making the characters seem quite clueless. I get the feeling that all the nice things that are being said about this version of the movie and the 2 disc deluxe version are being left by members of Disney's PR department, because The Proposal is a stinker. Skip it. If you are a die hard fan of the stars, rent it somewhere cheap.

My recall of '90s zeitgeist placed the general approach and style at 1994, and a glance at the back-of-the-book index of each article's original publication date confirmed that suspicion.

The best Wet Ones I found were with Aloe and they're hypoallergenic."},{"rating":"1","title":"May be flushable, but do NOT degrade quickly!","review":"We just had our sewer line back up into our house.

The cost of the drain clearing was more then $150 USD! We came out with a grocery bag of kandoo wipes. I have only used 3 packs! I didn't flush more then the recomended amount and the backup happened at the end of our private line. If this is what they do at the end of three packs and a month or two, I can only imagine what happens to other people!Kandoo will be getting a bill from our home. Don't let it happen to yours!The product was a great idea for our son who was training. The marketing was perfect and we liked the orange packs scent.

A good study in how a great cast can be wasted. Tony Curtis roll in the movie (script fault) drug it down more. Hy Averback, the director has been great in hour TV shows but doesn't seem to know what to do with a 1 hour movie.

This was a great documentary that indulged in undeserved demonization of republicans and glorification of democrats. The conclusion advocates a communist redistribution of wealth. The national debt is frightening and overwhelming, but more government spending in a different direction is only escalating the problem! It should have included what happened in the 1920s leading up to the market crash and the Great Depression, so that people could get an idea of the end game possibilities here, rather than promoting a defunct political theory."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whose fault is debt?","review":"This documentary is a mishmash of random thoughts relating to debt that never really comes a conclusion. The government is horrible because of irrational spending resulting in the huge national debt. But people who are in debt, specifically consumer debt, are the victims of evil corporations. I'm sensing a double standard here...It's appalling that these people are shocked that credit card companies actually expect them to pay for what they buy and, if they don't, to charge them interest. Nothing is yours and only yours until its paid for. It's the bank's house/car/clothing/etc until you've finished paying for it. Is this such a hard concept to grasp?Debt is (voluntary) bondage.

But borrowing beyond your means to repay is ALSO IMMORAL. This movie highlights the former, but not the latter.If you charge something on a credit card, you are BORROWING MONEY. That money is NOT YOURS. It belongs to someone else, and it's wholly irrelevant that you don't like them because they're a greedy corporation. It's still NOT YOUR MONEY.Now, if you don't pay the money back, YOU ARE STEALING. That's right. You are a THIEF. Taking something that isn't yours and not giving it back is the definition of theft. How on earth can this movie rightfully argue that those who borrow money and don't return it are always \\"victims\\"?Be accountable for your actions!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Propaganda","review":"This really could have been some interesting subject matter, but it doesn't show both sides of the story. Somehow, personal responsibility does not find it's way into the story. Oddly, these credit cards seem to take on a life of their own...and their owners have nothing to do with the debt they accrue and then refuse to pay.Funnier still is that somehow George Bush is personally responsible for all this. Imagine that.I agree that big credit card companies are out to get people with fees, and that more government regulation is definately needed (like raising the minimum amount due even more so that people actually pay down their debt), but all this \\"documentary\\" shows you are a few sad cases carefully edited in while Republicans speak in Congress.

A few interviews of people with debt, and a boring Harvard professor.I was looking for a more detailed analysis of the workings of credit card companies and the growing household debts across the country.

After reading it I decided to take a course in game theory which I enjoyed a lot. The historical info about von Neumann was very informative and interesting too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exemplary Treatment of a 20th century Renaissance Man","review":"\\"Prisoner's Dilemma\\" is one of the best non-fiction books I've ever read. It alternates chapters on von Neumann's biography with straightforward expositions of game theory and 20th century political history, seamlessly integrating all three elements.Von Neumann is not exactly a household name like Einstein, yet his genius equalled (and some would say surpassed) the latter's, because he produced major contributions to the fields of physics, mathematics, economics, and computer science. A decided non-pacifist, he worked enthusiastically on the Manhattan Project (but may have been, along with Werner von Braun, a source for the character Dr. Strangelove)...He had a genuine photographic memory, reciting entire chapters of books verbatim he'd read decades earlier. He virtually invented the field of game theory singlehandedly, which has found deep ramifications in political science, economics, and psychology."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh...","review":"First off, this book isn't _bad_. It's just that after reading it,I was entirely unable to say what it was about.The problem is that I was sufficiently familiar with the topic thatthis book had nothing new in it for me; it quoted the same sourcesthat I'd read the originals of twenty or thirty years ago.Hence, it all just blurred together with what I already new...no mathematics, more just review of history lessons.I'd recommend Poundstone's other books over this one. Especiallythe Big{er,est} Secrets series."},{"rating":"2","title":"An important fact about the history of the logics.","review":"The essay is very rich of information about the prisoner's dilemma. This game is similar to other typical evens of the Greek logics.But this reconstruction is very large, in fact the first applications are by von Neumann in relation to the militar context.The resolution of this game found easy applications in the II world war.Next, we observe particularly the Axerold contribute, who tried an algorithm for the solution, without particular subcess.The game model is standard, but we can apply a recursive action for having several steps."},{"rating":"2","title":"I finally understand number theory - and the a bomb race","review":"If you use a computer - you owe so much to Jon Van Neumann. I confess we called number theory mystery math in university. No longer - I understand it now. This little book does a great job on the subject. The story of van Neumann is fascinating, then you have the explanation of many games like the prisoner's dilemma and how they apply to nuclear proliferation. Many world leaders should read this book, but of course politics and ego overshadow logic and rationality. Well worth the read, but this is not a trivial book , but it will help anyone in negotiations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Layman's intro to Game Theory","review":"I enjoyed this book and learned a lot. The author weaves the fundamentals of game theory through significant historical events. I particluarly like the examples and discussions the author presents to put the theories and dilemmas into realistic, social contexts.Two drawbacks: the lack of a technical theorem guide or appendix; and, the way the book lacks something that ties it all together. It loses momentum when Von Neumann's story ends. The last quarter of the book is abrupt as it runs through a group of definitions that fit under the game theory umbrella.Overall, it's a good enough balance of storytelling, logic and game theory fundamentals to recommend it to anyone interested in social theories, and the how game theory relates to political and economic policies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excelent Book!","review":"Very well written! Covers interesting chunk of history on how the game theory was created and on their creators and historical context (beginning of Cold War). Author gives very clear non-technical introduction into basics of the game theory. You will get intuitive feeling what game theories are about and all these in a very entertaining and informative style. You will want to thank author for this excellent book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good overview of game theory wrapped in a light biography","review":"Prisoner's Dilemma addresses two major areas: an overview of the concepts of game theory and a biography of John von Neumann. Neither are convered in extreme detail, but that isn't bad. In fact, it makes this book an enjoyable casual read.The game theory pieces are presented at a very approachable level of detail. No rigorous math, just well written descriptions of the basic concepts.The first part of the book covers the development of game theory and provides good \\"character development\\" of von Neumann. It them moves away from von Neumann and into the politics of the time (which are exceptionally interesting, especially if you didn't live through them).Overall I found the book very interesting. It manages to balance several topics without wandering and going into excessive detail."},{"rating":"1","title":"a grade of C","review":"The artwork on the cover and on the actual disc is very generic. It's made to look like a blank CD that a civilian recorded stuff on. This is not LTJ's best work. It doesn't come close to \\"Logical Progression\\" in any way, shape, or form. Disc 1 was worse and droned on. Disc 2 was shorter in length, but musically, of much better quality. I'm not a DnB snob, so much stuff gets my approval. This was just okay.

Highly recommended for all Christians who desire to truly understand sex in culture!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not waste money on this book.","review":"The author is something of an anti-sex fanatic. The entire book is nothing but him saying sexuality is the \\"devils work\\" and then throwing out a bunch of bible verses to try and support his preconcieved notion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Logical Fallacies and Irrelevant References Abound","review":"This book contends that sex is the center of moral crisis in America and that the trends we have currently adopted (tolerance of homosexuality, permissive pre-marital sexual relations, pursuit of sex for pleasure, etc.) will inevitably lead to a social collapse. Heimbach's arguments are based almost entirely on unsupported speculation. His social theories are flawed and inadequate. His references are frequently taken out of their proper context and misinterpreted. To make matters worse, Heimbach attempts to use these references to denounce paganism and encourage society's return to the same intolerant, cynical society it was in the early 1900s. This is a poor effort to support an unworthy cause. Sadly, it is likely that many irrational Christians have taken this book to heart and will thoughtlessly follow its teachings. For those who think critically, however, this book will be of no interest."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Basis in Fact or Reality","review":"Heimbach clarifies nothing. The author clearly has no understanding of the nature of paganism and his references and sources are highly suspect as well as taken out of context.

Sometimes, I would have liked to see the examples to go just a little bit deeper. Also, the book is now somewhat outdated, since 4.6 contains quite some enhancements of the classes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing and frustrating","review":"This book is not for anyone without prior structured programming language experience. The editors did a terrible job in proofreading the book which leads to confusing statements, e.g., the last sentence in listing note 2 on page 72, the first word should be \\"When\\", not \\"Then\\". The object of each code listing is not always explained so the reader sometimes has to guess at what the code is trying to do, e.g. listing 6-9 on page 80. Related to that, the function arguments used are not explained so the reader has to compare the usage to the reference manual or online help to understand why those particular arguments were used."},{"rating":"1","title":"WRONG CHORDS!!!","review":"It has a nice look to it, but MANY of the chords are wrong.

Groovy Girls are the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprising!","review":"What caught me off guard about this album is not the huge change in style; that I knew was coming. What startled me was how GOOD it turned out to be! I bought it expecting a mediocre-to-good record, nothing amazing, but it wasn't too expensive and I like Extol's older work so I picked it up, and was promptly blown away. This is a metalheads, and especially musician's, playground. All the technical goodies are still here: sudden time changes, riffs using odd rhythmic structure and harmonies, tightly planned out screaming. It's just all in a thrash setting rather than a black/death setting. Don't be worried by the picture of them looking like a bunch of indie rockers on the back: this is HEAVY. Every song has sections that made me sit up and say \\"wow,\\" particularly in the guitar work. If you like metal at all, get this! It's different from Undeceived and turned out to be a startlingly original piece of work, especially for a Norwegian band."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's the same vocalist.","review":"Okay, yes, this album is different. But guess what, if you know anything about music, you'll know that bands don't like to sound the same. Listen to every Extol cd and you'll notice that all of them are different. Don't expect the same thing from undeceived. Just expect great music. I'm a lyric person and this is great for praising God. The guitar is great as well as the drums and IT'S THE SAME VOCALIST, HE JUST SCREAMS AND YELLS and not growls like he did on Undeceived. Yes, Peter did leave AFTER finishing this cd, but it's him on this album. I don't have a favorite track but track nine was written and performed only by Peter and is beautiful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extol.......or is it??","review":"How do I say it.......utter dissappointment.I just about cried tears of anguish when I heard the new style. \\"WHY!\\" I cried....why oh why oh why!! I have been left feeling numb with disbelief. I loved burial and undeceived for the fantastic melodic death that it was. Now after hearing this album I suppose I will never buy another extol album. I'm sorry, but if I wanted to listen to music like believer (which i have, all albums) then I would do so. Extol should've just changed names, the style is so different. Yet another band who makes it and then screws the fans over with a radically different style :-( Don't get me wrong, I like thrash but there were hardly any bands around playing the old Extol style.........now there is one less.All I can say is I am so happy I recently found the band \\"In Flames\\". It is in the same style as where Extol used to be and is fantastic! Check em out."},{"rating":"2","title":"QUINTEESENTIAL PROGRESSIVE DEATH METAL!!!","review":"Synergy is a pinnacle album for Extol and the fulfillment of the progressive metal ideal. Even Chuck Schuldiner would be proud of this album (if you don't know who he is, then you really have no business commenting on this genre, much reviewing this album). Many have criticized the decreased vocal variation in Synergy from previous Extol albums. The shift away from the use of black metal elements in song writing and vocal enhancement immerses this album deeper into the realm of progressive death/tech death metal. The instrumental technicality and song arrangements speak for themselves with the fine vocals tastefully melding the sounds together for a master work. Overall, this album is a wonderful mix of catchy songwriting and superb musical technicality. This album is a must buy for Believer and Death fans!"},{"rating":"1","title":"New Sound! Wait.. I've heard this before...","review":"Extol started off as some decent Black Metal that just needed a bit of polish. Rockin stuff I can occasionally get into. But with this release, they've fallen into the recent trend of Screamo. Which really blows. All I hear is Thrice with worse drumming. The Used but faster. Overall, incredibly lame. I'm pretty sure this'll play on American Radio, but honestly, this is one to pass up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Completely Satisfied","review":"This toy was great for my 4 year old.

I got this one for my son for his third birthday and he dropped it shortly after opening it, the knob that adjusts the angle of the forklift or bucket loader snapped off!He didn't even have the truck half an hour. I'm sure it was bad luck but I do see other pieces that look dubious. I was well aware that this item might be more suited to a little older child, however, how this piece broke could have happened to anyone. The kind of plastic these pieces are made out of really aren't up to the task of being played with in the way a child, in the age group that would be interested in such a toy, would play with such a toy. It really is sad that Hasbro and the Tonka line have given up on preschoolers and boys that love \\"diggers\\" and trucks.

How depressing, the only reason I ride inside is because the weather is bad and I have to be indoors. I sure don't want to watch an ugly day on tv, would much rather see a beautiful day at the beach or something.The commentary and shifting was good, gave me something to do.

If you have a heart rate monitor, and cadence sensor for your bike, you can really get a good feel for the type of ride that you are on. I like to dim the lights, and use a little imagination, and I am in Alaska. This is a fun way to get a great workout; I'm covered in sweat after every ride (though I usually fast forward through the breaks, and pedal through the coasting portions). It is a lot of fun, and is definitely more fun than the normal \\"workout\\" type videos out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Indian to Girdwood","review":"Of the Alaska Collection, this was my favorite ride. Though the lighting was a little grey, the views of the Chugach Mountains more than made up for it. Riding on the bike path for the whole ride was a fun experience.

This bag is strong and dependable."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wouldn't buy another one.","review":"I saw a review where the guy said he could put two detectors and all his equipment in the bag. I can't. It's a cramped fit to put one Sharp Shooter two in it, and that's after you take it apart and put the two pieces in the bag. There is enough room for 8\\" and 4\\" coils and headphones, but you have to take everything out of the bag to get to them. The bag is cramped with the detector alone and offers no padding for protection. If it sold in the $5 to $10 range, I would have given it two stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Questionable Value","review":"I bought the metal detector because I needed to find a lost survey pin. I assumed I'd need something to keep it in so I ordered the carry bag. It is reasonably well made but it is just a nylon zippered bag. There is nothing particularly unique about it (other than the name emblazoned on the side) and it does not afford the metal detector much protection. The metal detector arrived in a well designed box that would suffice for long term storage and probably offer more protection against accidental damage in transit. It would take more time to unpack and repack the box so I'd recommend the carrying bag to those buying a metal detector for frequent use. But for someone who, like me, who intends to use the device infrequently and needs a storage case, I'd recommend saving the twenty bucks. Just use the product packaging."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smaller than expected","review":"I'm disappointed that the metal detector has to be taken apart to fit in the bag.

After a lot of research, I looked upon the Seymour Duncan Hot Rodded Set and decided to give it a try. It was one of my best decisions! The guitar sounded OK but now it sounds great!

The Kindle edition has enough graphics for my needs and the content is exactly that of the hard copy magazine. I enjoy the variety of topics and the in depth cover stories. Time is a very good weekly news, culture, and entertainment source and I tend to read it much more when on the Kindle...virtually cover-to-cover. The cost of $2.99/mo is fair.

Instead whenever you run into an article that has these in any decent amount, they've inserted an entry telling you to go get a PDF or print version. The salvation here is that their MOBILE web site at least has some images (even if impossibly small) and seems better formatted and organized. It looks and feels like some cheap RSS reader collected this rather than being an electronic version of the magazine. To fix it they should include all major article pictures, along with a full-screen copy of the cover. Time without pictures, is like the Braille-edition of Playboy. No wonder it is just $1.49 a month."},{"rating":"1","title":"Passable - but not good enough for a price hike","review":"Time has addressed some of the concerns previous reviewers have brought up - there are no more truncated articles, and there are occasionally a few pictures with the articles.

I still feel that some articles are missing on occasion, although I don't have a print edition to compare it to.So, for a $1.49 a month magazine (just under the price of a print subscription), it's decent. But at $2.99? Nearing double the price of a print subscription, with all the color pictures and charts, and knowledge that you are, in fact, getting the whole text of every article published?

The pictures in this book are quality pictures that I could relate to and understand.However, to the lay person, without captions or stories, these pictures don't tell their \\"story\\". There are several pictures of \\"rodeo girls\\", but the title doesn't accurately represent what is inside the book. There is an index in the back of the book that gives a brief description of who is in the picture, but it is difficult to tie to the pictures because they are not numbered.A good book, terrific pictures that tell a story, but not a book that would appeal to a broad group of people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing could be better","review":"If you have the slightest interest in this book, GET IT! It has the best photos of exactly \\"Rodeo Girl\\". Lots of sequins, lots of hair. It looks great on a coffee table too."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISAPPOINTED!!","review":"I'm really disappointed. As a current title holder and someone who has competed for national titles I don't think this book is really accurate. It is billed as a rodeo queen pictorial, but the pictures are so limited. It's about rodeo culture. Not rodeo queens.There are so many pictures of random rodeo scenes. In fact, I think it gives the layperson a really negative view of the rodeo culture. The pictures are over exposed and the way they are printed make them seem so dated. It's almost embarrasing. The few pictures that she had of queens weren't great, nothing to write home about. If they were of myself, I probably wouldn't buy the book.To me it was a disappointing waste of money. But if she got THIS published, I know I could put my personal photos together, not rake the time to title them and be a hit!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Complex and worthwhile!","review":"Technically book 4 in the Patternist series, it's actually the first in terms of time within the novels. We meet the two major characters, the immortal (male) Doro and the immortal (female) Anayawu. They form a very complex bond, made of love/hate, commonality, and need. They are opposites in many ways, with Doro being more consistently the 'heavy' (by which I mean he is controlling, murderous if need be, and a user. Anayawu is a healer who can change her shape and and is a mother, showing her nurturing tendencies often (but don't be fooled - she can get pretty pissed off herself). It's an intriguing look at emotional and physical slavery, gender roles, and race."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow! This is great stuff.","review":"The premise is original which hooks you right from the beginning. This story has many layers of meaning to it and will appeal to just about anyone. I found the character development very similar to Orson Scott Card's in terms of engaging the reader in caring about the characters. Octivia Butler often reminds me of Gabriel Garcia Marquez because of the way she weaves a bit of the supernatural into her stories. In some ways, this story is also like a Greek myth because it reveals the essence of human relationships. \\"Mind of My Mind\\" is the follow-up book and you're going to want to read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wild Seed","review":"I have read three of Butler's books, the Parable of the Sower, Clay's Ark and Wild Seed. This is my third favorite. Butler is an imaginative and masterful writer. I continue to be impressed by her."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Masterpiece","review":"This novel first came to my attention via a book by Orson Scott Card on how to write fiction. Mr. Card drew a handful of worthy examples of style from this book, and rightly so. Although the first chapter is by far the best on many levels, the rest of the story is fascinating and gripping. A work of speculative fiction, \\"Wild Seed\\" contains elements of history, anthropology, biology and geography combined with the genres of fantasy and science fiction. A century from now this book should be well enshrined as a classic of North American literature."},{"rating":"2","title":"for the multicultural reader","review":"This book is in a league of its own. The content is so new. I read sci-fi and fantasy all the time and it rarely includes people of other races much less focuses on them. Not only does this book focus on an African woman it is also completely original. I have never read any book that has content that is the same as the content in this book. It is truly extaordinary and due to that book Butler has become one of my favorite authors. Now, if only I could get SURVIVORS by her...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Butler imaginative as always","review":"Octavia E. Butler is a wonderful writer. This book was very good, and yet I think it too be one of her lesser works. It is one of a number of books involving the character Doro, who has supernatural abilities. This particular book will disappoint readers that only like happy endings. Butler has a great command of our language and combined with a very creative imagination, all of her books are worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic","review":"I am not normally a science fiction fan, but this book gripped me from the start and I couldn't put it down. Butler's lean, spare style of writing helps keep the story tightly under control and moving briskly. In addition, her skill at constructing multi-dimensional characters is at it's best in this novel. It isn't easy to make individuals as powerful as Anyanwu and Doro seem like believable people with genuine human emotions, but Butler pulls it off, showing startingly empathy with her characters, especially Anyanwu. The relationship between Doro and Anyanwu is so skillfully done you can't help but think of them as real people. The book is rich with both historical and sci-fi detail and gives the reader an almost overwhelming sense of epic scope while basing the story around a small, intimate cast. Butler is an excellent writer and this is arguably her finest effort -- a good book to start with if you haven't read her before.--Teri"},{"rating":"2","title":"still thinking about it","review":"I like Octavia Butler's writing, so maybe i am biased. But it has been 2 weeks since I finished the book and I am still thinking about it. Her books are the kind that make me want to be able to check in on the characters at later points in life. She weaves such an excellent story."},{"rating":"2","title":"True Masterpiece","review":"Octavia Butler is a remarkable writer. With Wild Seed, as all of her literature, she never falls short to deliver an astonishing, riveting, and provocative story that captivates the audience. Her writing allows readers to remove themselves from the comfort of their narcissism with beliefs that the world is black and white. Her characters and situations are believable to the well educated and well cultured individual."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different ways to be a mutant","review":"Good book; several layers of reference, including gender dynamics, the Old Testament, and even a touch of the conflict between vampires and werewolves.This particular edition has an irritating frequency of editorial errors (duplicated lines, wrong words, wrong letters), which I found distracting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major Let Down!","review":"'Wild Seed' seemed interesting from its description and on searching for reviews I found almost entirely praise...On reading it however I was left uninspired and rather bored and found myself endlessly waiting for it to get to the \\"good bit\\". The author seemed to drag out everything with repetitive dialogue which left very little room for any excitement (unless you find incest exciting of course). Far from being a good sci-fi or fantasy book, Wild Seed is more of a dull drama, with the supernatural powers thrown in as a weak anchor to tie the plot together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant!","review":"This was a *great* book. The characters were just gripping. I was moved to tears more than once. You *have* to read this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wild Seed is a great book...","review":"I thought Wild Seed, was a very interesting book. I love the way Ms. Butler visualized the life of immortals Anyanwu and Doro. There were a few misspelled words, and repeated sentences however, it was a great book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ultimately a downer","review":"I disagree with the majority vote here. I found the writing and story line to be like a bad Anne Rice novel. At least with Rice's vampires, you get a sense of their passion. Butler's book lacks this passion. For this reason, I found the characters not very well developed. To me, Doro was flatly evil and Anyanwu was long-suffering. And the various powers the characters possess end up seeming X-men cartoonish.I do think Butler writes well, and loved the Lillith's Brood series. But this book disappointed me and didn't leave me any the better for having invested my time in reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Story okay...Kindle formatting awful","review":"The story was pretty good. I enjoyed it. However, the formatting for the Kindle was awful. Words were mispelled, periods were missing at the ends of sentences, the number \\"1\\" was used for the letter \\"L\\" randomly, just to name a few of the many, many mistakes found on every page. If this had been a free book, perhaps I wouldn't complain. But I paid around $10 for this book. Amazon, what gives?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read","review":"I picked this book up at the library - not having a clue who this author was or what she wrote like. I'd never even heard about her. Now I know why - it's her first book! And a great one at that. I have a five month old baby, and even with trying to take care of her and doing the housework, I managed to read it in two days!! Since I have a baby, I really loved her descriptions of the babies. She seemed to bring them to life. A lot of this book is very realistic and you feel like you're actually there with the characters. The only reason this doesn't have five stars is because I thought the ending slightly abrupt, though at least it doesn't follow the typical story type. Once again though, truely a great read! I want to recommend it to everyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"1","review":"I really enjoyed the characters of this story but the end disappointed me. It ended abruptly, leaving questions unanswered. I didn't get to see if Gloria truly got saved, or if she and MacGregan ever married.

The author set up her character so well and then never did anything important with her. An epilogue would have been nice. The story just seemed unfinished and open-ended to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good CD.","review":"This is probably one of Impaled's better CD's. It has good vocals with better instrumentals and a better overall sound than Death After Life.

He loves construction trucks and has about 15 in his collection so far. The excavator is his favorite truck, so this is his favorite toy. He can put figures inside to pretend like they are driving it and he likes to take it outside and pick up dirt with the bucket and put it in his dump truck.After about a week, a plastic part of the boom disconnected, never to be reconnected. He continued to play with it and ignore it, but after about 3.5 weeks, the bottom part of the boom broke as well. Which was the source of alot of crying in our house. Although he did play with the toy alot, he's not especially rough with it. And, of all his trucks, this is the only one that has broken beyond repair so far.We will be buying a new excavator toy, just not this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money!","review":"This was a Christmas gift for my son. Out of the box it was broken, the piece of plastic that attaches the boom to the arm was not attached. I put the box aside with the intentions of returning it.

Well, he would not part with his broken toy even after arm came off the base of the truck and has to be reattached every couple of minutes. I contacted the company and they provided me with the website to order spare parts, the problem is not needing a spare part, the entire truck is a piece of cheaply made garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Arm broke","review":"I bought this excavator for my son for Christmas. He was so excited to play with it. But like another review states, after a few minutes the gray piece in the arm does not stay where it is supposed to and falls down every time he tries to manipulate the bucket. He was crying on Christmas morning b/c it would not work correctly. We used tape to fix it but it was still very disappointing. Do not buy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"not to be played with","review":"Nice looking toy, but considering it is made for a young child not worth more than a few dollars.My son loved this excavator for 3 days before it fell apart. When I received it and saw how flimsy it looked I was concerned about durability and my worries were warranted.

Shame on Penguin for releasing such a poor quality product, especially in these days of quality reproduction.

I'd still recommend you buy the book, but this DVD is all you need to get started.Results for me have been about a 20 second gain in my average pace for a tempo run I do on fairly regular basis to judge how my training is going. It's also made a significant reduction in the soreness I had been getting in my lower legs and my knees never bother me anymore.Only reason I did not give it 5 stars is becuase there is still room for improvement in both deeper explanation of more advanced subjects he covers in the book and I think the author could be more lively in his delivery.

However, its quality is really lacking. The legs, especially the lower, thinner segments, are really flimsy, and the joints are also wobbly (though they do lock well). The swivel head is cumbersome to use, and if you have a moderately heavy lens attached to this thing, it's very difficult to tighten it enough to actually keep the lens pointed at your subject rather than drooping down towards the ground.Perhaps the most important issue is the camera attachment. Though my camera hasn't fallen off in my limited use of this tripod, it was so wobbly and loose that I was constantly afraid my expensive DSLR would crash 4 feet to the ground.

It does however, have quite a happy ending.

Jeremiah's struggle to get what most everyone in life wants takes center stage in this wonderful novel. It shows all the decisions he made in life, both good and bad, and also shows the reader how a simple choice can make your path in life take a completely different turn. It also tells the reader how some thing wonderful can come from something totally evil. For example, Jeremiah's daughter....and his terrible wife.

This is so poorly written, every page felt like a chore. Steel's constant use of ellipses . . . makes the reader . . . feel like an engine is . . . sputtering. How does this woman sell so many books?

I concur with the opinion of other reviewers that you may not get what you thought you were getting--at least from one vendor (Adorama). The unit is supposed to work by pinching the outside of the hot shoe. Enough pressure to hold a heavier object is likely to bend the hot shoe. I would have thought that there would be a piece to actually slide into the shoe--much better mechanically--but no such luck with this piece of junk. Perhaps it might work on some cameras, but that list doesn't include Canon.Perhaps it's a good idea never to buy something like this sight-unseen.

If you're not careful then the spacer on the thumb screw, which I think is the culprit being slightly too long, will also fall off.

It strays away from the typical comedies, and is unique from any jack black or ben stiller comedy film. You will be suprised at the humor, it's a little shocking at points. I gave it 4 stars due to lots of filthy language, as a mom i had to wait untill the kids were in bed to watch it. other than that i think this movie is definatly worth it!!

The first 10 minutes are indeed funny as many have pointed out but it's downhill all the way thereafter - 2 hours of downhill. Perhaps I didn't understand things. I'm a Brit and have lived in the US for 15 years and should have no problem with comprehension. I understood about 50% of what was said - and 100% of the frequent use of the F and S words.

This is an expensive waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Probably one of the worst movies I have ever seen","review":"I rented this movie based on a suggestion from a friend who told me it was hilarious. I guess maybe I just don't \\"get\\" this kind of humour. The opening first few minutes with the fake trailers was mildly amusing and showed hope that the movie would pick up momentum. Like another viewer mentioned, it was all downhill from there. I think I may have laughed once or twice the entire movie. The script is absolutely terrible, you can actually feel the actors trying to be funny but just quite not making it. For the record, I am a Ben Stiller fan and find him hysterical in most roles. This movie is just a terrible, terrible dud."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unwatchable, Pointless, and Stupid","review":"I am sorry I wasted any time with this worthless dreck. It is an abomination, without redeeming value at all. Ben stiller is as wooden as a barn door. He isn't funny, and none of the other cast members could save this waste of electricity.

It is utterly without value."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment.","review":"Short and sweet: I didn't laugh throughout the entire movie.

When 4 snobby actors try to make an action war film, they all screw up, so the writer of the book of the film they are making suggest to take the actors into the jungles of Vietnam to make them see what it's really like.

I highly suggest TROPIC THUNDER!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sparingly Funny - not enough though","review":"I very much looked forward to seeing this movie. Unfortunately, most of it did not work out for me. The movie just wasn't funny enough throughout.

The dodgeball film Ben Stiller did was much more palatable, which isn't saying much. They've taken three of the most over exposed actors, two of which aren't even really actors, and given them a horrible vehicle. The veritable avalanche of Jack Black and Ben Stiller projects is begining to taste like so many doses of castor oil. It's begining to resemble the Will Ferrel syndrome; please make it stop. The Tom Cruise \\"cussing jewish producer guy\\" was so over sold that when I watched his performance I was just left scratching my head. The same can be said for the black face Robert Downey; it's funny that he's wearing an afro wig and lowered his voice a few octaves? I don't get it.

I wonder how they could have found the clips they showed in previews, they were the only ones not using the most obscene language possible. The preview make you want to see more of Stiller's spot on comedy, however, the cost was so great my psyche may never be the same.On a bright note, Tom Cruise plays one of the most authentic roles I have ever scene him in. Should he have a failed plastic surgery as he ages, this might be exactly what we see in 20-30 years. I mean, come on, he already could not contain himself when he bagged his hottie pubescent now wife."},{"rating":"1","title":"Robert Downey Junior stole the show!","review":"First of all, why would Ben Stiller be the star? His character was not funny. Jack Black had a few moments, but not many. Robert Downey Junior was the best character of the movie. I have never seen anyone play a black man like him! My husband and I are also black and we thought that he stole the show. Even when he just said an average line it was funny because he made it so real. I can actually imagine a real person being like his character. We are also a military family and you would be surprised at how many people can take it all to another level. I have to admit that I didn't look to see who was in the movie first (my husband bought it), so I didn't even know that he was in it at first. It actually took me a little while before I realized that it was him! He did an excellent job! I didn't think that the movie was that funny, but he saved it.

You can see dozens of Hollywood stars in the characters portryed by Ben Stiller, Jack Black, Robert Downey, Jr. and (insert name of the kid in the movie).Tropic Thunder acheives its goal and while it drags a bit in places and is not \\"falling off of your chair laughing\\" throughout the entire movie, it is quite funny and if you are able to \\"get\\" what Stiller and co. are trying to do, it's a great film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as funny as it thinks it is","review":"I really can't believe the other reviews here - I'm thinking that Ben Stiller has created dozens of Amazon accounts and is posting positive reviews....By now you know it's a spoof. I read one of the reviews comparing it to Blazing Saddles - heresy. This is rubbish. What story/plot (I know it's a comedy) is paper thin. Stiller and Black are going through the motions. Downey is only interesting because of his black/white thing.It's essentially an unfunny spoof Rambo. You remember that \\"coal miner\\" segment from Zoolander - it's that kind of crap for 107 minutes.The only thing getting it above 1 star is Tom Cruise (yes you read that right) - Tom Cruise is intentionally funny.Inane, pointless, drivel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible even for a comedy","review":"It has a few funny moments but its too lackluster in between those moments to really enjoy the movie.

Rent first or look in your local thrift store bins in 6 months."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ben Stiller proves once again that he has zero acting ability","review":"The only reason I watched this movie was because Robert Downey Jr. was in it. Watching Ben Stiller play next to Robert Downey Jr. was gut wrenching to say the least. Robert Downey Jr. preformed flawlessly of course and carried the poor script and most of the scenes as much as possible. Ben Stiller was horrible however, proving once again that he has no acting talent what so ever. Tom Cruise pulled off his disguised nasty producer part pretty good except for his dancing scenes. I have seen several of Ben Stiller's movies and he just never seems to get any better. Someone please drag him to acting school and chain him a desk so he can learn something.

I was very upset with paying $20 for this movie and being disgusted with it. Every other word out of anyone's mouth is a F-bomb, I guess they thought if they could cuss alot it would make the movie better. There were a VERY few moments where you may laugh, but the rest was not worth it. I dont know about most people, but watching Tom Cruise with a fake gut and bald head screaming and yelling at everyone on the screen and then trying to save his screen time by dancing at the end of the movie was HORRIBLE.You need to rent this movie before purchasing it unless you are into crude humor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck","review":"I couldn't even get past the first 10 minutes.

Movie seemed aimed at 14 year olds and I ain't one, so I guess I couldn't appreciate the over the top chararcters and loose script. And what's with the praise for Robert Downey in this role? What I saw from him was abysmal."},{"rating":"1","title":"This film was AWEFUL","review":"I am usually a big fan of Ben Stiller. Loved Meet the Parents, Dodgeball, even Envy was not that bad. But this movie tried to do too much. And Ben Stiller's style of comedy is starting to wear thin (kind of like Will Farrell's). He should try something different. And I'm not talking about something along the lines of Simple Jack. I think maybe he should have a chat with Jim Carey about what to do next.Robert Downey Jr did his best to try to keep this one going, but even he wasn't good enough to save this turkey."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather dull","review":"If you've seen the trailer and liked it, don't go any further : all that is worthwhile is there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy Theatrical Cut!!","review":"I second the previous reviewers who say to buy the theatrical cut.

Don't make the same mistake I did!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed.","review":"I would say that I am a Ben Stiller fan but I was not very impressed. The best thing about this movie was Robert Downey Jr., that was good acting and good make-up. My kids are still haunted by the panda bear scene, HA! HA!

From the guns to the decapitated heads to the explosive ending, there is zero chance that anyone who enjoys cinema would not appreciate this instant classic. Or, should I say that if you don't enjoy this movie, please stay away from me, because life is too short to be around people that can't appreciate comedy like this.

We love Ben Stiller movies and we love movies with Jack Black - until this one. When I read the reviews, I was sure this was a winner of a comedy. From the head spurting blood to the head on the end of Ben Stiller's bayonet, we did not find one laugh. There were a number of times that I had to turn away from the movie, retching. When Ben Stiller tasted the goo from the head to prove it was sugar water, we turned the DVD off. This movie is NOT for squeamish folks. If anyone has the time, I would love someone tell me what parts are funny. Ben and Jack, shame on you for mistaking gore for humor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Film Comedy of All Time","review":"As comedies go, Tropical Thunder makes Porky's II look like something by Noel Coward.

I'm still looking for someone who can explain why Ben Stiller and Jack Black are successful film comedians. Neither is a bit funny. Stiller looks okay, I guess, especially considering who his parents are, but Black doesn't have good looks or anything else going for him.

Everything else about this movie was as bad as tom cruise's character and just as \\"classy\\".

Well, it seemed like this movie couldn't make up its mind if it was trying to be a comedy, or trying to be an action adventure flick. To me, it failed as a comedy. It just wasn't that funny. The phony movie previews at the beginning were funny, but that was about it. There was some \\"ironic humor\\" in the film, but not much \\"laugh out loud\\" funny stuff.Though I will say that Tom Cruise's performance was inspired."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big disapointment!","review":"The cast seamed fabulous. The trailer was funny. I had great expectations then the movie started. Bad taste, not funny jokes.

This movie is not one of them. It is just a lot of bathroom humor--nothing really funny. If you liked Ben Stiller in Dodgeball or some of his other movies, then you might like this--but I thought Dodgeball was a lot better than this.

Jack Black plays Jack Black. Ben Stiller plays the Zoolander (again). Robert Downey Jr. plays a black man and is convincing and interesting, except I couldn't understand half of what he said. Tom Cruise is surprisingly funny and Matthew McConaughey is good.But the movie is just stupid. The premise is funny, and I knew the premise going in - prima-donna actors doing a film on Viet Nam go off-set and think they are still filming a movie when they get caught up in a drug lord operation and are under real attack.But it is poorly executed and just over the top camp.I'm clearly in the minority here, so as a guide to others let me say that if you like Zoolander then this movie is for you.

Yes, I know, it was an unrealistic view of war and over the top, however, ask any Vietnam vet if he thought this was remotely funny. I was even born yet when Vietnam was happening, yet this offended me in some ways. I wonder if Mr. Stiller would find a comedy about Auschwitz just as funny. Bottom line?

Robert Downey Jr. is the most politically incorrect one, playing an Aussie actor who gets his skin darkened to play the role of a black man in a movie about Vietnam. His comments to Stiller about the latter's \\"going full retard\\" as Simple Jack are just priceless. Yes, they're politically incorrect, but we could use more of that!Jack Black holds his own as a bleach blond, druggie whiner, while Tom Cruise takes the cake as a chubby, hairy, obnoxious and abusive producer back home in Los Angeles.

I love that it locks onto the can so you don't have to use brute force to squeeze the handles together. I purchased this can opener after two other openers broke within a week of each other.

This new model is easier to use (ergo dynamic) and opens everything we've attempted.

I was looking at electric openers and none of them, in my opinion, were worth buying. Originally I began looking at manual openers just to replace the cheap, junk one that I was using.

Once you get the blade through the can, the locking mechanism allows you to focus on twisting and not squeezing, which is also great for those with sensitive hands.The magnet on this can opener is strong enough to move lids around and position them to be safely picked up, but it isn't strong enough to completely pick up most lids, which would have been a nice addition. But in the end, this is the best can opener I've used."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best can opener I've ever used","review":"It sounds strange to get excited enough about a can opener to go on Amazon and leave a review for it.

I love Zyliss products - very high quality and this one doesn't disappoint there. However, you have to apply the opener perfectly or it doesn't close smoothly. Also, it is difficult to use the magnet. By the time you release the opener and position it just perfectly to get the lid, the lid has already started to sink into the can. Now, once you get the lid, the magnet release is a really neat feature. I just wish it was a little easier on the hands."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally one I can keep around.","review":"This can opener is quality built. I was a little concerned about it being mostly plastic but it functions magnificently. Quality engineering and materials. Haven't cold weather tested it for deer camp but at home in the kitchen it has the style and functionality needed to keep it out of the garbage can. I actually think I am using canned goods more because of it and the wife has seen me help out more in the kitchen because of it. May seem like a lot to say but those that have been frustrated with opening cans will understand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stylish, Easy to use","review":"I really like the product. The grip is very ergonomically designed, so your hands don't hurt even after opening 10 cans. The lock method is very cool and gives you an almost perfect cut every single time. But I just can't understand the automatic lift part of it. But for the price, this is a great can opener, best of its kind :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Opens cans with ease","review":"No more fighting with those cheap can openers while bruising your fingers. This can opener is a breeze to use and feels nice in the hand. The magnet's usefulness is questionable since if the lid drops much lower than the edge of the can (like let's say a tuna fish can that you squeezed to drain the liquid), it is hard to get the magnet on the lid because the crank gets in the way. If there was a way to extend the magnet out, this can opener would be perfect. I definately recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome opener","review":"After 2 weeks and multiple cans opened I have to say that this is the BEST opener we have ever owned. I hope its ease of use continues for many years to come. It makes it nearly effortless to open cans."},{"rating":"2","title":"When others failed this did the trick","review":"I ordered two can openers, one electric and this one.

You can drain tuna, vegies, etc. by just holding the can with the opener before removing the lid and pour the water, etc. down the drain or into a container.

Terrible state of affairs that we live in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful can opener...","review":"We've been looking for something to replace the older can opener we have, but this one was not it - I used it once and returned it. The other type by the same company is fine if you want one that doesn't leave any sharp edges."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk - do not buy","review":"I bought this and have been using it regularly for months. If it were made of metal it would be a great idea and a revolutionary product. Since it is made of plastic it flexes too much and barely pierces the can in many cases because I can't apply enough force due to the flexing. Go to any store and you will see that most if not all manual can openers are metal. That's for a reason. Zyliss engineers should be fired. Zyliss employees should use the products they sell.15 Sep 2011 update: I bought an Oxo Steel and what a difference. Excellent can opener. Very strong, stylish, and comfortable. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good for Arthritic Hands","review":"I have had issues with every other opener, but this one really works for me.

This is a big plus for me, since I sometimes encounter odd cans that just won't open like others (some unusual seams on imported cans)---I like the fact that this opener works in either direction.No need to use a traditional \\"death grip\\" to squeeze the opener--it has a built-in lock that holds the blade down firmly in the can with no help from you. No slip grip, large easy \\"key\\" is simple to turn, even for tired hands. It also has a handy magnet I sometimes use to retrieve cut can lids (but usually, I just lift them off with my fingers).This was a great purchase--highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Zyliss workability.","review":"Well, so far so good. It hasn't been really long enough to find out if this opener is of any quality. We have gone through at least three can openers..(hand operated) in a year. But, as I have mentioned, so far.. It does take a bit of muscle at the start, but when it cuts into a can, the rest of operation is an easy turning."},{"rating":"2","title":"#1 can opener","review":"This is my new favorite can opener! I love the handle because it is comfortable to hold on to. The design is really cool too. I bought the green one and it is snazzy. It's very easy to open cans with it; no strain on turning the knob like other openers I've had. I love the magnet that gets the lid out of the can and then releases it. I've had too much fun playing with this gadget! I would definitely recommend this to anyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to use","review":"This is a comfortable can opener especially for the older population and well worth the price that I paid.

Gets jammed on can labels and when it gets stuck, have to unlock and start over. Same kinds of cans used all the time, sometimes it works all around one can, more often tho - it jams ... I did put in the the dishwasher, maybe that had something to do with it. Now looking for an opener that has a magnet that brings the can's top up instead of dropping into the product. Had one a long time ago, much better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"works well","review":"works very well - very easy to open cans. they lid magnet function isn't really that helpful, but it is a good can opener, and cans don't over slip out of it when trying to open them"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Can Opener!","review":"Very good product. Has held up well to all the dishwasher cycles I have submitted it to, since I am a bit of a germ freak when it comes to openers that was important to me. It is easy to turn, the other most important quality I look for. The durability seems there, but time will really tell, so far so good. I am a bit frustrated by the locking mechanism, which is all that kept it from getting 5 stars from me, but it is a minor annoyance, and wouldn't prevent me from buying it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works like a dream","review":"Hands down this is the BEST can opener ever.

Definately looking forward to purchasing a copy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fishburne is great, but ...","review":"As always, Fishburne turns in great work here. However, it must be said that while Marshall has historical significance, he was an absolutely HORRIBLE Justice. It is quite clear from reading his opinions that he had little, if any, understanding of constitutional law, and no respect whatsoever for the principles supporting said law. In short, he was totally incompetent.Yet, he was celebrated nonetheless for obvious reasons.And here we are, all these years later, making PRECISELY the same mistake with Obama. We have a total incompetent with no respect for the country in a position of power, making a mess of everything he touches.We'd all be quite a bit better off if men were judged by merit, mind, and act.

Its no surprise that this genre died out to grunge, because all the good bands of this era started to lose their edge. Sad really, Id rather have bought something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"3 Is Third Best","review":"Firehouse departed from their formula with this release. Under pressure from Grunge or whatever, they only put three, what I'll call \\"true to their roots\\" tracks, on the album.Here For You, No One At All and I Live My Life For You are very good melodic tunes. I Live My Life For You is absolutely great and is one of my favorite ballads. The other stuff is just not as fun as before on Firehouse (debut) and Hold Your Fire."},{"rating":"2","title":"Swerve","review":"While Firehouse can still rock with the best of them, the boys from New Jersey take a little more serious approach to rock with \\"3\\". Unfortunately Firehouse uses mostly ballads and slower track, unlike their first 2 albums. even still, Firehouse mastered ballads and \\"I Live My Life For You\\", is one of the best they ever did. This is a must have for any true fan of the late 80s early 90s rock scence."},{"rating":"2","title":"3rd times the charm!","review":"I have been a fan of these guys since Don't treat me bad started making the rounds on radio many years ago. Their follow up to their debut was \\"Hold Your Fire\\" which is another solid release. On 3,the guys expand a little bit musically but still have their edge. If you're wanting Metal,there's always Metallica or Anthrax or groups of that genre. This effort by Firehouse has a little bit of everything to offer.\\"Love is a dangerous thing\\" is a little uptempo rocker which is followed by the heavier,but still melodic \\"what's wrong\\",and then there is the Tongue in cheek rocker \\"Somethin' 'Bout your body\\" which is a catchy song.There are the ballads,such as \\"Here for You\\",\\"No one at All\\",and of course \\"I live my life for you\\" which closes out the cd nicely.The cd has a good flow throughout,with no reason to skip thru any of the tunes.It's a shame that these guys weren't marketed better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Food","review":"These crisps are great especially for beginners or those prone to overfeeding their fish. The back of the bottle tells you one crisp for every inch of fish so instead of having to watch to see what your fish do or don't eat (and having to scoop out the extra) these crisps allow us fish parents to have an exact amount of food for our fish each and every time.There are two types of crisps in the bottle. Both crisps have an orange outer ring that contains their vital nutrients and vitamins, one of the crisps has a brown interior circle that is algae meal to stimulate the goldfish to have the richest color possible, and the other crisp has a yellow center that contains high-protein krill to help them with muscle growth.Overall, my little ones enjoy this food and I love all the nutrients it provides for them (me not having to scoop out any extras is a bonus ^_^)"},{"rating":"1","title":"less mess, bad color","review":"I hare flake food. I have to crunch it up for the smaller fish and the bigger fish doesn't eat the smaller pieces. It makes the water yucky.

Not only that, but the water testz are showing a poor watwr quality now and the bigger fish is loosing scales (from poor water quality). Says on the bottle \\"will not cloud water when used as directed\\", but as directed is \\"one crisp per inch of fish 2-3 times daily\\". I dialed way back on how much we fed, but one crisp per inch was not enough. The fish became erratic and fought. They were obviously hungry. Too bad, this could be a great product idea if made properly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Red Tide","review":"The flakes would be perfect if it wasn't for the RED DYE.

Amazing first novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing for this reader","review":"I have to say I was disappointed in this book which I thought had a lot of promise. I loved the first chapter, and after that it went downhill quickly. Like the previous reviewer, I didn't get the relationship between the gay couple of Jack and Stuart, and I found the character of Jack completely unsympathetic. Why would anyone want to befriend him much less be in a relationship with him, or read another 300 pages about him. The character of Flynn is tragic, and why any kind of treatment for her is only attempted once when she's being cared for by a healthcare professional is beyond me. To give the author credit, despite the fact I kept complaining about the book to my partner, she did keep me intrigued enough to finish it...if only to see if one more piece of misery was going to be heaped onto the main character's life."},{"rating":"2","title":"If You Think Nsync, Bsb, 98 Groups Are Good Get This One","review":"This is a good c.d.

Dryden's classic \\"The Game\\" is not just about his experiences with the Habs but instead is a sounding board his his feelings on hockey in general, the city of Montreal, and so forth. \\"From Behind the Red Line\\" is similar type of book. Its not just a diary of a hockey player in a foreign country.

Women are depicted from a variety of angles and the number of photos is astounding. My problem with the book is that it seriously lacks color and many of the photos are done in similar, artistic manners. It seems that many of the photographers enjoy experimenting with photography more than they enjoy bringing out the best in the women they are viewing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Another One!","review":"How many more 'histories of nude photography' can be produced without depleting the national ink reserves which will certainly result in books, such as Lady Chatterly's Lover, never again being printed? This book is a thick-as-a-brick collection of images that questions why anyone would want to collect such things. Because most of these images are old does not make them any more interesting and, in some ways, enables the 'reader' to chastise the past as 'no better' than the present in its appetite for low-bar imagery. Fortunately, historical revisionism does not fare well in the art world. Thumbing through this edition left me searching for any redeemable value beyond relief after placing it back on the shelf. As an alternative to this garbage, I suggest supporting photographers currently working in this genre; Saudek, Sturges, and so forth. Ok, the book is cheap and if you don't have one of these monocular anthologies, I suppose this one is as good, or bad, as all the others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finest example of Chicago-Style Gospel","review":"I own quite a few of Rev.

The best I could get is a shipping label to avoid return charges. If your foot is less than an inch wide, this is your shoe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Quality","review":"These are great tennis.

I found myself constantly looking ahead in the book to express ideas which used the grammar we were currently working on. The format for the subjunctive tenses were especially ill-conceived.

Ethan became wild because everyone expected him to and Grace withdrew into herself and tried to become \\"invisible\\". Good read, not just fluff. Message for all.

Well, it wasn't. I am not familiar with the author, but the reviews for the book were so good, and yes, he appears to be a funny man. However, reading about his RV trip with his parents and grown kids (WHY did they go??) became a one-note show very quickly. His mother swears and is afraid of everything. His father sings, sometimes the great funny old songs, nauturally wearing the uniform of the old man. The only sights that interest them on their trip through the US are the Office Depots and Walmarts; they go wild with excitement when they see one. His kids are barely noticeable. They drive on and on and the author quotes the continuous witticisms from his parents. It gets old very quickly. I skimmed the last two-thirds of the book and put it in my very short stack of books to give to the library. Very disappointing. To me, at least."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little bit heartwarming but a lot of tedious reading.","review":"It started off good. I liked Mike's parents and they were quirky like most people's parents so I got a few chuckles about the things they said. But this is a generally ordinary family and not much exciting happens on this road trip, at all. I kept waiting for something to happen. So soon I felt like it got pretty dull with the day to day conversations you would have in your own house about your own relatives. It was a bit mundane and not as interesting to me as I think it was to them. I felt like there just wasn't enough material here for a book.

Mike Leonard's cross country RV journey allows him and his college and adult age children the precious gift of knowing their parent/grandparents while there is still time to listen and reflect on life lessons learned. I stumbled upon this book and am so thankful for it both touched my heart and made me laugh out loud numerous times. Mr. Leonard also does a profound job of showing how life's unexpected providences can change the course of a life in totally unexpected ways. You'll want to buy extra copies of this and give it to your friends so they can enjoy the journey as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great family fun","review":"We've seen Mike Leonard on TV for years and always really liked his style and subjects.

It was not bad in those respects, but I had a great let-down when I got into the reading. I had to stop reading it because the language was so raw. The unfortunate grandma had not learned to express herself in a dignified, modest manner. It was very offensive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pleasant reading, but a little pointless.","review":"I think this book was a little too personal to be widely interesting to a large readership. The writing style was pretty good, and there are a lot of pretty funny incidents. But, in a way, it was easy to put it down and forget to pick it up again. I had to read it for my book club (and paid for the book!) or I probably would have set it aside and picked up something more compelling.Still, if anyone is feeling especially nostalgic about their family or would like to take a family road trip one day, this book has something to offer. More so, if you have an interest in Mike Leonard's family. His mother was my favorite character."},{"rating":"1","title":"An anti-valentine","review":"Why Mike Leonard should choose to portray his parents like this flies in the face of common sense. Dysfunctional families can be lots of fun, but the Leonards seem kinda . . . mirthless, I guess. And boring.

Sometimes it looked like a birthday cake or a squirrel or a tree and so on and so forth. The book provides an excellent introduction for preschool/kindergarten lessons on clouds or as the pre-model activity for some other creative exercise.

Looking at the other review it seems that Amazon makes a habit of doing this. It is not acceptable to sell someone something and then send them something else. I honestly feel that this was done intentionally. I believe that the shipper was hoping that I would keep the cheaper practise pad. When a customer orders a expensive item and is sent something of much lesser quality it is rediculous that I will have to wait 2-3 weeks after the incorrectly shipped item is returned and process.

I have not had time to audition the PWM-A600 in an actual meeting situation but I like the features and size. It offers both a wired and wireless microphone, the latter must be held about an inch from your lips which limits the system from picking up any other sound other than the speaker's voice. Otherwise my only reservation is that it doesn't have a great deal of volume though it boasts 100-Watt total output. There doesn't appear to be an allowance for an additional speaker either, so I would not recommend the A600 for large rooms or audiences but fine for meetings of up to about 70 people or so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty happy with it.","review":"I'm a Cubmaster for my son's Cub Scout pack. We have pack meetings in our school cafeteria, which means I have to be heard over the noise of several refridgerators and vending machines, not to mention the noise of 30+ cub scouts! I have a pretty soft voice, so by the end of our meetings, sometimes I was hoarse from yelling! The PA system was just what we needed. I've only used it once, but several parents commented how much easier it was to hear me, and I could talk in a normal voice. I like the fact that it has both corded and cordless microphones, because I can keep one, and the boys can use the other one to make presentations so they can be heard as well. My only minor complaint is with the cordless mike, you have to talk directly in the the end of the microphone for it to pick up - you can't just hold it close to your mouth.

RCA jacks for input from a tape player on the back, can handle both mikes at once. Both included mikes work well, case is strong.

They come on Stroboframe brackets, such as the real nice Stroboframe 350 brackets. I immediately get rid of them and replace them with something else. I like to just screw in whatever I am attaching on my bracket directly with a 1/4-20 screw. I use a Promaster TTL cord with it's own base and with it's own shoe on top of that base. I screw it directly into the bracket with a screw from the hardware store. I ruined a Promaster base, cracking the shoe off with one of these Stroboframe devices the first day I used it on a wedding job getting just getting out of the car. Manfrotto makes a replacement cold flash shoe that you can screw into whatever you are going to use this Stroboframe shoe for. The Manfrotto version does not have the side screw that overtightens to the device you are inserting into the shoe. Your device just slides in.

I was always eager to start the next book and at the same time sad to see the current one end. Her writing is so moving. The Shoe Box broke my bubble. It was such a let down after the others. It was so much of a disappointment I have yet to order another of her books. The story moved to fast with very little explaination of the characters. It seem to let you hang at the end. It never really explained why he chose the shoe box to hold his secrets. What led him to this. It is almost as if she rushed in her writing to meet a dead line. So much of the story seemed to be missing. The ending was good but the middle was missing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must!","review":"If you don't have this recording you are really missing something. The combonation of these three instruments the clarinet, cello, and piano is really something. It is unthinkable that these wonderful pieces of music should be played any way else. Brahms wrote an alternate viola part to replace the clarinet and Beethoven wrote and alternate violin part to replace the clarinet. It is facinating to see the evolution of this kind of trio. Beethoven's trio is one of his early works written as an experiment with these instruments. The Brahms on the other hand is a mature masterpiece that every one should be familiar with. Pick this one up you won't regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A major disappointment","review":"The three works on this recording clearly put an emphasis on the clarinet playing, and Stoltzman's performance just doesn't cut it. He is OK for new age or crossover music, but he completely lacks depth and sound quality required to play serious works. If you have never heard these pieces played by anyone else, then you can still enjoy this CD, because all three performes play mostly in tune, and the recording quality is good.If you are more than just a beginner, I recommend listening to Anthony Gigliotti's or David Oppenheim's recordings."},{"rating":"2","title":"good playing, tone too bright","review":"These are excellent pieces, all three of them, and these performers certainly do them justice. This recording should definitely be in your collection.I have one problem with it, however: Stoltzman's tone. His tone is just too shrill and reedy for my liking; I prefer a darker, less strident tone. I swear, his tone borders on buzzy sometimes. A good example of this is found in the first movement of the Brahms trio, between 0:55 and 1:13. He sounds like a kazoo. Most of the time, it's bearable, but I don't know what was going on here, because his other recordings don't suffer this problem. Maybe it's the A clarinet.I give the cd four stars, as opposed to three, because these players truly are virtuous in their playing, and they seem to understand the pieces very well. My favorite is the Brahms, with the Beethoven as a close second.Buy this CD if you're a classical music fan, but beware Stoltzman's tone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stoltzman? more like Sucksman","review":"I bought this CD on a whim, figuring \\"with these musicians, it can't be bad!\\" Well, it can.The biggest and most readily apparent problem is Stoltzman's clarinet playing. He gets so carried away in the more dramatic passages of this music that he throws restraint to the wind; he plays so aggressively in some sections, and with such shrill tone, that I occasionally cringe to listen to it.As for Ax and Ma, while their playing is perfectly good, they seem to have become infected by Stoltzman's rambunctiousness and at times the whole thing sounds like a three-way ego contest. Surely there must be better recordings of these pieces available.(Apparently, this recording won the 1996 Grammy for best chamber performance. Just goes to show that the Grammys have a lot more to do with whose name is on the cover than what's actually on the record.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time and Poorly Written","review":"I've read about a dozen books on Mars and potential for exploration, including some fiction and all of Zubrin's works.

Was it horrible? Back then, probably not. It might have even been a bit groundbreaking in a few of the parts. The lesbian fling was different for back then.

I was impressed with the scope of her research, her analysis of her subjects' psyches, and her ability to place her subjects in the popular and high culture of their times. Mistress of Modernism is this kind of work. Jackson Pollack's critics, Emma Goldman's friendship, Laurence Vail's superficially affable responses to life, Djuna Barnes' literary contacts, Peggy in Paris, and Peggy in Venice are all treated in this way. In choosing Peggy Guggenheim as a subject, Dearborn knew that a story with many dramatic moments was possible.

I wanted a nice read - not a sermon on how democrats, i.e. liberals in this author's mind, have ruined America. If I wanted a political discussion I could have tuned in the nightly news.

The package arrived with the instructions but no hardware kit. We called and requested a hardware kit be shipped to us over 8 days ago. We finally received a fedex tracking number yesterday-- only to find the hardware kit has not even shipped yet. Status? Still in the warehouse. When we called again this morning-- they apologized and assured us it would be shipping first thing Tuesday. Two weeks for a hardware kit? Apparently a trip to the hardware store is in order.

I called them and they told me that the replacement will SHIP (not arrive) within 72 hours. So I'm guessing I'll be waiting at least another week or two (the bed took about 2 weeks from order to arrival) for the replacement. Hopefully, it will be in one piece.I've seen a lot of reviews for this bed that mention broken pieces.

I knew that its low price would mean low quality, but this was truly off the meter in terms of crapitude. Particle board that literally disintegrated during assembly, mis-cut pieces that gave the platform a lopsidedness, and impossible to move,even inches. without something coming apart. Avoid at all costs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy Customer","review":"Pros:-Unbeatable price... nothing I found online even came close to the $120 price tag on this frame.-Attractive look.-Easy to assemble (maybe not for everyone? I found it to be a piece of cake, taking approx. an hour, but I definitely recommend getting help from one other person).Cons:-Heavy. I live in a 6 floor walk-up, and this was a serious pain to move around.-Quality of wood could be better, but hey - you get what you pay for. I did not have any problems so far with the wood, but I can't imagine moving more than once with this bed and keeping it intact.Summary:Overall, this is not an expensive bed frame... obviously. The 9-5 ground shipping and assembly parts of this deal mean that this is also not the most convenient of purchases. However, if you want a cheap yet attractive bed frame and are not afraid to put in the necessary effort, you'll probably be happy with this purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"For $200.00 Very Disapointing!","review":"First Off!

Today I finally asked to just get my money back since I am obviously never going to see the one part I am missing and they want to know if they can change my mind.I guess after 5 months now they have decided it is time to be concerned about my order. I will never order from this buyer again. I hope if you buy from them you cross your fingers for an undamaged product or you too will be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never buy this!","review":"To begin with, this is super heavy... I had previously ordered sectional sofa from Amazon & didnt turn out to be so inconvenient. So thot it is a good idea to order the platform bed as well from them. Apart from being inordinately heavy, it also chips at various places while maneuvering and pokes the fingers and scratches the skin.To add to the misery, the holes in the bed don't align, the pieces dont align & it was such a pain setting it up..Had to just nail it / screw it somehow so that it is somewhat useable... I had an easier time setting up my sectional sofa, dining table or even the TV stand.. but stay away from this one if you want stay away from trouble.I ordered for a full size & twin, I didnt even dare to open the other box after unpacking one!Painful decision :(("},{"rating":"2","title":"Dante's Path","review":"Using Dant's description of hell as the backdrop for exploring our fears, limitations, and weaknesses is outstanding. and a path is given to the reader to follow to confront and resolve our worst enemy, ourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dante's Path exceeded my expectations","review":"Dante's Path provided me with an excellent understanding of the Spiritual Journey that I been experiencing.

About 75-80%. Also the seat is small for one that is built for up to 300 lbs. Lets face it, if your near the 250lbs and up, your bottom is much larger than the seat resulting in, hanging over the edges. It was very uncomfortable for any extended period of time. The seat is hard and not padded well. Also, the \\"recliner\\" type chairs it says it will work on, is not totally true. The levers that opperate the seat are on either side, but if you sit on the lift in a recliner chair the \\"sinking factor\\" hinders the use of the leavers, and makes it difficult to reach them. We found it very frustrating and were extremely disapointed! This was not worth the $ in our oppinion.

Although some adults may wonder what it is about these DVD's that holds kids' attention - it is not as flashy and not top of the line filming as most modern movies our kids are used to watching - but there is something about it that taps into the basic instinct of little boys (and girls!), as if they are sitting on the edge of railroad tracks just watching trains go by:) We have purchased Vol 3 for Christmas and I'm sure they will love it just like the others.

So as you can imagine we have quite a few train videos and I have to say this series is probably my favorite (even after being subjected to watching it at least 268 times). There's a good amount of variation in the trains; steam, diesel, etc. There's trains from other countries which I have to say is always interesting to watch. They even got a little crazy showing cars that have been made into trains and the video reverses a few seconds in high speed so it's sort of comical.

I have very limited walking and bending over ability so I use grabbers for most anything (newspapers, pens, paperclips, empty soda bottles, dead bugs, etc). My only complaint is it will NOT pick up one sheet of paper due to the jaw pads being too slick. I am attempting to fix this by putting some duct tape on the jaws. The locking feature (lock the jaws shut) works much better than other models! I additionally like the ability to rotate the head 90 degrees."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fantastic Product","review":"I have used this item now for several weeks and found that it is a lifesaver.

It's sturdy and well built which is great. However, it does not allow for much grip pressure. Even picking up the kids clothes did not work well.

However I will say it is a bit short for my size and the fingers on the end don't pick up and hold onto the heavier objects like some I have had and by that I mean anything over a lb or so. These things tend to slip out of between the fingers as the grip just isn't there otherwise I have been satisfied with this product to this point and would purchase again for the money as last one I had cost over $35 and it broke in a couple of months. Don't waste your money on the gophers for sure as they are junk even though they are only $10 they ain't worth $2 as I have had 3 of them.

It is more trouble to return than it is worth it so I will find one in a store that I can actually test. Hopefully, my particular reacher was defective and others will not have the same problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Garbage!","review":"I had back surgery a few years ago, and I have used just about every \\"grabber\\" made and the PikStick is by far the worst I've used. It states that it can pickup items up to 5 lbs, fact of the matter is that the PikStick has a very hard time picking up anything over 1 lb. The grasping tips are rubber and grab things well (like paper and very light/small items), the problem is that it can't lift (no torque on the jaws) items like a shirt, canned goods, a soda, dropped utensils..... I spent 5 minutes trying to pick up a fork the other morning! The arms are too weak and are easily bent out of alignment. If you are in need of a reacher/ grabber, get one with the suction cups on the ends, or the ones physical therapy sell you with the one moving jaw/magnet on the end. Don't waste your time and money on a product that will disappoint."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good for Disabled","review":"I'm disabled and spend my days in a wheelchair, so you can bet I have a few reachers/grabbers to help me in my daily life. Because this one had good reviews and it was short I thought it would be a nice addition. But when it arrived and was unpacked by my husband, he handed it to me to try out. I couldn't even squeeze the handle(s) -- still can't after several months. Even my husband who has some arthritis has difficulty using this.So if you're fairly strong I suppose this would work for you. But if, like me, you have a disability which involves weakness this product is basically worthless.The very best reacher I have is by Etac."},{"rating":"2","title":"First trip to Hawaii","review":"We have just returned to the mainland from our first ever trip to Hawaii.

It is the only 'official' book out there on Cliff Burtons work on MOP (as far as I know), yet it is so painfully inaccurate that I would not even suggest it to beginning bassists.Not one song, from the rhythms on the verses of 'Battery' (the bass actually plays an 8th note pattern against the 16th note guitar riff) to the omissions of the bass solo in 'Orion' and the bass intro to 'Damage, Inc.', this book has absolutely nothing to offer to bassists of any level. How one can mistake a distorted bass guitar for a Hammond B3 organ is beyond me.As a professional transcriber myself, I simply fail to see how this was ever given the green light.On a side note, its 'Ride The Lightning' and 'Kill 'Em All' counterparts are just as painfully inaccurate."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a live concert track","review":"Althoug it is not clear from the mp3 sample or the title of the album, this single is a \\"live\\" track from a concert.

Considering how far-fetched that is, I think Robin did a great job making everything around it realistic.On a side note, as a teen I found this book engaging enough that it made me want to be an editor, which led to majoring in English.

The characters -- particularly the male protagonist (\\"Rand Prescott\\" -- the name itself gives you some idea of how shallow and trite the writing is) are unsympathetic and, in \\"Rand's\\" case, thoroughly unlikeable. The plot is unbelievable to the point of being laughable at times, and the writing so formulaic that it seems to have been written in a few weeks, at best. Worst of all, the book is almost demeaning to women, as \\"Rand's\\" outrageously chauvanistic and downright cruel behavior towards \\"Karen\\" is meekly accepted and rationalized.

They serve their purpose and work perfectly with the Nikon SB-600 and SB-900 Speedlight flashes.

You have to mount it slightly off center.The difference is about an inch or an inch and a half. To me, that is insignificant. What is more important to me as a photographer is the fact that I will get extended flash. It's not perfect, no. (What in life is perfect, anyway?)I give this a 9.5 out of 10.

Particularly the issue of the shutter release being at the bottom of the camera when composing a portrait oriented shot. I found a stroboframe flash bracket that rotates the camera counter clockwise within the flash bracket instead of flipping the flash. This leaves the shutter release at the top of the camera and also alleviated the other problem of speed light hot shoe breakage from repeated \\"flipping\\" of the flash that some other users have reported. The item is manufactured by Stroboframe and can be found at an ebay store called \\"Gadget Infinity\\" under the listing title of \\"Flash Bracket with 90 degrees Camera Rotate feature\\".

It is well made. I use it on a Canon 40D with the 580 EXII. It's quite sturdy, supports the flash without any flexing, and makes a good handle for the camera. We walked around downtown Denver all one day during the DNC and I found the bracket as good a carrying handle as flash bracket. There are a number of threaded holes on the bottom of the bracket that allow different mounting positions, and a tripod shoe can be fitted to the bracket by one of these extra holes. The flash cable seems to be well made and has worked well. The only fault I can find is more of a quibble than a fault; I would prefer a beefier hand grip/cushion.

This movie is one of those rare movies that you can actually relate to-where the dialgoue and situations remind you of real people. It's romantic without being sappy, and doesn't even have those unnecessary sex scenes that so many directors feel HAVE to be included in any love story. Despite what other reviews have indicated, I don't get tired of watching characters discover themselves and change their situations in pursuit of happiness.

He then finds that he fits in neither world, that of his birth mother's native people, or the white one he leaves behind in Anchorage. Soon, he is embroiled in more intrigue than he can handle, as he tries to solve suicides that only he feels are murders. You will think you have the book figured out several times, only to find out you are wrong. Mr. Jones is very good at evoking mood, and making us understand his native Alaska.

(The first, by his nephew, appeared in the year of his death.) Reed was able to talk to many people who knew Carroll, including several close relatives, and even to the sexton who buried him, so this book is a significant source of information. Reed includes several interesting letters from Carroll (some, amazingly, not reprinted in Carroll's collected letters) and photos. On the down side, Reed's speculations are often more nonsensical than anything Carroll wrote. This book probably started the myth that Carroll had a split personality - the lecturer in mathematics from Oxford being somehow detached from the writer of children's stories. It would be unfortunate if this down side stopped people admiring the rich store of information in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible","review":"Not a biography at all, but a strange imaginative exercise.

The style changes with each song, but it is never too overwrought. He sings the whole disc very well. There are enough changes to occupy all listeners. He sings it well and it sounds good like it should. It has a little jazz, a little rock'n'roll, and a little classical, and it never seems bothersome and overdone.

I was both pleasantly surprised and a little disapointed. Her vocals could not be better. Bonnie has aged very well. Her vocals are warmer and richer than with Delany with much more dynamics and emotional content. The song selection is also decent ranging from big band blues, jazz/pop standards and a great remake of her signature song \\"superstar\\". But... the production/arrangement is straight out of 1987, way too slick and overproduced with a David Sanborn style sax everywhere. I recently purchased Solomone Burke's new disc produced by Joe Henry and wish Bonnie could have a similar stripped down, earthy soul production. Hopefully her next one will sound a little more updated. Overall though, she's not the same, she's better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as dated as I feared","review":"I recently bought this to reread after 20 years, maybe because I've just resumed playing bridge regularly!

But it was a disappointment to find that \\"The Small One\\" was edited and of course it is never marked anywhere on the DVD box that it was. For those looking for an original version of this great classic you will need to look elsewhere. Not only did the editors change the words of the song \\"Clink clink clank clank\\" (I assume to be more \\"politically correct\\")but they completely removed the entire \\"Small One For Sale\\" song and segment.

The only new one was Small One, which I had in VHS form for many years, and always thought it was a Disney short classic, so I decided to purchase this set. Unforutnately, the colors on the DVD version are no where near as vivid as my old video copy. There is tons of artifacting through all 3 shorts, but at least the other 2 are very colorful and vibrant.It is still a recommended collection, as the two Christmas shorts featured in the Mickey tin had to be accessed through several chapter menus to get them to play. For a child, it would be hard to pick them out of the tin set if they wanted to watch them, so now it is much easier for them to see all 3 of these Xmas classics in one easy step. It's too bad the colors are muted on Small One."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Traditional Movie","review":"I was thrilled to find this on DVD. I made the mistake of getting rid of our old VHS tapes at a yard sale since my girls are now 10 and 11 years old.

Bill Saxbe has a sharp opinion about everyone, including himself, Richard Nixon, Patty Hearst, Robert Byrd, and everything from AT&T, the Indian government and the wonderful town of Mechanicsburg, Ohio.

If watching a lot of drop-dead gorgeous young college co-eds run around pursuant to a silly plot about witchcraft, sacrifices, etc. appeals to you (it did me) then this film too is for you.

Maybe it's really not all that bad, but it's simply not my thing. I'm not sure, but this might have been a made for TV movie. That's kind of what it looked like.

I really enjoy this album for its classic and wonderful music. In my opinion, the best track is number four: \\"Let it Snow! Let in Snow! Let it Snow!\\" It's early big band sounds make a fantastic edge. The title track \\"Christmas through Your Eyes\\" is an original. It was a major hit and was placed on her first Greatest Hits collection. Another song was recorded but not included. Don't Cry! It's available! The song's name is \\"Love on Layaway\\" and you can get it on \\"Now! That's What I Call Christmas!\\" or \\"All-Star Christmas.\\" The fantastic ballads \\"The Christmas Song (Chesnuts Roasting on An Open Fire),\\" \\"White Christmas,\\" and \\"Silent Night\\" are just HAVE TO HAVE songs!

If they did it would be to rightfully criticise it for being nothing more than the spiteful, rebellious ranting of a bitter apostate who has doomed herself for what? for the love of carrots between the legs? For the right to not only live haram but to proclaim it and write of it in all of its sick tawdry details?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pornography","review":"I purchased this little gem after reading a favorable review in the International Herald Tribune.

This book is clearly a work that is first and foremost pornographic. The plot plays out like that of an X-rated movie.Furthermore, it is clear that Badra, the main character, did not need to have an \\"awakening.\\" Her pre-pubescent and adolescent experiences and thoughts reveal that she was never naive or reticent about the erotic side of life.Finally, the effectiveness of the translation from French is a bit suspect. There are stretches of \\"sentences\\" that are nothing but a jumble of disjoint words. It does not appear to be a conscious use of literary license.This is the story of all things titilating and sexual that \\"happened\\" in Badra's life. It is not a memoir of human breadth, depth, or substance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whipping flesh to make it Real","review":"The Almond has been heavily hyped by reviewers as an erotic and inspirational story of an Islamic woman. It falls far short of the its hype and promise. Badra's story perhaps is interesting as it ilustrates the tribal customs and feudal culture that allows the bartered exchange of women. But there is nothing Islamic about Badra as a woman or her sexual pursuits. In her zealous pursuit of all things haaram, she views herself asa self actualized and empowered woman. Sadly, nothing could be further from the truth. At the ripe old age of 50 (GASP), she has no family, no friends and no meaning. Her aggranidizementof her sexual escapades left me feeling cold and clinical. She counts the notches in her bed post--- and a successful encounter is, for her, one in which she dominates and rejects her suitor. This isn't success; this is pathology. The book fails also as a vehicle of literary erotic expression, because her writing skills are pedestrian."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've read this story before","review":"For once I would really love to read a book that purports to be about a woman's sexual awakening without having said awakening occur at the hands of one man with whom she falls in love but who treats her poorly and/or can't seem to express his love until she's left unable to really love anyone else. Not that that's the exact plot here, but how many \\"women's erotica\\" books can be summed up that way?

I would give this half a star if I could.The author puts in some obligatory riff raff, before moving on to sex that is so, SO boring. How she brilliantly manages to do this (and mind you, that is the ONLY brilliant feature of this book) is beyond me. The ending: the most awesomely ridiculous thing you will come across in a hot minute.This book is poorly written, and FLAT. There are instances in it (many), where you will say to yourself that the author had a great opportunity to spin something rich, powerful, delicious, but she just disappoints.Read it if you think you want to read something \\"novel,\\" due to the author's religious or cultural background.Read it if you saw the cover and (mis)judged it to be cool.Don't read it if you are looking for something lyrical, beautiful, or even erotic."},{"rating":"2","title":"For the open-minded...","review":"I picked up this book because I wanted to be open-minded and read something different. I don't usually read erotica, but I bought into all the hype around this book. The novel revolves around Badra, a young Muslim woman who comes to Tangiers to escape a failed marriage and moves in with her progressive aunt. She falls in love with playboy doctor Driss who opens her to a world of all types of sexualities. After reading it my mind didn't change about sexually graphic writing, as I seem to be more conservative than I thought I was. However, I found the semi-autobiographical book to be an eye opener into the lives of Muslims, which is contrary to Western media images. Islam has long history for erotica, such as Arabian Nights, which has suppressed today by many radical Islamic clerics. Nonetheless I recommend the book for the adventurous and less conservative."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty much useless.","review":"I was required to purchase this for a college class.

The part about Ataturk is direct replica of Armstrong's \\"Grey Wolf.\\" At other parts, the writer tried to show that he is quoting from other people as if every person who wrote a book is worthy of quoting. All the quotations are from the missionaries living in Turkey. Given that Turkey was considered to be \\"the others\\" in the Christian world, you can not expects the missionaries to be fair in their explanations...But if you read the book with this in mind, actually the personal explanations of the sultans are fun to read.

In one section it is mentioned in one sentence that the other rulers of the world at the same time acted pretty much the same. But the rest of the book talks about the Turks doing this and that. In the part about the war with Greece, what Greeks have done to the Turks is mentioned in one sentence, then there is page after page of horrible details of what Turkish supposedly have done to Greeks. This book overall is highly biased as a historical work. It is written more as a novel with the agenda of blackening the name of the Turks and their greatest lider Kemal Ataturk."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's basic. buy it.","review":"I have been down with Zion I from Mind Over Matter, and basically they have evolved into one of the most diverse and intelligent hip hop groups to come out in the past couple of years.

This album does not feature any production by the Grouch, and it is far inferior to his unique production style. The one song I heard from this duo from grouch's my baddest btchs cd, was very dope, far better than anything on this album. There is far too much singing and pop appeal to this album for my taste. Although this album is far better than any mainstream hip hop, buy any other grouch album, the first CMA album, or either G&E album before this release. It has one really good track, the 2nd track. The rest is truely forgettable. I'm not familiar with Zion I's material, but this is really unimpressive stuff from him. Grouch is the only reason i give this album even 2 stars.

Everything somes off easy when you need to clean it. This is new for my third child. Our other saucer was given away. This one is so much better. It doesn't have too much on it, just enough. Our babies have all loved using an exer-saucer. As soon as they can hold themselves up sitting (around 4 or 5 months) we put them in an exersaucer.

All in all though it is a nice product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great ExeSaucer for the Price","review":"I took my six month old son to Babies R Us to \\"try out\\" all the exesauers and he liked this one the best, and it was one of the least expensive. The bright colors and different toys keep him entertained and some of the toys I thought were boring (like the 2 page book) are his favorite. I agree with the other reviewer - the snack tray seems like kind of a waste of space, but I just use it to put other toys on which he promptly throws on the floor - a fun game. The height adjustment accomodates babies that are on the smaller size and will grow with your child until he is probably to old to want to play in it anymore. A great choice and you can't beat the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Waste of Money -- Music lasts about a month","review":"The only reason I bought this one for $60+ versus a comparable exersaucer for around $25 was because of the music - the \\"12 songs plus flashing lights\\". Well, there's just one little toy that has the lights and music. The batteries ran out in about 1 month, and the problem is, you can't replace the batteries (not easily). I'm mechanically inclined, so I opened up the toy, found it takes 3 little LR44 \\"button\\" batteries, but they're on a circuit board with tiny, brittle, poorly soldered wires. I removed the batteries carefully, and replaced them with 3 new batteries (which cost $12 by the way). The toy still wouldn't work (and yes, I put them in correctly). Now this exersaucer cost me $72+, and has no music or lights at all. The rest of the toys on it are just junk that our daughter could care less about. Don't waste your money - just buy a cheaper model."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"We bought this toy when our daughter was 4 months old. She grew with it...loved the music, which is why we bought this particular model. However, we soon found that once the battery ran out on the music toy, it couldn't be replaced. That part of the exersaucer became useless. We've since had another baby. He never got to use the music part of the toy. We took it down after one month of use because of boredom. The plastic toys are cheap and boring. Since the only part that was good about this toy was the music, it's a waste of time and money because you can't replace the battery."},{"rating":"1","title":"didn't work for us!","review":"I honestly never had much luck with this exersaucer. The baby would stay in it for a few minutes and then would cry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware","review":"Initially I was okay with this toy. However, the plastic is hard on a lot of the pieces and I thought my baby might injure himself, he didn't. The part that I am most unhappy about is the book like tabs with stickers. The stickers have worn away with teething, most likely swallowing it. I will not use this product again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouch!! Pinched fingers!","review":"This product is not that great as far as exersaucers go- we replaced a few of the toys for more exciting ones. At least evenflo makes replacements. The main complaint I have is that the flip book that comes with this seems to always get little fingers caught in it. My 6 month old daughter loves to turn the pages (and chew on them) but she would always get the side of her fingers caught. This lead to numerous tears and we finally took that toy off. The other thing is that she sometimes just sits in the exersaucer, not playing. I don't think it stimulates her enough. If I had to do it again, I would buy a better model. This one just isn't that great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very entertaining","review":"My 5 month son is very active and when we put him in this exersaucer...he gets bored in a matter of minutes.

Check others out first!"},{"rating":"1","title":"a dissapointment","review":"I bought this exersaucer mainly because I wanted my boy to jump in it. but we realized that it's quite hard for him.

Very dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Safe and entertaining","review":"My 5 month old son has used this since he was 4 months old and he loves it, it engages him and keeps him safe for around 25 minutes, enough time for me to wash dishes, prepare dinner, take a shower, and best of all it is so light and easy to move. I move it to whatever room I am in and he is safe and happy. He laughs and touches everything and gets very excited when he makes things move and make noise. This is a great toy, it is a wonderful sensory experience for baby, and helps teach cause and effect. After using this once he was turning himself and reaching and grabbing everything.

My niece and nephew have the castle/fairy tale themed Ultrasaucer and it is loaded with cute and interactive toys. My baby even loves the clear spring covers as they are so colorful! Unfortunately, the Mega Circus model not only too few toys, but the toys are also so much more basic! (I don't expect that my child will use this for too long.) For the cost, I would have expected some more interesting and interactive, not just a few \\"colorful plastic animals on pegs\\". There are much better activity centres out there, not much thought looks to have gone into this one and it isn't worth the money.

There is much to be said for experiencing being a Chinese woman first hand. I am Chinese by ancestry and quite unsettled by this. Her scholarship falls under the general category of cultural anthropology. Cultural anthropology itself is a questionable field because it comes from a tradition of examining 'the other', like how you might examine animal or insect behavior. Those methods of anthropology don't sit well with me. I would rather that someone take a gander at 'European Anthropology' and try to understand what those colonizers where thinking when they ravaged much of the non-European world.

But it will completely chop a large onion in 6-7 swipes! It will shred/chop/julianne stick veggies quickly...you have to do it by hand and not use the large veggie impaling holder. Just be careful with the fingers as you get towards the end of the veggie. But not a problem if you pay attention. One thing that irritated me in the beginning was the plastic swing arm.

She said it was likely an internal problem and suggested that I take it to their nearest service rep, which is a half hour away, to be looked at.

And it does it 'thing' amazingly well. We even had one older stain that came out after two tries with the SpotBot. If the area seems a little too wet when you're done, use the hose to suck up most of the rest (but it's not necessary). It works as advertised and is well worth the price. The cleaning stuff they supply with the unit do a good job too so we'll continue to use the same brands.

It tries to do a good job but just doesn't. I had a couple of pet urine stains on the carpet that was revealed by a hand-held black light (so it had been there a while) the unit worked on it 2X with Oxy2 Gen and all the cleaning solutions to specifications with probably only a 20% max reduction in visible stain (as viewed under black light). Granted these are pet urine stain testings only (which aren't surface visible in normal daylight) but this really tells the story of what this unit can saturate and lift out of a carpet. In my opinion it isn't much. I also felt I had to put some weight on the top of the unit for it to get a good vacume seal and make sure the bristles of the brush actually impacted the carpet. Frankly IMO it's a toy. If your serious about real cleaning you'll never be happy with this.

One of my dogs pukes a lot and it's bile colored and hard to get up but the BotSpot does a great job. Sometimes I have to run the machine twice over a spot to get it all up but that's okay...at least I'm not on my hands and knees scrubbing it out of the carpet.You may wonder why I only gave the SpotBot 4 stars if I like it so much, and I really do like it--- well, I'll tell you -- the BotSpot leaves the carpet really, really wet and it sometimes takes more than an entire day to dry.

Also, we have a higher pile carpet and I feel like the brushes were too rough on the 'twist' of the fibers, altering the carpet's appearance in the areas where it was used. So for us it's back to the SpotShot cleaner and the (mfr. recommended) clear dish soap/water solution. If we had low-pile carpet and wanted to clean up, say a pee spot this would be a useful tool. Also, the hand-held tool really sucks; doesn't do anything except drip the cleaning solution and make a mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the hassle","review":"We have off-white carpet and a small child. The time it takes to haul the Spot Bot out of the closet and fill it with expensive cleaner, is longer than just spraying and scrubbing out the stain with the red bottle cleaner. This machine sucks down the cleaner and dumps it into your carpet, leaving it totally soaked. After the machine \\"cleans\\" the stain, you have to manually suck up the cleaner and water left in your carpet. Otherwise you will be left with a dark circle because the cleaner will attract dirt, as other reviews have also noted. We had to use the machine several times on various non set in stains; rarely did it clean a stain on 1 cycle. This is definitely not worth the cost for the machine, not to mention the amount of expensive cleaner it uses. I would buy a steam cleaner instead and clean your carpets regularly with that. In the meantime, the tried and true \\"red bottle\\" is the easiest, quickest and cheapest way to clean our carpets."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate it","review":"This is the worst spot cleaner I have ever owned. Yes it cleans well but leaves nice round circles on your carpet. It also leaks when you use the hose cleaner.If you use it often you will see what we call crop circles all over your carpet and then need to use the big steam cleaner to clean the whole carpet.If I could return mine I would in a heart beat."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING!","review":"One of my better investments! It doesn't replace a full size carpet cleaner but I love it! I live in an apartment with 3 cats and their litter box is in a carpeted area and they were leaving dark yellow stains all around it. I was worried the stains would never come out because after endless hours of scrubbing with everything i could find they were still there and smelled horrible. After they sat idle for about 7 months i broke down and bought one of these. One use and they are now gone. :] The smell isn't 100% gone (not up close) but i'm sure with time and maybe another cleaning and carpet freshener they will soon be gone. If everyone in the world had one, there would be no war."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaked on first use","review":"I used my sisters Bissell SpotBot and fell in love. Went to Target to buy one and they only had the \\"Pet\\" Bissell SpotBot. Right out of the box on first use this thing leaked all over my carpet. I made sure all the connections were connected and seals were not cracked and could not figure out where the water was comming from. Its going back this morning."},{"rating":"1","title":"not impressed","review":"I had high hopes for this little machine. We recently moved from a house with a yard to an apartment and our dog has had trouble with the transition. She has been peeing on one area of the brand new carpet when we're not around. I tried this machine and the urine smell is still there. The carpet is brown so the spot is not noticeable, but the smell is still there after treating with several different pet urine odor remover solutions. After this machine failed me I hired professionals to deep clean and treat the area and the odor is still there, faint, but still there. I'm at the end of my rope. I wish I hadn't wasted the $129 on this machine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast and Easy","review":"I love my dog, but sometimes he doesn't wait until morning to go outside. Up until I got this little cleaner, I had to drag out my big Oreck carpet shampooer, fill it with water, attach the shampoo and the water container, clean the spot, towel up the excess water, dismantle the shampooer, empty the water reservoirs, dry off the brushes, and store the cleaner back in the garage. With this cleaner I added a little detergent to the water, set the brush on the spot, hit one button, watched TV for six minutes, then emptied the dirty water. It did all the work.Amazing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Died after a year. Flooded the floor.","review":"I really liked this in the beginning. Having cats, I had to deal with the occasional cat vomit or hairballs. This unit would sometimes leave a big \\"dot\\" where it cleaned. Although I could fix that with the hand tool. After a year, it just died and flooded all over a wood floor. Verdict: nice at first, not sturdy for long term."},{"rating":"2","title":"Carpet Saver","review":"I've had mine for now for about 3 years and I've never had any issues with it. I make sure I take extra care of my SpotBot. It never has leaked on me. The suction is amazing. I perform regular maintenance on it after each usage.This SpotBot does an awesome job of cleaning up dog diarrhea. About a year and half ago my lab had eaten something that had upset her stomach and caused her to have diarrhea on our brand new carpet in the hallway. I decided to give the SpotBot a try to see if it would clean the mess up but I honestly thought my lab had ruined my carpet. By the second round over the soiled areas on the carpet was clean and showed no hint of mishaps. As I'm typing right now I'm cleaning up another messy soiled spot because our elderly dog had a seizure and lost control of her bowl movements. My SpotBot is doing a great job getting it all out during the first round, however I will do it twice to make sure everything gets cleaned up."},{"rating":"1","title":"not pleased","review":"I only used this product 4 or 5 times and the unit stopped working. The motor runs but the suction has stopped. I felt it cleaned the carpet ok, although I needed to do repeat rinsing to get all the solution up out of the carpet fibers. For the money spent I was very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT","review":"Bought a refurbished unit and it works like a dream. I used it for 2 hours straight on old set in stains, including tea and blueberries. I always treat a stain immediately with half and half white vinegar and water so the stain loosens. The spotbot got all the stain out. I found that if you 'fluff' the crop circles before the carpet dries it helps smooth the fibers back to normal. I am very happy with this and would recommend it to anyone for the in between professional steam cleans!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Works great...for the first time or two","review":"I've had 3 different models of this product and none of them worked more than 3 times. First one came in DOA, no suction to the pump. Returned it for a different one, it worked twice then no more suction. Third one worked a couple of times again, then stopped. Customer service walked me through a few things each time to try to get it to work, but no joy. Finally left the last one on the front porch hoping someone would steal it, but apparently thieves are smarter than I am. Based on the reviews I'm glad there are so many folks happy with the SpotBot, but I wonder how many have used it more than a couple of times. These are not robust enough for me to ever try again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great I Love It!","review":"We have two dogs and I've had every kind of carpet cleaner there has been made...this is my favorite. It can do the work for me! When I see a stain, I get the SpotBot ready and it cleans the stain right up. I love it that it has been treated with antimicrobial, so it doesn't smell. All other cleaners, even if I kept them washed etc. always ended up having a smell."},{"rating":"2","title":"Out Spot!","review":"SpotBot is very easy to use, and does a great job lifting even old stains.

It has sat idle the rest of the time.Today, I called their English-as-a-second-language call center to see if they'd send me a refurbed replacement. Juan hung up on me. The second person would not send me a refurbed unit. I asked for the supervisor. After a 7-minute wait, he offered me no solution other than the one vacuum repair center which returned my Bissell vacuum cleaner to me with a different problem from when I brought it in.Bottom line: after being a loyal Bissell customer, having purchased several Bissell vacuums, three Bissell carpet cleaners, two Bissell steam mops and these three Bissell SpotBots, I will not be purchasing any more Bissell products."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Work on set in stains","review":"Set in dog pee will not come out with this machine, which I thought it was designed for?

This EP is definitely a good buy, whether you like hard rock, or if you like softer stuff. If you like Pillar's harder rocking stuff, the last song on this EP, \\"Bring Me Down,\\" (this one is not live or acoustic), is just what you are looking for. It is an amazing song to hold you over until Pillar's next full-length, \\"Where Do We Go From Here,\\" which comes out on June 15, 2004.

His first person chapters aren't very well-written, either.All-in-all, don't waste your money on this book. If you feel you must read it, not something I recommend, then borrow it from a library.

It can be very difficult to distinguished anything between .4 and .6 mg/L. The directions for Cupramine stress that a level of .5 is desired. .25mg/L is below the therapeutic threshold and above .6 can be very harmful to the fish. Given the narrow acceptable range, I would have liked to see a better resolution from their recommended test kit.Finally, the box states 75 tests.

The fact that they are \\"proud\\" of their system really makes me wonder...either they're entirely clueless as to basic respect for another human being, or it's some strange S&M; thing. Seriously, they strictly advocate NOT letting the lease contract \\"out of their sight\\".

They said what the heck, they had 30 days to figure out how to pay the bill and besides, they could just make the minimum payment if they weren't rich in those 30 days.

First, find tenants with stable jobs, no self-esteem, and with no clue whatsoever about economics. Then get them to rent from you under the most oppressive of leases.The book assumes a market where good housing at a bargain price is plentiful, yet demand for rentals far outstrips supply. At best this is a paradox. There is no way the vast majority of renters would accept such outlandish terms that the Milins propose unless vacancies were virtually nil.The financial information was quasi-useful and the only semi-bright spot in an otherwise very dim book.The Milins come off as complete 'holes to deal with as buyers, sellers, and landlords. I'm surprised they find enough who will do business with them to keep FIVE houses occupied, much less the hundreds they brag about having.This book belongs in the fiction section.

Fifty dollars a month to repair a house that they don't even own! They equate renters to pets who must be \\"housebroken\\", and fondly tell of the landlord who's tenant paid for and built a fence on site, only to have his rent raised because the fence increased the property value and so the property tax!

What a shame, as it's one of Dory's very best. Collectors' Choice seem to have ignored every person who has written to them about this. Their other Dory reissue (the self-titled album) is better, but still to my ear a hemi-demi-semi tone lower than it should be.

The songs here have seemingly been remastered at the wrong speed, as Dory now sounds like the child of Bea Arthur and that \\"Cola Nut\\" guy. Her writing, as sharp as ever, is served well by the arrangements and overall production (which is a bit more commercial sounding than on her previous releases) but this new version does not do justice to the original.

Being a fan of Trevor Pinnock's for over two decades, I could not imagine anyone else leading the English Concert. I need not have given the matter a second thought-Manze, Mozart and the English Concert are wonderful together. Manze's solo playing is brisk & lively when need be, as well as beautifully serene when the music demands a more thoughtful tone. He also does a splendid job leading what I consider to be the finest period performance ensemble currently recording-the reknowned English Concert.Manze & his players are also well served by the exceptional Harmonia Mundi sound.

It's well crafted, well written, funny and interesting. That said, it's also a straightforward portrayal of growing up in a working class town in England (apparently, it's based on Mitchell's own experiences). In other words, it's nothing like Cloud Atlas or any of Mitchell's more complex and ambitious novels. Mitchell's virtuosity is in evidence, in his wonderful writing style, character development (the dad is particularly richly drawn and quite hilarious) and plot construction. Also, there are some characters that overlap with Cloud Atlas so that's fun. A good read -- but be prepared for a \\"memoir\\" type read (although crafted more tightly -- like a novel), not a Cloud Atlas."},{"rating":"2","title":"So what is this about?","review":"When I was reading the first few chapter of the book, I wasn't quite sure what it was about. Rather than using traditional plot devices, this novel tells the story of a year in a young teenagers life with a series of scenes. They do not tie together in a totally linear fashion, but instead are a more true to life telling. This is a brave form of literature I had never encountered before. This is among other things, a meditation on violence and cruelty as it exists in mundane life, from bullying, domestic hostility, sibling cruelty, the violent prejudice against 'outsiders', and the general propaganda response to the Falklands conflict. Above all of this, to me it is a portrait of a beautiful young soul, a poet who stammers, a window on a single year in a life which feels so totally real, it is easy to forget that this is a work of fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gift","review":"I purchased this for my niece as a Christmas gift from her Amazon wish list.

Wasn't expecting a lot and coming of age stories are sometimes hard to get right, but thoughtfully written and poignant look into the mind of an adolescent boy in a way I haven't seen before. Nice weaving of history English history in as well - I learned something about their war as I was reading. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A fantastic read","review":"BLACK SWAN GREEN is the most resonant, lifelike, and quietly, normal-ly poignant story of adolescence I can recall reading. Which is saying a lot, I think, since the story is told by a 13-year-old stuttery British boy in Worcestershire in 1982, and I'm a 27-year-old American woman in Brooklyn in 2010 who is maybe very shy and perhaps slightly right-left dyslexic but not enough to matter. The writing in Black Swan Green is poetic and beautiful without ever being saccharine, bloated, or distracting and the world through Jason Taylor's eyes is as muddy and chaotic as real life, but clearer through his thoughtfulness. At times the period references are too on-the-nose but never enough to distract you from the story. And this is, for me, the rare book about a fictional writer where I'd actually like to see the fake-author (Jason Taylor)'s poems, which Mitchell is far too smart and respectful of Taylor and the reader to ever put in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read it!","review":"I really loved this book. I wish I had read it when I was in junior high. It's a great depiction of the dread associated with being unpopular and picked on during the middle school years, as well as the few bright spots. I also liked that the chapters each read like short stories. My only complaints are that the main character is a bit too poetic/philosophical for me to stomach at times, and the abundant 80's pop culture references seemed gratuitous"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"There were several things I didn't like about the book:a) It didn't ring true--it felt like an adult trying to write like a 13 year oldb) All the references to the 1980s (music politics etc..) were forced.

Dion does throw an uptempo wrench in the mix here and there, however, strong points being second track 'Misled' and the Diane Warren-penned 'Real Emotion'. Unfortunately, Celine being Celine, there's plenty of hollow, pedestrian filler here(though not as much as last go-round), namely 'Love Doesn't Ask Why','Think Twice', and the title track. And though the aforementioned Warren provides four tunes here, none are nearly as bad as some of the crass garbage she's cranked out recently(namely anything that poor Toni Braxton's latched on to), with both 'Next Plane Out' and 'Loving Proof' ranking as some of the better tracks here. Overall, a very nice set-up for her fourth and best album, FALLING INTO YOU."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better than death.","review":"Although Celine's Album, \\"The Colour of My Love\\" starts out attractively with the song, \\"THe Power of Love,\\" it quickly degenerates from there.

That's not all for this 5-star album. Misled is my favorite off the album...a true dance song. The ballads return with Think Twice and Only One Road. Then, she goes back to funky up-tempo material with Everybody's Talking My Baby Down. Then, we have the beautiful Diane Warren penned ballad, Next Plane Out. Real Emotion bites. We go to her hit duet with Clive Griffin, When I Fall In Love, which is so beautiful. The beautiful ballads don't stop with Love Doesn't Ask Why. Then, Celine takes on a wierd dance sound with the haunting Refuse To Dance. Then, we have the beautiful ballad I Remember LA. After that, 2 Diane Warren up-tempos, No Living Without Loving You and Lovin' Proof. Finally, the album closes with the symbolic and magnificent title track. She can't go wrong with this album. If I could give it 6, I would."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunate....","review":"It's unfortunate when someone with an average voice becomes this famous, and they have songwriters writing any old thing just for the sake of putting them on the air.

For example, Ruthven discloses that Jeremy Bentham defended torture in some circumstances. Bentham is sometimes given undeserved credit as a progressive force in Anglo-American jurisprudence, and it is good to see him taken down a peg here.Still, Ruthven has his own blinders. He seems to be a Marxist of a sort. He presumes, then, that torture should be understood as a desperate effort by a ruling class to perpetuate its rule. When he deals with torture in the Soviet Union, he cannot bring himself to acknowledge that this was conducted by committed Marxists -- so he claims that it was really the remnant of pre-revolutionary superstitions that caused all the trouble. If they had been real Marxists, of course, they would all have been nice!That variety of special pleading weakens the book throughout."},{"rating":"1","title":"What were they thinking?","review":"OK.....with all the EXCELLENT Flash 5 books out there, why on EARTH did I buy this one?

I have never scanned over a book that I had actually started to read, but this earned whole sections of scan. McEwan has a tiresome ability to pour out of his protagonist tomes of unfulfilling descriptions that are PAINFUL to read through. Additionally, I doubt the ability of a person, even a fictional character, to recall with dulling detail memories of events. Perowne could regurgitate an entire page of drivel in the instance of opening a door or turning his car down a street. I don't doubt neurosurgeons are smart, but no one can ruminate such obtuse and lengthy inner-discourses in lightning quick instances. McEwan seemed more intent on living up to his prior accolades by performing a thought-exercise in writing, without ever telling a meaningful story."},{"rating":"1","title":"slow, cumbersome to finish","review":"I realized that you will either love this book or hate it. Personally I found his narrative slow. There is no real plot or structure to this novel. It merely drags on and on with verbose descriptions. This is like reading a personal blog.

If you want to be put to sleep, then I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Saturday","review":"Rather poor... Characters are quite unrealistic.

Ulysses takes place in one day and so does Saturday, and even though McEwan does not pretend to emulate Joyce, I couldn't help comparing the two books.

The book is a disaster from the start.The writing is tedious, the characters are laughably artificial. The writer fills a lot of pages with dreary descriptions of neurosurgery.

I had it on hold at the library for several weeks and was anticipating reading it. I couldn't have been more disappointed. In fact, I gave up half way through the book. I have never been more bored reading a book before. It was literally putting me to sleep.As with McEwan's last book, ATONEMENT, I had trouble getting through the first 100 pages, but at least with that book, the story eventually became interesting and I came away from it quite satisfied. SATURDAY on the other hand is nothing more than a pompously written book that plodded along with intellectual drivel.

The endless descriptions of performing brain surgery [w/ all the big words] and 18 pages decribing a soccer match sounded, frankly, a little self-indulgent. I didn't care, and not being a brain surgeon myself, would prefer to leave the anatomy lectures to med students. I found myself just skimming page after page looking for some unity. Instead, I found the same heavy-handed psychological terrain couched as a novel. I thought that the metaphor of the burning plane to be an interesting element until it just faded into the blur of everything else. Yes, McEwan is a solid writer, offering interesting perceptions through his main character, but \\"Saturday\\" reads more like an autobiography."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could not get past 100 pages","review":"I was interested to read this book, however I could not make it through the first 100 pages. The book is simply one man's thoughts and recounting of the events of one day. I found it very mind-numbing to simply follow one person's train of thought throughout his day. It was very anti-climatic, although the reader can sense that the author is building and building and building onto something.... However, I did not have the patience to find out what that 'something' was. I also work with neurosurgeons and I can assure you that none of them act like that and the description of his work was unrealistic. In reading other reviews it sounds that if I stuck with the book, it may have been slightly more interesting. However, I instead found it incredibly boring.

I loved the first half of McEwan's Atonement, though I felt the second half was ruined by too many repetitive war and hospital scenes, and a subtle shift in narrative that struck me as forced. Saturday, however, is composed of nothing but pointless detail (if you like descriptions of a man going to the bathroom, flushing, and choosing socks, this is the book for you) and conflict that leads nowhere and results in nothing. I'm so glad I read the terrible reviews of this book on Amazon and saved myself the chore of reading the last third. I skipped straight to the last page and felt I'd got the gist of it, which is essentially a lot of pretentious navel-gazing. What a disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost Perfect","review":"Well, of course Ian McEwan is a beautiful writer and his elegant style in this novel is as appealing as ever, but I felt I liked the parts better than the whole. I loved the descriptions of neurology, his son's music--I even bought a Steve Earle CD which the son called the \\"thinking man's Bruce Springsteen\\"--his daughter's poetry, his visit to his mother, the squash game, but did we really have to know every single thought and observation that passed through Henry's very fertile brain? At times I felt like screaming, \\"enough already!\\"And that all-too-perfect marriage to the least developed character in the book got on my bleepin' nerves. It sounded like the fantasy of a man at the mid-century mark.I'm still a McEwan fan, but this can't compare to the haunting emotion in \\"Atonement\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"do yourself a favor: sleep in on Saturday and skip this book","review":"Turgid and plodding.

I did not want to read ATONEMENT because quite frankly that story sounds boring. This book grabbed from a recommended table. It had a good plot but the author really did not develop the story to the point where I actually knew what was going to happen before it happened.

It was given RAVE reviews by critics as well as other avid readers, but it was all I could do to make myself finish it. The books starts off alright, but the author's tendency to ramble and go off on an entirely obscure tangent made me want to throw the book. I found myself re-reading lines over many times to try to find out what the author was getting at, or what point he was trying to make by discussing such strange things in the middle of a different thought.

Not recommended for even huge fans of Ian McEwan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unlikely and unlikeable","review":"Although well written, I found it hard to keep going with this book. There are numerous long descriptive sections (for example, pages and pages were taken up in describing a squash game) in which I lost interest. The high level of introspection was somewhat unconvincing. And the characters, apart from Baxter and Grammaticus, were dull and complacent. I found Perowne's children particularly unlikely and unlikeable.I was interested to read that the central character, Perowne, preferred William James to his \\"fussy brother\\" Henry, because the latter would \\"run round a thing a dozen different ways than call it by its name\\". This was much the way I found this book. Good editing could perhaps reduce it to a short story of some merit, but as a full length novel, it is weak."},{"rating":"1","title":"Profiting from Others' Distress","review":"Having enjoyed Atonement, I looked forward to reading Saturday, expecting an interesting and compelling narrative. I was very quickly disabused of this idea when I realized that Mr. McEwan had decided to use Huntington's Disease (HD) as a literary device to tell a story about a self-interested physician who is forced in the course of a single day to reevaluate the important things in life. Because the symptoms of HD are described in the novel by a brain surgeon, who is assumed to be an authority on the disease, readers who have no experience with HD may be led to believe that Mr. McEwan's stereotype is invariably true: that people with HD are violent and dangerous. Coping with a hereditary and totally debilitating disease is more than enough by itself. To make readers think they should fear such people's behavior is both cruel and a great injustice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully written, but not the stunner expected.","review":"I've seen so many reviews of this book, and seen the author on the News Hour, and was really geared up to have my socks knocked off. The book is engaging. I enjoyed Harry's inner life and was especially taken with his descriptions of working as a neurosurgeon. I was as bored as several other posters with the squash game section. People (including the author) keep calling this a 9/11 novel. It does include ruminations on 9/11 and the affects on people's thoughts and activities that radiated out from the event. Of far more interest to me were the characterizations of Harry and his family. Overall, well worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"wow, what a disappointment","review":"I loved \\"Atonement\\" for its subtle, deep and expansive writing. I hated Saturday for the opposite take.(I also enjoyed \\"Amsterdam\\" a lot) This book is a great disappointment since McEwan is obviously very talented, and I expected more than just a pot boiler with every cliched character the author could find....the \\"artiste\\" son and daughter to offset the \\"driven\\" mom and dad, the alzheimer ridden grandma, the cranky grandpa, the brutish criminal who suddenly is transformed into a sensitive soul by a poetry reading, the obligatory nude scene and finally the constant references to the \\"dangerous world\\" we live in because of the attack on the World Trade Center on 9/11.Please give us more credit than that to fill your pages, Mr. McEwan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Atonement it is not, Disappointment is more like it","review":"What a sad use of a decent writer's talent. Boring self-obsessed character who spends more time describing his squash game(9 pages)than love making with his wife (less than one). Besides being a conservative butthead, he never makes us believe that he is going to learn to be anything other than way too self-involved. The entire final plotting of book is contrived nonsense that belongs more on General Hospital than in literary fiction. I want the hours back I wasted hoping for this one to redeem itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boooorrrrrriiiiinnnnnggggggg","review":"Inticing beginning, but quickly drops off into the most DULL details of useless information.

This book is bloated with adjectives and distracting disquisitions on foods, wines,music, and squash which add little to the storyline, merely prove that an erudite writer with time on his hands can find abundant filler.A cast of uncompelling characters mixed with discussions of 9-11 politics makes for a forgettable experience (at least I hope so).Non-fiction is so much more interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the price.","review":"I found this book very difficult to get into. I kept on reading it expecting to be sucked in but I never was. I was also not a fan of the way that the author described every aspect of the story in such painstaking and unnecessary details. Overall I'd say if you can buy it used for a few dollars then give it a shot, but don't pay the full retail price."},{"rating":"1","title":"No thumbs up for Saturday","review":"The book is exquisitely written but has no plausible story line. It's a pity that such a talent for writing cannot come up with a more interesting and realistic plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"plodding, over written","review":"I got this book out of the library as an introduction to McEwan with high expectations as Mr McEwan enjoys a good reputation.I gave up on it. It's a plodding character study in which to little happens over too long. I found his writing style interesting at first, bout eventually was wondering whether he would ever get on with the job of telling a story and stop the endless internal monologues. He didn't. I couldn't wait around any more. The book goes back to the library today.After reading some reviews I might try Atonement instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quite as bad as Amsterdam","review":"To start, I have read some of McEwan's novels and quite enjoyed them.Secondly, as in the review title, it doesn't quite reach the pits of Amsterdam (a poorly constructed sliver of a a book with insufficient characterization and not nearly enough about it to achieve anything near the suspension of disbelief necessary to carry the improbable plot line).This book falls into the category of those McEwan books where he's aimed for something like high art and fallen somewhat flat - a stream of consciousness narrative that seems intended to show everyone what a clever fellow he is.Parts are OK, and he is quite a clever fellow.Not so enjoyable, then, and a sudden and again hard to swallow denouement which doesn't sit well with the rest of the intellectualizing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A gem","review":"My pick for the finest book of 2005. (Ok Smith's on beauty is up there too) We know from page one that we are in the hands of a master craftsmen! Reading Ian McGawen is like watching a great pitching performance.

I highly reccomend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"All in a Day's Work","review":"At first, I was doubtful about Mcewan managing to hold my interest because everything takes place in a mere 24 hours. I imagined long abstract interior monologues with little or no action. Not so. Instead, the internal ramblings were well balanced by plenty of real life adventure. And the tidbits about neuro diseases and neurosurgery were so detailed and precise I had to look at the auther bio to see if Mcewan had been a neurosurgeon in a previous life. He wasn't, making his portrayal of Perowne that much more impressive."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a let down!","review":"Anxiously awaited this book. What a disappointment.

He introduces us to assorted haves and have-nots who behave more or less the way we would expect them to behave. Nobody is very interesting, least of all the hero. McEwan seems to be saying, \\"Look what I can do!\\" or \\"Catch me if you can!\\" I do not know what the critics see in this author. To me, it's another instance of the Emperor's New Clothes. I wanted to care for somebody--anybody--in this book. I came closest to feeling that for the drunken grandfather who wrote poety but, finally, he, too, is just another cliché"},{"rating":"1","title":"I REALLY tried...","review":"Maybe this just isn't the best introduction to McEwan...I just could NOT get into this book. Everyone I know has read and loved it, but I got the the third break in the writing, closed it, and had NO desire to pick it up again (so I haven't).My main question is: Isn't it a good idea to introduce the PLOT within a few chapters??? There's just a lot of detail for detail's sake...the first three chapters could have been summed up in about a sentance or two...maybe, \\"He is an excellent doctor, and not the type you'd want programming the music at your parties\\" would have sufficed?Maybe this one gets better...it's a shame that the opening bored me so much that I'll never find out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Saturday - a full day","review":"One day and the people in the life of a Neurosurgeon in London.

The reviews were so favorable and the book was one of the most boring I have ever read. The detail was exhausting and if it weren't for the positive feedback, I would have given up after the first hundred pages. I began to skim over many of the pages and found that I did not miss out on any of the plot at all because there wasn't a plot. I think that some of the more favorable reviews this book has gotten are just because of some of the more pretentious readers are trying to make themselves like this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful","review":"After starting and stopping my \\"Read Saturday\\" project over the past 5 months, I finally finished this book. Having read \\"Atonement,\\" I know McEwan has an amazing ability to craft words, prose, emotions... but it was lost on this book. Instead, the author delves into an overly-detailed, verbose exploration of the day. (I don't care how beautifully you can write, 20 pages on one trivial squash match is just too much.) While the underlying premise and message of the book are powerful, it's just too pretentious in its over-detail."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHERE WAS HIS EDITOR...PROBABLY ASLEEP FROM READING THIS BOOK","review":"This story would probably have been more at home in a book of short stories......if the author had had the good sense to cut his 289 pages of ramblings down to about 60 pages. I do appreciate descriptive writing, but this is ridiculous. A reviewer in the Los Angeles Times said to \\"Read the last 100 pages at one sitting - - the pace and thrill allow it\\". What they failed to say was that the first 189 pages will have put you to sleep and you will be well rested to take on the last 100.I much prefered his book Amsterdam. It actually had a story worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let-down","review":"I read two other of McEwan's books in March 2006 (Atonement and Comfort of Strangers), and was so impressed by them, I couldn't wait to start Saturday. What a let-down. It had a good premise, and I kept waiting for something to happen. I don't mind ramblings, but this was too much. By page 100, I was curious enough to want to know what happens, so I skimmed through the rest of the book. The ending was too much. It was so bad, that I purposely left it on the train as I traveled through Spain so that it wouldn't weigh me down. And it was a hard-copy...just felt I didn't want it in my library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I purchased this novel the day it was released because I had SO loved the author's previous work, ATONEMENT. Unfortunately, this book was a total diappointment. Though the beginning is promising, the plot is SO contrived and unlikely that I felt cheated at the end.This one went to the used book store as soon as I finished it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not McEwan's Best - Read 'Atonement' instead","review":"I heard so much about this book...probably because it was connected with 9/11. I was very disappointed with Saturday.Unlike \\"Atonement,\\" the only other McEwan book I read (which I loved), I did not get involved with the characters of Saturday. It was as if McEwan was trying to get into the mind of his main character here - dissect the internal dialogue, but unlike John Updike and his Rabbit Angstrom character, it did not work in Saturday for McEwan. I felt \\"blah\\" the entire book. I read it and forgot about it. It won't move you like \\"Atonement\\" will.It isn't a bad book, but it isn't a great one either. It's just a book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Saturday is amazing","review":"This book is written with so much care. The words just drip off the page. Everyone in our book group loved it.. Which rarely happens."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insightful Reflection on post-9/11 world","review":"McEwan captured perfectly how it has felt for this New Yorker ever since 9/11/2001.

Masterful writing. As captivating as his Amsterdam."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confused","review":"I don't quite understand why this book is so well-received.

The only reason I finished it is because our book club chose it. It was \\"24\\" in print form, only the subject was a rather neutral character whose occupation as a neurosurgeon and thoughts about that subject would leave most of us out in the cold. Some relevant and metaphorical themes presented themselves regarding violence, protest, crime, and the current US involvement in Iraq.

This book from start to finish reads like someone resting on their laurels. The book has very little plot, and what little that there is, does not ring true. Most often this book seems like a platform for Mr. McEwan to opine on the War in Iraq and also to give his thoughts on humanity in general--oh the human race is cruel--that's original. Atonement could be slow, but was always worth reading on, this book took everything I had not to just put it down. I hope this isn't an indication of things to come from this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let me cut to the chase!","review":"If you're expecting this book to develop into a story, forget it. At many points in the book (pg 30,50 90 150 200 etc.) I thought something would happen to peak my interest. It remains boring, highly unbelievable and has an absurd \\"twist\\" in the very late chapters. As a surgeon, I was little impressed with his medical terms and descriptions of operations. It is just DULL. Save your time and money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This is a terrifically engaging and intelligent novel that is both meditative and pleasingly dense in vivid, narrative detail. Altough it swells with inner dialogue and deep explanation, there is deft movement to the story as it progresses from rumination to flashes of personal and potential horror and back again into the territory of character background.The passing thoughts of the chief character, a British neurosurgeon gliding through a day off until things go awry, comprise the main story line. But all along there are bright tangents on terrorism, the case for war, road rage, family life, brain disorders, violence, poetry and literature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"Reviews seemed fabulous. The first 75 pages or so were entertaining enough.Then the book dragged, digressed and rambled along. I forced to continuereading very slowly. Finally in the last 60 - 70 pages the book picks upbut it is pointless. A pure waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious drivel","review":"I'm listening to the last disc (of 9) of this book. I want to quit, but I have to finish it out. I don't feel like a runner getting his 2nd wind. I feel like a runner who isn't running anymore, and he's on the verge of collapse, and the only thing keeping him going is that he just needs to finish. No excitement - just obligation.It does cover a day in the life of a neurosurgeon, but it feels like it would've taken more than 24 hours to read or listen to this.And it's so pretentious. Way too much technical jargon. Way too much reminiscing. And do I really care how some rich guy feels about his car or house?I just can't wait till it's over."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great disappointment","review":"I started this novel with much anticipation based on all the fabulous reviews. Unfortunately it was an utter waste of time. McEwan can write but by the end I was hoping for the happy ending of the whole family's demise--maybe that was McEwan's goal. I so despised them all. I also thought McEwan and by proxy the main character were terrible misogynists. The main character's thought process while his daughter faces rape right in front of his eyes was disgusting, as was the same character's response to the major crisis at the end. He is only concerned with his own messiah complex. This was a thoroughly un-enjoyable and despicable work. If I could give it a zero I would, the whole thing left me incredibly angry at why anyone could enjoy this as great literature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Literature that stays in your mind","review":"I had a hard time becoming really involved with this story for about the first third, but then I started to understand that this book has to be savoured rather than gulped, which is my usual method. There are so many ideas, and observations and situations that really were worthy of attention and many \\"yes, that's it!\\" moments of recognition. Aspects of modern life that we all absorb, without really thinking about, are examined here, and McEwan obviously does think about them, and encapsulates a response to current events that I think will ring true with many readers. By the last third I was enthralled and engrossed. Give this one time and attention and you will be richly rewarded."},{"rating":"2","title":"McEwan writes what we all think.","review":"Post 9/11 our thinking has changed and no one has written about the paranoia, fears, or anxiety that we all unconsciously deal with on a day to day basis. A few short sentences here and there and McEwan touches on unspoken feelings we all have...about that day and about the future. A bit too detailed in some places, I found myself skipping ahead. BUT I always got a grip because I didn't want to miss a single word. Yes, I believe McEwan is and will be one of the greatest writers of this generation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly this book's rather dull","review":"Don't get me wrong, I'm a huge fan of Ian McEwan and was eagerly awaiting his new release - but sadly this book is not one of his better ones.Perhaps it was the uncharacteristic sentimentality, or the too perfect family cast (ie brilliant neurosurgeon, brilliant lawyer, brilliant jazz musician, brilliant poet etc - there has to be a failure in there somewhere?), or the thin characterisation of the bad guy (a Martin Amis gangster without the humour), or the rather weird and tentative political commentary, or is it simply that spending a day in the mind of a serious middle-aged doctor is really not particularly interesting?No doubt prime Booker prize material"},{"rating":"1","title":"Better I Should Read \\"Friday\\"","review":"I should have known better. Taking the word of a couple of professional reviewers, I failed to read a few pages online before ordering this confusing and convoluted novel.First, the narrative is written in the present tense. I will never understand why a writer will write in the present tense about events in the past. It is unnerving. I expessed this feeling to my professor in a graduate seminar on the American novel, and, much to my surprise, she agreed that the form was not to her liking.Second, we are drowned at the beginning in page afte page of medical arcana as the protagonist involves himself in multiple surgeries expressed in medical terminology that only a medical school graduate will understand.Third, the scenes change rapidly with no transitions to lead the reader in a logical sequenceSince I paid $16 for this book, I will struggle to get beyond page 20 where I am up to my eyeballs in confusion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless drivel...","review":"Pass on this one, unless you wished to be bored to a new state of existence...not a pleasant one, to be sure...Worthless drivel is the mainstay of this novel...based on a stream of consciousness, it in no way approaches literary merit...Faulkner, this is not...For your own sense of well being, find another book to read...There is essentially no plot, no action, no theme, no story...Caveat emptor!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"wellworth the time","review":"At last a novel that resonates with tthe confusion in the world we live in today. Having written several unfavorable reviews, I can finally rave about this one. Ian McEwan is one of the better novelists writing today, and if I could, I would give this a four-plus rating. I am reserving five stars for a novel I would reread. There are many aspects to this novel that I found intriguing, especially the ability to get inside Henry Perowne's head and feel his anger and frustration with life. McEwan is a masterful author and this book deserves a rave review."},{"rating":"1","title":"PASS ON DINNER IF SURGERY IS IN THE OFFERING","review":"It is obviously impossible for Ian McEwan to duplicate ATONEMENT. This attempt feels so contrived that it it is hard to believe that the same author wrote both books.I didn't care about the characters, and the protagonist lost it for me completely when he left his home and victimized family to perform surgery on the man who attempted to harm him. What a crock !If Ian were a first-time novelist, this would never be in print."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Listen to the Reviews!!!","review":"I cannot understand how this book received such glowing reviews. I picked up this book and was very excited at the prospect of diving into it. Well, there was no diving -- I was only able to slog my way through 50 pages. Then I had to ask myself, \\"why continue -- do I hate myself\\"? It does not take fifty pages to illustrate that the protagonist woke up in the early morning hours for no reason. I'm not into rip-roaring reads -- hey -- I read \\"Middlemarch\\" and enjoyed it!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Torture!","review":"I really tried to like this book. I really wanted to like it. I was the one who recommended it for book club. Everybody HATED it! The book is 90% stream of conscious. Following the narrator's thoughts from one tangent to another just does not make for entertaining - or enlightened! - reading. When there was action, it was very far fetched. Operating on the man who burgled your house, held a gun to your wife and molested your daughter?? Please. It was just too much. I have read a lot of books, but I would not recommend this one to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waiting for Saturday night","review":"Reading Ian Mcewan's Saturday made me long for Saturday night and get over this overextended one day. The writer has great style but he enslaves it to endless, exhausting and pompous medical details. The never ending elaborate description of the neurosurgery can turn any reader into a chronically neurotic fiction hater. The final outcome is a novel populated with not particularly pleasant charaters. Why should anybody care about the patient, or even less so - about the fate of his genious surgeon? What a let down ofter Mcewan's monumental Atonement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I had really high hopes for this book that were totally disappointed. The plot points were obvious, the writing was dull, the day dragged on forever. It would take some serious convincing or extreme prolonged boredom to get me to pick up a McEwan book again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow to start but a wonderful read","review":"This is the first Ian McEwan novel that I have read. I really enjoyed it and would recommend it to others. However, it got off to a slow start action-wise. I enjoyed the early chapters as you learned a lot about the main character's personality, as well as that of his family but if I had been in a different, less relaxed place I might have been frustrated by the lack of action. It's possible that if I were looking for an exciting or passionate read instead of something reflective I would have put this book down fifty pages in. That said, if you have patience and can savor the detials offered in the beginning of the book, you might really enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful writing, glacial pace","review":"This book suffers from the same affliction as ATONEMENT: beautiful, textured prose with no sense of how a story should be paced and told. I tried very hard to like this book, but the self-absorbed stream of conscious of the narrator repeatedly gets in the way of moving the plot along. I found myself thinking, over and over, \\"For God's sake, man, get on with it!\\" Wasting ten pages on a meaningless game of squash - and I used to be a tournament-level player - does nothing to advance the plot. Nor does his painfully long-winded description of making a fish stew (I can buy a Julia Child book or CD for something like this). McEwan is unable to keep from wrapping the story around the axle in paragraph after paragraph of boring detail, much of which seems designed to simply show off his writing skills, which are considerable. Finishing this book was a real chore. I do not recommend it, and I'm surprised that it was short-listed for the Booker Prize."},{"rating":"1","title":"a bit boring","review":"This story occurs over one day (Saturday, as in the title).

Didn't like it..."},{"rating":"1","title":"beautifully written and silly","review":"Mcewan is a fine prose stylist, but this novel is a failure in every other way. The characters are either languidly or hyperbolically unreal. The dramatic elements of the plot are absurd, mannered, and astonishingly unconvincing. The meditations on world events-- the war in Iraq, 911, etc-- are tepid and obvious.Why has this book gotten so much acclaim?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hype Only","review":"A complete waste of time. McEwan has done much better -- \\"Atonement,\\" for example. The characterizations were thin and the story simply boring and predictable with enough sidetracks to make another not very interesting book. It was difficult to finish.

There are too many better books to waste time on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"High hopes... but big disappointment","review":"I was very much expecting to be engaged and passionate about this book, which came highly recommended by a few people in my circle. In fact, the complete opposite happened.There were moments that this book was brilliant, and times it was a complete bore. The writing style is ok at best with too much on the minutia. I know the auther speaks of other authors and says that the genius is in the minutia (specific to Jane Austin), but I guess it was lost on me.I actually think the movie could be a great screenplay after it is reworked a bit. There are some great characters in the book that just don't get explored enough.

I am only giving it two stars as I do feel McEwan has talent in writing some fine prose, but the story line in this novel was more like a Rube Goldberg device. One action causes another action blah blah blah.Not sure what the intent of the novel was by IM, but I feel that this novel was written in a hurry without much though given to the overall theme of the book. A doctor with a conscience and great wife with two smart kids - come on - I cannot believe I finished it and I only did because in the end I needed something to put me to sleep. Sorry IM, but this wasn't the best job."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Saturday in the Life of Henry Perowne","review":"McEwan follows the life of Henry Perowne, renowned surgeon, for one full Saturday. Contented family man with a loving wife and a successful career, Henry goes about his Saturday routine, anticipating an evening reunion with his family. The day starts with Henry standing at his window in the middle of the night. He witnesses a plane crashing in the distance. The tragedy of 9/11 lingers in the air. As he goes about his business on this, his valued day-off, Henry carries a feeling that he can neither explain nor describe. The ordinary day eventually relinquishes into a disaster for himself and his family.The entire book takes place in the mind of Henry, allowing us to feel as he feels about everything from the mundane, to the bizarre, to the horrific.

Listed are authentic Bavarian beer halls, and small breweries that must be tried even if they are off the beaten path, as well as the large gardens. Good news is with the mass transit system, all beers are not far away!This book is very easy to navigate; many insider tips listed, history about the locations, reasons why you must try them over the other thousands of beer gardens/halls.

Its a little difficult seperating and threading the needle at first, but you'll get used to it. Theres more then enough thread if you need it and the instructions are pretty easy to follow. The needle is a regular metal one, not one of those plastic safe ones. The little round ring holds it taut and in place while you stitch. A fun little project to teach you the basics of a couple types of stitching.

I just recently went to a Kutless concert, and the lead singer took some time before starting to talk about his and other's christian faith. For one thing, I do not think that leaning on Jesus is all that christian songs can be about. That is a good subject matter, but not the only thing. Like in song #7, when he sings \\"I'm learning how to fly\\", it seems to represent growing and enjoying your relationship with christ, just it of course doesn't actually say that. You have to think outside of the bun, and then you will find the messages it speaks about. Great CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Been there, done that","review":"Despite what my 2 star rating of their latest release may imply, I am a big fan of Kutless. However, this cd is nothing special, and really, sounds the same as all their others. There has been absolutely no change or maturity in their musical sound or style. Put all their songs on one playlist, play them randomly, and you can't distinguish what cd each of the songs are off of.Good cd if it's the first Kutless for your collection; disappointing if it's your third or fourth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Rock Release-Kutless Lives On!","review":"Wow, what a great album.

His interpretations and improvisational style are similar to that of Ali Akbar Khan because they have the same musical spirit and temperament, as instilled by their guru Allaudin Khan. We hear 74 minutes of tranquility and romance appropriate to the coming evening. Although out of print and the label is retired, this album and others of the same series are still available new (as of this date of review) from specialty sellers, such as Shrimati's in Berkeley, CA. If you like Hindustani classical music, its depth and emotional power, seek out these recordings. Such long performances, with fully developed alaps, permit the raga modes to nurture the respective emotions. Ragas should not be rushed.

Anyway, back to the bike...it really is great. Huffy has always made great durable products (I had one and beat the crap out of it for years!). It was very easy to put together, all the parts were in the box and the bike was received from order to door in under a week. This thing should last him (hopefully)another two years (he's very tall!) at least and hopefully one of these days, he'll actually get up enough guts to ride on it for more than 4 minutes without wanting to get off and look for the Little Tykes thing or pick his nose."},{"rating":"2","title":"One tough bike","review":"This bike is sturdy, easy to put together and is living strong while my four year old trys to imitate his thirteen year old BMX biker brother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing Parts","review":"The bike arrived on time (one star for that).

It was 80 pages of hyperbolic exaggeration that concern work and studies that in reality have serious problems that may never be solved.I thought it would be good to read as a review of futurists so I wouldn't have to read them to understand their points, but Garreau appears to be a futurist's futurist: the leaning towards fabrication and scenario planning (science fiction writing) is accepted as a baseline, to which he reaches for ever higher flights of fantasy.After the 80 page mark (which ends in the middle of Kurzweil's heaven) this book might start really cooking along, I don't know: it was not my cup of tea. Why base your knowledge of reality on fantasies extrapolated from fantasies?"},{"rating":"1","title":"The shallow work of a journalistic mind","review":"Like a frightened butterfly, the author flits from topic to topic. touching one then another lightly then spiriting away with the same superficial questions posed again and again. The book is one big \\"interest step\\" - nothing more than an ad for the real thing - books like The Singularity is Near by Ray Kurzweil. I learned NOTHING from this book. The truly odd assortment of sources (apart from Kurzweil) that deigned to become the fabric of this book are compellingly kooky - good for many a laugh. And they reveal the author's true calling - chasing (but never catching) the butterfly that fully makes the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less here than meets the eye","review":"This book is big on eye-grabbing claims and weak on substance. It is designed to appeal to the credulous. The title is one obvious example of the lack of rigor. The book was about \\"radical enhancements\\" - including the genetic manipulations.

Forget the conspiracy theories and don't take it too seriously. If you want to take the subject of human evolution seriously, then this is perhaps a single data point on your way to achieving that end. If you think that you're going to gain some intimate understanding of biology or evolutionary anthropology, or predict the future of mankind based on reading a single book like this one, than your off the mark anyway. The author has a wealth of knowledge to share and who knows some of this may come to pass. My bet is that we are a lot closer than we think. If you choose to pick it up and read it, than I encourage you to read it all. There are some parts that were a little farfetched. There are many parts that are indeed thought provoking. There are some parts that I think have come and gone, but I think the book is worth reading all the way through."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Piece of My Complex Mind","review":"Russell Crowe's portrayal of John Nash's life is simply superb.

I had never seen, for example, a photograph of Landru, the French Bluebeard. The photographs are authentic: they do depict the people they claim to depict. You just cannot rely on Wilson's version of what they did.For some reason, this collection has been issued in a variety of titles, sometimes as 'Illustrated True Crime'; sometimes with Damon Wilson listed as co-editor, sometimes not; under different imprints; and with slightly different texts. Since its only value is as a casual and random collection of old photos, that makes no difference."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Good Book but Brutal!","review":"Okay, I read real or true crime books as often as I can. I bought this book because I wanted to see photos that normally wouldn't be shown like Nicole Brown Simpson after her murder. There were cases that I don't think should be in the same book like the Long Island Lolita, the Monica Lewinsky scandal, the Lorena Bobbit trial, and others. Some crimes are far more serious like the Jack the Ripper murders, the World War II concentration camps, and some are missing like Pan Am 103 which was indeed a criminal act and a terrorist act. The pictures are interesting. The cover of the book is a mob hit. Even now after 13 years since the Simpson-Goldman murders in Brentwood, California, there is talk of the Goldmans publishing the O.J. book retitled Confessions of a Double Murderer."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Egyptians knew more than just mummification","review":"There were many interesting topics in the book but I felt it was overall a little short. I used it as a read aloud for my children during our Egypt unit study. We were amazed at how the Egyptians multiplied and divided numbers. We tried it and it really worked! Many interesting things we did not know before. I do recommend the book, but because of it's short length I did not give it 5 stars.

Not one is boring at all.

Especially \\"Birth of Evil: Part 1 & 2\\" as we learn how Aku came into existence. I cannot say how great this season is. It's more dark, better action, and the art is at its best.

It is about damn time the 3rd season was released! This was the best show that Cartoon Network ever produced, and in my opinion, they really treated it poorly. It seemed they kept moving the time slot, and then they would go a long time without running a new episode. I guess they were too busy with the crap they currently produce like Teen Titans or Hi Hi Puffy Amiyumi!Anyhow, this show had it all. Great stories, great music, great visuals. The animation was kept very basic and that only added to the whole thing. Yeah, a few of the stories were a little silly, but you can't be perfect all the time.I wish CN would bring back the show.

So glad, in fact, that I quickly bought 5 large boxes of K-cups and a carousel to hold them all. It worked perfectly and really well for the first few months, but now, for no reason, has a few really annoying issues. The heating time is the same-very fast, but takes forever to actually dispense, while it used to be immediate. Also, it dispenses the wrong amount. If I choose the regular size, it dispenses the large size and when I hit large, it dispenses large. A few times it didn't even dispense anything at all, and I had to shut it off and on again to get it to work.

When I called they took me through a quick diagnostic and concluded replacement was needed and immediately shipped another, don't have the ship the first one back (but they do need the filter cup, so you don't get to keep two!)...

It's great to wake up turn it on and pop in a no mess kcup and make a great cup of coffee to get me started in the morning. Purchasing additonal kcups is so easy and having a bold cup in the morning and possibly a flavored later in the day is great. Cheaper than running out anywhere for a cup.

Also you have to keep an eye on it or it will vibrate the cup off the unit and onto the counter. We've tried every way imaginable to muffle it or keep the vibration down, but to no avail.

We called customer service only to be on hold forever and then finally someone back on the line and said that they'd get back to us in 1 to 2 business days, and that was 3 days ago and we haven't heard from them. For the price of these machines, the quality could be a lot better. It's a great concept, but the Kcups are expensive, if you use 2-3 a day that's 45 dollars or more a month for kcups, that's not cheap at all. We do have the My Kcup but that had to be rigged to work otherwise water spills all over the place when you try to use it. They need better customer service.

I received one as a present and it is going to the thrift store: the coffee is so-so at best, but more importantly, I simply cannot get over the inherent wastefulness of what amounts to a whole new industry to simultaneously complicate and de-skill something as simple and basic as making a cup of coffee. The Keuring is only 'simple' if you ignore the long supply chain and resource extraction that preceded its appearance on your kitchen counter and the whole new layer of complexity and waste inherent in producing the disposable k-cups. Is there not enough plastic in our landfils and oceans already?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"When this item arrived, the water reservoir had a crack in it.

After the first year the pump became very noisy. My father had one just like mine and it was very noisy too. This morning (Feb 2012) mine failed to work. I emptied the tank, shook it a bit, and sprayed a jet of water into the empty tank. To my surprise it started working again, but I don't anticipate that it will last much longer. I believe that a small appliance which costs $100 should last five years or more.Needless to say, I have started looking for a replacement -- from a different manufacturer. I must say I am also concerned about drinking hot coffee that has been piped through a cheap plastic cup."},{"rating":"1","title":"Taste like Plastic","review":"Tried 3 different K-cups from the sampler pack that came with the unit and they all tasted bad with a funny smell. Brewed just a cup of hot water with the unit and tasted it. YUCK!!! plastic!!!. Ran white vinegar through unit and let sit for 4 hours but it still tasted like plastic. Called Keruig and they if you've tried the white vinegar trick and it still taste like plastic you have to send it back.So I sent the B40 back.We have a B60 at the office and my father also has one and they both work fine so I ordered one of those. I received the B60 last night. Tested it with just water. YUCK!!!! Plastic again. Running vinegar cycle through unit today while I'm at work to see if that fixes it.Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dishwater Tastes Better","review":"I hate to slam a product but this coffee maker is horrible.

Nothing can ruin a good cup of tea worse then the lingering taste of coffee. I have to say I was pleased that there was no taste of coffee. I am not a fan of Earl Grey which I used but the fresh taste had me think twice.My twin girls have sensory processing disorder so they don't like machine noises such as hair dryer, blender, and mixer. They cry at lawn mowers two blocks away mind you. They are not bothered by this coffee machine at all. It does make some noise and as another reviewer said it is not a Mr. Coffee but I would hardly say its loud.Worth the money!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"You may become a coffee snob too!","review":"The ritual of grinding coffee beans in an attempt to brew a great cup of coffee is over. We were introduced to the Keurig at our son's big birthday party and decided to purchase this B40 as soon as we got home. We no longer have to throw out a half pot of good coffee because we don't drink a whole pot. We just brew what we drink! At Amazon the EXTRA BOLD k-cups are about 30 cents per perfect cup of coffee. Even fine restaurants can't compare to the rich flavor. We are very happy."},{"rating":"1","title":"BE WARNED: Unreliable","review":"Am on my second B40 and this one is having the same problem as the first one. The water pump fails. It sounds like it's working but it does not move any water. Keurig replaced the first one after three months. Now I'll have to contact them again about the second one.

Two choices is more than enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great when it works","review":"We've owned the PLATINUM Keurig for 3 months now. While we love it when it works, there ARE occasions when the k-cups blow out and coffee grinds fill the cup.

Keurig is aware of this problem and will work to make you happy (free boxes of k-cups...)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Already having issues with it!","review":"I bought this coffee brewer for my home because we have one at my office and everyone loved it, including me. However, I have only had mine for about four weeks and it is already not working right. Sometimes it only fills the cup with about a half cup of coffee, even though I pressed the large mug button. I have done all the things the \\"Trouble Shooting\\" tells me to, but it still doesn't work right.

We also regularly drink beverages made from the hot chocolate, coffee and tea K cups. I use it just about every day.However, now at just a little over one year, the machine no longer works. When I try to make coffee the machine will emit a low purr until I power cycle.

It died after a little less than a year of use. My neighbor had the same problem with his Keurig (different model, but it lasted less than a year, too). The pods are expensive, and you usually have to make a special trip to buy them as they are typically unavailable at the grocery store. The coffee can be a bit week. Keurig maintains that you can make a larger cup of coffee; however, it just pours more water through the same pod so it's just a larger, weaker cup of coffee. I liked the convenience of being able to brew a cup so quickly. I thought we would get more use out of having a variety of coffees and teas to choose from. We did not. Again, the pods are expensive. Overall, it was a huge disappointment. I wouldn't recommend to friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY HOT COFFEE FLAVORED WATER!","review":"If you love good coffee, and know something about it, don't buy this machine!It basically produces very hot coffee-flavored water. The coffee is thin and completely lacks texture, body and the all-important oils, which must be a caualty of the k-cup packaging process.Frankly, it reminded me of the coffee you used to get from the old vending machines.And, yes, I did try all the sample K-cups the machine came with.Even the darkest sumatran coffees had barely any taste.My old french press still makes the best cuppa I've ever had at home."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kuerigs are just Instant Coffee Vending Machines","review":"Keurigs are not ground coffee brewers.

I have never been more disappointed and frustrated with any product in my life. The machine comes with stale coffee pods, makes horrible tasting coffee, and one cannot find decent readily available replacement pods. I tried to return the coffee maker and Amazon told me I had to deal with the manufacturer and the manufacturer wanted to charge me a shipping fee to return the coffee maker plus a restocking fee making it more expensive to return than I paid for it...right in the trash can and thanks alot Amazon and Keurig.

I used several different coffee varieties and tried it with different cup sizes & amounts of water to be sure it wasn't the strength of the beverage that I found unpleasant. No, it's definitely the taste. Sorry but I like my coffee to actually taste like what you get from coffee beans.

However, when it arrived it was definitely not new. It appeared to be a refurbished model and carton was secured with a yellow tape. Black markings were on the box. I have ordered many items from Amazon and have sung the praises of this company. This order was totally unacceptable and now I am hesitant to order from Amazon. Yes, Amazon paid for the return through UPS. I stayed home all day for UPS to pick up the box since telephone call said they would be by between 7AM and 6PM. They did not pick up the box.

I cannot stand stale coffee, but with drip coffee makers you either have to throw out an entire pot after drinking one cup, or you have to drink stale coffee.

Do your research, there's an easy comparison tool on Keurig's website, but you'll find that while this one delivers the same wonderful coffee as the bigger ones, you'll have to refill the water for each cup, and, it takes a full 3 minutes to brew, while the other models hold enough water for 8 cups or so, and take only seconds to brew each cup. That being said, this an an adorable little machine, brews outstanding coffee, and is way quieter than the big ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"disapointed","review":"Will be sending this back, the largest setting for a cup of coffee produces 4 ounces of coffee, the water just drips out while making coffee, sometimes the water never heats up so you have a cold 4 ounce cup of coffee!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Underwhelming compared to Nespresso","review":"I purchased the Keuring as a Christmas gift for my family, and the product turned out to be completely underwhelming. When I want to make two 'tall' coffees, 100% times the sizes come out unequal- one cup of coffee will be less full than the other. The taste of the Keurig-brewed coffee is, well, average at best. If you want to buy a coffee machine that will deliver every single time you use it, with quality and depth to the coffeee brewed, try any of the Nespresso coffee machines and inserts.I used Nespresso for 3 years while I lived in Europe, and had to say goodbye to the machine when we moved back to the US, because of the difference in voltage/electrical plugs. Now, I went the \\"cheap route\\" and thought that Keuring (which is about 100 bucks less expensive) will be just as good as Nespresso. I was wrong...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Both Keurig B-40 brewers died","review":"I have to admit I have enjoyed the Keurig brewing system so much that after buying one for my home, I purchased one for work. Both on average are used about 1 cup per day. But the satisfaction level has died along with both machines dying, each less than 2 years old. From reading all of the reviews for this product and the B60 and B-70 models, the longevity of the brewer is notoriously low. The summary to me seems to be either you love or hate it depending on if it continues to works. Look at the ratings, the percentage with just 1 star is very high because the Keurig brewer has a poor track record. I will not reward Keurig by purchasing two more units to replace their defective brewers. I will find an option."},{"rating":"2","title":"life changing machine!","review":"My wife & I bought the B-60 for ourselves years ago, it was such a hit I've purchased the less expencive (but does the same job,) just different sizes)This machine makes a perfect gift"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great so far","review":"Got it on 2-4-13 and worked great right out of the box. Ordered a B40, but got a B45 upgrade instead. As far as I can see the only difference is the B45 has one more cup seting for a total of three instead of two cup setting for the B40. So far so good. Bought this after using the B40 at work. Believe me at work the machine gets some usage. I estimated at least 20-30 cups a day or more and is still going strong for 6 months now. Wife loves it! Heats quickly. Aprox 60-90 sec and not very noisy as other reviews have mentioned. I advise running a few dry runs to get it primed. Once I did that I got a full 9.5 oz cup or a little more.

They apologized and promised to replace these boxes immediately. Two weeks later I called again because the replacements never arrived. They were unable to find the replacement order. The representative claimed that the \\"best buy\\" date was more of a suggestion, and he did not see anything wrong with selling coffee that was about to expire.

I saw them today and asked how they like it after about 2 weeks of use. They LOVE it! Very simple, can choose from 7.25 and 9.25 mug sizes, even has auto shut-off. They love the fact it takes no time (about 2 mins) to warm up the machine if they choose to shut it off (which they rarely do unless they are leaving the house). You can even buy the Brew Over Ice teas for homemade iced tea. Yep, highly recommend this. I'd have given it 5 stars but I wish this particular unit had 3 brew sizes (more expensive models have 3 or 5 size options).

Overall this is a good buy and I expect that I'll get a lot of use out of this item. The coffee maker was competitively priced. This was by far the best price when shipping was factored in that I could find online.

No instructions or warrenty information was enclosed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short-term Life","review":"My daughter had a Keurig. made great coffee. She loved it, so I bought the B-40. She had a more expensive model. Loved my Keurig. Made great coffee for a little less than 6 months and then began pumping less coffee so a big mug held under 8 oz. I then descaled it even though the descale light was not on. Little improvement. Asked my daughter about hers. She told me she was on her second Keurig as the first one began pumping much less coffee. Now her second one is doing the same so she won't buy another. I misplaced by receipt so I bought a Bodum French Press from Amazon. Makes great coffee. Low tech. Not much can go wrong with it. My son said he thinks the problem with the Keurig is the pump. He's good at fixing things so I will ad to this review once he's done Would I recommend this to a friend? Nope."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't do it!!! Piece of garbage....","review":"I was a die hard Keurig fan when they first came out. My first machine was purchased before they were even mainstream and I loved it. It lasted almost 2 years. When it died I just assumed it was from use and bought another one. That one lasted less than a year and had the same problem. Since then I have gone through 4 machines and each one dies sooner than the last. I am finally moving on. Love the concept, love that I can make only one cup BUT not worth the hassle to take them back every time. I read somewhere that Keurig changed their manufacturing and that the quality went down and I agree wholeheartedly. I wish they would go back to whatever they did in the beginning because my first one was definitely the best. Today my newest machine died after a few months. Moving on....."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointed","review":"I received the Keurig elite for Christmas and was so disappointed at how it works. The coffee is so weak. I wouldn't say I like extra bold coffee, but I don't like watery coffee and this is exactly what you get. Some of the pods produce a better taste than others, but overall I find the coffee to be extra weak and it gets cold fast. I tried the Keurig Mini (2 separate units) and then the elite. I am returning this and going with another brand. I am bummed that I didn't like the Keurig--I wanted to like it badly!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuch in every drop","review":"Noisy growling for each cup of coffee that is loud enough to wake the dead.

It worked fine, we enjoyed it until two nights ago when were awakened by the smoke detector. The Keurig was engulfed in flames and the fire was speading quickly. We were so lucky to be able to get the fire out with an extinguisher, but not before a ton of smoke overtook the house. If you have one of these, I beg you to make sure you unplug it after each and every use! It is not enough to have it powered off. Things could have been so much worse, I am just happy that we were able to get the kids out of the house to safety. I will never buy another Keurig. That was the scariest thing to ever have to go through."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!","review":"I've had mine for three days. THREE days! Already, the brewer handle won't close. It's now an expensive paperweight. (Don't lecture me about improper usage--I've had it 3 days & made 3 cups of coffee. There's nothing I've done wrong.) Called customer service & they ask a jillion completely irrelevant questions (name, e-mail, address, zip, etc.--seriously Keurig, can't you build a list of names to sell when we're NOT trying to get an answer for something?). No help at all. I'm going to return it & think long & hard about whether to replace it. A quick web search shows that this may be a fairly common problem with this unit. What a complete waste of money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"did anybody who designed this actually turn it on????","review":"We replaced our old Keurig coffee maker with this one a few days ago. The old one wasn't bad, but it occasionally would mess up and grounds would go all over the place, and worst of all, when you removed the old grounds, it would always drip and make a mess all over the place.While I see that this new version has addressed these issues, It is obvious how they did it; they hooked up a Jet engine thruster to the device. I mean this thing actually shakes the entire kitchen; it is far louder than any alarm clock I have ever owned.This unit also adds two cup levels, regular and large, thank you for that.So for the work office, its a bit of amusement when people four doors down from the kitchen jump when the loud motor goes off, but I can only imagine in dread if I had this thing in my apt and wanted a cup of coffee while my wife was still asleep. She'd come at this machine with a sledge hammer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cool machine, weak coffee","review":"The idea and design for this machine are very good. The ease of use and lack of mess are very good. The cup of coffee that it brews is not so good. The vast selection of coffees is enticing but no matter what type I used the product was 8oz. of brown water. Granted I like stronger coffee but for some reason this machine seems to make VERY weak coffee. I am going to contact the manufacturer to see if the unit is defective........."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great at first but then.......","review":"We really liked the Keurig coffeemaker when we first bought it. It was fast and made a good cup of coffee despite the high price of the K-cups. But now, after owning it for 6 months it only puts out 1/2 of the water necessary to make a cup of coffee. We have used only filtered water the entire time we've used it. We have just cleaned out the system but it didn't help. I am not impressed after paying over $100 for this machine. Buyer beware!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Zero for two","review":"I have received two brewers and both have been defective. The first worked about 3 days and then didn't complete the brew cycle, leaving about a half inch of water in the cup. Keurig replaced it with little fuss.

The third unit is on it's way, but needless to say, I have wasted too much time on this problem already and this will be the last."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent value","review":"I've had this coffeemaker for a little over 2 years, and couldn't be happier. It performs as advertised, and I enjoy the pleasure and convenience of being able to get just one cup of coffee at any time with no trouble whatsoever. It's especially nice when company's here, and someone wants decaf, someone wants regular. I know this is the more expensive of the single-cup coffeemakers, but after looking at reviews, this is the one that was praised by all owners. I have found the K-cups at Target, and now on-line at Amazon grocery, so getting them has not been a problem. (This was a worry I had before purchasing.)I wouldn't want to be without this appliance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed with Keurig","review":"I purchased this Keurig B-40 at the end of October. It worked great for about 2 weeks. Now I have to fight with it for 1/2 hour to get a cup of coffee. I've bought a bunch of k-cups and now can't hardly use them. I'm really disappointed. When you turn the machine on, there is a humming, and if you're lucky you can hear water moving around in there. Sometimes I'll get a half cup of coffee. If I unplug and turn it back on, I can sometimes get another half cup. If I play with it long enough (I'm desperate at this point,) I can eventually get a full cup of coffee... but it's frustrating and I might as well drive to starbuck for the half-hour I have to fight with this machine.

I was expecting to have an out-of-body experience due to all the hype I've heard about the Keurig. However, no matter how much coffee I packed into the cup I simply could not get a coffee that didn't taste weak and watered down. Plus the water storage tank continually leaked out of the bottom. We returned our machine and happily went back to using our old coffee maker."},{"rating":"1","title":"this coffee fad is bad","review":"On 7/19/11 I bought the Keurig Elite and I will without a doubt be returning mine. I am a very avid coffee drinker and enthusiast, so I am a little particular with my coffee. I personally thought the coffee tasted burnt and really dulled the flavored coffee's taste. I also tried my regular favorite bean using the re-usable filter...I became even less impressed with the Keurig. My favorite brew tasted horrible in comparison. Not to mention, it did not make or leave the aroma of fresh brewed coffee (well maybe for a half a minute or so). I'll stick with my simple pot, and not fall for the fad again. (side note-I ran through a couple of gallons of water and when that didn't work, I tried vinegar and ran a couple more gallons through. It didn't help)"},{"rating":"2","title":"FREAKING AWESOME!","review":"This is the best coffee maker I've ever owned! It is perfect. I love the storage tank on the side for water.

I thought I could open the bottom to see what is the problem. I think I found it however, no where on there web site does it have where you can buy parts!

Instant gratification, lots of great flavors - it has it all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Design flaws","review":"I purchased the B40 from Keurig's website, and it worked correctly maybe twice. Then it started not pumping any water, or at times would brew a partial cup. Usually it would just sit there and do nothing, then the lights would go haywire. I found the brew strength to be highly inadequate as well. No way do I want another one of these machines, and I'm getting a refund. If you read the customer reviews on Keurig's own website, you'll see a pattern of these problems so there is obviously a design flaw. Overall a bad experience with an expensive appliance. I've been pouring the coffee out of the k-cups into my old drip brewer, and the coffee tastes much better that way!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good machine - while it lasts","review":"This is the second Keurig I bought in 4 years. Very convenient - while it works. Despite using filtered water, regular descaling, etc., they seem to simply stop working after 2 years.

Wish the company would do more to ensure longer lasting product."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is just great","review":"It is just great. No problems.

I bought it for home, where I rarely drink more than a cup, or two in the morning before work. Since getting the brewer, I've really started enjoying my coffee more and have even begun drinking tea. The flavors of both coffees and teas available are incredible. I wish the actual K-Cups were a little cheaper, but guess I am willing to pay a little more for the increased quality. Now, I'm buying a second brewer for the office."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than expected ...","review":"We have the B60 at home, so I bought the B40 for my office. Surprising, I find the B40 to be more practical (I don't need or use many of the options on the B60) and more quiet. The coffee is still more expensive than it needs to be but for my office, the cleanliness and convenience are worth it. I've used this machine one month and, so far, it's a winner. I tried the B30 before buying this ... too small and expensive. This machine has the best balance of functionality and price of all options."},{"rating":"2","title":"Daughter loves it!","review":"I bought this for my daughter for Christmas.

The descaling light wouldn't go off despite performing the descaling process 3 times. Be aware I only use distilled water in my unit so descaling shouldn't be an issue. My wife loved it and I had a substantial supply of K-Cups so I was forced to buy another one. This one was much more quieter than the first which sounded like a plane taking off. But now the noise has been getting much louder and it is turning itself off. This time I have only a minimal supply of K-Cups so if it breaks I am done with Keurig."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the Office and Personal use","review":"We have the Keurig B60 in our office - it just made more sense than having our Mr. Coffee sitting on a burner full of coffee all day, cooking and getting stronger and less tasteful. And we LOVE it - it makes a great cup of coffee (what's up with all the reviews that say it's not strong enough?) and we can offer clients hot chocolate or flavored coffees, which is a great feature. So, if you've read a negative review, I'm saying they're wrong. I'm a coffee lover, and I love this coffee maker. I'm online right now because I'm buying one for a gift for a co-worker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Coffee too weak","review":"I received this item as a gift, and where I love my friend who gave it to me, I am not fond of this machine. The only problem with it is the watery, weak coffee it brews. I have tried everything from changing coffee brands to varying fill levels of the K-cups and nothing works.

Quick, quiet, amazingly easy to use and a snap to clean. Even allows use of your own ground coffee blends (with separate Ecobrew mesh cup ~ about $12.). Many Keurig models now have tabs so you can't use the mesh cup. My tall commuter mug fits this machine - read that some models don't. Read reviewers who complain that K machines make weak coffee, and thus buy strong \\"Jet Fuel\\" bold roasts. Dunno 'bout them, but I love the \\"Donut House\\" blend. Tastes remarkably like Dunkin Donuts, and plenty strong enough with out bitterness. Paid $90 with free shipping from Amazon. Couldn't be happier!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very upset","review":"Got the first one. It stopped working. We Sent it back to amazon and they sent a new one. This one acted the same as the last one.

They told me to throw out the machine because they can't do anything with it. This new one lasted a month. THen the same thing. Called again. Once again sent one and returned the k cup.

I typically use the \\"My K-Cup\\" and use local coffee. The results are about on par with my french press, actually. My wife only drinks decaf so she uses the disposable K-Cups. On an average day, we brew only two cups total.The problem is, I've replaced my Keurig B-40 a total of THREE times during the warranty period for a failure to prime (essentially, priming is the process of pumping water from the reservoir to be heated and brewed with). Customer service was great and sent me a replacement promptly each time. However, it just shows that the Kuerig is a shoddy product! I'm now out of the one-year warranty period and my FOURTH Keurig is having the same issue. I'm not calling customer service and am just going to trash the brewer. I just ordered an Aeropress for my single cup coffee and expect to be much happier - there's not nearly as many things to go wrong!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Coffee Great, but Machine un-Reliable","review":"I did not purchase the B40 from Amazon; I got it as a Christmas present. However I do buy a lot from Amazon, & feel this is the best place add my review.The coffee is great! I love the convenience of the k-cups, and the price per cup isn't bad (around 0.50 cents a cup average - sometimes you can get deals that get you in the 40 cents a cup range). I also enjoy the tea items, such as the half lemonade, half tea Celestial Seasonings selection. It's just a fun thing to have.The reason for my 2 star review is I had to return the machine because it no longer works after 2 months of usage. I thought maybe I just got a lemon, but a friend is also returning her B40 for the same reason. This makes me wonder if there are some unreliable parts in this machine.If this were just a $20 coffee maker, I wouldn't expect much. But for over $100, my expectations are much higher. I'm going to go back to my old coffee maker, which has served me well for a number of years. Too bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love that first cup of Coffee from the pot?","review":"I don't know about you, but I think there is nothing better than that first cup of coffee right after it's brewed. Well, you get that with the Keurig-every cup-no old coffee. I have the B-40 machine and I use the K-cups with it. I drink tea occasionally, so it works well for that too by just running the hot water and throwing a tea bag in your cup. The K-cups come with tea too and it is pretty easy to use as well. Some companies make apple cider and cocoa as well.What I really like about this, is when you are having a party, everyone can make the hot drink of their choice; coffee, decaf coffee, tea, cocoa etc. and all I have to do is make sure the water reservoir stays full. It holds enough for several cups, but with enough people, it does empty. It's easy to have a pitcher of water handy right beside it though to refill it.If you are thinking about getting this machine, do it.

The water usually will not pass through it and it will blow the k-cup holder open and water will flow around it and not even pass through the grinds, unless your grinds are very coarse.

While the fitting that comes with the brewer and holds the prepackaged K-cups snaps into place the My K-Cup accessory just sits there.

No hot water, no coffee.I am returning the brewer to Amazon for a refund. Having had good service from other Keurig models, I will probably order another, but certainly not another B40. Keurig brewers have been good, solid workhorse products in my household for years.

The instructions read: \\"To Clean Lid: Wipe With Damp Cloth, To Clean Reservoir: Dishwasher Safe\\". After a run through the dishwasher the reservoir is completely warped, melted, and useless. For the price Keurig asks for their products they should be much more aware of what the instructions, they permenently adhere to the product, will actually do.

When I explained it was a Christmas gift the tech flat out told me I was lieing and it showed purchased dec06-feb07 the next tech explained thats when it was manufactured.I now less than a year after receiving this have a semi working $150 coffee machine taking up spac on my counter.

From the rest of the reviews it looks like I got a random dud, but for the money one would think this kind of thing simply should not happen."},{"rating":"2","title":"A few days in, so far so good.","review":"I have had the B40 for several days now and am enjoying it so far. I have used it twice a day without any problems. It brews up a good cup of coffee and am still working on finding my favorite K-Cup. Enjoying the Extra Bold varieties in the 9.25oz setting. No issues with noise or any other complaints for that matter. Will update this review after I have more time using the B40."},{"rating":"2","title":"Second times a charm","review":"I bought my first Keurig and it didn't work right. It wouldn't prime, the lights never came on, ect. I returned it and replaced it with an identical model. I love it. It'w well worth the space on my counter. I bought a pack of K-Cup lids, so now I can can heat hot water in it. I'm glad I didn't give up after the first problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great gift","review":"I bought this product as a birthday gift for my wife. She loves it and has absolutely no problems with it. I love the idea of the Keurig brewing system even though i am not an avid coffee drinker. This product works great since it lets my wife have exactly the amount of coffee she wants without having to clean an entire coffee maker. Plus grounds/water ratios are fixed by the machine so the quality control is great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keurig Elite","review":"I hd the Mini first, & now this one I heard it was excellent, & finally I gv in to buy the Elite. Im glad I did! The Mini is only for reg. cups the Elite is for the bigger cups as well & now w/ the cold weather I hv hot cocoa in the travel mugs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Took it back","review":"Purchased model B40 because it was smaller and would take less counter space and from what we could tell, the quality of coffee from the various Keurig machines would be the same. Went through the initial setup without problem and the 1st cup of coffee came out without a hitch. Next morning, even though the B40 was set for the larger brew, only 1/2 cup came out. Extra water was in the drip tray but but the cup was centered and there was no indication the water missed the cup. Next cup, same problem. 3rd cup worked OK. Later that morning my wife had the exact same problem so back to the store the unit went. Bed Bath & Beyond was great with the return so we stepped up to the Platinum B70 model and two days later, just great coffee and tea without problems. Also bought theK-cup reusable coffee filter but haven't tried it yet. Will report back."},{"rating":"2","title":"great product","review":"if you enjoy a gooe a goood cup of coffee this is the machine ,,coffe a little pricee,but well worth it"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love my Keurig","review":"This product lives up to the hype, I love that my coffee tastes fresh every time. My only complaint is that grocery stores have such little supply of K cups. Of course Amazon does have an amazing selection, but for a quick selection Bed, Bath and Beyond has 18 K cup pkgs. I don't have this exact model but try it you will like it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Enjoy It While It Lasts","review":"I was completely fooled into thinking this was the best coffee maker I'd ever had. I admit that for a while, it was. \\"A while\\" being the key words. A coffee maker that costs over a hundred dollars should last a lot more than a year. But after a year, this thing started getting really unreliable. By a year a half, it was just dead. All just in time for the warranty to end, naturally. I don't think coffee makers should be considered disposable. I've had cheap coffee machines last a decade. It's not asking too much that a pricey one last at least half as long as my $10 one.So, in the short term, enjoy your quick, convenient one-cup brewing. But don't expect the honeymoon to last."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good product","review":"Please pay attention to the reviews here where people are reviewing after using the product for a while. I have had this Keurig since December 2011. At first it was really nice. The main reason I bought it was to offer coffee choices to people visiting us. Within 1 month of using it fairly regularly, it developed problems with the brew cycle, not filling the cups. Sometimes it would work for 1 cup, then flash multiple lights. I tried the descale procedure and it would work for a couple weeks, then start acting up again. Sometimes it will brew 1 cup fine, then not brew at all after that. Usually I could unplug it for 20 seconds, then plug in again and brew a cup. But now that's not working either. It's frustrating because they seem to work long enough to not be able to take it back to the store. Then you're left with shipping it in for service. I just feel I'm out the $125. Because of all the hassle, I don't recommend this product for anybody. Just get a regular coffee machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't last","review":"The B40 worked well for a little over a year. The brewer produced a good cup of coffee, and since our water is good quality, we had no scale issues. The electronics completely quit-no lights sounds, nothing when plugged into a known good outlet. I took the cover off to check for a fuse, but there are none. No servicable power management components is a cheap shortcut that should not be taken on a $120 coffee maker. Shame on Keurig, I'm done with you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kuerig just stops working!","review":"I received my Keurig in December 2009 . After 6 months it stopped working and said descale...(i used spring water and town water) I descaled with viniger which was quite a process....then 6 months later it just stopped again....descaled again and now 6 months later it will not work again! For the price of this coffemaker I would assume it to work a little longer and better than this . If your coffee maker starts making little 1/2 cups or no coffee at all...you can be assured it is on its way out. wOULD NOT RECCOMEND"},{"rating":"1","title":"They need a competitor","review":"As I read the latest reviews, I find myself in the same boat as many others. This product worked beautifully for 9 months then died. I believe its the water pump, as others have said. By now Keurig surely knows the problem and still sells it without remorse. If they had a competitor with a comparable product they would correct the problem immediately. They have no pride in what they do. Don't buy this product, there's a good chance it will stop working in less than a year. Now what do I do with all of the Krupp cups I have? Amazon should not disgrace itself by selling this faulty item."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Complaints","review":"I've had the B40 for almost a year, and it continues to make great coffee, tea, and wonderful Hot Cocoa. I think it's funny that they call it Hot Cocoa. It's usually either Hot Chocolate or Cocoa. Anyway, I have no complaints at all.Yes, it does make some noise and vibrate, but it's nothing to be concerned about. I'm surprised some people found that objectionable. it's just the sound of the pump sending the water from here to there.I also bought the little cup that you can fill yourself with whatever coffee or tea you want. That works fine, too.You see these things in all sorts of public places, from supermarkets to doctor's offices. That's what made me decide to get one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reliable great tasting cup of coffee","review":"Keurig has managed to maintain quality and provide a consistently great cup of coffee. This coffee maker is great for the single person, or when hosting a couple friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great gift","review":"Got this for my husband. Makes great coffee. Lives up to reputation. Does make a weird noise when starting up but that's the only downside and it's minor."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY","review":"I have purchased several Keurig systems through the years. After only a short while the system starts producing a half a cup of coffee. If you call customer service they will instruct you to do several things to try to correct the issue. Never happens. They have sent me two replacement units and to no avail within a few months...same thing. I currently own two systems and intend on disposing of both and buying another brand! I do believe Keurig has some issues that they are not telling!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Senseo is much better","review":"Imus was touting this coffee maker so I bought one. Thanks a bunch Imus! I also have a Senseo which I highly recommend. If you like great coffee get the Senseo, it's half the price of the Keurig. Get the Keurig if you want to pay a lot for a coffee maker that also makes weak ordinary but expensive coffee and tea. I only use this disaster when I fill the (optional for $15 more dollars) coffee holder screen thingy with my own coffee."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Simone Signoret finest films.","review":"This has a great story and Simone Signoret is wonderful as the unfaithful wife. I had seen at at the French Institute many years ago and I was delighted to rediscover it and see it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Razor Sharp? more like a butter knife!","review":"I bought this because, as an engineer with a background in Safety, I thought the guard is exceptionally well designed. I tried the straight slicer, two of the juilenne blades and the serrated blade. I found them all so dull that they tore rather than cut the food. The cabbage in my coleslaw, well, I ended up cutting about half of it with a knife. I tried peppers, onions and celery, all of which looked chewed rather than sliced. The celery was really rough looking, strings hanging out all over the place. When I tried to slice sweet potatoes into rounds, they cut part way and broke off the rest. I tried all of the above both with and without the guard.My fingers are intact, but I wrenched my back from all the effort that I had to use to get the food to slice, if you can actually call it slicing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as I expected","review":"I was not impressed with this slicer at all!! The blades seemed very dull. It mangled an onion rather than dice it and the only way I could get a tomato sliced was to wiggle it back and forth over the blade without the guard. The guard is very cumbersome to use and would not work if you wanted long slices of things like zucchini. Needless to say, I will be looking for another slicer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junque","review":"I agree with all the other poor reviews, for the same reasons. It just doesn't do a very good job of slicing, dicing, grating; whatever this thing was designed to do, it doesn't do it very well. Bad toad, Jaccard!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cuts like a hammer","review":"There's no nice way to say it, the blades are dull. Seems nicely constructed, but the knives just aren't sharp. Very difficult to cut with and makes poor, ragged slices. Wasted money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid!","review":"Received as a gift and only recently taken out of the box. My bad, it's so awful I would return it if I could, and I absolutely hate returning items. Blades are not very sharp, food gets caught on lower part of mandoline below the blade insertion point, and the angled blade cuts unevenly. Not to mention the food guard is unwieldly and impossible to use. It's faster, easier, and cleaner to use a knife, so why bother? Stick to better-reviewed products and avoid this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jaccard ABS Mandoline","review":"The Jaccard Mandoline is nothing but a worthless piece of junk. It can'tslice tomatoes even with the so called tomato blade, potatoes and applesare to hard for the blade.Don't worry about cutting yourself, I doubt it could even do that!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Product in picture you showed is stainless steel but I received a black plastic one !","review":"Product I ordered was diferent than the one I received.

At this point, I don't care if the book is any good or not -- your overkill has cost you a sale."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOO MUCH ADVICE NOT RELATED TO THE FACE","review":"I too bought Natural Facelift based on all the positive reviews here. The book is extremely difficult to follow as one has to sift through so much bable to get to the exercises. The photos and instructions are inadequate to say the least. Ms. Kando also gives some unqualified and very bizaare advice for self dental treatment! This book is worthless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth Your Money","review":"I also am wondering if all the positive reviews are legitimate. I went to the bookstore to check it out & found the book to be fairly useless. Lots of text & needless exercises for the body. The few exercises listed for the face had unclear photos that are not very helpful. I say save your money or you might be very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"very helpful","review":"Yes! At last a book that makes some sense. The author is right in saying that you can't hang a beautiful picture on a decaying wall and gives some valuable advice on posture before introducing the facial exercises. I found that the exercises made a lot of sense and were well explained and illustrated and easy to follow. My friends have said that I look better since I have been doing them. It's certainly cheaper and healthier than facila surgery and the results are more natural."},{"rating":"2","title":"what a discovery!","review":"Now that I have been doing my facial exercises regularly for three months I have lost my double chin, my eye bags and the droopy lines at the mouth corners. People have remarked on how well I look. All that made me feel happy and much more confident than I used to be. Once I got interested in the subject I looked at other books on the subject but none of them could match Juliette Kando's common sense and wholistic approach. So, if you are worried about your age, get Juliette Kando's NATURAL FACELIFT it's definitely the best facial exercise book on the market and I want to strongly recomend it to anyone, male or female who is worried about losing their looks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A worthwhile pan","review":"When I received this pan as a gift, I thought I'd never use it and it would just waste space in my cabinet. But I really like it and use it regularly. The non-stick cups are not very non-stick and need a coating of spray oil so that the egg comes out easily, but I don't think that's much of a problem (and it looks like it's common for egg poachers). The bottom pan is heavy metal and can be used as a regular small saucepan."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT!","review":"This is a fun, cute and effective sunsuit.

I highly recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"not pleased.","review":"Against my better judgement I recently purchased 2 video now colors. This toy is not something I wanted to buy due to the limited amt. of disc to view. I pictured the toy collecting dust soon after the puchase. My daughter played with the toy on the first day, shortly after the screen went black! I changed the batteries and within a couple of minutes it happened again. My child is disappointed and I have to buy this toy reluctantly, again! This time I will keep the package it comes in. Don't buy until they improve the hardware. I gave it 2 stars due to the fact that one out if the two do work, for right now."},{"rating":"2","title":"my son loves this...","review":"I bought my son(who is 5) a VideoNow and my daughter(who is 2) a VideoNow Jr. for Christmas.

It is now Februray and I replaced each of their batteries only once and there are days they don't use it and other days its on for an hour or more. Also they can watch each others dics which is great. Did I mention I bought the Video Jr. on clearance at Target for $8.66 and the Video now at Toys R Us for $12.50!!!!!!!!!!!!!

It was the last one and the spongebob theme, he was very excited to see what it was. Well, after 3 battery changes and even plugging into a wall adapter, there is still no screen, at all, not even a blue screen. The sound works, but unfortunately, that failed to hold my son's attention for even a minute. I can't exchange it for another, because as I said it was the last one, so I'll be returning it, and debating whether I should invest the money for a game boy advance. I just wish it had worked even for a little bit, it was heartbreaking to see the look on my son's face when there was no picture. What a piece of crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be ready to buy stock in batteries","review":"We bought two video now Colors, and a video Now Jr. for our kids, thinking it would be fun for the car. However with standard batteries not one of them lasts for more than 5 minutes. I spent money on the more expensive (M3) batteries, and they seem to last longer. However at $9 a pack that seems a bit pricey, even the rechargables don't hold up well in the players."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good toy even though Screen went blank (after 4 yrs)","review":"I purchased this toy for my daughter and her friend 4 years ago when they both were three. I have never had a problem until today. The screen went blank and now I am on a quest to locate a new one. At first it was hard to find discs that my daughter would be interested in so I went on the internet and purchased from Walmart and Target and a few other sites. Now, there are discs EVERYWHERE, but even if you cannot locate, you can still order via the internet. Just type in VIDEO NOW DISCS in any search engine and you should get good results. My daughter loves this \\"toy\\" and I would highly recommend. I am giving it 4 stars because of the screen, otherwise it would be 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS TOY IS YOUR FUTURE CHILDHOOD MEMORIES","review":"This is a great toy. It is very durable and is a great portable device. I don't have one YET but I have used my cousins. The only bad thing about this is that you can't control how fast the rewinding is. But that dosn't really matter because you are going to want to see the whole thing. I really want my parents to get this for me and I bet you or your kids do to.

Yes I said it. With Jeanette's bootcamp you receive an HOUR workout and it is intense. It is non-stop cardio! It also features a variety of moves and really gets your heart rate high. The weight section is equally as nice. Not the few reps Jillian does. You will see results if you use the correct amount of weights. I like all of her DVD's because you get a good cardio workout and weight workout instead of the cardio and weights put together in a less than 20 minute program. Also try the bikini beach body and blast the belly fat workouts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Half Cardio. Half Strength. All Good!","review":"I am a fan of JJ's workouts (she's second to Jillian Michaels IMHO) so I was excited to cop this DVD. It's a total of 60 minutes in length. The first 30 minutes are pure cardio in boot camp style. It's intense and is a good workout for a low-intermediate and up fitness level. The final 30 minutes is all strength - I used 5 lbs. weights.Very straightforward workout that you can alternate on busy days (30 mins of cardio on Mondays & Weds; 30 mins of strength on Tues & Thurs). If you really want a challenge, do all 60 minutes. Either way, JJ is going to work you out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great book","review":"I think this book was a truley great and wonderful book. i love how it enhances the 1800's.

If you like the Deep Purple, the Moody/Mardsen or the Sykes/Vandemberg/Vai recordings you'll have plenty of great material in this CD.There's also the plus of the new material, that mixes the good old voice of Mr Coverdale (including it's famous \\"ouh ouh ouh\\" of \\"Kittens got claws\\") with great riffs performed by Aldrich and Reb \\"The lord of the strings\\" Beach. Although you can't categorize the new songs as \\"cutting edge\\" rock (thinking of Dream Theater)you will find power and comitment in each note.The snake is rockin' hard again: \\"If you want me\\" remembers me that we need the good old voices return and redeem its place in the music business.

I think the subject matter is interesting, however, it might be more suitable for a magazine article. This book was much too much like reading a textbook, and I several times I had to reread paragraphs hoping to get more meaning from them. I could not make it through the whole book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting but Incomplete","review":"This book was a very interesting read with a disappointing conclusion. Conley presents convincing evidence for which siblings succeed and why, but lacks an effective ending making the book feel incomplete. It is as if the author is afraid to make a solid statement about what his findings mean. Still, there is a lot of good information here and I would recommend it to anyone interested in this topic with the understanding that it isn't particularly well written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time","review":"I had high hopes for this book, but it was a terrible disappointment. The author rambles on and on, citing different studies that do no more than state the obvious. I mean, everyone knows that children of parents with more resources have a better chance of success than children of parents that are struggling. I didn't need a book to point that one out. I really learned nothing new from this book, except that perhaps the author wanted to whine about his own childhood, especially in the last chapter."},{"rating":"1","title":"O Brother!","review":"Better than many \\"birth-order\\" books -- Conley doesn't claim to explain everything. But he still has a case to present, and this is a botched job.The writing style will change twice within a single paragraph, from professional to personal, and back again. Anecdotal in the extreme, but the author cherry-picks statistics and selected studies when it suits his purpose (divorce is bad, but, hey, it can be great for some kids, maybe mine).And in the rather absurd Marxist economic outlook, an anti-religion bent, a freeze-dried hippie longing for the 1960s, a surprising lack of focus on child gender, some easily discovered factual errors (Bill Clinton WAS NOT 12 when he met JFK), and the result reminds you of a rather longihs article in a supermarket checkout rack magazine."},{"rating":"2","title":"a good toy","review":"this toy is really nice. it comes with...a suitcase, a purse, a brush and a flower in her hair. i like this doll from the jammin in jamaica line, because she is really pretty. i am going to tell you more about her...she has green eyeshadow, blonde hair, and dark lipstick. she is very pretty. she also comes with a movie called jammin in jamaica. it was an ok movie. i hope this review was helpful."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice!!!","review":"this toy is really cool. i rated it a 4 for fun because youreally have to have more my scene dolls to play with it. imostly have bratz and they are much shorter!!! i do have somemy-scenes though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"I bought this toy hoping it would fully please my daughter, and it did!

Mattel actually says that this is appropriate for ages 5 and up. Hmmmm, then why do the characters refer to being band groupies and look like a bunch of ridiculous club-rats on ecstasy? The age-inappropriateness of this product boggles the mind. It's Barbie, but she's a spoiled, lusty brat yearning for the love of a goateed rock punk. REAL NICE FOR KIDS!

YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO PUT IT DOWN!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Perfect Overveiw","review":"For me the Great War has always been a bit of a fog. The war was like one big gap in my knowledge of history. I looked at several books on the war but, in particular, I wanted to be able to have just one for my library that gave a balanced overview. I'm so glad I got G.J. Meyer's facinating \\" A World Undone\\". Meyer understands the general ignorance that is bred in most U.S. schools concerning the backdrop and causes of the war and covers them quite well. The book is supremely readable and peppered with facinating accounts from all the many corners of Europe ravaged in the war. The reader gets a great introduction to the many empires and characters from the war and can choose to go on to more specific aspects in other works having laid down a firm foundation. Well done."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Nearly Perfect Foundation for the WWI Enthusiast","review":"I've been a WW2 buff forever, but there was always a huge hole in my knowledge of WW1 (The Great War). This book achieves its purpose, which is to give a detailed yet not exhaustive account of the war, its background, and its repercussions. A perfect tome for someone who wants an introductory history of the conflict. Meyer does a great job of describing the war as a sequential series of events, and smartly adds \\"Background\\" chapters before and after important milestones to further establish context. After reading, it is apparent that WW1 and WW2 were really one single conflict separated by a generation-long period of \\"peace\\" - contextually, it is impossible to separate the two. If I had to pick a single event that ushered in the \\"modern\\" world, it would have to be The Great War. All existing geopolitics evolved from it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A World Undone: The Story of the Great War, 1914 to 1918","review":"I never knew a lot about WWI and frankly never was very interested in it. I always focused on the Civil War or WWII. I ordered this book after seeing some shows on TV over the past few years and becoming more interested in this period of history. I have NOT been disappointed! It is written so well, I can hardly put it down. I am still reading it. It is really saying something about a book if I sit reading it at night instead of watching TV! Love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I found this book to be an excellent detailed overview of the entire war. The detailed background information on all the countries involved and their respective rulers and all the various generals was very thorough. This was my first read about WW1 and it was very thorough and easy to read. Once I started I could not put it down. Would highly recommend to anyone who wants to learn ALL about WW1."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"The book is perfectly written, fast paced and intriguing, The author takes into account that most of today's readers have little deep historical background of that period. The book interlaces every chapter with a \\"background\\" chapter. The book contains a wealth of information. I think that it's reading is essential to understand how world wars can happen, and how it set the stage for the wholesale slaughter and strange political alignments in the greatest calamity in recorded history...WW2. If you think about the subject more deeply, you can already see many possible worst case scenarios that could easily lead to WW3."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book on WW1","review":"I generally read historical fiction or historical books. I have read a number of books on World War one and \\"The World Undone\\" is a very good one especially if you are looking for a book that has enough detail to satisfy an urge to learn about the topic without getting bogged down. The book is well written, easy to read and with very useful backgroud chapters on such things as the Hapsburgs, the Ottoman empire and so forth. These background chapters were well placed, provided context that was relevant and made the book that much more enjoyable. I would recommend the book to anyone interested in this topic or in history in general."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many cliches","review":"I have read numerous books on the Great War and I found this book used too many of the cliches of 1960's Great War historians. The whole \\"lions led by donkeys\\" issue is played up way too much. (attributing the quote to Ludendorff when most historians now figure it was just made up) For example Meyer on several occasions blast generals for pushing on despite losses and then sites other examples of the donkey generals giving up just when victory was at hand. You can't have it both ways. A good overview of the war but it seems to have not relied sufficiently enough on more recent historical analysis of the war."},{"rating":"2","title":"FANTASTIC!!!","review":"If only every history book was written by G.J. Meyer! 'A World Undone' is a fantastic read; I could not have imagined a single book could paint such a thorough picture of the Great War. I could not put this book down.I have read other volumes, including 'The First World War', 'The Guns of August', even 'World War One For Dummies'! But this is the absolute best of the lot, providing background history on the major players and combatants, and numerous glimpses into the personal lives of the leaders and soldiers of the day. It is these 'background essays' that make this history so much more enjoyable, so much more readable, that I was very disappointed when I came to the end. Most history books leave you needing a break, but 'A World Undone' left me wishing for a second volume."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book Literally fell apart","review":"While this is a good history of the First World War, the manufacture of is the worst possible. It literally fell apart as I was reading it. I had to read most of the book out of sections that fell out of the binding. The only sections still in the book were ones I glued in myself after they fell out. It is currently in nine parts. I considered sending it back, but that was way too much hassle. It is much easier for me to hold hard feelings than go through the trouble of sending it back, explaining when I bought it, trying to find proof of purchase, etc. If you really want the history buy the book, but don't expect it to be an easy read because you will have to fight the book falling apart while trying to read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book fell apart","review":"My husband began reading this book immediately when it arrived. He got a lot of enjoyment from it and from his reaction, I would give it 4 stars. However, halfway through the book, the entire second half came unglued from the spine from normal reading and not from abuse. Now, the pages are falling out.

Knew little details of \\"The Great war\\" and was looking for an overview without being bogged down in too many details.

I will look for other books by this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Saw the WWI museum in KC and wanted to know more...","review":"Recently visited the WWI museum in Kansas City (awesome), and wanted to know more about WWI.

I would recommend this book (and the museum!) to anyone wanting to know more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read","review":"A well written and researched book. Captures the futility of the Great War. Pre industrial governments both republic and monarchies had no idea of the devastation that industrialized war would bring, and its lasting impact which would not be played out until the end of the second world war."},{"rating":"2","title":"The World War I book I have been waiting for. 5 stars.","review":"This book is an in depth and entertaining examination of World War I, its causes, the nations and personalities involved. The background of the nations and personalities really gave me an insight that I had not had before nor read in other books on the subject. I also felt that the author made an effort to be as unbiased as possible.I had no idea that heirs to the Ottoman throne were kept imprisoned and terribly treated until crowned. Or that one of the greatest French socialists and great hope for peace was assassinated right before the hostilities started. Or that the English were more concerned about Ireland and the war came as almost a surprise to its citizens. and so on.The reader of this audio cd was also superb. An audio book can be ruined by a poor reader, this book benefits from its reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"By an American, for Americans","review":"This is a good introduction to folks with out much background on the war. It is written by an American and seems to be pointed at that audience. The author makes a great effort to provide comprehensive backgrounds about many aspects of the war, it's participants, and European history in general that most American's would not otherwise know.The book is not particularly scholarly though. There are realitvy few annotations. The author often presents an individual General's thoughts, motivation and philosophy without much supporting information. It would be nice if the author referenced letters, quotes or other documentation that support his suppositions. Otherwise, I don't know if this is conjecture or established fact. I knock a start off for this reason."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb introduction to WW1","review":"I have always been interested in the history of WW2 as a way to understand the world as it is today but eventually came to the conclusion that I had to go back in time in order to better appreciate the causes of WW2 and this meant to learn more about WW1.Sadly, WW1 is not as fancy as WW2 as it is almost a century old but \\"A World Undone\\" makes a great job in explaining the social and political situation of the world at that time. Combine this with a wonderful narrative style and you have a superb book on the subject.Get yourself this book and you will enjoy it as much as a very well written novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great quality","review":"The book is as stated in the description.

But when I got ready to buy it, the Kindle version is $1.71 MORE than the paperback! That is beyond absurd! I refuse to reward a publisher who penalizes me for ordering a digital (much cheaper for them to produce and distribute) version of their book. I already have Amazon Prime so why would I not buy the paperback?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Breadth, Decent Depth","review":"What I like about this book are the sections between each chapter that give more background on a specific person, event or situation that is relevant to what you just read in the previous chapter or are about to read in the next. It helps the reader understand more of the background behind many of the events during WWI. The book does a good job of covering the \\"less\\" popular fronts, especially the actions involving the armies of Austria-Hungarian empire.The details are deep enough to give the reader a good understanding without getting lost. Overall, I enjoyed reading this book. It is one of the better \\"global\\" overview books on WWI I have read. The insight into the politically focused activities in the various capitals of the primary players in the conflict was an unexpected element of the book. In particular, the back room dealings of the diplomats and government agents in the weeks leading up to August 1st, 1914 are uniquely brought to life in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two for the price of One.","review":"Both of the two short novels in this collection explore the gay male Ds erotic universe.

The characters are shallow/flat, and not nearly as well drawn as they could be. On the upside, the frozen moments of shock are well done, and the character of Patty herself has a lot of humor built into her at first.

Stay away from this its cheap for a reason."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor manufactuing and phone call quality","review":"I returned mine within minutes of opening them. The quality of the manufacturing was terrible. The buttons (volume and call) would stay depressed when you pushed them. They didn't click back up as they should. The headphones paired easily enough and the stereo sound quality was pretty good (not really loud enough to suit me though). However, when I made a call, the person said that they could barely hear me.Here are the cons in a nutshell:1. Poor manufacturing quality - buttons stick when pressed2. Terrible microphone quality for handsfree3. Poor battery life (4 hrs)4. Can't navigate songs (forward or back) using headset.If you want a cheap bluetooth headset, the logitech ones are awesome. They made a set that breaks pretty easily, but you can repair it with some superglue and nylon ribbon. They don't have a handsfree feature though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work with my Motorola Q or my wife's Chocolate","review":"Actually, it sort of worked with each. With my Q it would pair up fine and work great (sound quality is beyon my expectations). However, the first time you turned off the headsets you would turn them back on and instead of pairing back up with the phone it would just keep flashing, as if it was in find mode instead of pairing up. To get it to pair again I had to delete the profile from the phone and restart it.O.K., the Q has been finicky from the beginning, perhaps it wasn't the Jensen's fault. So I paired it to my wife's LG 8500 Chocolate phone. The audio from the phone came in great (clicks as you touched the controls, etc.) However, when you went to play music the volume control on the phone was stuck at 0 and wouldn't increase no matter what you do.It's a shame, because I was really looking forward to using this set. I'm sending it back and getting some headphones with good old fashioned copper wires."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak microphone, uncomfortable","review":"I bought Jensen headphones mainly because of its ability to automatically switch from my stereo source to my cell phone when a call comes in. While it does offer relatively good stereo sound quality while listening to music, the voice microphone quality is terrible, making the headset useless for phone calls. On top of that, I find the plastic part that goes around the ears to be too hard, and starts to hurt the back of my ears after 30-40 minutes of use. I see other reviews saying the headphones are quite comfortable, so maybe I've just got the wrong size ears. Anyway, I'm very disappointed with these headphones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works, just not very good","review":"This headset can be good If you only plan on using it a few hours at a time. Don't think you will be able to sit at work with these on all day, you will be lucky to get more than 3 hours. The USB charging cable that comes with it is fairly short, so you can't use them plugged in while charging unless your head is within a foot or so from the USB port. I use these with my Cingular 8525. I have not been able to connect them to my laptop to listen to music. I do find them comfortable, and they fold nicely into the carrying bag they come with. They do however take a while to connect to my phone, and will not connect if a song is already playing out loud. I will be looking for a better pair of headphones, this is a case of you get what you pay for."},{"rating":"1","title":"its missing something...","review":"If your device is not bluetooth enabled, then this package wont work for you. I thought that it would come with some sort of adapter for my MP3 player, but it didnt, it was just the headphones and the chargers...so If you really want these headphones, then you need to buy the extra adapter, which costs about 30 bucks...I can't say much about the sound quality, because I havent used them, but overall they look pretty cool, and they grip onto your head, so you can move around a lot without them falling off."},{"rating":"1","title":"A useless Blue tooth-ache!","review":"A very attractive price for stereo blue-tooth, but the device now sits an a junk drawer. I tried the headset with a T-Mobile Dash and Nokia 6030. Neither phone recognized the Headphone mode, so it can't be used for music and video. It does work in phone-only mode, however, callers complained that they could not hear me very well; the common description was that I sounded faint and far away.

I worked out in the gym with the headset with both weights and running and they remained secure on my head. The sound was good, not outstanding and the music did cut off at irregular intervals that were minutes apart for about a .5 seconds, this did not bother me esp. for the price (I paid a flat 28 bucks). You can't go wrong with this purchase at 28 bucks.

If not, this is not worth 5 dollars. The reception was horrible, very staticky and did not get very loud without sounding like a weak radio signal. Also, the headphones would connect and disconnect every 15 minutes or so from my computer, and took about 5 more to recconect. I would look into buying a higher priced bluetooth headphone set, its worth having something that works well for a more expensive price than a cheap one that will most likely have you back to using your old headphones instead, due to the poor quality.

I am 61 yr old and take three Hatha yoga classes per week: I am not new to yoga. I found her instructions often hard to hear (mumbling, eating her words) with little attention to modifications. Aside from her suggesting that you take a deep breath, there was little attention to the role of the breath in relation to the movement. I felt she was too relaxed/casual in her manner: assuming that the audience was actually using proper alignment with few cues regarding possible tricks to prevent common position errors. Savasana was very brief. I gave this DVD to my daughter who is a Certified Yoga Instructor.

She's very down to earth and makes yoga available for everyone, never using any sanskrit words or making it seem more complicated than it actually is. On her youtube, you can see all different sorts of videos, from ones with more challenging poses and ones for beginners.This DVD has a lot of forward folds and downward dogs, which is very nice. However, based on some of her other videos, I expected a bit more difficulty. I realize this is a video for everyone, but I would have preferred some more advanced moves. If you're just starting out with yoga, Tara is and AWESOME instructor and this is a great beginning. However, it can be boring if you're doing it for more of a workout than a relaxation practice.

I add, it's not for the average mature person wanting to begin or start over a yoga practice...it's a DVD for a young athlete, not older adults, even those of us who can double the session of her two dvds, Prime time's Walkout and Fitness and still have energy for yoga.

It was so filled with \\"if you're part of my club and have studied my lessons, you'll understand my cryptic commentary.\\" I'm all for different viewpoints, but you really serve no purpose with the \\" I know something you don't\\" mentality. A commentary should serve to clarify a difficult work for the novice reader, not make it more confusing and stroke your already puffed up ego.

In fact if one has reached the level of understanding the Pistis Sophia, they would NOT be posting Comments or Reviews.A beautifully written book and I could only understand bits and pieces.

As one of the previous reviewers has said, this tastes like hummus; no question. No eggplant flavor, tastes like hummus, out of the can. Even though the can says to add garlic, olive oil, and lemon to it, it still tastes like expensive hummus. I have made Baba Gannouche many times, from scratch.

I mixed in some olive oil, lemon juice, and garlic like the can says to do (if I only I would read directions first) and its really good. I agree from the other reviewer that the consisency is quite think like hummus, but it is not made out of chickpeas. It isn't the same as the babaganoush I get at restaurants, but it is still good for a can product. I'm a big fan of eggplant if made properly.

Wickman's research was padantic; obsessively detailed. However, there was no linear (or other) thinking involved in the final synthesis. In fact, having read the same research literature as Dr. Wickman had poured through, it is amazing to me that someone could write so many pages that are comprehensible only to people who have actually read the same research literature. Her writing evokes a rememberance of a criticism of Henry James (slightly reworded): \\"This author (not a writer) fills a much needed void.\\" Let us pray that the Seminole Tribe of Florida will soon experience a void that once was occupied by this author. Osceola was a great War Chief, and a very interesting individual.

I knew the price was too good to be true; and I'm not sending it back since when I got it from Amazon.com through Bargincell, it was .01 cents. Not worth the hassle or cost of mailing it back.In comparing it with the cable that came with the device (lazy me, wanted to be able to leave one at work and one at home so I didn't have to haul it back and forth all the time) I see that it seems to be missing a \\"connector\\" or whatever it is called.

It was a little tinnier than we expected, but very sharp looking. Unfortunately, unless you are going to keep your bread in a plastic bag, this was not designed to keep your bread fresh. The bread dries out very quickly,especially when you live in a very dry climate such as Arizona. It may work great in a higher humidity state? Or if you just want a place to put your bread out of the light and out of sight, bag your bread to keep it fresh and this will do those two things -- but without the bread being bagged, do not expect it to stay fresh!

It's so poorly designed & constructed, I couldn't even put it together. Where the arms are supposed to join, you have to turn a thumscrew into the two halves of the join. But the wire going through the arms is too big to thread through the joints -- so you can't get the two halves to come together fully, thus the teeth don't mesh. And even if you can put it together, it's not fully adjustable like the description claims. When you assemble the arms, you have to essentially lock them into place -- the only way to adjust them is to un-clamp them and re-assemble them, which is totally impractical and inconvenient.

Going over short distances (10 feet) indoors, I noticed that measurements differed by 2 to 3 inches depending on whether I pushed the wheel forwards or flipped it over backwards and pulled the wheel. So I laid out a tape measure for 15 feet. Going forward for the precisely-measured 15 feet, the reading was 13 feet, 11 inches. Measuring the same distance using the other method, it came out to 14 feet, 2 inches. So it seems to be consistently off by 6 to 7 percent. For my purposes, this tool is pretty much worthless.Back in the day, the Stanley logo meant you purchased a well-made tool.

The second day I tried it, I put it in a different position and got the headache and a burning sensation in my eyes (which unfortunately lasted all day). I then read the manual and found the sentence \\"do not use if you have a mood disorder and are on medication\\" which I am. So the lamp was returned. I notice now that Amazon has a disclaimer on its products, but what good is that? That just means a lot more returns and inconveniences.

It's a very toxic, unpleasant smell that truly permeates our entire home. Even my husband commented on how hard it was to be in the same room with me while I had it on. I'm a bit squeamish now about sitting so close to it, plus it takes a good hour or two for the smell to fade. I'm bummed, because it seems to work well and do what it's supposed to!

It's especially great for us because we live in an apartment that gets virtually no sunlight thanks to the fantastic view of the 8 story building next to us. It think this was money well spent.As for the smell problem mentioned in an earlier review, I have a fairly sensitive nose (so much so that my constant complaints bug my wife) and have yet to notice anything.Word of caution: Take the manufacturer instructions seriously about how overuse can lead to irritability.

This collection is not a career retrospective as it just focuses on the period during which he recorded with Columbia but it was clearly a fertile period. Not all of the songs are equally great here but there isn't a weak song in the bunch. There's a couple of ballads (\\"After All This Time\\" and \\"Things I Wish I'd Said\\") that are among the most moving country songs you'll ever hear - without being maudlin, which is a big plus for country ballads. Among the more upbeat tracks, the two that kick off the CD (\\"Lovin' All Night\\" and \\"Even Cowgirls Get the Blues\\") are terrific.This collection is a bit thin at 12 tracks but then I'd rather have a tight collection of 12 excellent cuts than a 20 track CD padded with a number of mediocre songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"He's a gem","review":"I bought this cd after recently watching The Called Love with River Phoenix and Samantha Mathis from the early 90's.

You just can't go wrong!

Now I love history and read a lot of history books, unfortunately, this book was a big dissapointment. Contrary to the blurb on the back cover this book is hardly riveting nor is it much of a thriller. It only covers the last few years of Savonarola's life but it is more about the political history of Florence than on Savonarola himself. Actually the book does not really seem to have a direction or a point and I could not figure out why the author wrote this.I would suggest that if you are interested in this book that you find a copy in a book store and read it before you buy otherwise you risk being dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very helpful Dictionary for International Students","review":"I have studied English as Second Language for a long time.

At that time, I only depended on LongMan Dictionary. However, while writing my homework, I felt my dictionary was not enough to support my poor English skill.

While shorter and more focused, \\"The Awakening\\" remains an excellent survey of a crucial time period. Dangerfield shows the growth of both economic nationalism and democratic nationalism and how these conflicting forces undermined any hopes for an Era of Good Feelings in national politics.

This is a superb novel about the friendship of two men during the Depression. The men work as guards against union organizers at a Kentucky coal mine. Their dilemma is whether to turn away from the abuses of the coal miners or to join their struggle. In swiftly moving chapters that snowball into an unforgettable climax, Yount tells how the men are tested. You will be tested too.Hardcastle is a book that was meant to be talked about, and if you're in a reading group, it would be an excellent choice. I have not read a more human and moving novel in several years. And not only that: Yount's writing crackles and sings with local color, feel, and humor. A brilliant novel!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hardcastle, a superb novel","review":"John Yount is a former teacher of mine. Hardcastle is, in my opinion, his best work, a writer working at his peak. The story has an original southern voice, with unique language and not a wasted word. Few contemporary southern novels are written as well. Yount treats the subject matter of Hardcastle, coal miners, with great sensitivity and care; the characters are more real than most books you will ever pick up. Yount's other works include Wolf At The Door, The Trapper's Last Shot, Toots in Solitude, and Thief of Dreams.

Since I love anything involving haunted houses, I decided to make this my first venture into Bentley's world. I must say, I wasn't impressed with this book. I found it a bit boring, and for me, a struggle to get through. I was also a little disturbed with the sexual nature associated with the little girl in the book. I think the premise was great, but it got muddled along the way. Unfortunately, I've not had the inclination to pick up another Little book since this one, and have no immediate plans to give him another shot. My suggestion, if you're going to give Bentley a try, pick another book to start with!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nasty is right","review":"I chose this book as part of a reading assignment for my writing class. I wanted a good ghost story (which, honestly, I can find very few). Even so, when I set out to read a book, I always read all the way through expecting \\"the payoff\\" (sometimes it takes a little longer than other books). It just never came. In fact, I had more questions on finishing the story than I'd had beginning it. I also found the sexual scenes very offensive. I thought that carrying through to the end would give some insight as to why this child (demon, thing) was the way she was. For what reason was she trying to entice these people, men and women (I'd even understand it if, for instance, one of the characters did have the inclination to molest children -- sort of a downfall through temptation thing). It didn't make sense to make it such a dominant part of the story or so graphically written. I wanted a horror novel not kiddie porn."},{"rating":"1","title":"No real scares or plot at all","review":"Maybe I have read too many horror books to be scared of them any more, but The House had no real scares in it and even less of a plot. Throughout the story we learn to care for only one of the five strangers and wouldn't it be just like a book of this low caliber that the only character we care about is the only one that dies at the end??? Perhaps the most dissapointing aspect of this book is that it has more aspects of sex and pornography in it than horror, genuine scares and a real plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the WORST books i have ever read","review":"I've read several Bentley Little books although why, i'm not sure. I can't say for sure if this one or the one about the postman was worse, but either way, i have given up reading anything he writes. If i could rate this book with less than one star, i would. I picture the first seventy-five percent of this book written at his leisure, with very little interest other than for the money he would make when it got published. The last twenty-five percent of the book, the finale, seemed rushed and contrived, written in a flash because his dead line was quickly approaching. If a writer is going to write, he should have the decency to at least try his best.

(Of course, the good guys do this stuff too, so maybe Little is just an extremely sick person who wants to infect his readers with his peculiar brand of deviancy.)

To bad Mr Little couldn't convene terror without having to use a little girl as a sexual object.I put this book in the trash can. I usually pass them on to the library but hated the thought of someone else having to read this.After reading this I won't be running out finding anything else written by Mr. Little.Save your self the 0.1 this book is selling for, you will be much richer with the penny (trust me).

I read that book in record time! :) But, I have to say, that when the ending came, I felt total disappointment!! Like many others have said, it was like he ran out of steam when the ending came!I'm not saying that I won't read his other books because I plan to!

Actually, I had hardly even began when it turned into garbage. Little gives extremely graphic details about a woman & a young girl. The girl is not real, the book is not real, but it has been written down. Which means that Little had these kinds of thoughts in his head and he forces readers to read it. Not me, I do have morals & will not accept this book. I am very angry that there was no warning of the graphic detail. The book is being returned. How it even got published is beyond me. This book is for people without morals & would be enjoyed by those who like filth about young girls. Bentley Little is a disgrace."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse horror (?) story I ever read","review":"The book started very powerfully, but the second half is completely ridiculus - so ridiculus it's almost funny.

Bad!!","review":"This is my 4th Bentley Little book, and for the most part, I do enjoy him but this book just plain bad...The disgusting and quite unnecessary pedophilia scenes aside, this book had no beginning, middle, or really end for that matter. I was to attached to absolutley none of the characters, because we knew nothing about them. The story meandering here and there, and never really amounted to anything. It's like the book is a great outline, but that was it. Horribly underwritten to the point of laughable. Did Bentley write this in high school english class? It sure seems like it. Usually, I can blow off reading a bad book, but I was pretty disappointed I wasted my time on this. Avoid it even if you're a die-hard Little fan. It stinks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre at best","review":"I really wanted to like this book. When I saw a review by Stephen King claiming it to be frightening and impossible to put down, I ordered it. I found it to be neither. One problem I had with The House was that none of the characters seemed to be developed enough for me to really care about them. Maybe there were just too many \\"main characters.\\" I was also disappointed in the ending. The book started out great, with that scary prologue, but I kept waiting for that to tie in with the main part of the book. It never really did, at least not to my satisfaction. I wasn't scared at all by this book; I've read better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Twisted","review":"After reading three other Bentley Little books I thought I could stand a little more of his odd type of horror. Well, I was totally unprepared for The House. It was so graphically gruesome I am suprised I was able to finish. There were some parts where nothing made sense and then there were parts where you could not help but understand even if you didnt want too. More sick than scary. Not written for those with weak stomachs in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scary and original","review":"Haunted houses have to be the hoariest horror conventions in the world. But Bentley Little revitalizes the genre with this boundary-busting ferociously original novel. Warning: this is not for the faint-hearted. Lilly-livered readers who don't like hardcore sex and violence should stay away from this one. Readers with a pair should love it, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like a ghost train","review":"I got lost somewhere around page 120 and didn't find my way out again - and, to be frank, I didn't bother. The book is a veritable ghost train, with horror paraphernalia jumping at you from every corner, dark houses, mad butlers, walking dolls, evil children a.s.o. a.s.o., and the five characters and complicated plot disrupt the tension continuously. And there is a streak of sadistic pedophilia in the book that I disliked enormously. The only scene I really liked was the making of the doll which I found really frightening exactly because it was so plain and simple. But the rest ... no."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware.

Although I love reading to her, there isn't always time and the Story Reader comes in handy when I'm busy. It's also great for long trips in the car. My 2 1/2 year old just recently started to play with it as well. Although she doesn't always know which book goes with which cartridge, she enjoys it once we help her put the books and cartridges in. My only complaint is the cost of the books, which is why I gave it only 4 stars. I strongly recommend this toy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Toy","review":"We gave this toy to my 3-year old son for the holidays, and he absolutely LOVES it. He gets engrossed in the stories and will \\"read\\" them over and over for hours. We feel it is important to encourage our son to read, and this toy can read to him when we can't. The only reason I didn't give this toy five stars is because the spiral binding on the books bends easily, and they must be straight in order to fit properly in the Story Reader. If they don't fit properly, the story will not play. The spiral binding, however, can easily be bent back into place. Other than this one problem, the toy is terrific."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"I got this for my 3yr. old daughter for Christmas. It did not work right.

When my dog's antibiotics were changed for an ongoing ear infection, I looked them up here to understand the change.

There's also information on how to medicate your pet (easier said than done with a cat, in my experience) drug compounding, holistic practices, purchasing from online vet pharmacies, electrolytes, pet insurance, disaster planning, and first aid.

To read about her life as a newlywed who flew with her husband in the early days of aviation was enthralling, and to read of their problems being pursued and photographed reminded me of Princess Diana being hounded by the paparazzi. The Lindberghs were pioneers in aviation, and were public figures without wishing to be ... how sad that their first child was stolen and then found dead. I was moved to tears reading Anne's descriptions of her son while mourning him; I can't imagine living through such a horrible experience. Her writing is true and beautiful and honest ... a rare treasure."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Extraordinary Woman, An Extraordinary Book","review":"This is one of the most wonderful books I've ever read. Being only 23 years old the kidnapping of the Lindbergh baby was before my time however, this story is timeless. Beautifully written complete with diary entries and family pictures. This book is a true literary classic to be enjoyed by every generation. An honest journey into the heart of a young girl, wife and mother."},{"rating":"2","title":"They don't write them like this anymore","review":"Anne Morrow Lindbergh is one of the giants of literature. Few writers of the twentieth century reach the heights of this woman in the pure excellence of her penned words. Writing is an outer expression of inner thoughts and Anne Morrow Lindbergh excels at this skill. And of course we don't write letters anymore and that is to be regretted. To pick up this book and share with the author her innermost thoughts is to spend time with a good friend before a warm cozy fire. This book is highly recommended. You will not find the likes of it again anytime soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't know.","review":"Can't speak for her experience.

I was disappointed in the presentation since I was interested in reading about life after transplant. While Sylvia obviously has a spiritual practice, the book presents it as an odd ball set of values. We can't experience with her what she experienced, as we might with better writing.

Monster Blood IV is nothing but the worst traits of the series, lined up one after another (and occasionally simultaneously) in one-hundred-plus pages of middle fingers to the reading audience.

I try to read through even the Goosebumps books I'm not all that interested in; however, I just found myself skimming this book after the first ten pages. The characters are annoying and the story takes pages to describe the most pointless things, which drags out what should have been a pretty straightforward plot. Honestly, I couldn't believe how little happened over the 28 chapters. The plot isn't quite as recycled as the previous Monster Bloods, but it still failed to engage. This is the last book in the series and Goosebumps should have gone out with something higher quality than this snore-fest. I'd heard bad things about this book, but I still gave it a fair shot.

Main lamp quit working after 3 uses. The main lamp is powered by the internal battery only. It will not iuminate at allwhen plugged in and using DC power. It is 100% dependent on the internal battery which is charged by the DC battery pack but when the internal battery dies the battery pack is useless. The internal battery wasa proprietary to Vector and no one sells it! Shame on Black & Decker is right! They screwed poeple with a bad product and then screw um again by not selling parts for it.If they simply carried the internal battery which can be easily replaced the units would work.

Along with many other posters on here the main bulb doesn't work at all and the battery no longer holds a charge for more than about 45 seconds. I thought about replacing the battery but discovered all these terrible reviews during my research so I thought I would add my own. I've come to the conclusion that you're really better off buying NON rechargable devices for the most part. In order to lower the price on these things they seem to have to buld them SO poorly. I guess we can't expect much when we demand things to be cheap then complain when they break."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Shame","review":"I am a huge fan of the Arc The Lad series. I loved the collection and Twilight Of Spirits. After reading the stories about this game, I thought \\"Oh my god, Arc is being ressurected!\\" Unfortunately, NO ONE from any of the past games make a big influence in this \\"Story\\". Darc and Kharg are gone along with most of the awesome Deimos characters. The cast from 1,2 and 3 return in the form of cards that you battle with. I thought the story line was incredibly stupid. They try to bring back the idea of guilds and hunters from Arc The Lad 2 and 3. It wasn't surprising when the idea fell through. There is no real reason to continue playing after you finish the main storyline except to see Delma and Volk make a two-minute appearence. Even if you are a fan of the series like me, heed my advice and just play twilight of spirits or the collection again and steer clear of this one. For shame Namco, for shame"},{"rating":"2","title":"The most satisfying of the Bounty Hunter books","review":"Hard Merchandise : Star Wars: Book 3 of The Bounty Hunter Warsby K.W. Jeter continues the story of Boba Fett, Neelah and Dengar after the battle on Tatooine. This book had the most surprises and was really unique in both the style and tone. I really enjoyed reading it. Overall the only problem I really had with the series was the characterization of Dengar as a not so brutal bounty hunter, something that takes away a little from the character. Other than that I have to give Jeter high marks for effort. He took the most mysterious and one of the most cherished characters in the Star Wars universe and crafted a well-written tale that did not totally destroy the perception of that character. Well done Mr. Jeter."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Exceptional Look at the Shadowy Bounty Hunters","review":"Although many people find this book to be lacking greatly, I thought that it was quite detailed. All of the important bounty hunters are closely examined, including, of course, everyone's favorite, Boba Fett. I started reading this book first--hey, I didn't know it was a series--so I do not know anything about the first two, but oh well. The plot was perplexing enough. The characters were pretty cool, actually, like the leader of the Rebel Scavenger squadron that is staking out KDY, and the giant space spider thing that Boba Fett crashes Slave I into. Some of the action is detailed, too, like when Slave I is being blasted to bits. You can accurately visualize the ship disintegrating. Plus, it has Star Destroyers in it that get stolen by the Rebels, which is cool scene. Even if you haven't read the first two books, you should read this one, because it is one of the best Star Wars books I have ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"well... it was Boba Fett!","review":"I must admit, after having read the first part of this trilogy I was a little disappointed. Seemed lame, without a kind of structure or plot. There simply was no action in it and I had the impression that the whole story could as well be told in a few paragraphs. But reading on, I later changed my mind, because it came to really interest me. I wanted to learn more about the backround events. At least one was told lots about the functionig of kdy and all other organisations such as black sun. I was given a good introduction into the way economy and crime works in the universe I chose my favourite... Thank you, Jeter!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The WORST Star Wars book ever written!!","review":"The first two books in the series are good, but this book HASNO ACTION!!BOBA FETT WOULD BE EMBARASSED."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard Merchandise is unbelievable!","review":"The book is absolutely action-packed, and is a wanderful end to the \\"Bounty Hunter Wars\\" series. It's definitely the best book in the series, thrilling from beginning to end. I hope this is not the last of the bounty hunters. This book has left me wanting more."},{"rating":"1","title":"completely dull","review":"The author tries to develop a huge web of intrigue and deceit but leaves a book full of nonsense situations trying to cover the huge gaps found in the plot and with unbeliavably stupid situations. The characters are completely superficial and the author gives attention to characters nobody wants to know about instead of potentially interesting characters like Bossk and Zuckuss. The only reason I read this is because it is StarWars after all and because I had already bought the first two books.For the first time I can say that reading a book was painfull and uncomfortable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will the real boba fett step forward.","review":"There are very few books that I have to have. When I heard that there was going to be a series featuring many of the bounty hunters I just couldn't wait. Now having read all 3 I think to myself, were any of the hunters in the series. Sure the names were there but not the characters. Boba Fett just talked to anyone who would listen like a drunk at a bar. All of the other hunters acted like fools. There is no way Vader would have selected these losers if they were like they are in this series. It had such potential to show the hunters in detail and to give us more info about them. In the end it was a case of finish it so that i could go on to another book. If you have read the first 2 and want to know how it ends then read it. Otherwise read some of the other starwars books. In the future I hope that there will be a series that is written on the hunters, with a book for each one. This could have been a good start, but just keeps coming up short."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been much much better.","review":"I waited until I finished all three books before reviewing 'cos the earlier books just left a lot of frustrations.In the last book of the Trilogy, lo and behold, the other bounty hunters are finally acting more like; bounty hunters; instead of greenhorns and fumbling idiots.Disappointingly, the sinister plots that were hinted at in the first two books turned out to be rather shallow or practically non-existent.What is distracting is the author's using of metric units of measurements in the last book while using \\"Standard ... Unit\\" in the first two.Of course, the scratchings on the Slave I cargo hold etc were not explained satisfactorily, or why was an intact hard merchandise delivered in the first book described as dead in the last book.Makes me wonder who's really writing the book, or how many of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you have read the first two books buy it, otherwise don't","review":"I read the first two books of this series and was not impressed at all, i had to read this one to find out what happened in the end. Nothing is the answer, it was far too predictable, there were a few twists but nothing that really interested me. At the end i just felt cheated for buying the whole trilogy. Boba Fett is by far the best character in the whole galaxy because of his general mysteriousness, if you're looking to find out something about him you're better off not buying this book. It left me infuriated in the way it finished and devastated that Lucas could sanction such mindless drivel under the great name of Star Wars. Not Reccomended."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was a fast read...but","review":"This book was a nice bok. There wasn't anything \\"spectacular\\" in it it was just a good adventure. I was dissapointed that the series didn't say How Boba Fett came about...parents,Mandolar,etc. I really wanted to find out about his culture. I also think it's stupid that Boba Fett is alive one reason they don't talk about him being alive in any of the following books. It's like he just dissapeared.Other than that the the book is good and if you like the SW universe you will like it. Besides you find out all about Neelah in this one. Hint *starships*."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good that turns sour","review":"I just finished the book not long ago and the ending was just down right pathetic! Too many things were wrong in the ending to make me recommend this book to anyone. The first 17 chapters were good and I enjoyed the series till that point, but the end didn't hold true to the Star Wars I know. I think the ending was written too quickly and it made the Star Wars galaxy seem to fit in my backyard. I think the ending betrayed any Star Wars fan who spent any amount of time researching past what was in the movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"repetitive","review":"This book could have used some thorough editing. Actually, the trilogy could have been pared down to one \\"great\\", two \\"good\\" books. There was a great deal of repetition and useless detail. You have to assume that anyone who reads this book, has already read the other two. Pretty disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yappy, trite, and redundant-- Jeter's worst yet","review":"All talk and no action makes this merchandise pretty limp. The first third of the book attempts to reconcile some of the more glaring mistakes in the first two. The results are heavy-handed, repetitive, and annoying. There were so many holes in the story, I thought a few more couldn't hurt, so I took the book down to the firing range and ventilated it repeatedly with a .40 caliber semi-automatic pistol. The shower of confetti was amusing, but that was the only entertainment value I got out of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bad I have to give it a star.","review":"I have not finished this book, but I will review the whole trilogy here. If the author of this book would bother to read Tales of the Bounty Hunters or even the X-Wing books, he would realize that Zuckuss was a completly different character than the Gand in this book. No Gand (if other books are correct) would use pronouns. Since Gands happen to be one of my favorite species in Star Wars, having Zuckuss constantly say \\"I\\" was anoying. 4-LOM has a vision in Tales of the Bounty Hunters of himself as a Jedi. I have been waiting for the book which expands on this, and I have learned that in fact, Zuckuss and 4-LOM never intended on joining the Alliance. I would suggest that you ignore this entire series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lot's of action & in-depth look into the 'real' Boba Fett.","review":"I just couldn't wait for this book to come out! And I wasn't disappointed. This book definitely keeps you reading with all of it's action and secrets continually being revealed. Boba Fett's fascinating character continues to emerge and surprise us and this book (the whole series really!) captures his personality perfectly. His actions and words I find to be very believable to his nature in all 3 books, and this final installment only further emphasizes this. I WANT MORE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hopefully are questions will be answered!?!","review":"The enigma of Boba Fett is slowly before our eyes coming to a end. The great bounty hunter's secrets are soon to be exposed; well at least most of his secrets. To be totally honest I do hope not all of his secrets are brought to light for the simple fact it would then iliminate my whole imagination about the man. Hopefully in this new and final installment we can have at least most of our questions answered. The two books of this series have been a great reads; full of twists and turns. We have had the honor of partaking in the mind and troubled soul of the most feared man in the galaxy. I hope; no I expect the third book to be on par or not better then the last two."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Book","review":"The first two books were great, but if you hate bounty hunters, you're going to hate this book. It has lots of action. I believe that it will have a very surprising ending. If you want to read about Dengar's past read Tales of the Bounty Hunters."},{"rating":"1","title":"An intricate web is nearly finished.","review":"Like the spidery characters of the Assemblers, author K.W. Jeter has built a web of conspiracy for Boba Fett, Dengar, and Neelah to get out of. But will they, and in one piece? Will readers even care what happens to unlikable characters trapped into doing business with unsavory individuals? Only reading this conclusion to The Bounty Hunter Wars trilogy will tell. As with the first two books (The Mandalorian Armor and Slave Ship) there are almost no characters to really care about, but plenty of back stabbing and blood shed to maintain interest. While not a highlight of the alternate universe Star Wars novels, most fans will enjoy the series on one level or another."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very solid series so far","review":"The first two Bounty Hunter books in the series were very very good. Maybe it's just the mystique surrounding the Boba Fett character that pushes it along. Or the way he handles himself around the other characters he runs into. Unlike some other people, I don't feel every Star Wars book needs to have Han, Luke, and Leia as a focus. Boba Fett carries this book on his own.The writing itself is good, although not great. Everybody seems in character, which is the main thing. But with Zahn helping out on this third chapter I expect Hard Merchandise to be the best of the three."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only timothy zahn could save this series.","review":"I read the first book, and was very disappointed in it. It was pretty much Boba Fett going around and making every one else look like a fool. Its story line was lack luster, its supporting characters dumb, and mostly didn't follow any other stories about the bounty hunters (i.e. tales of the bounty hunters). the only reason i could give this series 2 stars was because zahn (the best of the star wars writers) is helping with it. without him, this series is dead."},{"rating":"2","title":"This exciting and griping tale is wonderful","review":"I found this book Finished off the exciting trilogy, nicel"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good book","review":"Cyberpirates exceeded my expectations.

As a scientist, writer, and addicted reader, I have found that any connection with science renders most writers excruciating and/or incomprehensible. Ms. Barrett is a rare exception, able to weave science into her stories with consummate grace, neither turgid nor pedantic. Although not a professional scientist herself, she has a keen understanding of science and of scientists, and of human character in general. Her crystalline prose and thoughtful insight make this book eminently readable and at times, breathtaking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating stories by a talented author.","review":"A.

Mendel gets his due, as do Carol Linneaus and Darwin and Alfred Wallace. Each story here is a gem (with the exception of \\"The Marburg Sisters\\" which I didn't take to.) The novella Ship Fever is the heartbreaking story of a young physician with lofty goals for recognition caught in the middle of a typhus epidemic among Irish immigrants fleeing the potato famine; this story and 'Rare Bird', of a young woman with scientific ambitions growing up in 18th century London, were two of the best things that I have read in ages.

This is an arbitrary and very incomplete perspective on personality - which incidentally, has been studied very extensively in psychology over the past 50 years or so. The assessment of a given president's standing on each trait is entirely Barber's, not the result of any formal attempt at measurement or a consensus of experts.

Uses it in stuffing and will buy it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"good concept, poor execution","review":"I'm so tired of evil, insane wizards as the antagonist. And the protagonist is a passive girl who needs saving every step of the way. I can't help but think that the story would have been more interesting from the apprentices point of view, at least then the protagonist would have proactive, but I'm not sure it would really have helped. The balance of power was so obviously in favor of the apprentice, the reader has to wonder why he was playing such a silly game with the insane antagonist.The author kept covering the same ground over and over until I wanted to scream. If you're wondering why I kept reading, well, for the most part I did start skimming about 2/3s of the way through, I was so tired of hearing the girl wondering about who she should trust, \\"remembering\\" things the reader already knew, whining to herself about how she \\"just couldn't\\" do, resisting the things that would save her, and vicilitating all over the place."},{"rating":"1","title":"I EXPECTED MORE FROM THIS BOOK.","review":"I HAVE READ MANY OF TAMI HOAG'S BOOKS AND WAS DISAPPOINTED IN HER LATEST EFFORT. I AM ONLY MIDWAY THROUGH THE BOOK AND THE ONLY THING THAT KEEPS ME GOING IS THE DETERMINATION TO FINISH WHAT I STARTED. THE CHARACTERS AREN'T DEVELOPING. WE KNOW EVERYBODY HAS A STORY AND SOME HAVE A HISTORY TOGETHER, BUT NO HINT OR CLUE AS TO WHAT BROUGHT THEM TO THIS POINT. I'VE ALWAYS ENJOYED HER WRITING AND ALTHOUGH I PREFER HER EARLIER WORKS I ENJOYED HER MORE RECENT UNTIL THIS ONE. VERY DISAPPOINTED."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written with little character development","review":"This book deserves to die along with the killer Ms. Hoag writes about. It is so crammed with shallow characters that you'll need to list each one's bio to struggle through this mess. And this is by third chapter.Chapter one we meet the killer, loose him through the middle, then find him again in the end. She attempts to establish a connection between the book's mob of characters, but we never get to know them---nor do we want too. So many shallow characters only fill space. The only thing worse than reading this book is to listen to it on tape. The reader only adds to the pain.Bury the book and the tape, and take Ms. Hoag's word processor away, and never use this reader again---if let loose either one might hurt someone with a similar project."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well paced thriller","review":"Though this book was written several years back, when 'serial killer themes' were highly popular, the work holds up well, due to the considerable skills of the author. Plenty of gore and grit, lots of tension and suspense. The romantic subtheme is predictable, but a pleasant element in the midst of the pace of the thriller. Familiar characters balanced with the new make this a very enjoyable read for fans of Tami Hoag, one of my favorite authors."},{"rating":"2","title":"1ST TAMI HOAG BOOK, WON'T BE MY LAST!","review":"I am a loyal romance reader. I have specific authors in the mystery genere that I like (Sandra Brown,Iris Johansen,Sidney Sheldon and now Tami Hoag). This book blew me away. I thought it was very well written. The plot kept me guessing. I cared about the characters. Yes, this was a story that was hard to read in parts. It did have some explicit violence in it, yet I didn't feel it was any more violent than a rated R movie. I didn't get the feeling that the violence was for shock value. I disagree with the reviewer that felt that the romance between John and Kate was unnessary to the story. The author established that Kate had gone through an awful lot and personally I was glad she had some happiness come into her life. Hats off to Ms. Hoag. Keep up the great work! You have a new fan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Killer loose in MN - Watch out","review":"Another great thriller from Tami Hoag. This is the second story of hers that I have listened to and am again thrilled I have.In this story the dynamic duo Liska and Kovak are again on the trail of a killer but they are secondary characters in this one. This story centers on Kate Conlan and FBI agent from her past. They are both trying to help find the serial killer the \\"Cremator\\" who has drawn Kate into the story even though she doesn't usually act as an advocate for kids. But, things go many different ways with this story. I have to admit that I didn't completely know who did it until the very end. I recommend this story!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"As someone who has read all of Tami Hoag's books, this one is the worst. I was very disappointed. Reading this book rates right up there with being in the dentist's chair. The only thing that kept me from finishing this was a determination to do so. She spends so much time on the police and their lives that you never really know much about the criminal. Would not recommend!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time!","review":"About the only pages worth reading are the first few chapters and the last few chapters. What a waste of all the middle pages! Conversations are all the same over and over again. They couldn't even figure out the ties between the three women. Give me a break!I would not suggest anyone read this. I'm sorry I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 stars - formulaic","review":"It sucks to have to type a review in order to rate an item to get recommendations now that they've taken that feature away. If it irritates you to have to read this, tell Amazon.com to bring back the \\"rate this item\\" feature."},{"rating":"2","title":"On the Edge of your Seat!","review":"The final pages of Tami Hoag's Ashes to Ashes will have you sitting on the edge of your seat wishing you could read faster. I have read all of Ms. Hoag's books starting from way back when she wrote romance novels. They've all been excellent. In the last few years her mystery novels have topped my list of 'must read' books consistently. The comradarie that is apparent between the police detectives in this novel is intense. The murders are puzzling and guessing who the murder is will keep you busy when you're not reading the book. Another winner, hands down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I found the book very disappointing compared with other books by the same author. The characters were ill defined, you were never sure whether a character was male or female. The plot jumped around without definition ie it moved to different scenes without this being very clear to the reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"65% boring; 35% good (not great)","review":"I was looking for a new mystery/thriller writer and decided to try Hoag. This was my first, and it will proably be my last. The book can't figure out whether it's a romance or a mystery/thriller. It starts off as the latter, then spends the bulk of the book agonizing over the romance of the two main characters. As a romance, I can't say, since I don't read them. As a mystery/thriller, it's adequate and not badly written. But not well written either. I'd say it's adequate. Hoag's not in the same league with Michael Connelly, John Sandford, Dennis Lehane, Robert Crais, etc.The characters are not very real, the plotting is mundane and not particularly inventive. The book is readable, but overly long. Hoag seemed to be unable to figure out whether she was more interested in whether John and Kate were going to find true love, or whether they were going to find the serial killer.Guarantee you can do better than this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Didn't make it for me...","review":"I found this Tami Hoag novel the first one I had trouble getting through(and I've read all of her wonderful books). By the end I didn't care who did it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgusting","review":"I did not finish the book, I tried to get into the story but I found it extremely disgusting, couldn't get beyond the violence and profanity. Why do authors, who are capable of writing an entertaining mystery thriller, have to resort to violence and profanity. Tami Hoag is a has-been in my list of enjoyable story tellers"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read","review":"This book is a great read all the way through. It will keep you guessing and is suspenseful until the end. I have read it twice and have highly recommended it to others. Enjoy this book and hold on because it will keep you guessing. Nothing prepares you for the way the story ends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressive!!","review":"Although parts of this novel were a little cheesey (for lack of a better word), all-in-all if you're looking for a suspenseful thriller then this book won't disappoint you! A real page-turner!! Tammy Hoag kindof scares me now (she looks so innocent on the jacket cover). Excellent read!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Gratuitously violent and graphic.","review":"NIGHT SINS and GUILTY AS SIN were very exciting and two of my favorite thrillers. I was very disappointed in ASHES as the author seems almost pornographic in her presentation. I am not a prude but found the graphic descriptions of torture really unnecessary. It appeals to prurient interests and, in that respect, I found it disturbing. Ms. Hoag is such a great storyteller and she doesn't need to emphasize this angle to capture her audience."},{"rating":"1","title":"A DISAPPOINTMENT AT BEST","review":"AS A READER AND FAN OF ALL OF TAMI HOAGS BOOKS THAT HAVE COME BEFORE, I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH ASHES TO ASHES. I FOUND THE RESOLUTION OF THE CASE TOTALLY DISSATISFYING. I FEEL IT WAS A POORLY WRITTEN LOVE STORY WITH A SERIAL SPRINKLED AROUND FOR COLOR. AND WHEN THE KILLER JUST POPS UP - 'HERE I AM' WITH LITTLE OR NO EXPLANATION FOR HIS ACTIONS, I JUST THREW UP MY HANDS. I SINCERELY HOPE HER NEXT BOOK GOES BACK TO THE DEEP AND THOUGHT PROVOKING STYLE FOUND IN NIGHT SINS, GUILTY AS SIN,A THIN DARK LINE ETC...."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's all right -- nothing great","review":"I read the book. It is all right. Nothing great. Most of the time the flow of the story was quite interesting, but sometimes I wondered if Ms. Hoag gets paid by the word. Some relationships in the story were not necessary, except for filling up pages. The characters are good, but the end does not make much sense. Why did this person do it? How come the person appears in the role it does at the end ONLY? Nah, I have read much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good procedural but the crimes are a bit much","review":"Although I have read hundreds of mysteries and thrillers, this was my first book by Tami Hoag - and I was pleased to have found her. Ashes to Ashes is a police procedural set in Minneapolis, wher the cops are trying to find a particularly sadistic serial murderer of young women.The cops have the politicains on their backs, and the state's wealthiest man gets involved, too, calling in an FBI profiler when his daughter goes missing.I enjoyed the procedural aspects and despite the gruesome nature of the crimes, Hoag doesn't dwell on the details as much as some of her contemporaries do. Still, it's not for the squeamish. There's a nifty and credible plot twist at the end, and I recommend this for fans of the genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Again?","review":"If you have read books about serial killers, here it is again. Especially if you have read other Tami Hoag books, the pattern and format is the same. Some romance, some sex, some mystery but by the end you'll wish the author had left out the gratuitous graphics of the murders."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Dark Topic but well Written","review":"There is a serial killer on the loose and the killer is brutal in the way that he is killing the victims and his signature is that he sets them on fire in a public location. With plenty of front burner characters (Sam Kovac, Kate the witness advocate and John Quinn the FBI behavioral Science man) a man hunt is set for catching the murder before he kills again.This story has mystery, suspense, a little romance, and plenty of graphic details especially during autopsies but I feel that it will keep you turning the pages. I must admit to some confusion at the end when all of the ends were being tied up due to so many twists and turns the story takes but I slowed down and re-read a paragraph here and there and voila. Still I was surprised by who the bad guy was. Don't miss this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"ashes to ashes","review":"Interesting book. I read the whole thing even though it read like a made for tv movie, real predictable, but still kept my attention. The ending seemed to come from nowhere though. I felt cheated with the ending, I expected more from a 600 page book. I'm from minnesota and I'am familliar with minneapolis, and found the references distracting. I would of been happier not knowing which town it took place in."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT A THRILLER","review":"The little tuturial on the back of the book seemed a little deciving along with many of the customer reviews. I was under the impression that this was going to be a serial killer \\"THRILLER\\". Much to my surprise it was a drawn out love story with a tlittle bit of murder. Ever time you thought yoou were going to get in to the mind of the villian it stopped and went back to the love story.The only reason I gave this book two stars is cause it did have a good insite to the police works into a murder investigation. And there was some good humor in a few af the characters.For all you who thought this was a good thriller, and to those of you who agree with me on what a good serial killer novel should be about I recomend \\"COLD COLD HEART\\" BY JAMES ELLIOT."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tami's best book yet!","review":"I have always enjoyed Tami's books, and this one ranks at the top! I loved all of the characters, especially John, Kate, and Kovac! Keep up the good work!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A thriller","review":"Hoag teams her heroine, a former FBI agent, Kate now a witness advocate with her ex-lover ace FBI profiler, Quinn. She weaves many twists and turns into her serial murderer thriller.Kate's acid comments to and about her superior could be fatal to her career as well as her life. Believing her witness could be the bullet that kill both of them. A bit of Midwest political intrigue brought in another dimension to the story line."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Suspense Novel","review":"Wow! This book does NOT disappoint! It defintely keeps you on your toes wanting more and more! I thought I would know the who-dunnit-aspect of the novel but I was wrong! It really kept me reading. The only thing that bothered me is that there weren't enough encounters with \\"The Cremator\\" (the killer). I didn't exactly get 'inside' the killers' mind which would have made it more scarier. But the suspense of not knowing who the killer was made it worthwhile! I recommend this book to everyone who thinks that suspense novels are predictable because you will be wrong about this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable","review":"I felt this was one of Ms. Hoags better novels. Quite well written and suspensful. Never caught on til the end who the \\"creamator\\" was! And it was fun reading about near by places as I live just outside Mpls. One complaint/ question is what about Thor? Was he forgotten about? Also how many times does the word \\"proactive\\" come up?! Too many."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, previous book much better.","review":"She spent too much time on the police rather than the crime and the perpetrator."},{"rating":"1","title":"An okay thriller. Not one of Tami Hoag's best.","review":"If I had it to do over again, I would have waited for the paperback! As a big fan of Tami Hoags most recent thrillers, I was excited about getting Ashes to Ashes. I like the way she intertwines mystery, murder and mayhem with romance. However, I do not feel the same about this one. I found the strong-willed, independent heroine to be pretty obnoxious at times. I also found the \\"romance\\" self-talk fairly juvenile. I became somewhat bored half-way through the novel and had trouble finishing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sigh... another typical thriller","review":"It's too bad that all these so-called \\"pycho-thrillers\\" are all starting to read alike. This one reminded me so much of \\"Billy Straight\\" by Jonathan Kellerman, with the father as the possible suspect \\"deal\\". Tami Hoag barely delves into the mind of her killer, just a few mind bits here and there, and most of the book takes place with everyone else trying to figure out their emotions. And then when you find out who the killer actually is - you're still left wondering why? As for it being graphic, it barely scrapes the gore surface. I'll pass on the next one..."},{"rating":"1","title":"depressingly shallow","review":"First off, I haven't read so much unnecessary detail since that debacle of writing, Frazier's Cold Mountain. Hoag seems to want to throw everything in here she can think of.And then what does she think of? Mostly, anything that's mindless, shallow, callow. Yes, I read this thing for sheer entertainment. I wanted to \\"waste\\" a Saturday afternoon with a book, looking out at the snow in Manhattan. Instead, I was so irritated by the characters--just cliches masquerading as people--that I soon found myself skimming whole pages, muttering, \\"yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.\\"And then comes the ending. I think if she tried to get more banalities into that final chapter, she couldn't have done it. I don't think I've ever seen so many little greeting card sentiments in so few pages. All this, and graphic violence too. Well, it did the trick. I wasted the afternoon. Just not enjoyably."},{"rating":"2","title":"A bit predictable, but scared the pants off me anyway!","review":"I slept with the light on a few nights while I was reading this book. I had never read anything by Tami Hoag before, but I definitely will again! While the plotline was a bit predictable (anyone with a good sleuthing mind will figure it out), the description and the style in which she writes is scary as hell!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sensational!","review":"This is my first Tami Hoag and I thought it was brilliant, extremely well-written and I never guessed who the Cremator was. I am a huge fan of Patricia Cornwell and Kathy Reichs, but I felt that 'Ashes To Ashes' was much more realistic (esp when I come from a small time which exactly this story has happened) The only complaint was that not enough was said about the killer and there was too much on the police involved. I will definately be reading more of Ms Hoag's books and for those who complain about the graphic violence, don't read books on serial killers!"},{"rating":"2","title":"was great!","review":"great mystery right from the beginning! I didn't want to put it down. Tami can easily engage the reader right from the start."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost had me","review":"I read a few reviews and thought the book sound interesting. And then I read it. I must admit the end surprised me but not big time. Not enough detail and I never quite felt any compassion for the victims. The author did not build up any real anxiety leading to the deaths and therefore I was never really scared. I will not give up just yet though Id like to read her work again and with that I guess the author suceeded in her biggest goal. She now has another fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was terrible!","review":"I am sorry. You can tell me that this is only fiction, but who needs to read about such grusome acts. In today's society, they are sure to come true and I have no need to read about them. I will not read another Hoag book as long as she continues to write in this dark way. Go back to happy books!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I could give it no stars...","review":"Yet another book in the long line of romance novelists who are trying to branch out - but still fail. I've read three or four Tami Hoag novels and they all amount to the same thing - a fractured novel that tries to be both romance and thriller but does not blend together in a cohesive unit. This one was the worst, mostly due to dialogue that is so cliched and stilted that the author should be embarassed. Ms. Hoag should select a genre and stick to it, either romance ot thriller."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excelente....","review":"Para mi una de las mejores fragancias de la guess y las uso a cada momento del dia. es extraordinaria"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fresh and Sexy","review":"My husband found this cologne at a department store, and we ordered it at a much lower cost from Amazon.

Lots of sentences ended with question marks and references to \\"fog\\" whenever the facts are not clear to Montville. When the fog starts to lift, the book then gets boring. I can see that Montville is attempting to be accurate; however, in the process he creates an unenjoyable read. This is a shame as the subject matter is wonderful."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Solid Base-Hit","review":"If you only read one biography of the Babe, then the Big Bam would be an excellent choice. It's a solid, well researched look at the biggest name in baseball history. One of the strong points - the author's decision not to speculate - results in a lack of titillating vignettes from both the Babe's earliest years and some of his escapades. However, the reader gains that back in his confidence in the reliability of the book. Besides, the Sultan of Swat generated more than enough stories that are reported.A number of photographs are included and they add a great deal to the biography. The excellent bibliography also allows one to reasearch further.Overall, I was wishing it was a longer book by the time I was done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Babe is Never a disappointment!","review":"I bought this book as a gift for my father.

If you know anything about Babe Ruth, this book leaves all the interesting questions unanswered. Every time the author can't find the information or is too lazy to dig it out, he claims there's a fog around Ruth's early life. Why was he placed in an orphanage? Who knows. What was his mother like? In the fog. Was she part African-American? Montville says the information's all gone. He uses the convenient concept of the fog to avoid digging deeply--and maybe working hard.There are plenty of other Ruth biographies around. This one's just too foggy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Much Fog For My Taste.","review":"There's too much fog in this book. Whatever the author failed to research is hidden in fog.The assertion that Babe Ruth had attention deficit disorder is malarky. People with real ADD cant excel at something as complex as baseball. Armchair analysts always miss the point of psychiatric diagnoses, viz., diagnoses ALWAYS apply to folks with serious, debilitating symptoms NOT people with superficial behavioral similarities that are interesting or eccentric, but nowhere near the severity to create a handicap.There are better biographies of Babe Ruth than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Solid but dull story of a great ballplayer","review":"Babe Ruth was renowned for his home run blasts, sadly this bio only rates as a weak single at best. Montville follows the same formula here that he did for his biography of Ted Williams. Where as Wiliams was a great ballplayer with no real success of the field, Ruth set the tone for the roaring 20's. While many of the Ruth stories are myth, Montville spends very little time telling us what was real and what wasn't. His fameous fueds are hardly mentioned, saved for the one with Lou Gerhig and that garners only slim mention. All in all this book is authorative but liking in the spice and character that made Babe Ruth who he was!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Biography I've never read","review":"I received this book as a birthday present and was really looking forward to reading it as I enjoy sports and biographies. But reading this book was agonizing. I got 40 pages into it and still couldn't tell you one thing about Babe Ruth. The writing was horrible and incomprehensible.I finally just gave up. Life is simply too short. If you are interested in purchasing or reading this book, try reading the beginning first. Maybe you'll save yourself money and grief.Can't wait to see how this author butchers Ted Williams biography."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bam Bam Bam","review":"This book moves almost as fast as the Babe lived his life.From his early years at St. Mary's Industrial to the shadow of himself at the end, Montville writes another masterful biography. Entertaining and informative, the writer uses \\"fog\\" as an effective metaphor for the missing peices rather than stretching. For anyone who loves baseball or anyone who loves a good story. Outstanding!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's Not About You","review":"Leigh Montville's biography offers a wealth of information. Unfortunately, Montville, like other failed biographers, refuses to let his subject stand alone on the stage. Somerset Maugham once said \\"The best style is the style you don't notice.\\" The successful biographers know that they need to stay out of the way of their subject. Montville's writing style repeatedly intrudes on the text and reminds the reader that the author is always present, vying for the light. That's too bad for a book so well researched. For me, it's a fatal flaw for a biographer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must have book for baseball fans","review":"This is one of the best books written about baseball's greatest legend. I loved the way Leigh Montville tells the story of a kid that grew up to be the most beloved and admired player in baseball.

I love early Dylan, middle Dylan and even late Dylan but not this and not \\"good as i been to you.\\" If you have all the money in the world and all the space in the world to put another cd you will never listen to, then buy this, otherwise save your money and buy these songs by other better musicians and singers, or other better Dylan cds."},{"rating":"2","title":"1962, my a**!","review":"this must be the one most underrated record of all times, in every dylan catalogue it ranks as an inbetween, but sometimes i have the idea that this is Dylan's finest hour. neverbefore has he recorded his pain and fear so purely as here. only 'time out of mind' tops this. No, this is not 1962, this has nothing of the naivitey of 'blowin in the wind' ,this is post-punk, post-acid,post-reagan/thatcher/bush, this has the taste of our desasters right now, right here.

Dylan spellbinds with his interpretations of some Broadside Ballads and Traditional songs.Somehow he makes them his own, more than just covers or interpretations. This is what even the most brilliant classical artist aims at. Frankly this is all I need. Stark, intense, sad, sparse, he gets it all in on this one. Also on Good As I've Been To You,although perhaps not as down and out. He makes these tunes come alive. What more can you ask? This man is getting close to being the most fascinating blues singer of our times.

I presumed, incorrectly, that Mr. Shenkman had specific experience as an attorney practicing in this area. My impression is that his writings on asset protection appear to be just a summarization of the writings of others, with little or no original thought. About halfway through this book, puzzled by its consistent shallowness, I finally did some research on Mr. Shenkman and found out that he seemingly just quickly cranks out a new book every time some topic heats up, such as his \\"How to Buy a House with No (or Little) Money Down\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"another reason not to buy what you can't touch","review":"Miserable product.

The descriptions of the battles are mostly a order of battle (units involved etc.). Although very complete in that way and probably more accurate than many accounts, it does not make for very good reading. There are some insights as far as claims on both sides and what units were involved, but no first person stories and little overall evaluation and conclusion. Description of aircraft is also pretty light, and does not include pictures or drawings of all aircraft (would be useful for some of the more uncommon aircraft).If you are interested in units involved and numbers etc., I would suggest this book. If you want interesting stories and reading or want some evaluation and insight (other than numbers) on the subject I would not suggest this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and superficial.","review":"Based on the radio interview with Roselli that aired on WNYC in New York, I'm sure it would be possible to write an interesting biography of this apparently underappreciated singer. However, this book isn't it. Evanier appears to see Roselli as a sort of tragic figure whose personality flaws undermined his potential for a success even greater than the not-inconsiderable fame he has actually enjoyed. However, the reliance on anecdotes from a few friends and associates who are quoted over and over gives the book a repetitious character that left me bored after the first 100 pages. Somehow the story of a guy who scoffed at the instant fame offered by Ed Sullivan and Johnny Carson because they would not pay his usual fee just doesn't seem very tragic, or very interesting. To find a sympathetic character here, instead of a self-involved jerk who brought about his own problems, I needed more help from the author (and the editor)."},{"rating":"2","title":"JIMMY ROSELLI - Best Singer Ever!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I couldn't put this book down.

They make me feel like I am doing school work and don't tell you how this type of question will appear on the sat. The practice is the worst I have ever seen. I am not exagerating, I mean it!!! The math is interestingly hard, not because is tests the hard type of questions, but because it test questions that don't appear on the real test. Their math sections also have 20 grid-ins. The critical reading is just plain wierd and the writing is way to easy and contains to little questions. Ugh!!! The college hill method is supposed to get you the right answer. However, one of the steps is to think logically or, rephrasing it, use your reasoning skills. Great. They don't teach you how to develope those skills and have no examples using this method.

I tried using the practice tests on the Praxis website, even spent $26 on a Praxis book, which by the way only had one practice test in it,with maybe 20 questions. I purchased the McGraw Hill's SAT I book and started going through it page by page. The sample questions and practice questions were great. Everything was explained in detail, so there was nothing that I didn't understand. There were many practice tests, which I believe is crucial, especially for math.

Those of us who had the good fortune to have witnessed this interesting era in civil aviation will remember with great fondness those United Jet Mailiners, Eastern Golden Falcon Jets, and Delta and American Airlines Flagships and Astrojets.The photos are generally of good quality and well reproduced. The short captions are entertaining, even if they do not have a great deal of substance.

Our pastor has been using it for almost three years and only told a handful of other people. It has caused many people to leave which is exactly what it predicts. This book advocates using people to get what you want.The philosophy in this book is dangerous and based on worldly principles. Any pastor who is thinking of using this book should think twice. Our church went from a vital, growing church with a strong voice in our community to one with almost cult-like characteristics. We as Christians need to remember that we do not operate by the world's standards. Growth is not marked by what the world thinks of us but by how God sees us. There is so much division in my old church now as a direct result of the ideas in this book. Chirst told us that people would know we were His disiciples by our love for each other.

If you want to build a ministry that is short on message and long on appeal to worldly people, then this is the book for you.

Sony charged me over $700 and refused to return the 'physically damaged screen' as I requested so that the 'intentional damage' that I 'caused' could be verified. To confirm that this is a design flaw Sony included with the repaired computer NEW instructions as to how to prevent damaging the screen noting that 'the LCD screen may be sensitive to pressure or added stress'. This product is a sad commentary on Sony's design standards and on its unwillingness to stand behind its warranty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware of screen cracking - not covered by warranty","review":"There are many nice things about this computer - weight, size and decent speed. BUT - normal use can still cause the LCD to crack and it is NOT covered by warranty. Sony considers all LCD cracking to be accidental.

I was almost able to guess how the main character would react to a situation not by predictability but by the means which Bradby gave me through his strong character building. This and Master of Rain were great books. I want to be clear that this is a 5 Star book. I am giving this 4 stars because there really should have been a sequel to this book.

He is pretty rough with them and I noticed the mom's hair is starting to come out a little. Also, the mom's skirt falls down constantly which is kind of annoying during play but could probably be glued or something..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Doll House People","review":"Very Happy with the doll house people and sure my great grandaughter will be too.Also impressed with Plan Toys as it was received quickly and in excellent condition."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is great if you are not allergic","review":"After a great deal of research, I decided to buy this set doll for my daughter. She is 2 and half and she enjoyed the dolls for 1 day. Then I noticed my skin felt itchy and my lung hurt! When I checked the dolls, their legs and arms are made of some sort of electrician's wire that was covered with woven fibers and I know a lot people are allergic to this kind of fiber. I wish I have time to provide a photo. Long story short, a couple of days later, she had bad post-nasal drip that made her almost sleepless for two days and needed a doctor visit and prescription medication.She still loves them very much and begged me not to trow them away. Now she realized she cann't even sit near them because her throat will hurt. So she allowed me to put them in a zip-loc waiting for a solution.If there is no allergy, I will give the toy set 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"My 2 yr old loves it","review":"We have the doll house and some furniture and the addition of the family was a great thing. My 2 yr old daughter and 4 yr old son, keep rearranging the dolls in different positions onto the chairs and into the beds.

I bought it used, so I suppose the head could have fallen off and then accidentally glued on backwards, but I'm guessing it came from the factory that way."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad perfume","review":"this product is bad....I have purchased Tuscany as gift for my daughter for years......this perfume does not smell the same....waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book!","review":"I haven't read this book extremely well yet but it seems helpful. It is very organized and gives good advice. I am just learning to sew so I am a little confused.

I haven't sewn in years and was grateful to find this overview to re-teach myself. The pictures are definitely outdated, however, and that's the only area I can see for improvement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Intermediate to Advanced Book","review":"I bought this book because I thought it would be a comprehensive introduction to the art of sewing.

I actually vacuum it out weekly because I live in a very dusty area, and I still only really need to change it every 2-3 months. It really helps my allergies!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad for Doggies","review":"After I had purchased these, I researched them a little and I found the company that makes them also makes an entire line of plastic things, such as mouth guards.

This book however; is NOT one of them. The heroine is perhaps the most nerve wracking neurotic romantic character I have ever come across. Even in moments of kindness she is constantly sniping at the hero. I got so impatient with the book that I flung it across the room. good riddance!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This was a disappointing read.","review":"There were a few things that disturbed me about this book.1. The heroine was barely 17. To me, that is really teetering on the line between \\"okay\\" and \\"child molestation.\\"2. The spanking sequence was weird. Unless you're into that kind of thing, I found it odd and totally unnecessary. It totally humiliated Storm and is not something a grown man should do to a 17 year old young woman.3. The force-fingering of Storm on the beach to check for her virginity is more than barbaric. It's completely wrong and without merit. Any worthwhile heroine is not going to fall in love with some man that just raped her with his finger. Ugh.Brenda Joyce can be a little too rough for my taste. I much prefer Johanna Lindsey, Julie Garwood, and others like them. I wouldn't recommend this book at all."}]`),E={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:B},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:x,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},C={class:"card-container"},W=["disabled"],M={key:0},O={key:1};function H(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=w("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your SNAP 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",C,[(a(!0),i(y,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",O,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",M,"See more"))],8,W)):b("",!0)])}const N=d(E,[["render",H],["__scopeId","data-v-719cf22c"]]),L=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"sponsor/12.md","filePath":"sponsor/12.md"}'),j={name:"sponsor/12.md"},P=Object.assign(j,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(N)]))}});export{L as __pageData,P as default};
