Due to a touch of curiosity I decided to check out the original UK version. Again, the acting and story line was excellent. However, I found the final episode to be a complete disappointment and that is the reason this show gets a two star rating. Without spoiling the ending I will say the last ten minutes was more in the genre of Sci_fi and in my opinion ridiculous. It gives the viewer the impression that is was written at the last minute and was basically a patch job. Hence, the ending ruined the quality of the show.

It is as good (or bad) as any El Cheapo straightening iron you can pick up at Target. As many reviewers have noted, it tends to burn your hands as you iron. Worse still, you can't use any protective product (I used the Schwarzkopf Osis Flatliner Iron Serum and Toni and Guy's Iron-It Heat Defense Spray with my Chi with no such difficulty) - because it literally \\"fries\\" your hair, stinks terribly, and leaves gunky residue on the plates. Also, I found that I had to run the iron over my hair several times (my hair is wavy/curly, not coarse) in order to get it as straight and sleek as my old Chi.Save your $120 - you could get 1 T3, 1.5 Chi's, or 5 Conairs that would do a much better job than the Sedu."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after one year exactly","review":"I was very happy with mine, but it broke right after the one year warranty expired.

A big disappointment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped working as well after 9 months","review":"The iron worked well the first few months that I had it. But maybe after 9months or so I noticed that it just didn't seem to work as well. I thought it was my imagination or that maybe i needed to work smaller sections of hair at a time. But after about 9 months i was using the highest heat setting and tiny sections of hair - and it still isn't doing the job. My hair stylist used her Chi on my hair recently and I remembered what an iron is supposed to work like. I would not recommend the Sedu."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great results but not durable.......","review":"I loved my SEDU while it was working but one day it just stopped... When you pay $125 for a straightner you expect it should last a least a year. I had fabulous results my hair was very straight and shiny but not worth the money i paid for it when it broke after 6 months. I had read the reviews before i purchased it so i knew it could break easily so i make sure to take extra good care of it. Apparently it didn't matter.... They need to make a more durable product...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money....","review":"When it works, this does work well but they die out pretty soon. I have bought two of these flat irons and both of them died out within a year. Same problem with the cord that other users have been reporting. For something that costs $115, you think we would get a much more sturdier product. Yes and it does get very hot on the outside. So be sure to stay away from the area where the plates are."},{"rating":"2","title":"Saving Grace Salon's favorite Flat Iron","review":"I use this iron in my salon and have added a link for my clients. The best irons are not cheap, but well worth the price. Anyone that has struggled with a mediocre iron and then traded up to a Pro iron will rave about the incredible difference. Why?

It does get hot fast but like the other review, it gets really hot on the exterior. I have the corioliss also and it doesn't get hot on the outside.

But other than that it's really light and works well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked fine for a while till it died","review":"I've only had this iron for about 3-4 months and it has already started giving me problems. It's fine as long as it works. I travel a lot so maybe thats what caused it, however, I expected something i paid 130 bucks for to last a little while longer. Now, every time i turn it on, I have to spend 20 minutes to put it in the exact position where it will actually stay turned on. Once it gets hot, and I start straightening my hair, it usually turns off (yes even if its turned on), so I have to continuously watch in the mirror to make sure the little green light is on.There was so much hype about this iron when I first got it so thats why I picked this one over the CHI. But come on for an arm and a leg, can't a girl get an iron that will actually WORK!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Died After 1 Year - Same Problem with Cord","review":"This iron does a good job straightening hair with minimal hair damage.

This CD will be a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"SOLS,LUNAS,ESTRELLAS...","review":"True trance conjures up ethereal images to its listeners, it takes one on a lucid journey. Kimball Collins release has several tracks that do just that. Armin's \\"Communication\\" starts off quietly then takes off, it has multi-coloured layers of sound with the virgin Mary seeking escape from her institution and finally finding it. The Def Sets \\"Ogo\\" is a green piece set in a forest with a tribal chorus, complete with extraterrestrial guards with their laser guns sounding off. Flowing into the following final track we hear Mea Culpa's \\"The Child\\" which is an emotional exhilirating experience, a photo montage of some great past monumental event from a group of people's lives."},{"rating":"1","title":"yawn","review":"after reading several reviews of this album, and from talking to a friend about kimball collins' live sets, i was pretty excited to hear what this cd sounded like. i have to say that i'm not impressed. this cd is a homogenous mix of fast, standard trance 'anthems.' every song has the same form, and there's nothing really exciting about the mixing. on the whole, this is a pretty boring cd. there's a few standout tracks, like 'come on strong' and 'exodus,' but they're really not all that different from the other 10 songs on the cd. it seems as if any dj could have picked these same records and mixed this same cd. judging from this, i'll take sandra collins over kimball collins any day."},{"rating":"2","title":"The hard trance album I've been searching for","review":"This CD is a perfect middle-ground between harder psy trance and the sometimes too delicate touch of the new progressive sound. PLEASE NOTE THAT I DISKLIKE THE ICU SESSION ONE ALBUM BUT ***LOVE*** THIS ONE - Approaching epic while angling away from anthem, Kimball Collins compiles and mixes an intense and truly satisfying set that is definately not cheezy.Collins does not screw around here - He wastes no time with fuzzy intros as \\"Imagination\\" lays down a thumping beat almost immediately - songs build and build and build, both in urgency and fullness and \\"Lost in Love\\" adds warm beauty towards the end.I was very pleased to see that Collins compiled the set, as some labels hand famous DJs a stack of records and a check. The track selection was tight and thoughtful - apparently some of these tracks are big in Europe but I haven't heard them on other CDs yet. So, in summary, this is a HARD, beautiful, well mixed and original set.

This cd is unbelievable from track 1 thru track 11, from start to finish. Not only is the mixing smooth, but the track selection is OUTRAGEOUSLY HYPE. Kimball weaves his magic in mixing beautiful vocal tracks with non-vocal tracks--all are amazing to listen to. The mind-blowing progressions are found throughout the cd, and get you so hyped you'll jump out of your seat.I can't tell you how good this cd is. Even my friends who hate trance admitted that this album was phenomenal.If you like trance, or even if you don't, I can't recommend a better mixed album than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best","review":"This is one of the best trance cd's i've ever had the pleasure of purchasing and listening to.

Now he presents a CD of Christmas Classics that resembles an offering of a middle of the road act like Englebert Humperdinck. Nothing is wrong with Englbebert - but there is plenty wrong with this cd! First the cd cover looks like Garth wants to be on the cover of a romance novel. Second the music is unbalanced and full of Garth's ego. Where is the sentimental feeling that Christmas music is supposed to have. Garth should leave Christmas music to Elvis, Sinatra, Crosby, etc. This is really nothing more than an attempt to milk his fans out of more money. But like the rest of his catalog, it will sell briskly when first released and then will slow to a halt.Christmas albums are gimmicy by nature. This is just another gimmic by the King of Gimmic.

It is, without doubt, one of the most upbeat, entertaining holiday CD's I have ever heard. The big band arrangements on several of the numbers are superb. Your toes will be tapping and your fingers snapping as you listen to a truly excellent production. I recommend this CD to ALL music lovers."},{"rating":"1","title":"He's almost there...","review":"It is hard to believe that Garth would put out another Christmas CD. Oh, wait. No, it's not. All he wants for Christmas is to break the Beatles' album sales record. So, by recording a few more bland holiday songs, removing his previous effort from the shelves, and putting some of those *older* songs on the new record, he can have a new CD for the folks to buy and, thus, increase his number of records sold. Well, it's working. It's too bad Garth, whom I have enjoyed in the past, puts more effort into marketing than into his music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounds like Bill Murray made a Christmas Album","review":"Anyone who saw Garth forgetting the words and butchering Christmas carols on his TV special knows all they need to know about this turkey. Garth's singing on this cd reminds me of those old skits on Saturday Night Live when Bill Murray used to play the ultimate lounge singer. Maybe Chris Gaines will put out a Christmas album next year?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Dog in the Manger","review":"This CD proves once and for all that there is no level to which Garth Brooks won't stoop to make a buck.

Add 3 songs to a bland and directionless album? Why? Garth just wants to pad his statistics. This album is horrible. Garth reinvents himself as Chris Gaines, and then Santa Claus, and now he's back with more of the same. Will his ego ever stop? Will these hack cd's ever stop being produced?"},{"rating":"1","title":"moneymoneymoneymoney...","review":"All Garth cares about is money. A Christmas cd.

There are a couple of surprises on this one: Stills' \\"Only Waiting for You\\" has a yearning quality that would have made it a decent cut on one of his middle-period solo albums; and CSN's acoustic cover of \\"In My Life\\" is so lovely, you wonder why they don't just dynamite the whole boatload of cheesy sythesizers, oppressive overdubs, tacky Vegas-lounge arrangements, and get back to the acoustic garden where they belong. Stills' \\"It Won't Go Away\\" was a ripping inheritor to litanies of righteous anger like \\"Word Game\\" sung live and acoustic, but here, he plays it on electric rockstar guitar that's so overamped it sounds like a rider mower running over burlap bags. Here's hoping the next CSNY album is less used-up and overwrought than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't waste your money","review":"i admit i'm picky, but with so much good music to listen to, why try to convince yourself you like something when it's really not any good. i wouldn't include any of these songs on a playlist and i'll keep the cd but don't plan to listen to it again. what's vexing is that you'd think this was a fairly good cd based on most of the reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just doesn't measure up to the quality of the past.","review":"Hey, I love these guys but the feeling just ain't there on this one.

While it is not as good as their early stuff, I think it is better than anything they released in the 80's and 90's. My favorite song is \\"It Won't Go Away\\"; while it is typical preachy Stills, it has a great hook to it. Not sure why it didn't get some airplay on classic rock stations. \\"Find A Dream\\" and \\"These Empty Days\\" recaptures the classic CSN harmonies of old. \\"Street To Lean On\\" while it is also preachy may be Crosby's best work since \\"Almost Cut My Hair\\". If you are a CSN fan I think you will enjoy this set."},{"rating":"2","title":"the storm","review":"I have almost all the recordings from CSN,CN,CSNY and this is a very good effort from these legendary musicians.

It is definatelyenjoyable music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Uh......is anyone LISTENING??","review":"This album, despite one or two misfires, is excellent, easily CSN's second greatest album EVER!

I cringed listening to the clips provided. The vocals sound as though they were recorded while the singer was in the shower (and that's not just from the poor quality of the clips provided). Tributes are supposed to be different perspectives on an existing song, not feeble attempts to perfectly recreate the vocal stylings of the original singer. The music behind the singer is not bad - not exactly Incubus but a little different flavor. However, that is all but subdued by the grating performance by the vocalist. Until an \\"Encomium\\"-style tribute is released in honor of Incubus, stick with the original."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will make and Incubus fan's ears bleed","review":"I'd like to repeat the sentiments of the previous reviewer - THIS IS NOT THE STRING QUARTET TRIBUTE. This is something thrown together by a band trying to ride on Incubus' coat strings, and can't even pull off a decent tribute to them. I was excited by the idea of a tribute album, but this band simply did not have what it would take to appropriately cover Incubus... Most of the album instrumental-wise was tolerable, but the singer's voice, word pronunciations, and timing is enough to make any Incubus fan cry. Please do yourself a favor and don't give this CD a second thought."},{"rating":"1","title":"People, the real incubus stuff is all you need!","review":"I have read the reviews about this record, and I just want to tell you all that this is NOT the \\"string quartet tribute to incubus\\" which is a high quality piece of art. This on the other hand doesn't even qualify as art. It fits better in a garbage-bag than in a stereo.Does Incubus deserve the tributes? Yes of course, they are excellent. So I'm not going to go too far in this thrashing.. Kudos to the band who made this tribute, for you have chosen a great band to tribute, and I would probably not be able to make anything even close to what you have done, with my lack of musical skills... But it is still not even comparable to what incubus has made throughout the years.. If incubus was a [bad] band, who would care of the rate of this cd? No one, but..as they are as great as they really are and because of how spoiled we are with good music (incubus of course) this tribute can't be seen as something to wish for..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just plain awful","review":"If it were possible to give this 0 stars, I would.

The musicians aren't too bad, but it's the singing that kills it. No one can dupilcate Brandon Boyd in any way. This guy doesnt have the same kind of voice, and he can't even sing so it sounds worse. He also emphasizes the little things Brandon will do with his voice. He sounds like a 40 year old guy who has never had any practice singing. He also does it at the wrong pace. I especially noticed this in \\"Nice to Know You\\". It's like he would stop and think of the lyric, then say it, but then have to catch back up, so he sings faster or something. I dunno, it's hard to explain on here I guess, just listen to the clip and you will know what I'm trying to say. To make it simple, this tribute sucks, but the real Incubus is awesome."},{"rating":"1","title":"stay away from this","review":"ok ive just listen to the 30 sec. sample of the first 5 tracks and i dont know whether to laugh or cry...like people before have said...the music sounds fine but the voice is horrible...i could prolly sing it better. so yeah id pass on this"},{"rating":"1","title":"You've got to be joking!","review":"This is supposed to be a tribute!

This is not worth money, not even trash, stay far, far, far away from this. The star, which is completely redundant, let's just put it this way, I gave it one star too many. I don't know why money was even spent on the making of this CD. Do not purchase, unless you want to torture somebody. It'll just make you deaf I'm already deaf. I reiterate and hope you take my advice stay far, far, very far away from this.

The central problem is that it's totally negative, taking the wholly stereotypical and unhelpful stance that fatherhood marks the end of any fun in your life. The cover illustrates this rather succinctly, with an aprehensive cartoon dude confronted with a signpost with \\"Having a Life\\" pointing one way, and \\"Fatherhood\\" the opposite way. I guess I could have mentally edited out the negative approach and mined the book for useful tips/advice -- if there were any. But there isn't.

I read the story about a man who seems to be put out at the fact that he has 4 children. I feel as though the author thinks he is making headlines when he tells you that binge drinking until 2am isn't going to happen for you any more.

This book is a complete waste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"I'm not sure where these positive reviews are coming from- I assume they are by Mr. Downey's family. I have never been motivated by a book before enough to write a review online, but this book is so truly, truly awful that I feel the need to warn others. My wife is 7 months pregnant- she bought this for me to get me reading about the baby. I have stopped reading it halfway through, and am now begging for the chance to read ANY OTHER BOOK she owns. It is advertised as humorous, but I promise you that it is certainly not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Juvenile","review":"I found this book neither helpful nor humorous. It crams three pages of useful information into 190+ pages. The humor is childish and the advice is useless. It reminds me of a bad teen exploitation movie or a poorly written National Lampoon piece.At least, I didn't buy it, but got it as a gift. Unfortunately, my wife was the one who gave it to me, so there goes money that could have been better spent on diapers or something useful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing - Do Not Buy This Book","review":"I read the first couple chapters of this book because my wife gave it to me. (I guess the cutesy title and nice cover caught her eye.) I felt bad, but I had to tell her the reason I stopped reading was because the book is useless. The author seems like he spent very little time writing this. The stories are unrealistic and he still can't make them entertaining. You wonder what publisher actually allowed this to go to print. Hopefully, you're reading this before you spend the money and aren't just another sucker like my wife was. No offense sweetie :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Can I Get a Refund?","review":"I will never get that hour of my life back!!!

It is an unconnected series of humorless one-liners by someone surely headed for divorce court. I cannot overstate how bad this book is.

However, as was mentioned in another review there needs to be more. The chapters could include more details, exercises & drills, etc. As we know, just reading about a subject doesn't improve knowledge and skills, only the application of the material can lead to improvements.

The first part of the Honor Harrington series was great! So was \\"Path of the Fury\\" and \\"In Death Ground.\\" The words action-packed and fast paced come to mind when thinking of \\"March Upcountry\\" and the rest of the series with John Ringo. \\"The Shadow of Saganami\\" is just a shadow of the adventure that David Weber used to be. This is just a long-winded expose' on politics. If I wanted politics, I would go to the current events section of the book store, not science fiction. If you are looking for excitement and battle scenes, look up John Ringo's \\"Ghost.\\" If you are having problems falling asleep at night, buy \\"Shadow of Saganami.\\" Really, though, unless you are REALLY into politically based Sci-Fi, this is not the book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"The saga continues","review":"I thought the Sganami book started strong in the first chapter but then it digressed to bring us up to date on all these new characters and bogged down. The captain should have been fleshed out more strongly initially. After mucking around for the first half of the book it finally found its pace. The book finished strong. I await the next in this new series but it is about as strong as In Enemy Hands or War of Honor.Not first tier but enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"I quit halfway through, I was so bored","review":"I've been a huge fan of David Weber for years, so I really wanted to enjoy this--it had my goodwill from the beginning, but I only made it to around page 215 before giving up, it was that boring. I couldn't invest in the characters, I didn't care what their problems were, I couldn't take any more discussions of the intricacies of politics. Maybe this would have been better if it were about half to 2/3 of the length, but as it is, it's 960 pages. On the positive side, though, there's a scene with Honor Harrington (in the first chapter) which ruled."},{"rating":"1","title":"a boring cartoon","review":"In a universe where everyone has blue eyes and walks ten feet tall acomplicated plot with hundreds of players could be both confusing and boring. Weber is good at one thing: Operatic space battles. Unfortunately there is very little of that in Shadow of Saganami. Most of the book is taken up by political discussions between various groups on several planets. It bored me to tears!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I have always enjoyed Dave's Harrington universe...until I got to this book.

As usual, character development is awesome. Also has a nice little teaser of \\"At All Costs\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cure for insomnia","review":"This one will lull you to sleep if you read it before bedtime, trust me. The set up in the first two thirds of the book is tedious and I found myself flipping through page after page before the pace quickened to the point where it began to hold my interest. However, even the passages describing the action sequences are densely written. It is hard to believe that this is the same author that wrote \\"The Apocalypse Troll\\" or \\"Path of the Fury\\". This is the last time I'm going to be sucked into buying a David Weber novel from the blurbs on the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Honorverse doesn't just mean a book about Honor Harrington","review":"...and it doesn't suffer any, either. Honor appears for about 10 pages in the first part of the book, and we just don't miss her, as we follow the exploits of some new middies on their snotty cruise with badly-emotionally-damaged Captain Aivars Terekhov. The Talbott Cluster wants to join Manticore...and Manpower and Mesa want to screw up the works.Even the villains are real people, and some of them are even very sympathetic.Weber has expanded his Honorverse once again, and has shown that he doesn't need the nearly-perfect Harrington to tell a gripping story.This is a terrific addition to the Harrington saga.Walt BoyesThe Bananaslug. at Baen's Bar"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mechanical - longer than you can imagine","review":"If you have enjoyed all the books in Weber's \\"Honorverse\\" then I suppose you too will have to wade through this one. Be prepared, you'll have that deja vu feeling all over again. Honor's little habit of rubbing her left finger over her right hand? The captain in this book has a little wrist flick. Overly devious Haven's? This book has overly devious Sollies instead. You get the idea.The characters were cut out of cardboard - amazingly under developed. You'll recognize some of the plot as recycled from prior books. You get your usual assortment of ground action, a space battle, politics and a leftover villain for the next book. No telepathic treecats in this one, thank god."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointment","review":"I generally love david weber's work. I own almost all of his books in hardback.

She began to appreciate Scarlatti's style after her piano teacher assigned her one of his sonatas."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT","review":"Cottonwoodhill is the most known album by this German Band, and \\"Brainticket,\\" the song, is what still gets most play on underground and independant stations, such as my beloved WFMU. As much as the album has earned its crediability as an underground classic, the sound can be a little thin. You can't help but wish another player were added to this funky-organ-acid-orgy-poetry mix.Celetrial Ocean fixes this. The organ is generally replaced by a moog synthasizer. This has a thicker sound, and gives the album a warmer texture. Flutes chime in on top of the moogs warm blanket.This album also replaces the driving, manic acid funk of Cottonwoodhill with a slower, spacier approach. There is no more feeling that this is a bad trip: this is a nice, relaxed float. The singer still recites her poetry, but her voice acutally soothes this time out. If Cottonwoodhill is bad acid, Celestial Ocean is valum.Either way, this band has earned its place as one of my drugs of choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong Tracks on CD!","review":"Hello? do u know that half the songs arn't even on this cd? the real ones aint even good anyways. check up on the real songs before you spend you bucks on tracks not even on this cd"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great hip-hop compilation!","review":"I love how the Source makes a compilation of great hip-hop joints of the year every year!

Corvinus is a 'vuglar Nick Charles (The Thin Man)' type of character. I simply could not get comfortable with the use of f*** and s***, which are peppered throughout the story. Other overused words include - pal, yeah, uh-uh, okay, right ( as a substitute for yeah). Out of place phraseology include - catch you later, vertically challenged, you've got the ball, and no how, no where. The use of modern dialogue is a distraction and doesn't fit the Roman purple-striper persona.This genre is much better handled by Davis, Saylor and Roberts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read","review":"I am a huge fan of Scottish history especially in the era of Robert The Bruce. Nigel Tranter does another excellent job telling the story of Angus Og in the difficult times in Scotland's push for freedom. The book provides a good amount of detail on life on the islands surrounding Scotland and really brings life during this time period to a reality. It did however, seemingly end abruptly. I was surprised to find that it didn't end with Angus Og's death, but took a different turn. Either way definitely worth your time in reading. If you haven't already checked out the Bruce Trilogy also written by Nigel Tranter, give that a try too!!..

That would be the only reason you are unfamiliar with this album.But wow! This still sounds fresh and relevant 40 plus years later. Stellar from top to bottom. Combines the best of pop, folk, rock, pyschedelia into a package that has few rivals. I would say its darn near perfect...except for Marakesh Express. For whatever reason it seems to throw an odd wrinkle into the flow of this masterpiece for me. But that said, the humanity of it makes it all the more charming and endearing.If you dont have this don't waste another minute.

Science and engineering are missing, in so many ways. Plot continuity is battered at best as is character development. Yet somehow its imperfections are surely akin to the imperfections of any reaction we'd have in a situation like that. The improbable reactions in the plot become believable as we watch the real news and see real politicians willing to cripple America to make a political point.

It deals with a simple premise; a signal of most-likely intelligent origin has been detected from space. How will the world react?In Signals, Kevin D. Randle takes a look at the scientific, military, academic, political, and journalistic communities and how they react to the discovery of a signal that is probably intelligent in origin. Members of each of these communities is highlighted as they try to better their careers with the news or get roped in by it. Randle does an excellent job of predicting how some people would react. From the first hours that the signal is detected all the way to a massive grandstand the story moves through believable paces.At first this seems like a hard-science SF novel, but it really deals very little with the science and pays most of its attention to human nature and reaction. I hope that the other books in this series are as good because it certainly started out on the right foot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Track List is Misleading","review":"I, too, fell for the inaccurate track listing for this CD, whereas the one I received had only 15 songs.

There are 2 very nice ones, however,the beauty \\"I'm Growing Up\\" and \\"He Don't Love Me\\".

Recorded mostly in 1992-93, it culminates the sounds of all the guys who've come together.

It is a truely worthless book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A complete waste of time and money","review":"I thought this book was going to be about servlets and JDBC. The title is completely misleading. Out of 17 chapters there is only 1 chapter on servlets (which mostly just rehashes the sample servlets from Sun), 1 on a JDBC case study, and 4 very basic chapters on JDBC. The other 11 chapters of the book are on the basics of Java, the Internet, using the Java Web Server, and similar introductory subject matter. This seems like one of those books that was published just to make a buck based on a flashy title pertaining to a hot subject area. The only value of this book is as a very basic introduction to JDBC. Other than that the book is completely worthless. I regret having to air such a harsh opinion but I had much higher hopes for a book on this subject matter."},{"rating":"1","title":"A book so bad it is laughable","review":"I got this book from a friend who was going to throw it away. After perusing it, I threw it away. You would learn more about servlets from reading a couple of articles in periodicals!

The author's code is generously shared on a diskette glued to the back cover. For US$50 at least give me the code on CD-ROM!

But it actually does neither of the two. The examples are, well, murky; they use a strange programming style which makes them extremely difficult to follow. It is extremely hard or downright impossible to get anything useful out of this book. At the time it came out it was one of the few titles dealing with these subjects.

It is expensive and useful only as a doorstop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money!","review":"I bought this book several months ago thinking I would get some good information about two subjects that fit well together.

There are upbeat, mellow and poignant songs on the CD and Delp's vocals soar and lament while Goudreau proves to be a stellar guitarist. Brad Delp literally sang more songs for RTZ (featuring Goudreau) than he did for the much more famous band Boston. RTZ was not as consistently good as Boston but many of their exemplary tracks could fit into a Boston CD. Brad Delp had a great career as a singer and he was a longstanding vegetarian and humanitarian. His untimely death makes it imperative for fans to buy all the RTZ CDs. Delp was the voice of Boston and he was perfect for Tom Scholz's multi-instrumental virtuousity and impeccable sound engineering."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you love Boston--try these cds","review":"This sounds exactly like a Boston recording of course with the lead singer and guitar player from Boston in the group. The only thing wrong is that every song sounds the same--not too original. The 2nd cd is exactly as the the 1st with almost the same lineup so why did they not call it an RTZ album?

I got him the set when he was 13 years old. He is now 15 and as tall as me! He plays his drums every day and his old throne was wearing out. The other big problem was that it was too short for him.This throne from Pearl is nice. Heavy weight and it stands a lot taller than his old seat.

I was hoping that there might be more of the passages that bring to mind more of the intrigue, tension, and mystery. That is there, mostly in the passages that cover the train station good bye scene, but overall it has much more of the kind of up beat jazz that when you watch the movie you realize represents the majority of the movie. All that considered, I'd still buy it because at least now I have it, so if you're thinking about it, I'd go ahead and get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Picture and Sound","review":"DVD plays well and has excellent video and audio quality.

I've promisedmyself a copy --- for years . . .UNCOMMON suspense and skill . . ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eye-opener","review":"Great movie to see if you like suspense/espionage. Robert Redford is subtle, yet convincing as the grim-faced CIA member who narrowly escapes a planned hit in this early 70's film directed by the late, great Sydney Pollack. This isn't the action flick for you if you are looking for fast-paced and IN YOUR FACE excitement. This is a classic cat and mouse thriller, with an ending that definitely makes you scratch your head (but in a good way). Excellent cinematography, great action scenes that are effective, but not overly bloody. Nostalgic shots of 70's NYC is a plus. Its absolutely worth spending a few hours of your life with Redford and the immensely creepy Max Von Sydow for this flick."},{"rating":"2","title":"Three Days of the Condor - Great!","review":"This is one of Robert Redford's best suspense films. Paired with Faye Dunaway and Cliff Robertson, this film about intrigue in the intelligence community was a forerunner to today's \\"24.\\" Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absorbing political spy thriller.","review":"This is a very absorbing movie with first-rate performances by the entire cast. You'll see Robert Redford at his best in this one. I was also impressed by Fay Dunaway's performance. She was terrific as the vulnerable kidnapped victim. Max non Sydow was his exceptional self, playing a cool, calculating hit man, Cliff Robertson was perfect as CIA director Higgens, and John Houseman's screen presence was never so obvious as in this film. Honestly, there wasn't a bad performance in the entire movie. This intelligent spy thriller will make you sit up and pay attention as you wonder who in the heck the good guys are, and who, if anyone, can you possibly trust? Between 1 and 10, \\"Three Days of the Condor\\", one of many wonderful Redford/Pollack vehicles, gets a well-deserved 9. Rent it, or buy it. I doubt you'll be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent spy movie","review":"This movie reminds me of the movie \\"A Beautiful Mind\\" and a dozen other movies which tantalize the imagination with \\"big brother' themes. From mathematicians who believe the entire universe can be described using the magic of numbers to religious adherents who see ancient encrypted codes governing the secrets of mankind \\"Three days of the Condor\\" is one of many movies trying to explain that which baffles most people's minds. We drudge the ocean floor seeking rare pearls hidden in the mouths of otherwise practically worthless bivalves and pan for gold in the muddy waters of practically inaccessible waterways and get the notion that what is valuable in life is that which is obscured from normal view. Words and numbers have different meanings to different people and for those seeking secrets hidden in their perceptions of the symbols of the world around us will love this movie"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enviorment","review":"Excellent movie, showing years ago what we are experiencing now with gas and oil prices zooming."},{"rating":"2","title":"A spy thriller classic","review":"Despite the age, this movie holds up extremely well, even the action sequences. Great performances, fabulous cast. I think Redford was at his peak with this movie. He's the smartest guy in the room, but we're with him, following his thinking, which is fun, especially as he uses his wits to keep a step ahead of professionals who are quite sharp themselves. The only thing you'll find dated in this movie is the sideburns, but they're getting to be fashionable again as well, aren't they?Top recommendation from me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good spy thriller.","review":"I must confess, I DO NOT like Robert Redford -- when his name is mentioned in my presence, I immediately get heartburn; however, his performance in this film is superior. If you liked \\"All the President's Men\\", then you'll like Redford in this one too. The story line is a great one, very believeable from my view, and is tastefully and coherently carried out -- much more contemporary than James Bond stuff and, serious, not silly in any way. So, in the end, this DVD is certainly worth buying if you enjoy that CIA film genre. If I did not personally despise Redford, I surely would give this one 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suspense and Intrigue at it's best.","review":"If you like your movies filled with a good story line, suspense, intrigue, and Robert Redford, you'll enjoy this movie. The CIA stuff and a guy stuck between a rock and a hard place make this movie one that you don't want to press the pause key on your remote to get a snack. A movie made in the mid 70's really is a quality film. Great shots of the World Trade Center with a scene actually taken from within one of the Trade Center Towers. Limited profanity and killing. Just enough to give the film the reality to deal with the subject matter. A guy flick for sure, but Redford will not be too hard on the eyes for the women. No disappointment purchasing \\"Three Days of the Condor\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"ONE OF THE FINEST","review":"This classic suspense film was released in a chilling time. Viet Nam was a national, benchmark issue; Columnist Jack Anderson believed his life to be in danger from the government and the CIA was said by some to be involved in illegal plots and intrigues. Redford handles his role superbly; Faye Dunaway as well, and Max Von Sydow is most classy as a skilled, hired assasin. It is difficult to bring to mind a film since made that captures the plot and flow of this one. The suspense is gripping - a tribute to the Redford talent. This is the sort of classic one can view periodically and enjoy all over again. History since adds great irony to the film's premise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent movie of its time","review":"Early 70s, end of Bretton Woods gold standard, US needs, oil for its war in Vietnam and other places and the Saudis agree to only accept US dollars for oil. That's some of the reality behind this story. THe US has to control the Middle East and we have been there ever since, killing and being killed. This movie deserves a good look by anyone interested in what really makes the US tick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Film has not aged well","review":"The first 10 minutes were fast-paced and exciting, but it was downhill after that. The story dragged on and with tighter editing, at least 30 minutes could have been cut and the film would have been much better.The one-night stand with Faye Dunaway was not believable and didn't advance the plot, and even the action scenes were flat. The script was pretty bad, too. At one point, when Dunaway is complaining to Redford about how badly he has treated her, he says \\"At least I haven't raped you,\\" and she replies \\"The night is still young.\\"I saw this film 10 or 15 years ago and it seemed a lot better then than it did this time."},{"rating":"2","title":"3 Days of the Condor","review":"This is my father-in-laws favorite movie, although it isn't my cup of tea. After our VCR ate his VHS tape, I bought the DVD for him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Film Ever on the CIA","review":"Of all the films I've seen on the CIA, \\"Condor\\" is the best, including \\"The Parallax View\\". Superb performance by Redford and savvy direction by Sydney Pollack. \\"Condor\\" captures both the tenderness and depravity of this high stakes, life-or-death universe.There is a fascinating relationship of Von Sydow's Old Europe assassin toward Redford's hunted, harried character: a mixture of cold-blooded detachment and true affection.Perhaps the best exchange is between Redford and Cliff Robertson's CIA case officer who almost justifies the senseless murder of Redford's office mates. Redford intuitively recoils from Robertson's argument with this rejoinder: \\"Boy, have you found a home.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"And the price is right!!!","review":"Great movie but for $122.00 ???

But thanks for commenting.As for the film, I know it won a couple Oscars and all, but I just didn't like it. I thought the editing was poor, that the scenes were long and often unnecessary. Although the story was good, a modern director would have put it together a lot better."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fine piece of escapism ... back to the 70's","review":"An archetypal 70's cerebral CIA thriller. This slow-paced cinematic effort from Sydney Pollack is mostly gripping, but marred by two plot holes. The first is the seeming inability of the CIA to compare the two bullets in the alley shooting -- and discover that they were fired by two different pistols. Oops; I guess that would have taken the focus of guilt off of Redford's character too early in the story. The second hole is the inexplicable reason why Faye Dunaway's character would so quickly submit to the charm of Redford's character, after being kidnapped. A classic example of internalized oppression in women -- in a world where men get what they want, and women too realize the power structure through their own self-imposed subjugation. Other than that, a fine piece of escapism."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another important movie to see...","review":"This movie is as urgent and timeless today as it was forty years ago...

Its interesting to compare this movie's mystery, action and suspense to present day thrillers! Blue work shirts and jeans---simple and sexy, worn very well by Redford, the cars, bikes, computers---fashion and background are nostalgic and fun! Redford's haircut is still better than John Edwards and I don't believe he paid the equivalent of $400--the Male Farrah Fawcett with his blond, feathered locks. Aside from sentiment and looks, the movie definitely shines, and you are rooting for the hero throughout. Quite enjoyable to realize that OIL, politics and power were entangled and continue to be; often the driving force behind present day suspense...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great reference book for China fairings","review":"Fairings (because they were available at fairs) or bed pieces are small groups of gaily colored china figures made for Victorian fairgrounds mostly during the period 1860 to 1890. Despite growing popularity, little is known about them and nothing has previously been written.This book records the author's researches during a period of 30 years and it provides much information that was previously unknown. The fairings provide interesting evidence of the humor and sentiment appreciated by the Victorian masses who flocked to the fiargrounds.

A Harvard professor deserves at least that. Perry Miller's classic introduction to the New England Puritans remains an essential text for anyone seeking to understand the complexities of a much maligned and often misunderstood religious movement. An understanding of the New England Puritans is absolutely essential to an understanding of American History and American society. Miller does not espouse the doctrines of Puritanism; he provides a concise and helpful historical background and then guides the reader through some representative samples of their writing. This is not a book designed to convert someone to Puritanism. A sidenote: The Puritans referred to in this book have not existed for centuries, so I assure you no reviewer of this book actually left the Puritanism described in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A sidenote","review":"I would certainly disagree with Mr. Richard's assessment that the Puritanism of this book no longer exists today. The very reason why Puritan literature and its history is so prevalent today is because so many Christians are reading and following the writings of the Puritans of three centuries ago. That is just not a proper assessment of \\"modern puritanism\\". Yes, much has changed in three hundred years, but not the faith of the Believers who are Reformed in their theology and life. And yes, the Puritans in this book have been dead for a long time, but their writings and the Faith that they passed on is not dead but living strong today."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is so beautiful!","review":"I do love this dainty bracelet.

Thanks Jack!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's on my top-ten worst movie list.","review":"This movie would more aptly be titled 'The Dirge of Narayama'. It was fifteen years ago when I saw this film, and I still remember how awful it was! If you are a Kurosawa fan looking to expand your horizons to include other Japanese films, I would pass this one by. It's slow, disjointed and lacks interest."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Ballad of Narayama is now one of my favorite films.","review":"The Ballad of Narayama is about the harsh realities of life in an impoverished Japanese village in the late eighteen hundreds. Sound boring? It's anything but. Sound depressing? Much of it is, but the overwhelming power of the film left my heart full rather than heavy. If you're looking for an incredibly well made film - brilliantly written, acted, filmed and directed - start here. You'll be glad you did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting character study of a poor community","review":"The story of a small mountain village whose inhabitants must struggle to eke out their meager living. Theft is not tolerated, and the old are left on a mountaintop to die from exposure. This is a fascinating portrayal of how people are sometimes forced by their circumstances to be as merciless as nature itself. It is easy to condemn many of the practices seen in this film, but we are forced to wonder how we might behave if we were similarly deprived. To what extent is our ethics a product of our relatively luxurious lifestyle? It is also interesting to see how various characters face their conditions--some retain their dignity and humanity, while others display what is most ugly and base in human nature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strong woman, lyric, for grown-ups!","review":"I have seen nearly all of Imamura's films, and this one must rank near the top...I think that to understand the films of Imamura is to appreciate through his eyes the strong and lusty women who figure in his every work. This film is of the last year of such a woman's life and of how her profoundly strong will triumphs in its own humble way over the mores of conventional society, nature and human nature.I cannot recommend this film enough to satisfy myself! I would also suggest that to fully appreciate it, his other films must also be seen..."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best movie I've ever seen","review":"This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. It's brutal, but for people who live in this harsh environment these brutal laws are the only chance to survive. I've read many books about the Russian eskimos and the other people of the North who live in similar conditions - they have very similar brutal laws and customs. Strict children selection, severe punisments for theft - all these realities could be found in the North as well. Like in this Japanese village, the old people, when they can no longer work, go to the forest, make the final fire and freeze to death. This movie is not a fantasy, but the reality of survival in the harsh environment. This movie shows how the people live close to the nature, struggle with it, yet truly integrated into it? Excellent staging, great actors make this film a true masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING","review":"The reader is introduced to the realistic workings of police detectives and how they deal with the events. The story moves along well with excellent dialogue, coupled with graphic descriptions of people and places encountered, presents a \\"being there\\" atmosphere for the reader. The characters are depicted as having frailties as well as strong points. One has the feeling of \\"I know that person.\\" As facts unfold, teamed with logic, the outcome may come as a shock to some readers. I found it necessary to digest the last pages several times in order to accept them. To me, this makes for an especially good story. J. McKay writes in a professional manner and hopefully will continue to regale us with more reading. Perhaps even developing some of the characters we met in this epic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Paul, Sam, and the Typewriter.","review":"Paul's story:It all began in 1974 when he came back in the United States. He tells how he got the typewriter, why - later on - he didn't buy an electric typewriter nor a computer like everybody else nowadays. Finally we learn how Sam Messer met the typewriter and how a relationship grew between these two.Sam's story:The illustrations of Sam Messer are the most attractive part of this book. They are not really illustrations but tell a second story of their own.The story of an old and hard working typewriter, battered by the fingers of Paul Auster. A typewriter that suffers pain, hardship and gets angry once in a while.To be honest: this book is a book of art and almost all the credits go to Sam Messer.

The acting was good and the story line was exciting. If your a fan of Alyssa Milano or Ice T it is a must see. Milano is a very underrated actress and not to mention one of the most sexiest around. Ice T is a smooth and very natural actor to watch. I recommend this DVD highly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excitement? Thrills?

I was hooked. The author lets us know many details of her life with her husband, truly a great man -- what a loss to the world is his death. She exhibits great courage, persistence, hope, and appreciation for those who assisted her through this ordeal. I was crying at several points in this book, even at the end, where she includes many of the letters of support she received from people all over the world. The other bus passengers must have wondered what was going on with me as I sat there reading with tears streaming down my face!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a profound and great book","review":"This book does such an immense service in showing us the complex issues surrounding terrorism, hatred and politics that led to the sad murder of Daniel Pearl. Mariane Pearl was so fair in showing that the extremist Muslims who took her husband's life do not represent all Muslims. She showed the beauty of Muslims such as Captain and her husband's Wall Street Journal colleague who worked tirelessly to help find her husband. Most of all, she showed a reservoir of great strength in being fair to the people of Pakistan. She revealed with great clarity the hatred within the nation that has made life dangerous for the country's own citizens, but poetically shared with the reader the fact that there are many fighting within the country to make the streets safer for everyone. The country would be well served to learn from this amazing book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Worth the Read","review":"I requested and received this book for Christmas and finished reading it within just a few days.

Over the years, time and again this book has delivered when I needed some quick facts and a refresher on material I may have learned elsewhere. The best part of it is that it is full of illustrations, important when one is trying to obtain intuition on a subject. Not much is missed here, at least as of the date of publishing. Facts that might require pages and pages to uncover in a more comprehensive title on a subject, e.g., differential calculus, are all packed within a few pages in this title, making it a good reference.I was suprised to see this title is out of print.

The \\"burn, burn, burn\\" is hardly audible and inserted quickly after the second \\"push\\". It's definitely in there though. I say inserted because it's not in the video/dvd version of TSRTS.

Unfortunately I am one of those people and am pretty disapointed with this book.A previous reviewer mentioned duplicate pages and while that is true...the action is so poorly presented I almost didn't notice. But as a TMNT fan who bought this product as a completist I was most disapointed that Casey Jones and Raphael are afterthoughts that are only bit players. Almost like they are in the way of the story that Eastman wanted to tell. I guess to his credit the story in this form is simply called \\"Bodycount.\\"Don't buy this unless you cumpulsively have no choice to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality Craftsmanship","review":"First thing I noticed when I opened Heavy Metal's reprint of TMNT Bodycount was the sound of the spine of the book cracking as the cheap glue holding it together started falling apart. This thing is not well made. On top of that my copy had page 38 reprinted on page 36. I was completely confused as to what was happening in the story until I noticed the error. The story is ultra-violent, over-exaggerated, gun-porn, starring one of the turtles and Casey Jones and really isn't all that great anyway. I could have lived with that if not for the crappy quality of the physical book itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Book","review":"This book was amazing.

It is perfect, spiritually uplifting, and a very appropriate story. Our Ward loved it, and the Primary children sang songs to complement it. Another 8 brethren sang duets and solos of O Come O Come Emmanuel and We Three Kings. Another 3 pianists played music. And a brother played a duet on his small tuba with a piano, and 2 brethren played Silent Night on their acoustic, amplified guitars. All of it was blended with this lovely book's story. One of best Ward Christmas programs EVER!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Perfect Christmas Book","review":"It is so hard with young children to try and separate the secular and the spiritual sides of Christmas.

If you have the opportunity, buy this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb Teaching Tool","review":"We were looking for something that we could use to link Christmas to... Christ. At first I was a little taken back by the simplicity of the text, but after reading is several times, I've found that the simplicity is intentional. The simple statements, just a few words to a page, follow a clear line of thought, and are designed to help the reader teach and make a point. It is NOT a book for pure entertainment. It IS a book for someone that just needs an extra tool to teach a lesson, and does not expect that tool to do all the work.The illustration is superb and also does a great job. The religious imagery is not distracting (like crucifixion pictures that really go for blood,) but helps convey the importance of the subject matter. I strongly recommend the book as it's done great things for our efforts to keep our kids focused on Christ over commercial. After all, it's not the commercial that builds anything worthwhile."},{"rating":"1","title":"save your $$","review":"For me this book is just not worth the money and had I been able to check it out at the library for a preview I probably wouldn't have bought the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"ick!","review":"This book was not at all what I was expecting. I was hoping for something that would keep the magic of Santa alive while still realizing that Christmas is a celebration of Jesus' birth.

I sent it back immediately."},{"rating":"2","title":"The book I've been looking for","review":"This is the book that I have been looking for all my life! The book provides a perfect way to bridge the gap between Santa and Jesus Christ.

The story is told from the perspective of Kate herself and she feels like a real person, someone you'd love to get to know. It's not a lighthearted book, in fact at the end, I was crying.

Worked like normal again for about 2 days. Volume doesn't always work. But I didn't bother to call syntax back since it was a pain.

I am an electronics engr and very heavy into pro audio so my gear is wired properly and protected against surges and spikes better than most commercial installations. Getting a replacement works from them, but is very slow and cumbersome and they are very difficult to work with. Regarless of that, three failures on three units in 11 months is just unacceptable.

It is a \\"Best Buy\\" in my book, plus March 2007 Consumers Reports gave the Olevia a pretty good review.There are two annoyances that leave it short of five stars: (1) the TV is not able to be controlled by my Comcast-provided remote, and the Olevia remote can't be programmed to control all the features of the cable box - therefore I have to use two remotes; (2) there is a piercing blue light that emits from the on/off switch when the TV is turned off, so if you have this TV in the bedroom, you'll have to put a little piece of black electrical tape over the light because it is so uncomfortably bright."},{"rating":"1","title":"obscure instructions","review":"I bought an olevia 32 inch and while I like many things about it, the jacks available on the back have no real markings for use that I understand.

Darker is another failed attempt on my part to enjoy his work with the exception of The Tower. I thought I would love a novel about a force that chases down and literally crushes people flat but this, like most of the Clark novels I've read, just seemed sooooooooooooo drawn out and I wanted it to end. There comes a point in certain books where it becomes a challenge to me to finish and that's when I decide it is a bad book. This one was especially difficult because I had already read a couple bad novels by this guy. Still, I am a horror fan and I have time to get to all of it before I die, at least hopefully, and I'm glad I read Darker even though I pretty much hated it.

Add Cray's superb guitar playing and you have a prime sample of the above musical phrase. At 14 songs this hits all but one of his albums up to 1997's Sweet Potato Pie. Oddly, one album is missing representation: 1995's fine Some Rainy Morning. Surely, Mercury could have included a track like \\"Never Mattered Much\\" as this CD clocks in at just under 60 minutes. Still, if you think you're interested in Cray and aren't sure where to start, this is the one.

A welcome effort shows a great talent...","review":"Having had the opportunity to hear Ms. Bode live, I eagerly awaited her first release. Alas, though having some bright moments, overall it left an impression of sounding forced and a bit too \\"earnest\\". This release is a huge leap forward, and should be a \\"BUY NOW WITH ONE CLICK!\\" to anyone who's found Norah Jones or more \\"mainstream jazz\\" singers worth listening to- Bode's voice is clearly more technically capable than Jones, and is thankfully missing the by-the-numbers feel one finds in so much of Diana Krall's work. While I'm a big Cassandra Wilson fan, Bode's work is certainly more accessible, without being too saccharine (barring perhaps her lost love lament \\"St. Louis Song\\"). I can't give it 5 stars, because this is no \\"Graceland\\"-- though her wonderful interpretation of Simon's classic alone makes the disc worth buying.

He is a charmless interpreter whose tendency is either to be rigid and fierce or else bland and slack, depending on his mood. He never assayed any work of Mahler's beyond this proficient, hasty Sym. #1, which is almost astonishing in its impatience and complete lack of sympathy with Mahler's idiom. Een with the gorgeous Philadelphia Orch. playing quie well, thre's no humor, nuance, insight, or joy -- just a fast rush-hour traversal that wastes everyone's time.

Almost unrecognizable from the same 3/5 of a band that brought you \\"Invisible Touch,\\" this goes everywhere and has a damn good time doing so. I particularly like \\"Get 'em Out by Friday\\" and \\"Horizons,\\" a beautiful short guitar piece from the bespectacled, shy Hackett. \\"Can-Utility\\" has an awesome guitar/keyboard interplay in the second half and sweeps you up in the drama, while the opening \\"Watcher\\" is a bit overrated, I think, although the spooky Mellotron opening is captivating (and better done on Genesis Live)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breathtaking!","review":"As said in most of the other reviews, while the production may seem shaky at times, it is made up for with the sheer musical brilliance put forth in every aspect of the music found on \\"Foxtrot\\".

It contains the classic 'Supper's Ready', the 23 min. epic that epotimizes early Genesis, containing incredible dynamics, intricate song structure, raw power and emotion. The best Genesis song ever. All of the rest of songs are excellent too, containing the classics: Watcher Of The Skies (the perfect opener) and Get 'Em Out By Friday. Two unterrated greats: Time Table (a bit flat, but one of the most intricate Genesis songs) and the great Can-Utility And The Coastliners (A masterful blending of acoustic and electric driven by exclent melodies and ending in a wonderful crescendo).

Genesis's \\"Foxtrot\\" continues the direction of the second and third album with this third album. The album begins with beautifully disembodied drowns and then drifts into the first track, \\"Watcher of the Skies\\", It has an aggressive sound that is delicate and pastoral. \\"Suppers Ready\\" is the album's highlight; running 23 min. demonstrates the bands musicianship and upbeat insanity. \\" Get'em out by Friday\\", another great track, is a venture of the conceptual pop song contained in the conceptual album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bliss","review":"Simply wonderful stuff, this.Being such a fan, an objective review is probably out of the question.Indulge yourself if you are interested in this era, and the wonderful musicians that abounded.It, as with its early sister albums, combines classical themes from all the arts, and is an absolute 'must buy'This band were amongst the pioneers, if not the leading light in their genre.Do yourself a favour and explore the inspired genius that was, Genesis."},{"rating":"2","title":"You won't be disappointed if you like 'real' music","review":"After getting hooked into the Selling England by the Pound, I purchased Nursury Cryme and Foxtrot.

You feel like you are reading a fairy tale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my cup of tea at all","review":"Have had Genesis albums for years and loved them especially Selling England by the Pound, but this one does not do it for me. Perhaps you need to be in the right mind space?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perhaps a little over rated, but good","review":"This is a good cd from the Gabriel era but I think it gets a little over rated here. Watcher of the skies is the best song on the cd. Supper's ready is the best for 15 minutes, but takes off on a tangent for a couple of minutes. The rest of the song's are good, not great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Imagination, Innovation","review":"You listen to albums like \\"Foxtrot\\" and you mourn for the lack of imagination and creativity in most of today's music. There are parts of \\"Foxtrot\\" that are a tad over the top and a wee bit silly, but the sheer nerve and verve, the willingness to take chances and the musical virtuosity effectively more than compensate. I understand that \\"Foxtrot\\" will be getting another sonic makeover early in 2008. I hope more care is rendered to that project than the current (2007) re-issues from the Phil Collins era which lost too much of their musicality in a sea of increased volume and sonic compression. If they are going to tinker with \\"Foxtrot\\", let's hope they tinker lightly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Horizon's Bright","review":"I owned this album, and I love it. Phil Collins' drumwork is splendid, as is Gabriel's lead vocals andBanks' synthesizer work. I especially love Hackett'sclassical nylon solo on \\"Horizon's\\". A must-have forGenesis lovers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome All Purpose Cart","review":"This cart is awesome.It's lightweight, compact and easy to open. It rolls well even with over-sized items."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy Solder Points","review":"I bought 2 of these for work, we carry computers around a university campus. One broke after less than 10 uses. The platform solder points broke off, so now there is no more platform. The other is still holding on to dear life, but its also about to go. Adjusting the straps is a nightmare, you are better cutting the strap off, and using your bungie cords. We were pretty careful with these units, only used a few times, pretty dissappointed in how little they lasted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Samsonite Luggage Cart - It's a good product","review":"The Samsonite luggage card is a good durable product and is performing well on a daily basis. Slightly larger wheels and more adjustment in the strap would be welcome.

I just left it at the airport!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great for people under 5 ft 9 inches MAYBE","review":"This appears to be reasonable for someone shorter than me (a not so very tall 6 foot 1 inch). As it is, it is just too short to be comfortable to use. If I stand such that the handle is meeting more than the last joint of my fingers, the cart is standing almost upright and is prone to fishtailing and jerking along in this configuration. I was surprised to see that there was not another sliding element to provide adjustable length.I would have been satisfied (I think) with its construction, but this limiting design doesn't permit me to use it. It would frankly be just as easy to carry parcels up to 25 pounds rather than subject myself to the knuckle-dragging gait that would be required for me to drag them in this cart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost ---but not quite!---perfect","review":"This is a very sturdy little cart and folds easily for storing. Amazon sells 2 models of this cart. I chose this one b/c it holds more weight than the other one. BUT the strap for securing the luggage to the cart is a major PIA. It's adjustable but does not stay adjusted and readjustment is very tedious. I'd suggest buying this cart but also using a common bungee cord for securing the luggage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Raving about Cliff","review":"Cliff Eberhardt has such a gift of crafting words into song that create not only a story, but emotion.

The product is great accept that I can't find replacement bulbs for it so it makes it a one time use and thats not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't find replacement bulbs","review":"I purchased this for my orchids. The bulbs have burned out and for the past 7 or 8 months I have been trying to find replacements. They are specially made by the company for the box, so I can't purchase regular grow lights to put in the unit. The PlantNanny website has been stating since January that they will have replacement bulbs in by April. It is now July. I moved my orchids outside for the summer, but don't think I will be abe to use this box for them this fall and winter.

I look forward to reading more of these in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thinking Outside the Box","review":"This is just the coolest product. But since I'm kind of over the whole CD player thing I decided to get it and adapt it for my MP3 player. It works PERFECTLY. I just, very easily, removed the CD pages (they were only sewed in and so I was able to take a seamripper to the stitches without damaging the case AT ALL). It is the perfect size for my (rather large) Creative Zen Vision W, the USB cable, RCA cords, and my earphones (which are the supraural type, I HATE earbuds). And if I want to travel with all the acoutrements all I need to do is take the player out (since it does actually have it's own case) and I'd have plenty of room for the car adapter and the power supply. And the speaker jack has a long enough cord that if I did that I could clip the MP3 player to the handle and STILL use the speakers. This is a great product and you CAN'T beat the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"A GREAT CD","review":"I love the Manhattan Transfer. I have their Anthology CD. But this CD is special. In my opinion it is a must for anyone who likes this type of music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Far from their best","review":"I am a great fan of the Manhattan transfer but can attest that this is not one of their better efforts. Most of the tracks sound like a high school glee club with bland, sometimes downright silly, arrangements and none of the complex styling that made them one of the best vocal groups in the business. \\"Let's Hang On\\" and \\"Along Came Mary\\" are hard to listen to without cringing and \\"God Only Knows\\" sounds like someone doing a parody of their style. The high point is \\"The Thrill Is Gone\\" which is good enough to be on any of their other CDs. This will only appeal to someone who has never heard their music and doesn't know just how fine Manhattan Transfer can be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somnambulistic","review":"The opening track, Let's Hang On, written to be sung by a man to a woman, is re-arranged for a man/woman duet in a way that destroys the meaning of the lyrics. The instumental portion is bland-ified in a way that is also completely out of touch with the original. And the rest of the CD goes downhill from there. It comes off as a bunch of hits arranged so as to be \\"safe\\" enough for the playlist at a smooth jazz station, and it just puts me to sleep. Not anywhere near the calibre of other Manhattan Transfer recordings."},{"rating":"2","title":"War on a Sub is Something Else","review":"Very interesting book. Momentum builds as you get into book and goes strong through the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Guess What?","review":"Through my own fault, I didn't check out some of this album on You Tube. I had really liked some of this group's earlier work, but when this arrived I was thoroughly disappointed. When I sent it in for one of Amazon's fantastic returns (the best of ANY business!), they replied \\"you've been such a loyal customer that we'll give you the refund and you can keep the item!\\" So I gave it to a friend, which made him happy, made me happy. Amazon totally rocks! And I have no personal nor stock interest in them! Doing business with any other online source makes absolutely no sense so long as Amazon matches or beats their prices.

The cleaner does clean well, however, minutes after opening it and taking it out of the box, the plastic on the lid cracked. I've used it possibly 10 times now and every time the crack on the lid webbed out more and more. Today, on the 11th use, the lid broke off completely. Now, before accuse me of manhandling the machine in order to break it, you should know that I store it under the sink and gently lift it out from under the sink with each use (realizing how fragile it was with the first use). So now it's completely unusable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality edition","review":"The particular edition I have seen (Timeless Video) is unwatchable. Apparently they recorded it from a television broadcast. After the first 23 minutes of this 55 minute feature, the top half of the screen is occupied by VCR data.The movie itself is Cocteau's first effort, and the half I was able to see in this edition is a bit primitive, though one already sees visual themes used to great effect in Orpheus."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why take orders that can't be filled???","review":"I have heard many complaints as to the condition of packing of the Atar Wars Unleashed figures.

My best friend was notified that Amazon would not be filling his order for these which leaves me to ask..\\"Why take orders that cannot be filled?\\" It's like overbooking an airline flight. There are X amount of seats (or in this case figures), yet orders are still taken and many people end up getting screwed by believing that they will be receiving their items long after the opportunity has passed to buy from someone else.

It deems a single parent family as a \\"lesser\\" family. This is not a message I would want to convey to a potential or new single mother, no less a child in a single parent home. I am certain their are financial and other struggles in dual parent homes just as frequently as in single parent homes. I am also certain that many single parents by choice are able to make that choice because they are financially stable and have excellent support systems. I am certainly interested in having more books out there that support alternative families. This is not one of them.

The disk is of incredibly poor quality. The vocals are hard to hear, drowned out by the overpowering tin sound of the accompaniment. It's impossible to enjoy the music when you can't hear the words and the little you can hear is mush. Very very dissapointed. We're returning ours asap."},{"rating":"2","title":"the original Key to Ascension","review":"Some may disagree with me, but one of the reasons this Yes live album still outdoes the others they've released is the aforementioned cruddy sound quality. It may not sound pristine and pure, but the music SOUNDS live, not like a studio set with a live audience cut in the way their other live discs sound. It's raw, it has mistakes (check out Jon Anderson's hoarse gasp on \\"Starship Trooper\\"), it features great moments of individual virtuosity (Chris Squire's bass solo on \\"The Fish,\\" a Bill Bruford drum solo and, natch, a Rick Wakeman keyboard extravaganza), and it never fails to remind you that \\"progressive\\" doesn't mean \\"bloodless.\\" Get this album and, to coin a heavy metal axiom, CRANK IT UP!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes - live and rocking!","review":"Yes captured at it's popularity peak on tour in 1972 and 1973. Having recently released _The Yes Album_, _Fragile_ and _Close to the Edge_ - the band performs these songs with immaculate energy. The crowds are enthusiastic as well, evident during bassist Chris Squire's solo 'The Fish'. Steve Howe's playing is fantastic during 'Yours Is No Disgrace', where he seems to push things to another level during electric guitar solos.For the fans familiar with the studio albums, 'And You And I' may be disappointing, as this early version began with 'The Apocalypse'. Similarly, Starship Trooper is disappointing in it's instrumental Wurm. The sound quality was somewhat botched in production, but it has improved greatly with remastering."},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterpiece - A Classic","review":"This is a true masterpiece from beginning to end. It's YES at it's peak. No matter how many times you hear the heart pounding \\"Roundabout\\" or the enchanting \\"And You & I\\", you'll always be transported far away. This music was called progressive almost 30 years ago and it still is with all it's melodic and instrumental complexity and harmonic excellence. But also we are reminded of real music and good musicians as we have to remember that this is a live album in which the YES members played with no aide what so ever (Lip sync or tracks as it's commonly done today). In an era where \\"plastic\\" music is on the rise and the likes of The Spice Girls or Brittney Spears are enjoying enormous popularity, I always enjoy the soul cleansing experience of this album from YES who's music has proven to be timeless. If you don't believe me, just sit down and listen to \\"Close to the Edge\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"More Bruford","review":"Like the previous reviewer, I also just saw Yes (Anderson, White, Howe and Squire) and I miss Bill Bruford on drums.

Nobody does a drum roll like Bruford..."},{"rating":"1","title":"No","review":"Giving one star for some vague remembrance of the remarkable original studio recordings of these tracks, which still raise a hair or two for a few seconds when heard on this album, especially \\"Close to the Edge\\", and why I thought this album sounded so good on vinyl 30 years ago, which it probably did.Leaves me to the conclusion of a horrible job of remastering, which makes this album barely inaudible at times. It sounds like it was remastered in a dank basement filled with old aluminum pots. Absolutely no depth, bottom or dimension to the music.Your equalizer won't help you here. I took it out of my player twice....just couldn't get through it. It actually hurt.Excuse me, I need to go back to studying the return policy for opened recorded music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very impressive","review":"This was one of my first Yes experiences. I had been a Bruford fan for some time, and I knew that he drummed for some of these tracks. I found, however, that Bruford was the drummer for only two of the tracks. The rest was done by none other than Alan White.At face value, I was sorely disappointed. Once I gave it a listen, I was not too sad. This may be a bold statement, but I almost enjoyed \\"Roundabout\\" better this way. Bruford sounded very precise on the studio cut, and very tasteful, don't get me wrong. Alan White's drumming seemed to be more projectory, and lively; coming in on the ride cymbal instead of the hihats made it sound huge!The best track does involve he that is Bill Bruford, and that is \\"Perpetual Change\\". The song as a whole; great music, great solos, but most importantly, great melody. The chorus of the song is extremely beautiful.By far, one of the best live performances I have heard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes, but...","review":"Truly an amazing performace at the time, this recording is lacking in sonic quality.

Ok now I'm an old guy.When I saw yes perform in 1977 at Colt Park in Hartford, they opened with Siberian Khatru. And it sounded just as it does on Yessongs. Starship Trooper, Yours is No Disgrace, all were perfect and beautiful.All the rest of the songs on this album really do sound as the group sounded in it's prime, at the time. I saw them many times, but Colt Park was the best - It must have been the lasers...This is a really fantastic album.

I use this \\"cleaning wipe\\" to clear off all of the dust and dirt that accumulates on the surfaces of my car's interior, and then I use the protectant wipe:Armor All(tm) Protectant Wipesto give it a shine. The combination works well and leaves the car looking clean for a decent amount of time.My only complaint about these is that they usually dry up before I get through the whole bottle of wipes. The cap isn't the tightest closing lid I've ever seen (and I'm sure the Florida heat doesn't help, though I usually store them indoors).Overall, however, I do recommend these as you can get several cleanings out of them, they leave the car very clean, and they are much cheaper than paying someone to detail your car for you.

A Jersey Shore mansion overlooking the ocean, it is inhabitied by a group of close friends and seems the perfect spot to recover from her divorce.When Cole Perelle, a young doctor, arrives at the beach house, he and Kit immediately strike up a special, close friendship.It is a friendship so valuable that neither is willing to risk it by acting on the intense attraction that develops between them. Their intertwined lives begin to echo the rhythms of the waves on the beach as they come together, pull away and come together again.

It is the most durable, has a good texture, and the texture on the ball last longer than any other. The multi color may scare you away at first (it is what kept me from trying it for so long). But once you try it you will love it. It makes it easy to see the ball, as well as easy to see the degree of rotation on the ball. It does not get a lump in it as often as others when a frustrated teammate kicks it HARD with a toe. As a note lumps develop in rubber balls from internal bruises, these usually don't cause a lump for 24 hours. The only con is it is usually $19.99. Whereas other balls are usually 16.99 on sale.

The first disc is a comprehensive summary of the early years. Stevie really adds some special touches to Dylan's Blowin' In The Wind and the Beatles We Can Work It Out. Discs two and three are just full of prime time material. My gosh almsot the entire Innervisions record is on here. I Believe really stands out here with its softer and spunkier attributes. The Songs In The Key Of Life tracks are a great pleasure as well. Then there's the lovely regaae flavored Jammin'. The fourth disc does drop off a bit and I am a little dissappointed that only one track from the badly underrated Conversation Peace CD was Included.

In order for many artists' box sets to sell, they need to add unreleased material. What one notices about this box is the fact there is virtually no unreleased material and yet one does not feel cheated. The CDs are packed to the gills and there is no stretching or padding. The four CDs are well paced and selected.One correction to one of the reviewers: Master Blaster Jammin' is on the box (there are 16 tracks on disc three).Even though there are no unreleased cuts, there are a few rarities: Until You Come Back To Me (That's What I'm Gonna Do) is from the deleted Looking Back (3 LP anthology). Fingertips (Pts I & II) is the full seven minute version remixed from the original 3 track tapes. Ribbon In The Sky is a slightly extended version.Terrific sound with a wonderful booklet with tons of photos. This is a box set worth every penny.

That made no sense at all. Gabriel's idea that he will go insane because it will be inherited from his mother was really absurd. It was not believeable at all.

It is not a \\"click\\" together house. You need an electric screwdriver to go into the plastic as there are no pre-drilled holes. My family played poker on christmas eve with the first two people out having to assemble the house... luckily I didn't lose! But boy was my sis mad!!! It took her all night (plus some help!) since she didn't know how to use the electric drill. But once she got it up- it has been great.

It was very easy to put together we had it up in less than 30 minutes. Great features with the doorbell and mail slot and phone. Wish the faucet clicked together with the sink better though they really need to rethink that. You will need a electric screwdriver or Drill because if they had predrilled holes the screws wouldn't grip in the plastic very well.

Ellis is a fine guitarist, and this CD plays to his strengths -- technical skills with material to match. He's also a more-than-capable singer who's voice can mix well with the hard-edged blues sound, but the focus of the CD is pretty much his guitar work. Of particular note are the opening track, \\"To the Devil for a Dime\\" as well as \\"Wanted Man,\\" \\"Cut You Loose\\", \\"The Next Miss Wrong,\\" and \\"When I Howl\\" (which features howling that makes my dog look quizzically at the speakers). Also worthwhile are two somewhat softer arrangements, \\"The Sun Is Shining\\" and \\"Mercy Mercy Mercy\\" (a cover of the Zawinul & Zawinul classic). Bottom line: if you like your blues delivered in an electric-guitar driven arrangement with above-average musicianship, you'll like this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"As raw as they come...","review":"Georgia's best kept secret,Tinsley Ellis,can easily stand alongside Clapton or Gary Moore.This 1994 offering represents the fruits of a live in the studio recording with a band that decided to strip down to the essentials:smoking guitar licks and a tight rhytm section.Featuring Derek Trucks as a guest,this album is so good that it might actually be true!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Still Cookin' The Blues!","review":"Tinsley Ellis has truly grown better with the years!

This is a much more calmer and mature INTRO. This album seems to reflect a collage of peaks and valleys that the group may have experienced before Kenny's death.

They even resisted the urge to jack up the volume. The jacked up volume scourge has ruined the dynamic range of many remasters and new issues in the last 7-10 years.

Using the two perspectives of story telling in the form of myth and parable Anderson and Foley explore how our stories motivate the rituals we perform both liturgically and in our day to day lives. In doing so we find how our humaness can weave with the divine. Understanding this is what can lead effective pastoral care. They review corporate rituals of baptism, marraige and funeral, but also discuss the need for ritual in the context of divorce, miscarraige and chronic illness. They also discuss reconciliation as an honest process of listening to the stories of others. This book is highly recommended for pastors and Christian lay persons."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mighty Good, Dangerously Accurate","review":"Anderson and Foley do a wonderful job of collecting stories and demonstrating how important these stories become in the lives of those who have shared and or experienced them. The beauty of this book is that they allow the reader to see themselves in the stories, these are not only the stories of the people mentioned in them, but they are the stories of all of us in one way or another, to one degree or another. Finally, they relate to the reader how the stories of us help to define ourselves.

In the liner notes, she cites Preston Reed as an influence, but, for me, she is lightyears from Reed. Reed is impressive one song at a time, but after a short while all his songs start to sound alike. King has a better sense of melody, and makes better use of dynamics, much more like Leo Kottke. Her faster songs have drive, and all of her songs have an organic flow. Her slower songs, like \\"Can The Gwot Save Us\\", remind me a lot of The Durutti Column. At 45 minutes, the album is on the short side, but that's better than over-staying your welcome, which she certainly does not. When she leaves, you'll still be happy she stopped in, and will look forward to her next visit."},{"rating":"1","title":"a CD that must be heard to be believed","review":"Simply the worst solo acoustic guitar CD ever recorded.No groove.

I must say that anyone who passes over this album claiming that it's just another collection of technical exercises simply doesn't get the artist. A brilliant album in my humble opinion. Perhaps for those with keener depth perception. Kaki King's work is much more than the sum of her skills."},{"rating":"1","title":"disgusted","review":"As the mother of an 8 year old girl who is learning to play the guitar, I was so thrilled that my daughter had a \\"role model\\" female guitarist to look up to in Kaki King.What was I supposed to think, when my daughter asked me to explain something on Kaki's website. I thought it would be a guitar question, but she wanted to know what the word \\"orgasm\\" meant. I was stunned to read this at Kaki King's question and answer web page (direct quote): \\"a little awkward when you want to spend the night getting trashed in dim bars. When 50 cent signed my t!t$ I had an orgasm.\\"I don't know a lot about acoustic guitar music, and acoustic guitar players. We are parents to children who are bombarded with inappropriate messages. To read this filth at the website of a \\"female role model\\" guitarist is shocking.We will never buy another Kaki King CD ever again."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a good CD","review":"I don't know if I'd go so far as to say this is the worst solo guitar recording ever made. Of all the CDs I own, that distinction probably goes to Esteban. But Kaki King gives \\"Zorro\\" a run for his money here.Everything about this CD is bad: the sound of the guitars (thin, processed, brittle); the playing (sloppy, uninspired, poor sense of timing); the songs themselves (unoriginal, predictable, boxy). And then there's Kaki's attempt at singing, which is really quite embarrassing.Most other artists don't record CDs unless and until they've earned the right to do so after years of practice and dues-paying.Sounds to me like Kaki King has started her recording career about ten years too early."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst guitar recording ever","review":"Some people may call Kaki King \\"Kaki Queen,\\" but who cares what her family and friends think! There are a lot of people who use other words to describe her, and they're not very flattering.But more to the point, this cd is nothing but guitar noodling. They're not even real compositions. It's embarrassing to compare Kaki King to any of the \\"real\\" solo acoustic players because she is SO inferior - as a player, as a composer, as an original voice.And then there's her singing. Terrible singing. Terrible voice.This is without a doubt the worst guitar recording ever released."},{"rating":"2","title":"Music To Make Us Longer","review":"Beautiful guitars: a must for any layered guitarwork fan. The playing is superb, featuring playing that runs the gamut from delicate and expressive to the loudest dynamic range of the instrument.The song, as opposed to the instrumentals, is a bit weak. It sees to me that Kaki was still developing her songcraft at this point, and I'm glad that she continued because, as her other albums have shown, it has only gotten stronger.All in all, this is the album that I continually return to in her catalog. It has continued to captivate me since my first listen, and it has become an album I return to for inspiration when recording my own music.A note on the engineering: the album is listenable, but I wish that the engineering had been better. I feel many of the the tracks would have benefited from better tracking, mixing, and mastering... I'm a bit picky when it comes to such talented players and would have liked to hear more of the detail Kaki is capable of in the final product."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I could give lower, I would","review":"Never in the history of the instrument has anyone this amateurish gotten this much exposure.Unlike Michael Hedges, who added a percussive style to an existing musical foundation, King, like Preston Reed, show only novel skills and no depth of musical understanding.In layman's terms, Kaki King, creates nothing more than noise with her guitar."},{"rating":"1","title":"you call this music?","review":"This CD must be an aberration. Or else it must be a joke.How this girl got a record deal is beyond me. I have heard high school kids who write better songs, and who have better knowledge of the instrument.This CD is bogus. I think the people who think of Kaki King as some great guitar player know zilch about artists like Preston Reed and Adrian Legg. She is totally unoriginal. Her songs are unlistenable. Kaki King doesn't deserve to clean up the nail clippings of guitarists like Don Ross or Leo Kottke.This is music for people who are musically illiterate.I agree with the reviewer below who said this is the worst solo acoustic guitar music ever recorded.Awful.Avoid at all cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Stars","review":"Blatent ripoff of Preston Reed/ Hedges. She has no soul her \\"music\\" has no feeling. She tries to come on the scene calling everyone else who plays solo acoustic \\"New Age\\". There is no originality and it matters not whether she is a she or he, there is nothing original about this at all. Her technique is nothing more than a gimmick, whereas hedges/reed use that style as a means of accomplishing things musical that would have otherwise been impossible. Try as she may to be the hot girl w/ attitude (who also listens to stravinsky and is therefore artistically legit), she is not an original."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wanky dreck.","review":"There's a reason that solo instrumental performance has fallen by the wayside, with the exception of Kaki King -- It's boring and is only interesting to the person playing it and other instrumentalists. Not only this, but it's terribly unoriginal; Kaki King owes quite a bit to Michael Hedges, who, contrary to popular belief, is just as wanky, self-indulgent, and uninteresting as Yngwie Malmsteen or Allan Holdsworth. This is a musical one-trick pony. This is the equivalent of a seal balancing a ball on its nose -- Novel entertainment, but nothing of any true substance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Phenomenal!","review":"I have been listening to this over and over!

She is a watered down version of Preston Reed. All this talk of Kaki King being original is utter nonsense. If you listen to all her music, and take away what was ripped off from Preston Reed, you're left with music that puts you into a new age stupor - the very thing Kaki King so arrogantly says about the music of other solo guitarists. Talk about the pot calling the kettle black!I'd give her time - a LOT more time - before she figures out how to sound like herself. I've been listening to solo acoustic guitar all my life, so I know that of which I speak. Kaki King's music is weak, unoriginal, and oh so verrry New Agey."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wanna Be Hedges","review":"This girl is such an obvious Hedges ripoff, it's not even funny. I mean, it's like listening to someone who took every one of his recordings and tweaked them a tiny bit and renamed them. I don't know why that bothers me so much other than the lack of authenticity.

The mark of a bad Michael Hedges impersonator, or in this case, a bad Preston Reed impersonator, is developing all the technique with none of the emotion or musicality.The music on this CD sounds like it was played by a robot.If there were a \\"Gong Show\\" for solo guitarists, Kaki King would be the perfect contestant."},{"rating":"1","title":"outraged","review":"I am the mother of an eight year old girl who takes guitar lessons.

She read about this - of all places - on Kaki King's website, in her question and answer area. Kaki describes in detail how she opened her blouse so 50 Cent could sign his autograph on her, and she achieved climax. Except Kaki's language is filthy.This artist is NO role model for anyone, least of all young girls. She has every right to say what she wants on her website. Our family loves acoustic guitar music.

I just listened to this re-mixed album all the way though a couple of times - and I have to say, it is a vast improvement from the original mix. The music and vocals are \\"crisper\\". Background stuff is clearly heard. It just sounds so clean, but with the original anolog sound (yes, there are bits and pieces of distortion in there, like on the original album). The stereo mixing is superb - I'm impressed.

It's pointless to name the highlights here, it's all classic Genesis at the top of their game and being very prog., doing what they do best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Genesis' finest hour","review":"I believe this album to be Genesis at their peak. It sounds nothing like anything they had produced before or after. It was Pete's swan song. I still listen to it and sometimes find it hard to believe that this was the same band that put out \\"Selling England...\\", etc. It's very different and it stands alone. For a lot of people, this seems to be the last Genesis album they pick up. The story IS very strange but I think it still holds up. Why a concert of it wasn't filmed, in it's entirety is a damn shame! They performed it 102 times - the WHOLE thing from \\"The Lamb\\" to \\"It\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding musicianship, Incredible songcrafting","review":"This album lies among the finest progressive works of its era. This is Peter Gabriel unleashed. The album is itself an experience which sort of gets through your senses in layers as you listen to this masterpiece again and again. Tony Banks is an incredible musician on those keyboards, both acoustic (Anyway) and electronic (The Supernatural Anesthesist). Hacket has some of his finest moments here along with his strings in \\"Selling England\\", and Collins begins to stand out as a singer. The album is simply one of the Best-10 of Progressive Rock, ever!. Careful, if you come from listening to Peter Grabriel's \\"So\\", or the late Phil Collins's work, this album may be a big disappointment to you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like a fine wine, Lamb gets better with time!","review":"I was fortunate enough to see this performed live in NYC at the Accademy of Music in lower Manhattan in December of 1974.

On the back of the CD, it says Definitive Edition Remaster, but the sound quality is, as I've mentioned, poor. Also, on the back, where it claims to be a Definitive Edition Remaster, it lists all the band members except Peter Gabariel -- which is a bit odd, as this was his last album with Genesis.The U.S. version does list Gabriel, which is one way of telling this is the real thing. Don't get the Argentina version, as it is not worth your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nobody lying down here!","review":"This album is one of the classic rock operas of our (late Baby Boomers) generation. It is a little know piece by fans of Genesis except for the fans of early Genesis music. The story that is told through fun and intriguing lyrics and the complexity of the music, place this piece in a true classical genre along with Philip Glass' Einstein on the Beach, 1000 Airplanes on the Roof and Monsters of Grace. I actually got to see \\"the lamb\\" album live. Peter Gabriel was brilliant! But he couldn't have done this without the rest of the band. I lost all my vinyl albums in a flood years ago so to hear it after so much time was beyond words. This is music to be savored and enjoyed in one sitting.

The only song I really like a lot is the title track. The album is overly lavish and artificially grandiose.

I'm not a huge fan of Peter Gabriel either; I prefer Phil Collins."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's always great to go back","review":"I purchased Lamb Lies Down on Broadway after a good friend turned me on to Genesis via this album, which turned my sister who was older than me on to them and well the rest is history.

Now I'm listening to it at least twice a week."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic tunes, superb lyrics!","review":"This concept album tells a disturbing, fascinating tale which ends as it begins leaving you in a state of abeyance. There are a variety of different sounds; from definitive 70's prog rock to melodious haunting songs. It could probably be put under the umbrella \\"prog rock\\" but has heavy psychedelic overtones. Good use of piano, that is seriously lacking in today's rock music. My favourite tracks are \\"Anyway\\" and \\"It\\". I first listened to this album in 1980 - it blew my socks off then and it is still my favourite album of all time. It is quite possible that it could be re-discovered by youngsters of today, who are getting into the British retro scene, and enjoy bands like Kula Shaker, Supergrass and Mansun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Genesis. Ambitious album almost spot on.","review":"If you like Genesis or Peter Gabriel at all and haven't listened to this album, then you'll be delighted when you do. The title track is well known and played on the radio frequently but I don't think it really is representative of the whole album. The other songs on the album are really chunky stuff with outstanding instrumentals and lyrics. I hightly recommend this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"DOES the LAMB LIE?","review":"This was my first exposure to Genesis. It was kinda,werid,reading the album cover,who is Rael? Being a musician I marveledat it. The songs may have been avarage sounding, but the meterand lyrics,just wonderfull. Collins drumwork, for all youdrummers that have a double pedal,listen to Collins doing12/8 and 11/8, doing a single pedal form of this syncopation!(Side 1, 3rd song) Wow!! Rutherford's bass lines are notto shabby either. At that time we had big speakers in ourstereo system,so those bass pedals came out!!! I went outand bought a set of bass pedals. Getting back to the music,you have to remember ,this was a very difficult time for Genesis,plus Gabriel's wife was expecting and those instrumentalparts are Banks all the way.Its worth the collection, a grounbreaking effect for this great band."},{"rating":"1","title":"New mix SUX!

I've listened to the entire disc and compared to the CD of the original mastering, this newly mastered mix sucks azz. The fades from song to song are abrubt at best it does not flow. There are MANY things I was hoping to still hear that are not even in the mix anymore. It doesn't even sound like its in stereo for most of the disc. I could go on and on and spend days comparing and citing examples but suffice it to say this is my all time favorite record, ive listened to it at least a thousand times maybe more, I pretty much know it by heart from start to finish and this new mix it just terrible.

I first heard it at 17 years of age in 1987 and it took me about ten listens to get \\"into\\" it. This is not Justin Timberlake and it is not Beyonce Knowles. It is so different to anything you hear on FM radio that it will be a shock to the system for a while. I have read here that it can be compared to Mozart of 200 years ago and I would agree. A few of the instrumentals on disc two go on a little bit, but that only takes its vote down from eight stars to seven and two thirds. Be patient with this disc: every person should have on their \\"list of one hundred things to do before the grave\\" at least trying to accept this album - 90 percent of you will love yourself for trying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterpiece!","review":"Have the original records, and saw them live for the Lamb Lies Down On Broadway.

How in the world could they ever top this? I'm sure Gabriel knew not even to try.In an era of concept albums and rock operas (Tommy, Quadrophenia, Thick As A Brick,) this one outdoes them all. The album actually leaves you exhausted after listening too it, as so much genius is poured into every track. It's incredible that Invisible Touch and The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway were made by the same band. But they really weren't. This album was the end of the \\"real\\" Genesis."},{"rating":"2","title":"A truly magnificent album","review":"I got into this album in the mid 80's when Peter Gabriel was doing \\"Sledgehammer\\" and Genesis (by this point a trio) was doing catchy little pop tunes. I was amazed by what I heard. The writing is so strong and some of the melodies will absolutley haunt you (in a good way)forever. I still find myself having to listen to it from beginning to end at least 2 or 3 times a year and when I first bought it in the mid eighties I listened to it every day for about 3 months. A truly great great album from one of Prog rocks best bands GENESIS! Their Pre-Lamb stuff is also a must!"},{"rating":"2","title":"more than 25 years later, still a gem","review":"In the mid 70's, I overheard \\"Back in NYC\\" playing in my brother's room, and was immediately fascinated by what seemed to be the most interesting-sounding rock music I'd ever heard. Listening to the rest of the album only confirmed my impressions, which I've recently had a chance to reinforce with a CD version to replace the long worn out album.Simply put, this is a masterpiece! Often lumped in (unfairly) with Yes, ELP, and other often pretentious progressive rockers, Genesis proves with this album that they not only had these groups' musical ability but could also sustain interesting content over 4 full sides (100+ minutes of music). Even the \\"fillers\\" here -- the instrumental sections between songs -- are carefully thought out, and believe it or not hide some exquisite melodies.Some albums reward repeated attention by the listener. In no other rock album is this as true with \\"Lamb.\\" It was great in 1975, and it's great today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"I bought these ties in a couple of different colors for my wedding and they worked out great!

Broadwell and Carol Broadwell Dietrich expertly guide you through learning how to be the boss. They cover adjusting to your new role, acquiring the skills you'll need and coping with becoming a supervisor - from planning and organizing to directing and controlling. There may be just too much about stress and not quite enough about daily processes and follow through, but the information is solid across all subjects. The authors get right to the point, never sacrificing warmth, context or detail. Each section ends with thought-provoking group or individual exercises to reinforce what you've just read. We recommend this book to people who are taking their first supervisory positions, to those aiming for that goal and to anyone who has to train either of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good information","review":"This book gets specific about how women can communicate better.

Before Lionel Richie became a household name, The Commodores were mostly funk, as can be seen in \\"Brick House,\\" the group's biggest hit, but beyond that song, the disc doesn't cover that side of the group very well at all.But, I still give the compilation a perfect 5 star rating, because even though it covers a pretty narrow portion of the band, it covers the BEST portion. Lionel's ballads aren't nearly at the same level of genius as some of Marvin Gaye's or Stevie Wonder's greatest work, but I think they're just as enjoyable. Songs like \\"Sail On\\" and \\"Just To Be Close To You\\" will simply never get old.I absolutely love this CD, it's one of the most played in my collection, but if you're looking for a true Commodores overview, you might want to look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting, Thoughtful Film","review":"Rising Son is the story of a son seeking indepedence from the dreams his father has for him against the backdrop of the severe recession of the 1980s. Brian Dennehy is in his element as a middle manager in an automotive factory who worked his way up from the factory floor but must face the lost of his career as the plant closes. He dreams of his sons having better lives and pushes them both to have the career he wants for them, whether they do or not.

I can see where some people might get some valuable information out of it but my biggest issue was that it couldn't decide if it was directed at the coach new to the game or an intermediate coach moving into coaching 11v11 games (hence little use for anyone coaching over 13's)As the back of the book states the author has coached from 5 year olds to pros and it is obvious that he couldn't decide who to target the book at.

It is well written, encourages coaches to have a positive attitude towards their players & the game, & includes a wealth of material.

Some of the vocal bits may be a little boring, but the instrumental sections (especially on Dancing With... and Firth of Fifth) are excellent. Particularly of note are Tony Banks's keyboards and Phil Collins's virtuoso drumming. Unlike most prog rock bands, they don't rely so much on guitar to drive their instrumental sections, but they are still a worthwhile listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"It doesn't get better than this!","review":"This CD continues the farytale theme of NURSERY CRYME and betters it. We start on our journey with \\"Dancing With The Moonlit Knight\\" which contains the CD's title. \\"I Know What I Like (In Your Wardrobe)\\" is the story of a slow-pated lawnmower man who gets unneeded (and unheeded) advice. \\"Firth Of Fifth\\" is the CD's most beautiful track. Check out that chord progression in Steve Hackett's solo! \\"More Fool Me\\" features Phil Collins' plaintive voice. \\"The Battle Of Epping Forest\\" tells of a gangland turf fight. \\"Afer The Ordeal\\" can be said to have served as the previous piece's postlude. This is an instrumental piece. \\"The Cinema Show\\" is a tune about dating. It bleeds into the CD's epilogue \\"Aisle Of Plenty\\", a comical song about supermarkets. It features the same chord progression found on track 1. SELLING ENGLAND is definitely the best of Genesis' early work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, except for...","review":"I'm a big Genesis fan and my favourite track on this album is \\"Firth of Fifth\\" (i rarely hear this beautiful piano-playing).

Rarely considered an album of any import by critics, as the two other Amazon reviews attest, it is easily one of Genesis fans' favorite album. Not showy but more a collection of music that slowly gets under your skin until you find yourself stringing together any number of tremendous Peter Gabriel lyrics. An excellently whimsical and romantic effort by an important band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essentually a classic","review":"Genesis made thier 2nd best album with Selling England By The Pound thier fifth album realeased in june 1973 in britain and November 1973 in the U.S. Genesis had used The Mellotron since Trespass and suposedly a clavinet on Genesis Live but the addition of other synthesizers into the group gave the band a more sophisticated edge and greatly enhanced and expanded their Prog Rock sound. Peter reprises his oboe playing and most the usual elements of Genesises early period are here, Peters fine flute, Tonys dynamic keyboards, Steves strong guitar work, Mikes steady bass and Phils intence drumming and this album features the bands second ever longest song the 12 minute Battle Of Epping Forest. The only drawback is the sappy More Fool Me but thats more then made up for by the other songs on the album."},{"rating":"2","title":"After 30 years, I never get tired of this album.....","review":"... in particular Banks' long keyboard masterpiece in \\"Aisle of Plenty\\".

The album hit the top ten spurred on by the number three single \\"I Know What I Like (In Your Wardrobe)\\". That song is a sublime slice of prog-rock with weird lyrics and a great Peter Gabriel vocal. The album is full of tight playing by the best of all of the Genesis lineups with Mike Rutherford & Steve Hackett on guitars, Phil Collins on drums (and making his vocal debut), Tony Banks on keyboards and the brilliant Peter Gabriel on vocals. Other standout songs include the chamber music stylings of \\"Firth Of Fifth\\", the magical \\"Dancing With The Moonlight Knight\\" and the sprawling \\"The Cinema Show\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gabriel era best album","review":"Simply this is one of rock's most beautifully crafted albums. For me the best Genesis ever did with Peter Gabriel. Every player gave their best in terms of musical & writting ability to contribute to each track. All of Genesis trademark sounds are included: Gabriel (and the rest of the band as well) lyrics, Collins excellent drumming, Hackett soulfull solosand both Banks clever keyboard sound and Rutherford bass and arregements. What makes this recording so good is who well the tracks are sequenced and linked to each other."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Genesis Album of all time","review":"Selling England By the Pound is an incredible musical achievement. Everything came together for the band on this album. They would never again achieve the cohesiveness and synergy that they found here. The album is a quantum leap above their previous four. Their folllow-up, The Lamb Lies Down, was marred by division and disatisfaction within the band, a plodding and obscure story, and the need for too much filler to extend the album to two discs. Selling England was the band at its creative peak as a 5 piece unit where each member contributed to every song. Each band member plays some of the best music that they ever would in their careers. Give your ears and mind a treat, listen to this album loud, by candle light, with a nice bottle of wine. Amazing stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Awesome","review":"\\"Young man says 'You are what you eat, eat well'. Old man says 'You are what you wear, wear well'. You know what you are, you don't give a damn.. you're bursting your belt that is your home-made sham!\\" Magical lyrics like these along with stunning instrumentals are what make this album one of the best progressive rock albums ever. Selling England transports you into places that are so vivid you will want to relive them over and over again. To me, it is almost inconceivable how someone (mostly Gabriel) can write such eloquent lyrics and match it with instumentals that are second to none... a far cry from today's mindless pop culture music."},{"rating":"2","title":"IT'S ONE O'CLOCK AND TIME FOR LUNCH","review":"THIS IS A MUST HAVE FOR ANY TRUE GENESIS [ W/PETER ] FAN.

The workout sequence is great with three days of cardio, two of sculpting/toning, and two of yoga/stretching. I have found that these sessions move quickly so before you know it 12 minutes has past. You do work up a sweat in the cardio sessions. Now I often times pair two sessions together for a longer work out.

The ability to mix and match many shorter workouts is exactly what I was looking for. Having said that, I am very disappointed in my inability to keep up with the moves. The moves seem more complex than I am used to and having gone back three times now I am just not getting it. It may just be me. On the positive side I think this instructor has a lot of energy and if I could get the moves down it would be a nice change of pace.For reference I have been doing the body sculpting and cardio workouts from the Biggest Loser people and Jillian for about 10 months now without an issue.

I really enjoyed it and thought it was effective."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Variety in Cardio & Excellent Stretch","review":"I like Denise even though her cueing is horrible and she sometimes seems lost and a just a step behind during her workout videos. This video is the same, BUT I love the two cardio segments due to the variety. They aren't the most difficult for sure, but on a light day I like to complete them both + the stretch segment which is GREAT. I often add this stretch to my other more difficult videos. I tried the upper body segment though and hated it.. the movements were off and seemed way too rushed for a good strength workout.

I love how a full effort for all 12 minutes makes me feel just as energized as a 30-minute workout at the gym, without taking up as much time in the morning and making me feel rushed. The variety between workouts keeps me from getting bored, as does the fast pace of these workouts.

His viewpoint character, Billy, returns home to help a couple of old friends because Frank's little brother Jake has died alone in a trailer (alcoholism), but Billy's still in love with Frank's wife Hazel (and, truth told, with Frank). But the novel's not told strictly chronologically, though the floating in time is easy to understand. The language is gorgeous, with stupendous imagery.

If you are looking for a firewall/VPN unit, I suggest you pass on this particular product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreliable - Requires frequent reboots","review":"After just one week of use and installing the newest firmware, this router began showing sickly signs requiring a daily reboot. By week two it began needing to be rebooted every 15 minutes. This now seems typical of previous experiences I have had with other Netgear products. So much for plug and play.My recommmendation: leave Netgear to the passive routers and use another brand for firewalls and DHCP serving."},{"rating":"1","title":"I could not get this product to work with my laptop","review":"I could not get this product to work with my laptop! I hired a professional to help me install it and after several hours he finally got it to work with my laptop however I could not use my wifi. I had to be hard wired in. Definitely NOT what I thought I had purchased!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good choice","review":"Beware, if you want to use the VPN you also need to buy the Netgear proprietary software. This is bad - they should include it in the price of the router. I did not realize this when I bought the router, but it does say so if you read the fine print and look at the diagram.However I found the basic DSL PPPoE connection to degrade over a day or so, and require reboot for performance, or it stops, and you are forced to reboot it. So given this, I never spent the extra money to buy their VPN software. I was surprised about this since I used this to replace a Linksys WRT54G which has worked flawlessly for years.(I bought a Linksys RVS4000 instead, and could not get it's VPN going either. Finally I bought a Draytek router, which are hard to find in the US. This is working really well - but not for the amateur - the setup is very sophisticated and needs great expertise. But once you set it up - it works very well, to my relief.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sound Quality Very Low","review":"While the sound quality on this one isn't quite as bad as 'The Gate of A Heavenly Body', it is still really really low. The mastering appears to have been done by either an amateur or a newbie with really cheap equipment. He/she was also prolly told to make the record as loud as possible. This results in much distortion and clipping. It might be bad for your speakers, but I know one thing for sure: it sounds bad. That's not to say the music is bad, just that the end product doesn't sound professional or worth paying for.Another rip off by the Marble Sheep.See wikipedia 'loudness war' or google pleasurize music' or 'turnmeup' for more info.

But BBC Video, always happy to throw in a spoiler where it can, has chosen for no good reason to pointlessly spoil this story by re-editing it into a 2-parter.So do be aware that this video is not what was presented on television."},{"rating":"1","title":"Parody very short in length","review":"The parody, 'Curse of Fatal Death', is only about 15 minutes long! The rest of the video is dedicated to how the parody was made which, in my opinion, was boring and tedious. There are three other parodys of Dr. Who at the end of the tape (about 5 mintues each) which are Ok. Although Rowan Atkinson and Hugh Grant are seen in the spoof, I was very disappointed that there wasn't much substance in the parody. The skit is well made, using some orginal Dr. Who visual and audio effects and music, but not enough substance. I probably would not have purchased 'Curse of Fatal Death' if I knew how short it would be."},{"rating":"2","title":"DR WHO- Curse of the Fatal Death","review":"Dr Who-Curse of the Fatal Death proves the Doctor Who is alive and well in the 21st century.

I am sure this story happens to all, and this book explains wonderfully and simply that there will be hard times and we must keep on. I believe it is important for children to understand that.The illustration is gorgeous. The story reminds me of \\"Lines composed a few miles above Tintern Abbey...\\" by Wordsworth:These beauteous forms,Through a long absence, have not been to meAs is a landscape to a blind man's eye;But oft, in lonely rooms, and 'mid the dinOf towns and cities, I have owed to them,In hours of weariness, sensations sweet,Felt in the blood, and felt along the heart;And passing even into my purer mind,With tranquil restoration: -feelings tooOf unremembered pleasure; such, perhaps,As have no slight or trivial influenceOn that best portion of a good man's life,His little, nameless, unremembered, actsOf kindness and of love."},{"rating":"1","title":"book was good but,","review":"this is second purchase of the book 'the red tree' cause I lost one I used to have.I was happy to have the book even though that wasn't the original hard cover.the only problem is that, I got this book almost 15 days after ordering it.

The book was totally dammaged by water and all wrinkled.I could not open the pages because they were attached to one onother.Thank you for sending the book but I am disappointed by the quality. Please send me a new replacement."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is far too dark for a 3 year old","review":"I think this book is more appropriate for a troubled teenager, than a 3 - 8 year old. I found the pictures extremely depressing and gloomy, and the story way beyond what most 3 year olds would be able to grasp. Originally I bought this book as I was given tickets to see the production of \\"The Red Tree\\" at the Out of the Box Early Childhood Festival in Brisbane (Australia). I wanted to read it to my son before we went to the show but I ended up wondering why I had wasted my money. I have since come to realise that Shaun Tan's style is very individual - the type you either love or hate. Children have to grow up fast enough as it is without exposing them to such a depressing book. After we saw the live production of the Red Tree, my son walked around the house with his head hung down in the manner of the little girl from the book. His four year old mind had no hope of grasping the complexities in this story."},{"rating":"1","title":"The red tree","review":"First I would like to say 'read' is a bit too strong a word for what amount's to a picture book with a sentence on each page.So having looked at this book a few times, (more than once because I couldn't quite believe what I was seeing) I have to say that I was shocked at it's thoroughly depressing content.It might work for an already mentally disturbed child in a 'light at the end of tunnel' kind of way. But what on earth a regular happy-go-lucky kid would experience from looking at this book is beyond me, apart from nightmares that is.When a child is shown this book the first question is goingto be what is depression? Depression being a concept that should be as unfamiliar to children as tax returns or hangovers. So I cannot understand why anyone would consider this a book to 'entertain' children."},{"rating":"1","title":"Entering the darkness with hope","review":"I have found this an excellent book for myself on 'darker days'and to use with adults who may need some help to access painful or dark feelings, depression etc.The illustrations are particularly open-ended, offering imagery and symbol as a 'way in'. The text never 'gets in the way' and its sparseness is a gift...the story is within."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lyrical and Powerful","review":"What a tremendous book ... although it's right to expect something truly special from Australia's best picture book illustrator.The text of the book is deceptively simple, and perfectly economical. Its true power is revealled by the images, which are haunting and unforgettable. Although feelings of depression and loneliness strike us all, Tan has found a note-perfect way to depict complex and dark emotions. I've heard (and used) many analogies for the darkness that accompanies depression, but when you see Tan's images, everything else will fall short.So with such themes of darkness, does the book soar? Definitely! The conclusion is unaffected and uplifting, reminiscent of the Australian writer and illustrator Michael Leunig.I cannot, in all honesty, think of any life, at any age, that would not be enriched by this simple, lyrical and moving book. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not that bad for a debut","review":"Yes was still experimenting with their sound when this album was recorded in 1969. Not exactly prog-rock (as Fragile) but you will be surprised to hear the band in the 'early days'. This album has rarely been revisited (compilations) since it was almost forgotten (at least in the US) upon release. A cover of the Beatles \\"Every Little Thing\\" gives them some credibility to take a Lennon-McCartney track and give it a makeover yielding excellent results. \\"Harold Land\\" is an excellent mellow piece about an army man. \\"I See You\\" is a jazzy cover from the Byrds psychedelic era. All in all, it balances out, if you're new to the band and are familiar only with \\"Roundabout\\" it won't be a wise purchase. If you are a fan who is curious, you should enjoy this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jazz and rock","review":"This debut album Yes was the only Yes vinyl album I hadn't been able to track down anywhere, so when I got the chance, I paid as much as $50 for it. Just to complete my Yes collection.At first, I was kinda disappointed. But this album gains credit with time. And you end up really appreciating it - not only because of the affectional value but also for the music itself.Especially Side One is very jazzy. I See You is an absolutely great jazz song, full of soul and Yesness! In fact, every single track is very worth listening to. And Jon Anderson's voice in its youth is very fragile yet very very beautiful and skilled.On the back of the cover, it says: (...) My second runner in the Great Group-Most-Likely-To-Make-It Stakes. And my money is on them! (...) (Tony Wilson, Melody Maker).You bet!(Oh, by the way, Sweetness is used in Yes freak Vincent Gallo's movie Buffalo 66 starring Christina Ricci.

Where I live only two of those stations are used by the radio (88.1 and 88.5), however depending on the location in the city then 88.3 is used but with static. With that in mind, the only one that seems to remotely work is 88.3 and 88.5 and that is with a lot of static. For me it would go in and out of working. It would go from little static to covered in static, no matter where I put it in my car. I notice that if I am on the highway going to another city, then it will work a little better than when I drive around in my city, so I am assuming that people who live in a big city will not like this at all.The bottom line is this product did not work, the signal was atrocious and it quickly goes through the battery."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!!!!","review":"When I first purchased this FM Transmitter I thought it worked awesome.

I wish I'd had this book when researching \\"A Secret of the Universe\\"!

I have been a GIANT Yes fan since for nearly 30 years. I have taken the brilliant with the not so brilliant and I have taken them happily. But I will not take Relayer. It is utter bile. The most nonsensical, masturbatory, overblown recording they ever made. I do not make such criticism lightly. I have, on many occaisions, attempted to re-evaluate the album. I even bought the remaster. Here's what happens... I press play and after 2 minutes I am laughing so hard I have to stop the disc. Try another track, laughter turns into complete disbelief.

As others have said, this is not an easy acquisition. Only a Yes fan will have bought it in the first place, but many will reject it too soon without giving it the attention it deserves and demands. At first the sensory assault seems too overwhelming and terribly disjointed. But give it a couple of more chances and it becomes a transcendant treasure. After a time the way through the \\"Gates of Delirium\\" becomes clear and resplendant to a summit pouring out into the epiphany of the mystical and wafting \\"Soon.\\" This isn't background music! It demands close attention. Headphones help. Leave your world behind when you approach this one.

This album lacks the coherence of the several albums before, but it makes up for this with sheer energy. Drummer Alan White blossoms on Relayer, providing fireworks throughout the album. This album is rife with the extended virtuoso composition that you can expect from the band of this era, with Howe, Squire, and keyboardist Moraz trading off runs that when put together, confuse and tantalize the ear. \\"To Be Over\\" has always seemed kind of out of place to me, as if Yes runs out of steam towards the end of the album, but if this song is unremarkable it is perhaps only in contrast to the first two songs. This is, in my opinion, Yes's last great album."},{"rating":"2","title":"What can I say?......","review":"It's a great album, lots of incredible work, namely from Steve Howe and Patrick Moraz; It's definetley, um, different?

He is truely a genius, because never before has a man brought so many genres of music together into what can only be described as a symphony. Speaking of symphonies just listen to Roses from My Friends and you can feel the energy, passion and emotion which is truely immense. He is one of the few true artists of our time, so if you don't have this pick it up. Ballads to Blues Jams- Ben does it all."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the point?","review":"Ben Harper is my favorite artist and I'd like to share a few thoughts here:If you are a big enough Ben fan, you probably have his albums already, and maybe some of his single CD's with some of the unreleased tracks.I hate when artists do this, and this has Virgin Records written all over it. A money maker, but does nothing for the real fans who want to hear his new stuff.I heard from a friend who worked on the album that Virgin sent back Burn to Shine 3 times because they \\"didn't hear a radio single on the entire album.\\"Anyway, any Ben is Good Ben...and these are three great albums.If you do not own any of them: good purchase! If you do own them: don't fall for the trap!"},{"rating":"2","title":"BEN on AUSTIN CITY LIMITS","review":"I recently saw BEN HARPER on the PBS TV saturday night weekly AUSTIN CITY LIMITS and this guy and his band blew his \\"Live\\" audience and myself off our surroundings with his pure and earthy multitextured brand of original music. Whether it's rock, pop, a little bit of country, reggae, blues, or jazz tinged soulful R&B music, BEN is one of the very few all around musicians who captivates and leaves you spellbound with his sincere performances. No question about it: I had to purchase this box set and the other three cds. BEN HARPER's recordings are priceless and classic...he thoroughly entertains and lifts you with his music and message. I wish I'd been exposed to BEN HARPER years ago, but, better late than never...Simply irresitable! THANK YOU PBS TV & Austin City Limits!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe I just don't get it","review":"I first heard of Ben Harper while watching a documentary about MoTown and the influence of the Funk Brothers. Ben Harper was one of the singers used to sing with the remaining band members. His voice on these songs was crystal clear, resounant, and powerful. I thought, \\"I need to get a CD by this guy.\\" Well, this boxed set is a disappointment. He whispers through the songs in a soft voice. I listened to it once, and not since. His voice just was not featured in this album. I admit, maybe I just don't get it. I will give it another try, but for now, this album was a big letdown for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"dance by the light","review":"My three-year-old daughter loves this book. She has had a fascination with the moon since she was old enough to notice it. She likes unfolding the pages and reads it to her baby brother. It is a cute introduction to the phases of the moon. She likes especially to have her daddy read it to her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Small; story disappointing","review":"This book was much smaller than I expected (I bought the hardcover edition). It's about the size of my hand. The story disappointed me too. It starts out fine, but you're left hanging at the end. I don't think I'd have bought it if I had read it in the store.SYNOPSISMonica sees the full moon, asks Papa to get it. Papa gets long ladder, goes to moon. Moon is too big; moon tells Papa to wait. Papa waits until moon is smaller, brings it to Monica. Monica plays with the moon. \\"But the moon kept getting smaller and smaller and smaller and finally it disappeared altogether. Then one night, Monica saw a thin sliver of the moon reappear. Each night the moon grew... and grew and grew...\\" That's how it ends -- with a two page illustration of the full moon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book - but with a few small caveats","review":"This is a short story about a girl who wants to play with the moon, sending her dad to get it. We go through a half a month until the moon is small enough to take home, and then it disappears - but it comes back in the sky in the next half a month.Several of the pages have fold-outs of some sort, most noticeably the big spread where the full moon talks to Monica's father. These fold-outs are a little delicate, possibly too delicate for the small hands who expect to use board books. You might want to wait until your child is older and then simply get the bigger, non-board edition.Unlike some commenters here, I have an actual board book, with the same ISBN as listed. I don't know what happened with their books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another excellent book by Eric Carle","review":"This book is among my daughter's favorites. She is nearly two years old and has already dog-eared and torn some pages, she literally has enjoyed the book to pieces. This has turned out to be a perfect book for her because she absolutely loves the moon. Seattle winter's don't offer many opportunities for even glimpses of the moon. It's also about a girl and her papa which is something nice for dads to share. Don't expect this book to physically withstand the curious hands of infants. It's not tough like a board book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"fails in the board book category","review":"First off, I love Eric Carle's books and this is one of our favorite stories.We asked for the board book version as a gift for our toddler because she's still pretty hard on regular books. We didn't realize that this board book has fold out pages made of heavy weight paper and a center fold out section that I can feel tearing as I look through the book. There is no way this book will withstand daily reading by a toddler. I'm so disappointed because I wanted her to be able to enjoy this story on her own, especially when we already own the hardback book version of this story."},{"rating":"1","title":"DONT BUY THE $6.99 VERSION- TOO SMALL!!!!!!!!","review":"I WAS SO DISSAPPOINTED AFTER WE RECEIVED THIS BOOK. IT WAS ABOUT 6 INCHES BY 4 INCHES WITH REDICULOUSLY SMALL WRITTING. THIS WAS NOT ANYWHERE IN THE DESCRIPTION. I WOUND UP PAYING MORE IN SHIPPING THAN I WOULD HAVE FOR THE BOOK!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My children and I enjoyed this one a lot","review":"I love Eric Carle for young children and this one didn't disappoint me. Fun story, interesting pages that open out, keeps a kid's attention. As other reviewers have stated, you do need to be somewhat careful that the pages don't tear since they open out away from the book but it worked just fine for us and added a fun element to the story. A good bedtime book when you are getting the kids settled down to sleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"So small! Wish I had read the reviews first - *Faceplant*","review":"My son fell in love with this book at a friend's house so I went to the mobile app and ordered it.

Returned."},{"rating":"1","title":"extremely tiny, hard to read and hard to see images","review":"Wonderful book, the text is great if you are able to see the mini print, i used a magnifying glass to read it. Nowhere did it say that this book was tiny thats why i bought it. Im so upset!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed in size of the book","review":"Have always loved the story and sent it to my grandson. I was very disappointed to fond out it was a tiny version. This should be clearly stated in the description since I thought I was sending him the full size version with the fold out ladder"},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too small.","review":"My son loves the moon and looks for it any time he is outside. So his dad bought him a moon nightlight that goes through the phases for his room for his 2nd birthday. He LOVES books and I love Eric Carle so when I saw this I was VERY excited; it would go perfectly with his moon nightlight. When it got here I was so disappointed because it's TINY. Like I can fit it in my back pocket tiny. And the unfolding of the pages isn't exactly ideal for a 2 year old. I should have read the negative reviews before making my purchase. I also assumed since it was \\"hardcover\\" that it would have been a full size book. Still a neat book. But I really feel gypped on my purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment..","review":"I was disappointed when I received this book in the mail. I ordered two of Eric Carle's books from this vendor and while they were delivered in a timely fashion that I was pleased with, they were definitely not what I expected. Instead of being the regular sized, hardback books that I see at Books-A-Million or Barnes and Noble, they are miniature versions of the books and they are tiny. I planned to give a set of the Eric Carle books to my nephew for Christmas, but now I am going to have to go out and purchase more books that are a normal size because he hates tiny books. He likes to see the big, pretty pictures. I am very frustrated and hate that I wasn't given an accurate description of the size of the books before making my purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISAPPOINTED IN THE SIZE","review":"THE STORY WAS EXCELLENT,MY CHILDREN LOVED IT, I WAS DISAPPOINTED IN THE SIZE OF THE BOOK."},{"rating":"1","title":"Papa, Please Get the Moon for Me","review":"The book was listed in like new condition. Some of the pages were tore and colored on. Several names were written in the front cover. It looks like a very used book."},{"rating":"2","title":"another beautiful active book from Eric Carle","review":"Author Eric Carle (The Very Lonely Firefly, The Very Hungry Caterpillar, The Very Busy Spider) excels in creating books that offer children more than words on a page -- he consistently incorporates additional elements (lights, holes(!), textures) that make the books even more interesting to thirsty little minds.In this book, a smaller portable version of the original, a girl asks her father for the moon. Fold-out pages complement Carle's unique illustrative style as we discover a looooooong ladder that reaches to the moon and back, and a magnificent four-page center spread revealing the full moon in all its glory.This fantastic tale for young children is sure to delight parents and kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I thought I was getting a full-sized book, but instead I received this teeny-tiny mini book that is so small I don't see what the purpose of having it is. I don't remember seeing anywhere that the book would be 2 \\" X 3\\" - so just a warning to anyone who thinks they are ordering a normal book."},{"rating":"2","title":"My 2-year-old daughter LOVES this book!","review":"My daughter LOVES the moon and when I gave her this book she absolutely LOVED it! She asks me to read it multiple times every night! It is a very cute and charming story--another great book by Eric Carle!!! I think I will get this book as a gift for my friends who are expecting!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Papa, Please Get Me the Moon","review":"Very diapppointed. Cheap, tiny little book, not even a board book which I thought I was buying. This is not up to Eric Karl's usual standards. It looked like something that you would buy at the \\"Dollar Store\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a BOARD book...","review":"I was expecting a hard cover, large book like one you would find at the library... Instead it is about 6 inches tall and 5 inches wide board book (some pages extends a small amount) and it looks nothing like the book I checked out at the library that my 2 year old adored. I think the product should include this information so customers are not misled. The book I wanted has extendable ladders when \\"papa\\" gets the moon, and this book doesn't include this. I am very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Papa, Please Get the Moon for Me","review":"This is a very imaginative and educational book that also touches upon a father's love for his child. Very calming illustrations as well. A great concept."},{"rating":"1","title":"Need a magnifying glass","review":"Classic book but I was shocked when I got it and found that it is \\"pocket\\" sized. I could hardly read it and it certainly wasn't big enough to engage my two year old son. Thanks for the no hassle return Amazon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome book. This is not for the board book though and is small in size.","review":"This is a lovely story and is one of our all time favorites in our collection.I wanted to reiterate what others have said though, this book is tiny and is not the board book version which is bigger.If you have younger kids, you may want to search for the board book version that has the pop up and interactive pages as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"a classic","review":"this s a wonderful story. the smaller size allows me to easily carry it in my bag, and pull it out to share with the children i work with."},{"rating":"2","title":"<3","review":"I remember as a child having this read to me. I love the story; it is sweet and meaningful. I would strongly recommend buying the pop-out version, too, especially for younger children! It makes the reading experience much more entertaining. My favorite part about this book, by far, are the illustrations."},{"rating":"1","title":"teeny tiny","review":"I don't believe it states anywhere in the description that this would be a 2\\" by 3\\" book -- what a disapointment when I opened the box!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another fabulous Eric Carle book","review":"This is a small book perfect for small hands. The illustrations are true to Eric Carle's other book illustrations as you would expect. Learning a new concept is never far away in his books and you won't be disappointed with this one. They are boosted for understanding by the features of the page fold-outs, fold-ups, and fold-downs. It's wonderful as a board book because those fold-flaps can handle the frequent times they are used without tearing as a page does. This story is also presented on an Eric Carle DVD or VHS which I have also rated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute book about a father going to any length for his child","review":"We like looking at the moon and this book helps to open conversation with my child about the moon. The story was neat in the sense that the father really is adventurous in retrieving the moon.Only thing that wasn't so great about the book is the large flaps that are a little confusing as to which direction in which they should be opened. My son almost ripped one of the pages trying to figure it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"My 2-year old's very favorite book","review":"I bought this on a whim because my daughter likes saying good night to the moon. It was one of five books I purchased in one order, and the rest remain unread because my two-year old daughter immediately picked this one as the one she wanted read - over and over and over again. She can recite practically the whole thing and so strongly identifies with the little girl in the story she likes to pretend to be Monica (or she gets confused and thinks she IS Monica). It's a cute story and the fold-outs are unusual and compelling, but it's one of those rare books that has struck a deep chord with her - and that I can tolerate reading over and over and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"WHAT A SWEET BOOK!!","review":"I think this is definitely one of my favourite books. I love books myself and I love my son now 18 months to read quality books. Every night since I've read this book to him, he points at the window at night time saying \\"Ba Ba\\" that's Chinese for father. It's simply so sweet. I've always loved Eric Carle's books but this one is my favourite. I will be running a playgroup soon and this is definitely my choice of book for father's day. Highly recommended. 5 start plus."},{"rating":"1","title":"Small book","review":"I thought I was getting the full size book and I ended up with a tiny 4x6 book. The story is great, but I am disappointed in the size of the actual book. I did not see anywhere on the listing that it was so small."},{"rating":"1","title":"There was an error in the binding of this book!","review":"So, I got this book in the mail and put it on the shelf. When it was time to read it, we started reading and then came to several pages that were upside down and our book had missing pages! The book itself looks very cool with all of the fold-out pages, but it's worthless to us when the missing pages make the story senseless!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute, but could be better quality","review":"The story is cute...I just didn't like how a lot of the pages stuck together and almost ripped the first several times of reading. Also, the pages are not cut evenly so appearance isn't all that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Papa can you get the moon for me?","review":"This book was so much smaller than I was expecting. I thought it would be a full sized hard cover children's book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pay attention to the size of the book, only 1/4 as big as usual picture books of A4 size of paper!","review":"The book is still good with imagination, fold-flip, but just way too small to feel the beauty of the images. In this sense, the price of 7 dollars is not worthy it at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great even for infants","review":"I have the board book version of this book and just thought I'd add that for people looking for books for their infants that have an actual story, this is a wonderful book. I am a father and have been reading this to my daughter since she was about 3 months old. She obviously doesn't understand it yet (she is 7 months now) but her face lights up every time I pull it off the shelf (and believe me, it doesn't light up for every book, so she definitely likes this book for some reason....it might be the pages that fold out and the colorful illustrations). Anyway, kids don't need to be able to understand the story to enjoy this book and it especially sweet for fathers to read to their kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOO SMALL BOOK!","review":"One of my favorite books for children - but NO WHERE did it say that this HARDCOVER book was 3 inches high and wide! Ridculous! I like small books too, but that was NOT what I thought I'd ordered. BAD DESCRIPTION!"},{"rating":"1","title":"nice story but too flimsy for little ones","review":"I bought this for my 3 yr old grand daughter.

Would I have purchased it if I had actually seen it. NO"},{"rating":"2","title":"An enjoyable read","review":"My two year old boy loves trains, planes and the moon. This book has helped us to teach him about the different phases. He can identify a \\"cresent\\", \\"full\\" and \\"quarter\\" moon. He likes to look for Monica's pet cat in the pictures. The fold outs are a fun idea, but not terribly practical with a toddler, although I've been surprised how well they've held up --he hasn't bent them too much. This is a book he comes back to on his own. Pictures are great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wonderful concept poorly implemented","review":"I bought this book for my 11-month son who is very hard on regular books. Unfortunately, he will not get to read it until he is much older because the fold-out pages are much too flimsy for a board book.I was very disappointed to bring it home from the store and have the page with the moon that unfolds tear just from me opening those two pages.The book is very very pretty, I just wish it were more durable. I don't see how a child could avoid damaging it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was good but....","review":"Hi: the book is upper great....but....I never image that will be small size....I thought will be regular size....I am working with special kids and I am using it ...only doing one by one ...because the size donn't gave me another option...thank you anyway to asked me for the review...:)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Feast of a Medieval Mystery","review":"Kathryn and her new husband Colum are spending their honeymoon at the manor of Lord Henry, naturally amidst murders. On the national front, the French are trying to keep King Edward from their shores and keep Henry Tudor safe. Locally, the village of Walmer has a series of deaths by poison. Kathryn uses logic to catch the murderers. The author deftly weaves history and social life of the middle ages into an intricate plotted mystery. If you like Candace Robb's Owen Archer mysteries this is one you will want to read. The plot is strong, the characters multi-faceted, and a very strong heroine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another BBC screw-up","review":"The BBC can't do anything right! First and foremost they cancelled Doctor Who, now they can't even release it on video properly. For some reason (incompetence, most probably) they placed, not the original pilot episode, but the actual first episode of an Unearthly Child as it originally aired. The tapes have been pulled from retailers and are being replaced with the proper episode. How long this will take, no one knows. Another big disappointment for North American Who fans. DON'T buy this tape until you're positive you know what you're getting"},{"rating":"2","title":"He Was There","review":"An excellent book by a man who actually witnessed the events he recounts. Considered by many to be the peak of the Stones' performing career, their 1972 tour of America certainly deserved to be covered in detail and Mr. Greenfield did so. He was also filing regular reports for Rolling Stone magazine during the tour and these are paraphrased throughout. The book would have been better if he had used the original material from RS, but this is a minor quibble. It's a must-have for anyone wanting to read about the Greatest Rock 'n' Roll Band In The World at the height of their powers. And the recently released DVD of the superb 72 tour movie Ladies And Gentlemen The Rolling Stones is another must-have for any Stones fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Track Listing","review":"1) Here Comes The Sun2) Let It Be3) And I Love Her4) Fool On The Hill5) Here There And Everywhere6) Mother Nature's Son7) For No One8) Yesterday9) Eleanor Rigby10) Blackbird11) She's Leaving Home12) I Will13) Michelle14) The Long And Winding Road"},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"I bought this book in the hope that it would contain actual implementation details concerning the various methods; specifically prismatic and other unstructured methods. To say the least, this book is thick but it is filled with extraneous fluff without any real details. For instance, the chapter on prismatic grid generation is nothing but a lot of \\"hand-waving\\" without any concrete details and I can say the same concerning the rest of the book.Also, it appears that many of the chapters in the book were included without a strict peer-review process as should be the process for a book of this type."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good collection of papers. Good also for implementation","review":"This book is a good collection of papers ranging from structured grid generation to unstructured grids, going through concepts of geometric modeling that are needed in grid generation. Maybe \\"handbook\\" in the title may be misleading for those who are not experts in the field and who could interpret it as a \\"step-by-step guide\\" to implementation. Nevertheless --I can speak of structured grid generation only being more familiar with this field rather than unstructured grids-- despite the lack of actual algorithms and pseudo-codes, the reader can indeed implement his own structured grid generator if he reads the book with care and does some algebra by hand on his own (good exercise).I am happy with it. The literature referenced by each author is vast and is a good starting point for further analysis of the methods."},{"rating":"2","title":"A hard blow to psuedoscience","review":"Pretty much a book that dissects human beliefs and offers rational explanation for everything. It takes the fun out of things like alien invasions and ghosts, but it makes the reader more informed. Good for people who want scientific explanation for everything, but a harsh reality check for those who engage in more whimsical and alternative belief systems."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sonic Heroes is a fun game for any die-hard Sonic fan.","review":"Not bad at all.

Every topic is first presented theoretically AND THEN illustrated through numerous, detailed and completely explained examples.

A fine book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Particularly strong on applications!","review":"I have used this as a supplementary text in teaching calculus and have found it to be an excellent personal resource. The author's manner of explaining is delightfully clear. Stewart doesn't hesitate to expand his explanations, but he doesn't do it simply for effect: his words clearly help the reader to understand the concept.I particularly appreciate Stewart's use of graphics that can be understood without a great deal of technology. While this text can certainly be used in a technology-rich setting, it doesn't need either a computer lab or a graphing calculator to benefit from the explanations, the development, and the opportunities for skill-building or exploration that Stewart provides.

Add to that disappointment the fragility of the plastic surrounding the 'spindle' resulting in breakage preventing the cable from retracting and I can no longer recommend this product.I didn't discover these flaws until the 100-day warranty had expired, and the best BoxWave would do to help me was give me a 25% off coupon towards the purchase of another MiniSync cable.

It is sectioned to allow you to adapt for time available. It includes scaled down exercises for those who are less agile or strong. If you do the full workout, it is fairly strenuous and seems to work all parts of the body. I think calling it yoga is somewhat of a stretch. It uses some yoga postures, but seems more like pilates to me.

This was very interactive and fun, and Bob Harper has such an encouraging and positive attitude. It just keeps you wanting to push yourself and really believe you could do it. This is a REAL workout, and you can break a sweat and feel sore the next day like any other workout. So far I haven't lost weight, though of course it has been a few weeks. It's a good starter if you're trying to get back into the routine of working out and can do so in the comfort of your own home. I also like that you can customize your workout according to what level you feel comfortable with. Totally worth it, and much more of a deal than any gym membership I've had and never used. Also, I really like that he has you work your abs without doing a single crunch. I hate crunches. You do poses and movements you never thought could actually be part of a workout. Love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"As with Biggest Loser Boot Camp, this is designed with heavier folks in mind. The workouts are no joke, but they are definitely doable. As with Biggest Loser Boot Camp you are able to customize your workout, doing only the portions you want to. 20 minutes seem a little longer with this workout, but it's manageable. The moves are fairly easy and they have people of differing abilities to follow for different levels of fitness. It's great in connection with the Biggest Loser Boot Camp DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Want to lose inches?","review":"This customizeable workout will make you sweat. The DVD is good for beginners and experts alike. There are enough Big Losers on the DVD so beginner modifications and expert modifications are depicted with each exercise.

This is my absolute FAVORITE workout DVD.I started with the warm up, 20-minute workout and then cool down. That was more than enough of a workout for me as a beginner. I worked my way up to the full hour, which includes a strength segment that has weighted yoga positions and an abs segment which is very challenging.If you enjoy the personalities from The Biggest Loser, this workout DVD has Ali Vincent (season 5 winner, first female), Bill (Season 4 winner), Bernie, Heba, Vickie, and Michelle (season 6 winner before she won)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good workout :-)","review":"This is definitely a good yoga workout. Easy to follow, good sequences. I'd recommend on a beginner intermediate level."},{"rating":"2","title":"weight loss yoga","review":"This dve is great!!

It makes it more real."},{"rating":"2","title":"i'm in love!!","review":"I got this DVD a week ago and I'm totally in love with it! I can already feel a difference in my legs. Not only are they becoming harder, but they are slimming down as well. I've never been so excited to get home and work out.The length is perfect for a full yoga workout. Level 1 of the workout is amazing (holding power poses) and takes you back to the basics with warrior 1/2, extended side angle, triangle, reverse triangle, chair. And of course, no Bob workout is complete without some planks in Level 2 which focuses only on core work. Level 3 combines yoga with hand weights which I found to be really unique. I had never done that before. You even get to do corpse pose and meditate at the end, which is lacking in Jillian's Yoga Meltdown. I also found Bob really entertaining in this DVD, as opposed to his Pure Burn Super Strength DVD where I wanted to punch him in the face.This is a great DVD to combine with the 30 min BL Last Chance Workout or one of Jillian's 20-30 min workouts."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Workout","review":"This DVD provides a great workout that will strengthen every area of your body especially your abs and back. It is a 6-week program that will help you shed some pounds and has a maintenance workout to help you maintain the weight loss. I have lost 5-6lbs in just 3-weeks. You must do the DVD at least 4-5 times a week and maintain a healthy diet. I can see the toning in my muscles, so don't hesitate to get and use this workout DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome DVD!!","review":"Great for beginners and people who are not flexible or lack strength. I love Bobs style of teaching yoga. Very easy to follow!! Love this DVD!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best yoga DVDs out there","review":"I didn't really like this DVD when I first did it, but after a few times it really grew on me. Challenging workout with great flow and nice transitions between positions. Unlike many yoga DVDs, this focuses equally on lower body and arms. Not so much on abs, but still a great overall workout. I really love the arms workout with weights at the end. You'll feel those triceps tomorrow morning!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not real yoga","review":"This is a great workout video but that's what it is. Sure it uses some yoga poses but weights in a yoga class, the yogi's would roll over in their grave if they saw this. If you want a yoga workout then get Rodney Yee strength building yoga. It's true yoga using proper alignment and props.Bob looks great as usual but he need to help participants into proper positioning before they hurt themselves.Yogini"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best..","review":"If you are looking for weight loss yoga I strongly recommend you pass on this one and purchase Jillian Michael's Yoga Meltdown. I own both DVDs and Jillian is simply a better instructor. Her routines flow much better from pose to pose, there is less repetition and Jillian is much more motivating than Bob. Also Jillian has pros in her video which really helps when posing, they are better to watch than the biggest loser contestants. This DVD is not bad in any way, it's just that Jillian's is better for yoga pros and beginners."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a true yoga DVD but a great wrokout","review":"This workout DVD probably shouldn't be called a yoga DVD but I think it is still a great workout. I do this workout after i run for 30 minutes and after I am finished, my muscles are singing...in a good way. I have noticed changes in my tone all over. I would recommend this DVD but not for those who are looking to try yoga."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fat Burning - Yes!!","review":"I love this workout! I am out of shape, but have done SOME Yoga in the past. It's always hit or miss for me finding a Yoga workout that makes me feel like I've worked out. This one definitely gave me a workout! The kind you feel in every muscle the next day, but not beyond the ability of newbies. The only complaint, (but not really much of one) is that I wish Bob would have done more of the workout himself to show proper form and make the workout flow a little smoother. Ali is so much further advanced than any of the other guys, that she tends to go faster than the rest. It makes it a little hard to follow in the beginning, but once you've done it a few times, not such a big deal anymore.Overall - this is a great workout! You won't be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow what a work out","review":"I've done yoga off and on for years but never anything like this. I was dripping in sweat and wasn't even able to do the entire workout the first time through. What is nice is that you can customize the workout to your level (but even the lowest level is a challenge). I would definitely recommend this video."},{"rating":"2","title":"A bit of both","review":"I like this workout. It is a bit of the zen of yoga mixed with the sweat of a cardio.

I am glad that I have it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This DVD Rocks!","review":"I wanted to begin adding yoga to my weekly workout routine so I ordered this dvd to get started. I love Bob and find him very motivational and kind but the actual yoga is incredible! I've been doing it for only 2 weeks and am noticing big changes! The strength involved in just the beginning program is impressive and I was thrilled to be so challenged. I sweat my butt off in doing this - literally!"},{"rating":"2","title":"ARE YOU KIDDING ME....?!?!?!","review":"I ordered this with fairly low expectations. Had done Pilates but not YOGA -thought that it was not something that would give comparable results.BE PREPARED TO BE SHOCKED. I started this DVD on SUN and lost 6lbs by FRI.IT KICKS YOUR ASS -- and STAY WITH IT - those planks and that darned CHAIRPOSITION are brutal - but the results are worth every sore muscle...This DVD is amazing -- and looking at Bob doesn't hurt either...BUY IT!! : )"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome workout - fitness focused","review":"I have a love / hate relationship with Yoga. I like it when the pace is quick and you keep moving. When I'm done I want to feel like I've worked out, not taken a nap. Some practices are much more \\"philosophical\\" than workout. NOT this DVD. Bob helps you to stretch and strengthen muscles. Its definitely NOT aerobic, but you do feel it at the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as easy as you think.","review":"Being new to yoga I though for some strange reason that this would be great. It is much harder then I thought but I am always up for a good challenge.

It isnt the yoga I'm used to doing but I'm guessing that is because it is for weight loss. I found even the first level challenging. I didn't find this to be as relaxing as the yoga I do in classes, but I definately feel like I've done a good workout. There is a lot of focus on the arms."},{"rating":"2","title":"good DVD","review":"I bought this DVD for my husband, who is a fanatic of the series.

Therefore, I was pleasantly surprised that this DVD actually taught me a new pose (awkward airplane...great for your core). I have been to many different yoga classes and have watched many yoga videos and DVDs, but this is the first DVD I found that incorporates light weights and a medicine ball into practice. I like the additions of the weights; it keeps the workout fresh.As previous reviewers have noticed, going from plank to downward dog endlessly can be boring, but it's so good for your abs, and I hate crunches."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whoa!!!","review":"What a suprising workout this was!

I am not afraid of working hard and since I'm young and in pretty decent shape, it surprised me how much I struggled with the positions.

You get out of it what you put in - as in you can work your way up to where you want to be. Bob is motivational and encouraging and best of all - you get to do this in your own living room! My kids (ages 13 and 9) even do this with me sometimes and we always have a grand time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good!","review":"This DVD works your core! Great for a \\"low-key\\" workout-when you want to do something active and beneficial, yet not have an all-out cardio butt-kicker. The DVD is broken up into sections-a short warmup, 3 workouts, and a cooldown. I like that one is able to customize and pick which workouts you wish to do. You can do workout 1 twice in a row, then workout 3. Mix and match however you choose.My core was sore the next day. I considered myself quite active (working out about 5 days a week)at 5'6\\" 118 lbs. I do have some familarity with yoga (taken a few classes), but am not a huge follower. So, from my perspective-some familiarity and pretty fit, this is a great, core-working, lower-key workout. I like it, but don't love it-probably b/c of personal workout preferences. I generally prefer a fast-pace, higher energy workout-which is not yoga-Not Bob's fault! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"You are going to sweat!","review":"good work out. definitely not for wimps.. you will be working hard, but do it at your own speed and work your way up so you stick with it.

WHAT is the deal with all the criminals having grown up with Dave AND having crippled/diseased wives? Why does Clete ALWAYS end up with a girlfriend that is one of the bad guys?Why does the river always smell like fish spawning? Why do all the male characters smell like testosterone?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Entertainment","review":"After reading several of James Burke's novels, he has become one of my favorite authors. This book is similar to earlier books and offers fans more Dave Robicheaux adventures. It has a new plot that keeps the suspense level high all the way through the book. This book is interesting and enjoyable to read from cover to cover. Thanks to a great author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Post Katrina Murder, Greed and Passion in New Iberia Parish","review":"Another twisting, weaving tale of murder, madness, greed and survival in New Iberia Parish awaits the fans of the amazing James Lee Burke. We accompany Detective Robicheaux as he ponders the clues and wreckage left behind at one gruesome, swampy killing field after another. The reader is treated to a mixture of rot, mildew and blooming hibiscus that permeates the post-Katrina landscape blended with the odors of Cajun cooking and home-made whiskey.Burke's legendary gift of transporting us to the depths of Southern Louisiana; with its' vivid history, many contradictions and primitive, wacky characters, is in full tilt boogie here!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Robicheaux fan","review":"This is classic Burke. Imaginative characters, regional beauty, and mystery combine for a fun ride with wit and drama. No matter the sequence in which you read Burke's Robicheaux books, you can jump in and enjoy the story. He draws you down into the bayou and leaves you with a smile at book's end."},{"rating":"2","title":"First James Lee Burke Book I've Ever Read And It Won't Be The Last","review":"As my title says, I'd never read a James Lee Burke book before. This author really knows how to write. His descriptive manner placed me in New Orleans and allowed me to see the beauty of the homes, hear the sounds of the river, listen to the tugboats and even the crocodiles swishing their tails in the water. The story begins some years earlier which gave me a good picture of the lead character and where he came from before bringing the story forward into present day. Each character in the book is more than one dimensional. You know each and every one of them and what makes them tick. The ending and putting all the pieces together of the crime(s) was very well done. I thought several times, I had \\"whodunnit\\" figured out but I was wrong and pleased to admit it. An excellent book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Storytelling","review":"This is one of the better Dave Robicheaux novels. His characters are as compelling as ever and his descriptions of Louisiana almost make you feel as if you have lived there all of your life. This book is equal doses or mystery, procedural drama, and social commentary. The marks against it are for the fact the Bella Lujian seems to be a reqworking of the same old Robicheaux villains and for the over the top connection to Katrina. If Burke needed to make a statement about Katrina he could have done it through a story instead of a sermon."},{"rating":"2","title":"It doesn't get better","review":"There are two major flaws in James Lee Burke's writing: his books aren't a 1000 pages long and he doesn't write one a month. This guy is a poet. Keep it rockin' Jimmy Lee. Remember the pipeline welders and their polka dot hats?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Odd","review":"Burke is one of my favourite living writers. His plots are complex, characters interesting, and settings vivid. But, this book does not compare with any of his others. The plot is rushed and characters are left flat and undeveloped. Poor Molly, Dave's latest wife, is given only peripheral attention and treated with the same brush Burke has painted most of Dave's other partners. The conclusion of the book is almost as convenient as waking up only to discover it was only a dream. It has usually been a treat to go into summer with a Burke book to read, but this was a shocker. Even the editing of this book was horrible. Simple spelling errors creeping into many chapters, plots not fleshed out and characters left on the page without significant purpose.I'm wondering what's going on with Burke and his publisher that this book would be put on the shelves in this state. The publisher should be taking better care of such a significant author."},{"rating":"2","title":"BUY THIS AND TREAT YOURSELF!","review":"THERE IS PROBABLY NO BIGGER JAMES LEE BURKE FAN THAN ME. I HAVE READ ALL OF THE DAVE ROBICHEAUX SERIES AND FOUND THIS ONE TO BE JUST AS ENTERTAINING AS THE OTHER 14 OR SO TITLES! TAKE IT FROM A TRUE FAN WHO KNOWS THE WORK THIS IS A KEEPER!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fundamental book for anyone working with cryptography","review":"This book, that you can see some parts on the authors site, is a essencial on everyone desk working on security and cryptography. It is not a book of recipes of how to build a secure cryptographic environment but a fundamental book on the basics of cryptography and cryptographic protocols."},{"rating":"2","title":"Genesis' first live album","review":"Live(1973) is Genesis' first live album and features their early hits like WATCHER OF THE SKIES, and THE KNIFE. The band sounds good live, but this album is only for the die-hard Genesis fans and if you're looking for a good live album of Genesis, get SECONDS OUT."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Live Album but...","review":"While this is a fantastic set and amply demonstrates how powerful Genesis was live at this time, it's too bad they didn't see fit to release the rest of the show that was broadcast on the BBC. The full version of Suppers Ready, which was also a part of that broadcasted performance, is I'm sure also fantastic and would have completed this wonderful recording. It also would have been nice to be able to compare that version with the later live one released on the Seconds Out recording. But still, even without Supper, this is one of the all time best progressive rock recordings and my personnal favorite of their early recordings."},{"rating":"2","title":"ORIGINAL GENESIS","review":"THIS IS THE ULTIMATE \\"OLD\\" GENESIS CD. I WENT TO SEE THIS CONCERT & IT WAS SUPERB. THIS CD BRINGS BACK A SMALL AMOUNT OF THE MEMORIES!! I'M A HUGE PETER GABRIEL FAN, SO FOR ME THIS IS A GOLDEN CD, ON A PAR WITH LAMB LIES DOWN."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fine early Genesis album","review":"This record was my introduction to Gabriel-era Genesis, and what an introduction! Although the set list is rather slim -- five 8-10 minute songs -- each one of these songs is a classic of the Gabriel era, and the recordings on this set are vastly superior to the studio originals. This is especially so on \\"Musical Box\\" and \\"Return of the Giant Hogweed,\\" which suffered from truly abysmal production when they were recorded in the studio. These live cuts crackle with ferocious, dynamic energy, and make for a thrilling listen. These songs, with their unconventional structures and odd time-signatures, aren't immediately accessible to anyone raised on Top 40 radio, but if you're a fan of early Genesis or are looking for something intriguing, I can't recommend this album highly enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Resource","review":"There are several editions of this book, I believe, but no matter which one you get, I guarantee that you will continue to look to it for reference. I consider it a better single resource than any of the USPC books. It covers a very wide variety of topics and gives plenty of information about them. The insides of the cover (front and back, at least on mine) have conformation and common injuries/faults, which are wonderful for a quick review."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Information","review":"This book provides excellent information for the novice rider, and a through basic education in horsemanship. I found it very useful and informative. A wonderful teaching tool, it is comprehinsive without being overwhelming."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT for Children!!!","review":"While the material in these books is lots of fun, this is not a book that should be left lying around where younger readers to get their hands on it.There are various entries in unexpected parts of the books that touch on sexual acts, some of which are decidedly outside social norms (including references to urine and \\"water sports\\", insects and formicophilia); same-sex relations (both positive and negative statements); genitalia; fellatio; and more.For kids in high school, this may be acceptable, depending on the maturity of the child, but this is certainly not a book that should be left where children in the lower grades can read it without supervision and adult guidance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Neat book","review":"Got it for my boyfriend, but took a look at it first. It is truly a neat book, full of some interesting info."},{"rating":"1","title":"BOOK OF UNTRUE INFORMATION!!!","review":"Save your money, and buy a book that has factual information in it. I looked up some of the things in this book because they seemed hard to believe, and learned it was because they were not at all true. This is a waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slamed for buying two kendle book devices.","review":"Customer Reviews > \\"Yeah. I have a question. Why does the Kendle book cost more than the paperback?

Don't see this product being used for a long time and the balls are easy to lose. Other than that the grandchildren had great fun with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Book ???","review":"It does cover many things about java but the format is horrible.For most chapters, it will give all the theories at the start of the chapters and overwhlem you with all the examples towards the end. It is quite a comprehensive book but you are going to have a hard time linking the theories with the examples.Strongly not recommended for begineers"},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent way to learn Java as well as programming","review":"In reviewing the fifth edition of Deitel's book, I experienced thoroughness of explanation and wealth of different examples needed for teaching and sound pedagogy combined with the practical conciseness needed for industry. This book can serve as a great beginning concepts programming book for the beginning student and will serve the experienced programmer as a reference book for years to come.Upon seeing Deitel's work, I have adopted his book for my class. As an instructor who has taught many programming languages over seventeen years, I can appreciate how Deitel can speak to the beginning programmer and the experienced programmer at the same time in each chapter."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book makes Java more difficult than it actually is!","review":"This is so far the worst programming book I've ever read. The authors obviously don't know how to teach the subject. They throw everything at you at the first few chapters and expect readers to understand it at the end. A terrible book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Like New???","review":"I understand you get your money's worth but false advertisement is another thing. Maybe it was an error on the sender's part but I ordered a book \\"like new\\" at a like new price. I received a book that had water stains, crumpled edges, and an appearance of found it in the attic lets sell it on Amazon. I read reviews expecting more and was dissappointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not Buy this or any Dietel Book!!!","review":"I have never used any text books worse than Dietel ones. How to program in Java and thier C++ books are awful. My college requires these books and I really don't understand why.They break each page up with what they call \\"good programming practices\\" and \\"performance tips\\" and \\"common programming errors\\" and these completely interupt any flow of ideas the main \\"body\\" of the book might be trying to convey.I tried to skip the annoying interuption sections and just read the text, but it is impossible.Please do not waste your time on this book, and if your instructor makes you buy it, beg him or her profoundly to use a different book.I am very disgusted with this book. I wish the Dietel's would just stop making them!!!! If I could have given it negative stars I would have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Wordy","review":"This book is almost 1600 pages, and is way too wordy.Hence, the book is difficult to learn from and is a not a good reference.The authors need to be far more succinct and to he point."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much too dense for a beginner","review":"I chose this book as a text, on the recommendation of a colleague, for an Intro to Java course that I was teaching . After three weeks of using it, I regretted my choice. It is much too dense for a beginner. It also doesn't seem to have a good step-by-step method for learning the parts of the language, preferring to jump ahead into more advanced concepts that are mentioned in an offhand manner far too often. I found myself flipping back and forth constantly. Having said that, I feel that it is a good book to use if you have a decent programming background and a lot of time available. The examples are comprehensive (again, as long as you don't mind flipping back and forth), which would make this book a good auxiliary text."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overpriced and Underdelivers","review":"I can certainly understand the point that the authors were trying to make in presenting us with a textbook that teaches Java while also teaching about the object-oriented paradigm and relating the concepts to software engineering and UML. For that, I can give the book an additional star over the one I would normally award; but that's all. The combination of these concepts within the pages of this volume is so cluttered, so badly written and so poorly executed as to make the effort all but useless. With so many less expensive and better written alternatives available (e.g., \\"Thinking in Java,\\" which can be downloaded for free, and Bloch's \\"Effective Java Programming Language Guide\\"), there are simply too many options available. Between them and the many online tutorials that are available, there is no reason to saddle the reader with such a ponderous edition. Give this one a pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good book - way overpriced.","review":"I got this book as a gift and I already had the Wrox java book by Ivor Horton. They are both very good books, comparable in material covered and in clarity of instruction and explanation. However, this book is over twice the amount of the Wrox book with no advantage. I recommend the Wrox book hands down, unless you just have money to burn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Used in school and do not like it","review":"I used this in my intro to java class and I have to say I didnt like it. If you are teaching yourself DO NOT get this book, its is very jumbled and abstract. When we where learning the class we would have to jump from chapter to chapter so we could learn properly because nothing is on order."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't do the job","review":"I am an experienced programmer who wants to learn Java. Every time I reach for this book I am disappointed. Today I wanted to learn about servlets, but the chapter on servlets is so confusing that I'm going to look for an on-line tutorial instead. The authors completely skip the very important fact that most servlets are invoked when the user first displays an HTML file. Instead, they jump right into showing the code of a very simple servlet instead of taking things from the top, which would be an HTML file.The writing is very wordy and technical. The authors need to use other writing techniques such as step-by-step lists instead of relying on these long paragraphs of text.In general, I find that these authors try to cover every topic on the sun, and end up only touching the high points in the most superficial way, leaving out important aspects of their topics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to find information","review":"It is hard for me to imagine how they managed to publish four editions before this book. The index is terrible; it frequently refers to pages that then refer you to other pages for more information. The index should refer you to the primary location in the first place, and maybe other locations as an after-thought, not the other way around.The overall format of the book also seems to be haphazard, as if the authors did not know which direction to pursue. Granted, there is a lot of information, but it is difficult to decipher.I have enjoyed other Deitel&Deitel; programming books, and was looking forward to reviewing this one. However, now that I have, I can not recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst ever.","review":"A lot is said about Deitel books (especially Java How To). Do not buy them. Im happy I borrowed it at library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Software Engineering, Not Just Programming","review":"This fat book is not just how to program Java, it is how to do softwareengineering! By including a case study, with up-front analysis and designdiagrams in UML, Deitel and Deitel bring the big picture of softwaredevelopment into an introductory programming book."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste time and money","review":"the book is not understandable after chapter 7 ,,i needed another book to understand the concepts and i needed to carry a few dictionary too, deitel should use an easier language to understand,may be they will do in the 15th edition of this book1i reccomend walter savitch ,this is a good book,first i read the book and then i read the chapter that i didnt understand in deitel, after all ,deitel made some sense!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"briefly ,the book is too hard to understand especially after chapter 7,u need a few dictionaries to understand the explanations of the codes, i suggest Walter Savitch 2nd edition,i have this book too and now i understand the concepts"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't reccomend for experienced -or- beginners!","review":"I cannot reccomend this book to experienced programmers learning Java or to beginners. The experienced will find it cluttered and watered down, and beginners will end up with a very novice, incomplete, and probably incorrect comprehension of the more complicated aspects.The first few chapters are ok for someone new to programming but beyond that the text is extremely bloated and only explains complex topics with \\"for dummies\\" examples that will leave you unable to perform in a real enviroment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long and extremely tiring (bad)","review":"I'm new to java after 17 years working in IT. This book is long, tiring, over-detailed. Go with Beginning Java 2 of Ivan Horton if you want to learn Java, this is the best for Java beginner"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Pain in the neck","review":"Yes, it's comprehensive. 1400 pages of unreadable dribble. I had trouble keeping my eyes open. Worse than Wrox at taking pieces of code then demonstrating a billion line examples, explaining them line by line. The explanations are usually a few pages forward in the book so you have to read a sentence, flip back a few pages, read the next sentence, etc ad naseum. Not for beginners. Make sure you have a grip on C++ before attempting this. If you already know Java you might like the book because it covers a lot like Cell phone and PDA tools."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for beginners!","review":"This was the text assigned for a beginning course in Java programming. The book constantly introduces more complex concepts in code examples of elementary topics. There is so much flipping back and forth, as another review noted, that my copy turned yellow with Post-its. It is frequently used as a text because the publishers provide PowerPoint lecture slides for the examples in the book. It might well be an excellent refresher for intermediate or advanced programmers, but beginners would be better off with Sun's well-organized and free on-line tutorial."},{"rating":"2","title":"what i think of this cd","review":"this cd is totaly awsome it has all the good musicians and their best songs it is so cool you can dace to the songs very easily. when i have my new years party this cd will be playing the whole time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD DANCE MUSIC-THE BEST OF PARTY TO GO!","review":"party to go 2000 is the best out of all mtv list.it has all the best songs and great remixs britney spears thinkin' about you (pink bubble gum mix) nsync \\"here we go\\" and steps \\"5,6,7,8,\\".if you are fans of trl and like the music that is on the countdown,you will love this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Law for the elephant","review":"This is an excellent analysis of the development of law in the western frontier as settlement preceded \\"law and order\\" and the common law was adapted to the circumstances"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"As a Joe collector and a Lego collector, I was interested in the \\"Built to Rule\\" Lego clones that Hasbro came up with. My interest died after the first set I got, the Cobra Raven set, (I also got the Transformers Jetfire set, also just as bad). Ugh. The pieces will not stay together even while building, much less for play or display. The quality seems to be poor, and there are so many pre-built and single purpose pieces that it pretty much cancels out any point to it being building blocks.I was happy it came with one of my favourite Cobras, but that was about it. Utterly useless otherwise. As a Joe collector, I recommend you avoid it. As a Lego collector, I recommend you avoid it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blown out of proportion","review":"This book is filled with too many code snippets and references to HTML and SGML. I found myself constantly skipping pages in an attempt to get to any valuable information about XML."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Introduction","review":"I first read this book a few years ago, and still read excerpts from it periodically as friends get involved. In one of the early chapters, St Laurent basically asserts that WYSIWYG was actually a technological setback. I knew at that point I was going to enjoy the book.If you're into computer science, and want to understand the technology - this is a great place to start."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very disappointing book for software developers","review":"Some people appear to really like this book. It has received many glowing reviews, but I can only shake my head in disagreement. This book is a dud -- too much text, and not enough practical advise or code examples.The author could not adequately describe how to use basic XML components such as Document Type Definitions (DTDs), and failed to show how Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) can be used to display XML on the web.If you are a web programmer or need to do something useful withXML, look elsewhere. This is not the book for you. In fact, I'm selling this book. Wanna buy it? I'll use the proceeds to purchase \\"Beginning XML\\" by Kurt Cagle. That book looks promising."},{"rating":"1","title":"Conversational. I didn't find what I was looking for.","review":"I am looking for a book that explains what XML is, what it should be used for, and details. In this book I found discussions of HTML, XML, and SGML, and the pros and cons of various styles, but I did not find the overview I needed nor the details. I like to read books that get right to the point. (I also like to read unix(tm)-style manual pages). Although this book has lots of usefull content, I did not find what I was looking for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"This book takes a very long winded round about way of explaining XML. I admit I only read 70 pages but learned almost nothing. The book is a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"Seems to have been written by someone who with a knowledge of HTML who wanted to write a book about something else.Lots editorial and not much substance"},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent quick introduction to XML","review":"I liked the simple writing style of the author. The book came handy when I needed to learn XML quickly (3 to 4 days) and start writing DTDs. I am not sure why the author started talking about CSS in chapter 2 before introducing XML. I guess he was trying to bridge a gap between HTML and XML. That part was little confusing to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good introduction, Easy Read","review":"It was an easy read. Not a very technical book had easily understood xml examples. I liked all the references to outside sources for further details. Did well in introducing DTD, CSS, XSL. I would like more on database generated xml, dealing with the database structure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Set of 18!!!!!!!!!

In four sections Ellis reflects the latest information on nearly all species of Ichthyosaurs, Plesiosaurs, Pliosaurs and Mosasaurs combined with a lot of outstanding life reconstructions (done by Ellis himself). The text is free of speculation but full of scientific background because Ellis frequently includes the latest inputs from the leading experts. What the book also makes very enjoyable is the fact, that the book is free of difficult technical jargon but gives a lot of references for people that are looking for these technical details. The style and print quality of the book is also very good.In summary one can say confidently that this book is the best popularized book on mesozoic marine life available"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the book I have been waiting for!","review":"There is a great deal of information regarding the life of prehistoric aquatic reptiles. Unfortunately, these amazing creatures have always been relegated to a single chapter in the majority of dinosaur-oriented books (No, these creatures were not dinosaurs, nor were they related to them). Or the most in-depth publications were steeped in the literature of scientific texts.Richard Ellis, like Robert Bakker and Carl Zimmer, has opened the door for the rest of us. Through this great book he is allowing us-- the average reader with an interest in the sciences-- to be a part of that world. His book is a total compendium that describes all the major families of these reptiles: Icthyosaurs, Mosasaurs, Pliosaurs, and of course that perennial candidate for the Loch Ness Monster, the Plesiosaurs.Thank you, Richard Ellis. I love this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as described","review":"I ordered this based on the fact that I could adjust it and it would clip to the air conditioning vents.

At the same time it's something that almost nobody would go out looking for. It's one of those things you stumble across almost totally at random that makes you say to yourself, \\"wow, I had no idea that I needed that\\". Sort of like when you get a backscratcher and start hitting itches you didn't even know you had.Like another reviewer said, it's a great disc to listen to at night with headphones on. It's also wonderful at night or on rainy days in the car. It has a certain darkness and moodiness to it that is so appropriate for those situations.It's good to see that Kevin Moore is still putting out great music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great debut by Kevin Moore","review":"A word of warning to DT fans who have been \\"out of it\\" for a while: don't buy this album expecting Kevin Moore to be doing traditional progressive metal, for you will be very disappointed. DO buy this album, however, and expect a very atmoshperic, stimulating, and moody type of ambient rock. Kevin Moore's vocals are very dark and almost melancholy in their tone, yet they are soothing and soulful as well. Fates Warning drummer Mark Zonder provides the guest percussive talents for most of the songs, displaying some fusion-based rhythms on a majority of the tracks. Overall, the album is fantastic. I can't exactly put into words all of the things that I like about it, but I can tell you that after you listen to tracks like \\"Colorblind\\", \\"Undertow\\", \\"Even The Waves\\", and \\"On The Page\\", you'll most likely listen to this album any time of the day, especially late at night or on a rainy day. Just buy it, you won't regret it... I certainly didn't! :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"atmospheric voyage KV.","review":"This album is a completly diferent thing from what dream theatre or fates warning are, but this isnt a bad thing, instead is a great one, this progresive-ambient album is one of the most original concepts I have heard in years, the vocals are great and very original, the instruments make for a prefect combination (and trip of course), simply astonishing, those progresive-metal fans better look elsewhere, but those with a strong desire to hear something great and original should get this album, its a must-buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kevin Moore Paints a Picture With Sound","review":"After leaving Dream Theater, Berklee Alumni and keyboardist, Kevin Moore left the East Coast beat for some time away to compose this colorful masterpiece. His lyrics and satire are layered with heavy keyboard riffs, mello sounds, and acostic drums. His reference to color perforates the album at many levels. It's an artistic break from the Progressive Viens of his Dream Theater days and a refreshing new approach to keyboard composed music. It's definately a welcome and refreshing alternative to the masses of overplayed, underproduced artists and should be a welcome melodic addition to any musical collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unlike anything by Dream Theater","review":"The album has to much sampling for my taste. Moore remains a great keyboardist, although I don't care for his singing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe it wasme...","review":"I was looking forward to reading this book. It sounded promising- things I like- damsel in distress, strong hero, and great sidekick friend. But then geez. The book just never did anything for me.There was a lot of angst and no sizzle. I mean it was angst, angst, and more angst. They do get together..then they split up, then wham o, back together. But with no sizzle really. I mean really?? After all that?This a romance with lots of heartache and sadness and a small happy ending. I need more than that."},{"rating":"2","title":"moving and satisfying","review":"I was leery of this book after reading some of the other reviews about it being slow. This is also the first novel I have read by this author, but for $3.99 I decided to risk it and I am glad I did. Yes, the story is slow moving, but not in a bad way. This is a book to be savored. . . a book where the small details mean a lot. Dylan is smart and strong, and yet kind and gentle. Melissa has been beaten down by life, but watching her blossom into the woman she was meant to be is beautiful. I agree with others that the ending was a bit too abrupt. An epilogue might have pushed this book to 5 stars for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as I had hoped","review":"Based on the other reviews and the description, I had really high hopes for Harper's Bride. Sadly, it was a predictable book, the characters were shallow (particularly Dylan, as well as the secondary/supporting characters), and their interactions seems contrived and unnatural. Also, the writing was overly simplistic, unsophisticated and unimaginative. Overall I was disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"a bit dull","review":"I was surprised when I read this book at how dull it was - especially after reading the reviews. There was precious little dialogue in the book to move the story along and quite a bit of the internal musings of the characters. I did not feel that the love story was well developed. It did not hold my interest and I was just turning pages trying to get to the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down","review":"I enjoyed this book so much it is not a feel good book in the sense of light hearted read. Alexis Harrington makes you see and feel the time period she is writing about and this was a hard and desperate time. Don't shy away from this book because it's not all smiles and sunshine it is worth your time and the story and characters. will capture your heart.

I did not want to sacrifice some of the features that you lose with an umbrella stoller (basket, comfort, recline etc). This stoller does all this and more. Once you get the hang of folding and opening it is a breeze. It doesn't take up much more space than an umbrella stroller. It has a handle when folded to carry which is real convenient. It is light and maneuvers well. The wheels are a little bigger than an umbrella stroller so it is a little smoother. I haven't been in a store so I cannot provide any feedback on tight spaces. It was also very easy to assemble (just need to attach the basket and wheels. The seat is also a little higher than other strollers. My daughter likes this feature!

Hoops Nation does a great job of bringing out the local color of each court. Ballard brilliantly moves from stories about the players to comments on playgrounds, all the while expressing a true love for the game. The best part about this book is that the author doesnt romanticize his travels. He's just a guy who is looking for a good game, and his detachment succeeds in bringing out the unique flavor of each court he visits.

This book expalins in vivid detail the actual manipulation tactics that are used by the energy, pharmacuetical and tobbaco industries (among others) to blind us into submission and hypnotize us into believing their products are not only safe but are intimately tied to your youth and vitality.An earlier post for this book made the comment that the authors shouldn't explain the actual manipulation strategies, but the dangerous PR firms allready know how to use them.

This CD shows his work as a songwriter and player. It puts him at a new level. His songwriting is excellent and his playing is on par with contemporary players like Euge Groove, Dave Koz, and Walter Beasley. His best work on this CD is where he uses a full ensemble of musicians and stays away from drum programming. This is a great album to listen to from cut one to the end. The best cut by far is \\"Stride\\", and he does a cover of \\"Never Gonna Get It\\" with fellow sax players Kim Waters and Steve Cole which is a good listen as well.

These accounts of Schubert's 3rd and 4th Symphonies performed by conductor Igor Markevitch leading the Berlin Philharmonic are truly remarkable. However, these late mono recordings are already featured on CD -- the 3rd was just included in Markevitch's \\"Original Masters\\" box set and the 4th has been in print for years paired with two Berwald Symphonies on a DG Originals disc (see my reviews of both titles). In fairness, the latter is being phased out and becoming harder to find, but there is no excuse for the former as it was just released in 2003. Overall, the \\"Musik...Sprache der Welt\\" series offers great music at a great price, but surely there are rarer gems than these hidden in the DG vaults."},{"rating":"2","title":"What time travel on a realistic Earth would lead to","review":"The mental and physical changes of Ron Moosic through the book created an interesting cycle.

Each one helping and caring about one another and growing in understanding love, trust and hope. The character development is thorough of the two main protagonists, Adam and Miranda.

Neil Diamond's reputation got a bit battered after the seventies and he became an \\"easy-listening\\" favorite. Listening to these tunes now, they do seem a bit kitchy. A lot of Diamond's lyrics provide unintentional laughter - examples: \\"I am I said, to no one there. And no one heard at all, not even the chair...\\" and \\"the love she sang to me, the love she brang to me...\\" That having been said, one can't help but sing along with most of these songs which have seeped into our collective subconscious. At the end of the day, Diamond is a really good songwriter. This is a great collection of his best songs from the seventies. It leaves off early hits like \\"I'm a Believer\\" and \\"Girl, You'll be a Woman Soon\\" and all his eighties stuff like \\"Forever in Bluejeans\\" - for those, you have to buy two other Greatest Hits compilations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glory Road...Abbreviated","review":"If \\"12 Greatest Hits\\" wasn't enough and \\"Glory Road:1968-72\\" was too much, then this collection will be just right.

The worst thing about it was coming to the end and knowing there was no more to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ideology with a little math...","review":"I find it very difficult to appreciate this book. While I'm very interested in the subject matter and thought much of the mathematics was interesting, I found the author's wholesale plugging of his ideologies unpleasant, insulting and out-of-place.I am simply not used to reading a math book (popular or otherwise) filled with vitriol for the UN, Socialism, Communism, the Romans, environmentalists or any of the other pet peeves the author seems to have.Mathematics is a subject of pure reasoning. I find the author's constant ideological interjections distracting and a worrying sign of his rigidity of thinking. I'd recommend one pass over this book and keep moving along..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A journey through history, science and personalities","review":"This is more than a \\"book on mathematics\\". It is an engaging work, chock full of diagrams, charts and illustration, that serve to highlight the witty, erudite text. ALong the way we touch a variety of subjects, numerology, ancient Greece and Rome, professional jealousy, explorers, the Middle Ages and last, but not least, the seeimingly infinite ways in which people have tried to calculate the value of pi.We start in neolithic times and advance to the Egyptians and Babylonians where he surmises on their attemtps to derive this important number. The book is arranged chronolgically and Beckmann attempts to portray the social and scientific conditions under which a particular theory was conceived. It is also the story of the greats of science, the giants of the mind - Archimedes, Euclid, Newton, Pascal and Euler (and thers)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the effort","review":"Some interesting things I didn't know.However, the author goes on several rants about topics not at all relevant to the matter at hand.I'm sure there are better products to be found."},{"rating":"1","title":"A poorly baked pi","review":"There is little to recommend about this title. The author seems to wander into different tangents while getting off of the subject at hand, namely pi. There is little chronological order as shown in many excerpts where he covers a span of 600 years in as little as one page. I find my self constantly referring to the generously given dates strewn about, trying to determine the order of discovery or the century in which he has just jumped to."},{"rating":"1","title":"entertaining but obnoxious","review":"The author sounds like someone I'd love to meet at the Oak Bar for a few martinis--but over a book's length his initially amusing tantrums and diatribes about the fools of history (of whom in his opinion the Romans seem to have been the most numerous) start to wear thin. They're also not true."},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes me laugh, though it's not supposed to be funny","review":"Who would have thought that a book about the history of a transcendental could be so politicized! He wastes an entire chapter railing about how he thinks the Romans were just a bunch of dicks. He shows that the Archimedes Screw is still in use today, but not without claiming that Egyptian leaders \\"think it more important to destroy Israel than provide their people with modern irrigation.\\" And it just keeps going. I roll my eyes and snigger at the sheer irrelevance of his politicizing, but there's plenty of other books about pi that stay on subject and don't waste time editorializing."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm a new student of mathematics (age 55) and this helped.","review":"The uses of pi were never so understandable to me as in Beckman's work. I found the historical use and consistency fascinating."},{"rating":"2","title":"A leisure read","review":"Buy this book if you are a math lover and are also interested in its history. Although It's not an serious math book that you can learn whole lot of math from, it does contain some mathematical derivations, formulas, proofs which can be skipped without destroying the coherency of the author's presentation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two thumbs DOWN","review":"I agree with those who give two thumbs DOWN to this book. No question that you can easily find used versions of this book to sell.This book will not be a prestigious member of my small library. Beckmann's major story line is his personal hate against all bad things that happened in the past. Concerning the history of Pi the book has some value, but I found nothing in it that one could not find on Internet in 5 minutes. His speculations are the only exceptions.I feel I wasted my money purchasing this book. If you have the chance to have a look into the book prior to purchase, go to chapter 5 or 8 to see the real content of the book. Don't be mislead by the first chapter. That is perhaps the only part that carries some values."},{"rating":"1","title":"An irritating little book","review":"I agree with the majority here:- there are some interesting little anecdotes.

Of course, what should we expect from someone who spent most of his life trying to debunk the theory of relativity?As many of the reviews have stated, Beckmann spends a lot of time discussing his pet political opinions and not a lot of time actually discussing pi. His tone is horrible and most of his asides aren't only unrelated to his arguments, but completely unsupported. Although I agreed with a lot of his opinions, they had no place in a book about the history of mathematics.If you're looking for a general history on mathematics with a lot of hyperliberal rants, then this might be the book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"3.1 stars... rounded up!","review":"This research could not have been more economically true to the title of the work. A history reads like a collective relay race in an effort to square the circle; complete with methods, computations and their respective diagrams. As prose this could be called piece-biographical and selectively-historical as diviners of Pi are recognized for their progress. From modern computer models to the monte carlo method Pi itself decides that a final unbounded quantity is the best solution in searching and researching for an answer. Accented with witty insight 'Pi' never goes flat and can be enjoyed even without a strong mathematical background.

Since then I have gotten so much stronger and the results are visible. I've lost pounds and inches and now I can do all of the jumping jacks that Bob wants you to do in the video. It makes you feel amazing! I love the challenges and it has truly motivated me to do more. I'm slowly working my way out of the modified moves into the more challenging ones.

I am a retired senior citizen, and exercise daily, and found I could keep up, but I did find this video a true workout. I liked the fact you could program how much you wanted to do by choosing 1 to 3 workouts, and then adding the warm-up and cool-down. The instruction by Bob is very clear, but the cueing is awful. (I would have given this 5 stars were it not for the bad cueing, and giving it 4 stars was a stretch, too, but the workout itself is soooo good.) You may be keeping up with the group exactly, but when the camera goes from Bob showing something back to the group, you will be off (or, rather, they are off). This is constant and very annoying throughout the entire video. But the workout itself gets a #10. I hope the video company redoes this, because the editing/cueing job is truly awful. ."},{"rating":"2","title":"I enjoy this one","review":"I really enjoy the instruction from Bob.

I found Dremora while web surfing for bands in the same genre as Nightwish (and others). Often when you find a band you like, you end up having to order their music from Europe. Dremora is one of the very few American bands in the Gothic, symphonic, operatic genre. Their first EP is a fine example of this type of music. It's a bit like a combination of Nightwish and Epica, two of my favorite new bands although certainly not a clone of either. The first three songs have the characteristic Gothic metal sound with heavy guitar and fine soprano vocals from Juliano Novo. The last tune on the disc is a Gothic instrumental that is more typical of some of the German bands like Elis or Lyriel. All great stuff. So, if you like Nightwish, Epica, After Forever, Edenbridge, or Within Temptation, try out this new band. I think you'll like it and, like me, want more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Promising","review":"Not in the league of peers, but pleasant and promising. Very capable voice. Weak point - composing.

It is great phone that gets great reception and has a lot of useful features. However, the real reason I am writing a review is to alert you that that phones may be refurbished even though they say new. After I received my phone, I was having weird security issues (i.e. not allowing out-going calls, password protection, etc.). I worked with the blackberry administrator for my firm and he said it was due to the fact my phone was refurbished. I contacted amazon, and after a few rounds of emails, they finally admitted that due to a problem with the vendor the phone was refurbished. Amazon never made any effort to contact me before this to alert me that the phone they sold me was refurbished.

The sure type has never learned to make \\"OK\\" when I type those keys and correct it. I find I text less because it is too slow. You can't save often used text messages.

It's a short read but certainly with some substance. Ernest Shackleton is, of course, a famous traveler and explorer and there is little new information in the book on the actual subject of his travels. However, the author, who I believe is Shackleton's relative of sorts, does a decent job of putting his experiences in the context of today's management practices. The author analyzes specific actions by the explorer (selection of prospective employees, using public relations to advance his cause and fundraise, etc.) and summarizes take-aways in a simple and straightforward fashion. More than anything, the book made me want to go out and find our more about the man!"},{"rating":"1","title":"More platitudes on leadership","review":"The authors have taken a potential exemplar of effective leadership and obscured the lessons to be learned with a farrago of trite and banal exhortations. Add this book to the swelling number of leadership publications that offer no deep insight into leaders and the leadership phenomenon."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Very Dull Book for an Important Subject","review":"I guess you can derive as much pleasure from reading this book as you would from The Joy of Cooking. I am sure there is a great deal to be learned about leadership skills from Shackleton's expeditions, as is evidenced by the italicized and boldfaced summary statements throughout the book. These are great ingredients of leadership success, but somehow Shackleton the leader fails to leap out of the pages of the book as a living hero. I have never read a book about a great leader written in such dry prose. Maybe the project was doomed by the authors' objective of culling some neat points from various accounts of the great explorer's adventures for today's self-improvement book market. Has anyone been inspired to be a great culinary artist by reading The Joy of Cooking?"},{"rating":"2","title":"for leaders and the led","review":"This book gives a beautifully pared-down account of an extraordinary story and provides remarkably appropriate analogies in our present day. It should inspire many to read more on the subject of Shackleton and the Endurance expedition,particularly Endurance by Alfred Lansing.Whether you are a leader or among the led in any facet of your life there are lessons to be learned and remembered here. They are laid out in a clear and concise format and illustrated by the ongoing saga of Shackleton and the amazing group of men he brought through an unbelievably harrowing adventure. The book reminds us of the power of good, of compassion, perseverance, and honesty. It is well worthwhile reading for anyone interested in a marvelous story and how it relates to all of us in the here and now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Armstrong","review":"This is just an excellent book.

The story telling is horrible IMHO. I know this is a remarkable story but the authors butchered it. And the attempt to weave in leadership lessons further ruined the story telling. The authors hit you over the head with obvious leadership lessons rather than focusing on telling a good story. I'm amazed at the positive reviews here. I almost never stop reading a book without finishing it, but this was one exception. My time was too valuable to waste on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great leader, not so great leadership book","review":"Ernest Shackleton accomplished arguably superhuman things. He was good at selecting, cajoling and inspiring men. How he brought his crew back alive from such a frozen, forbidding world, is one of the amazing miracles of the past two hundred years.Yet a close, hard look suggests that the leadership lessons to be learned are limited for most readers. The authors try too hard to take each Shackleton episode or act as a lesson tobe learned and applied yet these lessons are not as clear as the authors might want to suggest nor are the lessons necessarily generalizeable to modern life or commerce. After reading the entire book, little remains to explain Shackleton's theory or practice of leadership, just a lot of anecdotes and incidents. Shackleton and his leadership remain inscrutable.An amazing story, yes. An amazing leadership book, I think not."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent book about an outstanding man","review":"Shackleton was an incredible man, who undertook an incredible journey, and in spite of unbelievable hardship, returned home with the entire crew.

Yesterday I replaced the battery and took the unit apart to find out why the power button didn't work. Turns out they had the wrong part installed in my UPS. The push button was way too short to contact the switch on the circuit board. APC's commercial products are very good but their consumer line is junk.

I was, however, very unpleased with the APC website which was supposed to help me choose the right model. The interface is not very intuitive, but I managed to put in the information about our two computers and hard drives. However, I was immediately steered to the high-end models, costing well above $500. I couldn't even find the affordable models through the useless APC web site.

Before I picked up this book, I was making some use of the Oxford Classical Text, and the difference is painfully clear.

It's so rare to truly like every song on a CD, but this is one of those rare occasions. The opening dissonance of \\"Sailor\\" starts the album off letting the listener know something unique is in store. A heavenly song called \\"Heaven\\" sounds like a love song from a mother to a child (at least to me). \\"Medicine\\" is a visual song for me. It starts off quite mellow, but as the singer gets more and more needy for her medicine, I can \\"see\\" the temper tantrum of the truly addicted coming to a violent outburst.Music and gorgeous vocals create a beautiful atmosphere. The lyrics are poetic and the whole thing is just unique in a world of bland, musical crap that for some reason millions of people would rather listen to. But, if you are not one of those, give this a listen. It's too bad none of the tracks are available here to be sampled, but try the Story of M website!"},{"rating":"1","title":"8 planets only!!!??","review":"We got the same Glowing in the dark Solar System for Christmas. It has the same packaging, looks the same, but Pluto is totally missing from it! There are only 8 planets orbiting the sun and even in the description they talk about only eight, not mentioning Pluto at all! So when you buy this product in a store (we have it from Michaels) or online, count the planets on the package! Luckily my 7 year old realized the missing planet himself. He has fun putting it together and painting it and won\`t be confused since he knows it already, but it is very weird, since it is supposed to be a fun science product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful voice, interesting album","review":"Maire Brennan has a beautiful voice as you'll see when you listen to this album.

Crawford has always brought falsetto to a new \\"high\\" (pardon the pun). You want to see the best Phantom, check out Craig Schulman, best known for almost 2000 performances as Valjean in \\"Les Miserables\\"... or Cris Groenendaal... or the current Phantom, Howard McGillin. All so much better than Crawford.To hear Crawford sing \\"Bring Him Home\\" from \\"Les Mis\\".... well, that is simply a travesty.

It helped, but the elastic was so tight that I had to take it off for a few hours each day. I ordered the medium and that has been much better. I wear it 24 hours a day and it has made a huge difference. It doesn't cure the problem, but it definitely makes the pain and discomfort more manageable.

I appreciate Rex-Johnson's introduction that focuses and guides consumers on ocean and fish sustainability. This is befitting any bonafide cook from the Northwest (or anywhere!). Besides great recipes, she includes a helpful Appendix of techniques, everything from making bread crumbs to a chiffonade. The book seems basic enough, and sophisticated enough, for a broad range of cooking skills. And the photos and presentation are beautiful, interwoven with historial trivia related to fishing. There's a lot in this little gem."},{"rating":"2","title":"A big book in a gift-size package","review":"The Pike Place Market is a destination point for anyone visiting Seattle. The market is a vibrant maze of fish stalls, vegetable vendors, meat purveyors, etc. To local foodies, the market is shopping central, especially for seafood. Tourists love the sense of history, plus the entertaining fishmongers singing and acrobatically tossing whole fish across the counter.Braiden Rex-Johnson, an expert on the Pike Place Market, captures the essense of the market in this gift-size cookbook. The stunning photographs bring alive the color and commotion of the market, and the exceptional recipes reflect the diversity of Northwest cuisine. Don't miss trying the recipe for Baked Whole Salmon with Vietnamese Dipping Sauce. I made it for a dinner party and it was a dramatic presentation.

The author developed each of his characters very carefully and each seemed very authentic. The portrayal of the professor/writer who represented one of the major characters was indeed someone I came to observe carefully throughout my reading. While he wasn't the most attractive individual, I found him to be a struggling and real human being. He's at a difficult age in his life and some of the seams are showing. His student, also a writer is a complex character. Through the story, a kind of mystery develops that left me anticipating outcomes. This was an excellent technique used by the author.All in all, this was a very engaging story that made it easy to read to the end. Unexpected outcomes from my anticipations made it all the more intersting."},{"rating":"1","title":"How much longer is this book anyway???","review":"Currently about 2/3 of the way through with this book. Was the author smoking as much as our main character? IF...only if I can complete this novel; I'll feel like I've accomplished something. The 'wonder' of Wonder Boys is how it got published. Perhaps I'm missing out due to my refusal to do street drugs? The characters are really poorly fleshed out and the endless jumping from scene to scene made my head spin. If there's a point or a theme; I've missed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Honest & Brilliant","review":"The best thing about Wonder Boys is the absolute honesty of the characters. You can't help but identify with at least one of the characters in the book. And they are all so brilliantly flawed and heart breaking, yet at the same time you find yourself laughing out loud a long with them as you read it.Grady Tripp is a professor and author who is attempting to finish his new novel. His life is in total shambles and with the help of his eccentric student and pill popping editor in one crazy weekend, he'll have to deal with it all. This book is totally funny and such a pleasure to read. You'll find yourself cracking up, reminiscing those crazy college days, and feeling happy your life seems a tad bit more controlled than poor Grady's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Enjoyable!","review":"This book is very unique in its style. One of the many things I enjoyed about the book was that the characters were real. They were human, and flawed just like everybody, but as flawed as they were, they were also endearing. This story also gets to the heart of what its like to be a writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Writing Workshop Writing About Writing Workshops","review":"I've tried to be impressed with this book, but cannot. That Michael Chabon is a master of the language is not in doubt. What is in doubt is whether, ultimately, his story and, more importantly, his characters, are relevant. If you want to spend a weekend reading a novel about pot heads in Pittsburgh, with a touch of homosexual love interest (isn't that sweet?), then this myopic exposition is for you. The main protagonist is too pathetic, the plot too lacking in higher action, the point of view too seedy (in an unexciting sense of the word). Reading it is to feel squeezed into a drab colored, excessively confining frame. Stories about writing workshops by products of writing workshops always seem to beg the question. Mr. Chabon, take a lesson from Thom Jones -- move out into the world. Away from the classrooms and away from the excessive self absorption of the ego hominem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Emotionally Detached","review":"There is little formally wrong with Chabon's Wonder Boys. The laughs are there, and the narrator is amusing and can turn a phrase well. Unfortunately, the novel is uneven in this regard. Very brilliant sections and followed by dull ones, where the effort seems to fall flat. The large middle section of the book involving the quirky Passover seder reads like a set piece of other seders going terribly wrong.In the end, this so-called dark musing on contemporary writing and the life it generates is curiously detached, emotionally uninvolved, and even trite. Is this the work of the \\"great\\" Michael Chabon?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much in some areas, too little in others","review":"There is little formally wrong with Chabon's Wonder Boys.

For most Americans this \\"Wonder Boys\\" would be a mediocre or perhaps for the non-discriminating, optimistic, fundamentally nice readers it is a decent book but for those of us who seek literature and enlightenment this is not the book to read. This book sheds light on Michael Chabon's shortcomings as his uninteresting, unsympathetic characters exhibit their banal traits within an even more trite and just plain stupid plot. If you have time to read this book enter this endeavor knowing what your getting into or take my advice and don't take the gamble that you might enjoy this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pre-Pulitzer Grace","review":"Wonder Boys is nothing short of magnificent. While Chabon was awarded a Pulitzer for a Kavalier and Clay, this is a far superior work. Taking place over the short span of a weekend, Wonder Boys manages to embrace the reader and take him along on a tour of middle aged panic, Mid-Atlantic mindset, and fear of mediocrity. As his world crashes down around him, our hero Grady Tripp is forced to make decisions, apparently for the first time in many years. He is at once lover, mentor, failure, last hope and father figure to those surrounding him. Can he pull it off? Read and find out."},{"rating":"2","title":"have not yet seen the movie...","review":"I have a fourth of the way left to go in the book and I can't stop thinking about it. The irony is astounding and the word choice creates and atmosphere of being inside a writers head. Chabon portrays the lifestyle of a struggling writer in a way that mirrors the theme of the book--eccentric. There is something special about a book and its author that includes allusions to popular culture, films and other literary works. The allusions throughout the book bring the reader closer to tripp and leer. I look forward to finishing the book but I am dreading having it out of my life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable story of a puer aeternus","review":"Michael Chabon is one of my favorite writers. This early novel, set in Pittsburgh, is about an author who is blocked, with a 2000-page manuscript he can't seem to finish, yet who nonetheless cannot rid himself of his childish ways and start taking responsibility for his actions. Sort of a dark Peter Pan. Very readable and enjoyable, as well as humorous throughout."},{"rating":"1","title":"a wordy, uninteresting \\"WordFest\\"","review":"Someone has to balance the surfeit of obsequious praise lavished on this pretentiously written book, so I'm obliging. Chabon even uses words that are not in the dictionary, e.g., deinotherian. I realized halfway through the novel that I cared not a whit for any of the dissolute characters or what happened to them. I originally thought I would read the book then rent the film to see the characters rendered alive. To endure their various travails once more is too much for moi."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful!","review":"This book was chosen for our book club. Everybody was disappointed. Saying it was awful is one of the kinder opinions from our club members..."},{"rating":"2","title":"The mark of great skill!","review":"I've barely finished this book and I already feel like a swan diving off the roof; Mr. Chabon is that good. The story of an eccentric novelist whose life turns upside down in the midst of a writer's block is insightful, entertaining and thought provoking. The dark humor is second to none. Granted, Grady Tripp isn't the most pleasant character ever read, but his off-kilter personality had me in stitches throughout the novel. I haven't seen the film yet but I hope Michael Chabon made pots of money off its release. What a skillful and brilliant novelist. You must read this book immediately."},{"rating":"1","title":"wierd but not very humorous","review":"I thought the book was sad and disjointed. I really don't understand the ratings for this book.Maybe better if you are not sober!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Try Lucky Jim","review":"A lot like Kingsley Amis' Lucky Jim, but not as subtle or imaginative in the writing. Both novels are based on stories of failed, very selfish academics. The surprise in Lucky Jim is that the failed academic is fired (or at least fails to leap over the probation bar). If you want to read a novel of this kind, Lucky Jim is more appealing (in the writing more than in the character). Forced humour in both, I thought."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good","review":"I read a bit of this, then skimmed the rest. I could pick out the plot points like they were flags on a golf course. Literary fiction is supposed to be pure, with no tricks. Well, this had plotting as awkward as the worst John Grisham novel. And its pretentious use of language made me cringe at times. If Chabon is the best literary writer under 40 (as some say he is), then MTV really has destroyed some minds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Michael Chabon is a rising star.","review":"When his first book of short stories came out, his writing drew comparisons to Salinger, but after this, his third work, I don't know how accurate that is. He has developed a style all his own, combining humor and energy with just plain good fiction. Not as funny as _The Mysteries of Pittsburgh_, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing as this work is definitely worth reading. I think that Michael Chabon and Nick Hornby have a lot in common, and the two of them are the authors I watch the papers for in anticipation of new releases. The characters in their stories are seperated as the Americans and the British look at life in slightly different ways, but both imbue their characters with such charisma and humor that you cheer them on no matter how stupid they may be acting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Reading","review":"This is writing at its best, the way that writing should be. Chabon's novel is completely engaging from the first page until the last. Anyone who enjoys reading well written literature will love this book.

One of the wheels fell off after only one day of use and the other would not turn.

The two vertical pockets on the front are very difficult to use. Rather than two vertical, what is needed is one horizontal as a \\"drop pocket\\" to use before going through airport security. The external side pockets are too narrow to hold a phone or anything else.The photo and description are misleading.

However, the title had led me to believe that this book focused on material advancement, whereas the author actually focuses upon being rich within the totality of circumstances. While there is a good deal of discussion about material prosperity, there is a decidedly spiritual slant to the message. Like other Murphy books, there are many scriptural references to be found here, but I want to emphasize that this isn't a dogmatic, religious approach to prosperity. The book contains many anecdotal stories that illustrate the points the author is making. In a nutshell, positive self talk, coupled with the ability to truly forgive others can lead to great things."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is there any respect to the reader?","review":"When I was reading the book, I thought the stories were interesting.

I know this copy has been revised, but there was no introduction from the Ian McMahan who did the revision. There should be at least a paragraph saying that the stories have been altered to make them more appealing the new generation.

Well worth the money if you're a Yes fan. The only negative is there's no Wakeman or Kaye, but with those parts being well executed by the orchestra, it really becomes a plus instead of a drawback. Still, if you're hoping to hear some dynamic keyboard parts, you may be disappointed. Overall this is musically their best recent disc (tie with The Ladder).

I found most of these rather good songs especially \\"The Creul Surf\\" at the end which shows that this group was not about wimp rock at all. This was an underrated group that because they only had 2 hits in America they were written off as wimps. Not true at all. This was actually an album of some well hidden rockers. They do a few covers here, but a couple were rather good sounding. So pretty much I can get rid of \\"Little Children\\" as being the be all end all of this group, and say that they're pretty good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works as advertised, good quality.","review":"This product works as advertised, quality is very good.

The island is for him only a place to fear (e.g. he actually discusses the possibilities of virus injected into migratory birds as biological warfare), or a place for future investments. The book is actually worse than I expected, and it makes me sad that scholars can produce such useless material about an interesting place as Cuba is. I guess Falcoff just isn't curious, or feels no empathy for other cultures. He says \\"Americans are - unlike their European, Canadian, or Latin American counterparts - intrusive and inquiring\\".

I am not a diabetic but I used to get hungry right after I ate and I got those ravaging hunger pangs with irritability and even lightheadedness. When I use this honey I don't get those anymore.I take honey water along with me during my outings in the summer. Not so great in the winter because it solidifies as it cools, becomes grainy/sandy and tickles my throat in an uncomfortable way as it goes down.

I love historical fiction, espescially told from a woman's point of view. Especially when there is some mystical or magical aspects. This book starts out strong, and has a lot going for it. But from start to finish, the characters never progess. There is no rising action, no climax. It is just bleak and you pretty much dislike all of the characters by the end. I was just trying to get through the last 65 pages or so, absolutely no joy or real compulsion to finish except to get it done."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Thrall's Tale","review":"Judith Lindbergh, The Thrall's Tale (Penguin 2007) depicts the Norse settlement in Greenland in the 10th century (the epoch of Eric the Red). The protagonists are a woman slave (or thrall) of Irish extraction (a crypto-Christian in the twilight of the traditional Norse gods), her daughter (the product of a brutal rape), and the elderly seeress who takes them both in. The writing is almost poetry. It not only puts the reader into that world; it puts you into their skins.I found it quite absorbing."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING!","review":"I must admit that this book started out good and I was really happy with it. The lady is a good enough writer and the plot seemed intriguing. But what the hell happened, I couldn't quite tell you.

One too many times to keep this book in my library from here on out. Its getting donated to Goodwill, where I hope some person will find it and hopefully enjoy it more than I did. I really wanted to like this one, but it just comes up short in a decent story."},{"rating":"1","title":"not good at all","review":"I really thought the book was going to be great when I read the inside cover and duskjacket write up, but it is nothing of the kind.Someone on the back cover of the book compared it to Memoirs of a Geisha , that is laughable as it is not even comparable.I have no problems with the way the story is told, its the dialogue which is extremely hard to follow. It gets descriptive and perhaps too crazy? I don't know how to describe it. Characters shouting out or chanting? It was just too stupid to even follow. Just horrible dialogue and the storyline is not strong enough to make up for it.I eventually gave up and stopped reading the book. It gets worse as the story goes. Sometimes I even forget who was speaking in the story and I find my mind wandering around.Its a real shame , since it says the author spent 10 years researching the story and historical facts. Perhaps she should have worked on the dialogue.Dont' even bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dry as dust","review":"Through the eyes of three women, we see the era in which the worship of Odin begins to wane as Christ comes to the Norse people. Katla, a woman born to slavery, learns freedom in Christ, but still she suffers much. Thorjeld, an old witch who worships the pagan demons, resents Katla and her neglect of the child born of Katla's rape, one Thorjeld believes is powerful and possibly the reincarnation of her own mother. Finally, there is the child herself, Bibrau, a warped, sick girl who hungers for love, but is perhaps one of the least loveable characters ever born into fiction. The narrative is dry and violent, and does not make you care about the people in the story. It might make a good sleeping pill."},{"rating":"2","title":"thrall","review":"This book gives you an insight into the Nordic people and how their lives are different because they have to deal with such cold weather and with the length of the days in winter.

It was what I expected."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excited by the dust jacket write-up, disappointed in the book","review":"I was excited about reading this book when I read the write-upon the dust jacket. It sounded like something I would really like.It started out well with the story of Katla, a thrall (or slave) onher way to Greenland in A.D. 985. I enjoyed the description ofevery day life for the new settlers. The conflict between theworshippers of the old Norse Gods and the new Christians wasinteresting.But ... I didn't like any of the characters. I had troublefollowing what was going on. The narration is in first person,split between the voices of Katla, her daughter Bibrau, andThorbjorg, the seeress/healer. I often had to go back and rereadentire sections to get the flow of the story - especially whenthe narration was in Bibrau's voice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intense and Intriguing","review":"When I read \\"The Thrall's Tale\\" I was transported to a time and place unknown to me. The travel back in time was electrifying. The language takes a few pages to become your own and the descriptions are detailed, but necessary to place you into this barren and difficult land. The historical notes were helpful to understand background.I recommend this tale to all those who love historical fiction with a story placed in a mystical setting. The battle between paganism and Christianity was thought provoking. My reaction to the characters - intense. I was either intrigued or disgusted by them. When I finished the book, I wanted to know what happened to the characters next.I loved this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"trying to hard to be deep","review":"I can't define my disappointment. The blurb on the inside cover held so much promise. The setting, the plot, even the outline of the characters seemed to be exactly something I'd enjoy. Unfortunately, that blurb may have been the best part of the book. I finished the book with a bad taste in my mouth. Not one of the characters invoked any sympathy at all. I couldn't bring myself to care about any of them. I couldn't like them or hate them. The plot was predictable and tired. But the absolute worst of it all was the complete indulgence of the prose. If the author could have gotten over herself and her inflated sense of prose, maybe she could have managed at least a decent story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please let this end","review":"The book started to pull me in to a very intriguing story of the lives of three women, Thorjeld who believes and studies the old Norse ways, Katla a Christian who does not follow Christ but has memories from her childhood, and the last Bibrau who is following the dark demon ways. Unfortunately the narrative is dry and you quickly lose interest in the people in the story. I got to a point where I just wanted to get to the end, which was such a disappointment. If everyone was as sad as the main characters of this novel, I would think that the Norse civilization would have just killed themselves from sheer depression!"},{"rating":"1","title":"convoluted","review":"I didn't really care for this book, the plot was long and drawn out, and slow moving.

The book is arranged chronologically and bounces from one geographic location or civilization during one period of time to another civilization in the same period. Then he will move on to a later period so there is good cross-reference between civilizations. It's really great having so much information covered in a single book and at the end of each chapter, he gives a bibliography of further reading you can do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great price for a textbook!","review":"I purchased this book for a history class I am currently taking. So far, I have really enjoyed the book. The author does a great job transitioning through the time periods of each civilization. He moves through the material at a steady but relaxed pace, while explaining the details of the culture and politics, along with the civilizations�?origins, formation, and decline. The price was also enticing, as it was more expensive in my local bookstore.

I consider this Yes's best collection since they really didn't care what the record company or the critics said.By the way, my favorite piece is The Ancient - first piece - fast vibraphones and wailing guitar!My only criticism is the production. The sound of the entire collection is not as clear as Close to the Edge or Relayer.

They start something and they don't know how to finish it, they need a composer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"the most boring yes on cd.","review":"A huge let down from the quality of the yes album,fragile,close to the edge & yessongs.Don't waste your money or time on this one.The joke at the time of the album's release back in the 70's was that Yes finally went over the edge!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes At Their Pompous Best","review":"Okay folks; if you're not a fan of Yes- move right along, there's nothing to see here. You see, this is progressive rock at its worst- bombastic, overwrought,and pretentious. Go somewhere and lock yourself in a room with some nice Asia, or maybe a flask of Emerson, Lake and Palmer. For the rest of you: this is Yes at their most fun. While 90% of the music listening public would find this terribly horrible, we who know better and can appreciate what they at least were *trying* to achieve can revel in the mindless flight of fancy that is this album. So as far as rating this album, consider it thusly: a generous four stars for Yes fans- a paltry 1.5 stars for everyone else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rainbows, sunshine, alternate view!","review":"As a kid, I was into classical music so Yes appealed to me if only because the songs were long and complex. Being the longest and most complex of their albums, I obviously liked Tales. I listen to the modern groups but, to this day, Yes is the only music I never tire of. There's something pure and smart and \\"nice\\" about it. Some people listen to music that makes them want to commit suicide. Yes makes you want to live."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Yes album ever","review":"I am a huge Yes fan. I am an even bigger Rick Wakeman fan, and he shines on this album. I've been listening to this album for years and only recently picked up the remastered version (Mini LP version just like the real album.)What a pleasure to here this album so crisp and with the two bonus tracks. As far as I'm concerned, Yes without Rick Wakeman is subpar. Along with his solo album \\"The Six Wives of Henry VIII\\", this is his best work. I am so pleased to see so many others agree!Go do yourself a favor and pick up this masterpiece!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Far below their best material","review":"As a longtime and diehard Yes fan, I can safely say that this album is a serious clunker. Another reviewer said this is a love or hate album. I would agree. I wouldn't say I hate it, but I definitely dislike most of it. The Ritual is pretty good, but the rest is just boring and directionless. I love long epic prog songs, but these songs just sound like they were made long just for the sake of being long. They just kind of meander along with no purpose or direction at all. It is a shame because the albums before and after it are all great. The Yes Album, Fragile and Close To The Edge are 3 of the greatest prog albums of all time and Relayer is pretty darn good too, but Tales From Topographic Oceans just falls way short of the mark."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Strange Genesis Album","review":"Quite surprisingly, there was a mistake with the cover when I bought this record. Besides, why did the band replace Peter Gabriel with a clone of Jon Anderson? Apart from that, you can clearly recognize Steve Hackett's guitar play and Phil Collins' drumming. Mike Rutherford has a rawer sound that usual, but that's him with no doubt (basic but efficient bass lines) and Tony Banks is still the same great virtuoso, although his Minimoog sounds a little cheap. But why the hell do they only play one after another on this record? And why these hippy versions of Supper's Ready and Watcher Of The Skies? This album is supposed to be experimental, not only because of the tracks' running time - so why do I feel that it's been done before (and better)?OK, I think you got the point."},{"rating":"1","title":"practically unlistenable","review":"me too, i've been listening to this great band since about 1970. i even saw them open for elp in philadelphia. they were amazing!! recently, i've been picking up their remastered material and have been thrilled to rediscover them, at least up until i relistened to tales... now i remember why i pretty much lost interest in them after this album, with the exception of relayer. i never thought i'd agree with the critics of prog rock, having always loved it; from early yes to early genesis, to caravan, etc. i'm disappointed to say, but this album is practically unlistenable. sorry, guys."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Pretentious Poop","review":"There are few worse experiences than listening to this music 30 years later and realizing that the only possible reason you could have liked it then was because your consciousness was altered. Meaningless pseudo-philosophical lyrics are layered on top of melodies that meander and never resolve. This musical mediocrity effectively ended Yes's artistic credibility."},{"rating":"2","title":"Right stuff, wrong time","review":"I'd agree with the statement made by members of the band that they made what should have been their masterwork at a bad time. The upshot is we are left with a 'draft' of what might have been the best album ever, given a few more revisions. As it is, it's patchy, with rough ideas spoiling absolute sublimity. Their later keyboard player summed it up recently when he said, 'If they'd done it with 90's technology, it would have been incredible'. But with 70s production techniques, it was just too much of a challenge. That said - there is still no better double album in existence than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Primary goal: to make four album side length songs","review":"It's obvious that the only objective for this Yes album was to fulfill the conceit of making four album-side length songs. How those songs are composed, and whether they made cohesive pieces of music was secondary at best. I don't understand other reviewers take on this album as great progressive rock. It's NOTHING like Close to the Edge or Fragile in the way those albums could draw the listener in and involve him with great grooves and great musical pieces that gel together. The album cover is the best part."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some great moments, but I'm with Wakeman on this one","review":"I had problems with this one thirty years ago, and I still do. Some great moments here and there, but lots of flashy, tuneless, pointless grandstanding as well, and as another reviewer has already pointed out, Jon Anderson was awfully full of himself back then.I still like 'Close to the Edge' a lot, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Much Filler","review":"Bill Bruford could see it coming...that's why he left right before this album.Rick Wakeman was fed up with this recording session to the point where he quit the band after this album.Even Chris Squire didn't think it was a good idea.All those should tell you something about this album...it was treading more in dangerous waters than topographic oceans. Rick Wakeman was right on the money when he said that this album contained mostly filler material...alot of parts were \\"bled to death\\" because they didn't have enough music to fill the album.This album was driven by Anderson and Howe...and sounds like the others were along for the ride. It doesn't continue the masterful Close To The Edge or tight playing that brought us Fragile and The Yes Album. The result here is a very watered down Yes album that goes on for too long.Four songs over four album sides? That should be a warning sign already."},{"rating":"2","title":"the coolest cats from the 70's","review":"I always got an enormous kick out of these guys. The hard driving beat that always got everybody up dancing. I remember seeing the band at CBGB's around 1975 opening up for Television. When they broke into a Dance of the Dawn I'll never forget Joey Ramone and Debbie Harry jumping onto the stage hoping to get close to their heros. Steve Howe was chanting \\"Gabba Gabba Hey\\" as Chris Squire clubbed a very drunk Johnny Thunders with his Stratocaster. Lou Reed (sporting his \\"deustchland uber alles\\" blond crew cut)attempted to grab a mike and started a slurring version of \\"Ritual\\" until he was dragged off the stage by a hyper-upset Jim Carrol who was screaming \\"rock on; rock on; rock on!\\". All in all a night to remember."},{"rating":"1","title":"Prog Rock Disaster","review":"Sorry I know that some people are really into this album but I just didn't get it. While Tangerine Dream abandoned the concept of rock and just had fun making weird synth sounds, Yes and ELP not only wanted to retain the status of rock musicians, they promoted of the idea of the \\"concept album\\" a dreadful idea that almost killed rock. Tales from Topographic Ocean is too meandering to pass as rock but yet annoying enough that it can't quietly filed under ambient. If you see this in your parent's lp collection, don't ask. You don't want to know."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stinker","review":"When this came out it was the first Yes album released that I didn't/wouldn't buy! I listened to it over at a buddies place and I'm almost certain the reason he bought it was to get rid of people he didn't like. This album is a chore!! Tales is just soooooo introverted and pretentious that it is the definition of self-indulgent wankery.We wrote a review of Tales for the school newspaper when it came out and it was the only time we couldn't bring ourselves to listen to the album as we were writing. Painfully boring boring boring! I honestly can't understand why anyone would like this album. Tales is without doubt as tedious as any political filibuster and to be forced to listen to this never ending album (CD) would have to be considered cruel and unusual punishment for even the most heinous crimes against society.I like Yes but this one's a real stinker!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One listen and I was seasick","review":"This is a terrible record. Consisting of four 20 minute long songs this has to be one of the most boring records ever recorded. I was once told that the long passages of monotonous mellotron are supposed to remind you of being on an ocean. I can see that, because, like the ocean, these songs go on forever, seldom change, and there is no end in sight to them on the horizon. The only person I could recommend this cd for is someone who suffers from insomnia. Everyone else should stay away from this overpriced sleeping pill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sometimes Less Is More","review":"\\"Rhino should have released the bonus tracks in a separate package and left all these classic early Yes albums the way they were meant to be.\\"That was my original review and I stand by it.But I must add this. After hearing the new beginning to ?The Revealing Science Of God?, the bonus tracks no longer bother me. That new beginning certainly puts things in perspective.At least they haven?t changed the beginnings of the other three movements, yet. They?re probably saving that for next time.Now I?d like to address ?A music fan from Yesworld? who is also known as ?man-at-work437?. I realize it?s human nature to insult people when they disagree with you. And I have no hard feelings. I regard you as an intelligent person because you listen to Yes.In fact, you have caused me to re-evaluate my assessment of that Bartok piano concerto CD (featuring soloist Jeno Jando). I plan to revise my review of that Bartok record soon, and I will give it five stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST CD EVER!!","review":"Well, heres the story. An uncle of mine gave me this for christmas 'cuz I love Radiohead. He said that I would like this too. Boy was he wrong!Radiohead are genuiuses this is CRAP. Every song is half an hour long and BORING. As if that wasn't enough they put on some extra songs (rehearsals or something) that are also LONG and BORING.If you want interesting music that rocks check out anything by Radiohead, Incubus, Staind, Limp Bizkit and Marylin Manson. This is just JUNK!Say NO to 'Yes'!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A new masterpiece","review":"I grew tired of this album years ago......saw YES do the \\"Tales\\" tour and liked that. Anyway 30 years later, remastered and its a gem! Better than almost anything anyone is doing today.....Amazing stuff....highly recommended........get comfortable and relax with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"I HATED THIS, UNTIL...","review":"this was my least favorite album yes released during their classic period. and then one day, out of the blue, i got it. and it hit me hard. it now ranks as my favorite yes album and that's saying something considering the competition. better than the yes album? better than fragile? close to the edge? relayer? yes, yes, yes and again yes. if you do not have hours and hours of free time on your hands you may never get it. this is the ultimate recording for those who enjoy music that works on multiple levels. to those who have nothing but contempt for this album, i truly understand. and i feel sorry for you. you are missing one of the seminal experiences a human can have. give it time. lots of time. trust me. it's worth it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Record Made Even Better","review":"Tales From Topographic Oceans is not often seen among the great Yes albums due to its inaccessibility, but it belongs at the top of the list in my opinion. It was a natural progression from the long-form pieces of Close To The Edge. Relayer, the album that follows this one, distills all of the elements of this daunting work into what I feel is the pinnacle of Yes' performance. Anyone with any attention span at all can (and should) listen to Topographic Oceans. It is an album of indiscribable beauty.Now, with this re-release, one has no excuse but to buy it and enjoy the wonderful journey. The bonus tracks are a real surprise, as they lend a bit of insight as to how this intensely complex body of work was formed. They also help one realise that Yes are actually terrestrial beings. :-)Buy this record! It's worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not their best, but still essential for the serious yes fan","review":"This may sound strange to you, but I bought this album about 15 years ago, listened to it a few times, found it inaccessible, and set it aside. Just recently, I decided to give it another chance. I commute 40 minutes to work and figured I could listen on the way, and back.This is not an album that comes easily, but after listening to it about 5 or so times, it is starting to come together, and I do like it. I don't think it is quite the work of art of \\"close to the edge\\" or \\"relayer\\". At times it just seems to be thrown together--as if the band was in a garage somewhere and just improvised. The sound quality also doesn't seem as clear and crisp as on some of their other works.I agree with the other reviewers that this should not be your first YES purchase, but if you get hooked into them, as I have, you will find some juicy tidbits here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some things never change","review":"Hey man, this record album is jus' as cool these days as it was when it first came out. And just like back then, it still gives you plenty of headroom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Size Doesn't Matter","review":"This mostly-awful double-album is the epitome of prog-rock excess -- and this comes from a person who loves the three Yes albums previous to this monstrosity. Actually, there is *some* value to it -- the first track is composed of some compelling musical passages and interesting shifts. It all falls apart quickly after that, though, devolving into really appalling, unfocused nonsense. The lyrics (never a strong point with Yes) are so incomprehensible and obviously meaningless that one wonders why they are even present. Keyboardist Rick Wakeman himself once described the album as an exercise in \\"wading though a cesspool to get a waterlily.\\" There are some excellent Yes albums, but this is one of the real bombs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yes sounding very bloated.","review":"This album is very boring. The vinyl had one song on each side (four in all). By the time you got thru the first album, you couldn't bear the thought of listening to the second disc.

It's self indulgent, pompous and boring. 4 Overlong tracks of symphonic sludge. Gone is Bill Bruford's crisp but enigmatic drum technique. Gone is Chris Squire crunchy bass riffs. In comes synthesisers galore, temples bells , stampeding elephants, you name it everything was thrown on this album. The album was a huge disappointment as the 3 previous studio recordings had the best Yes line up.So why am I commenting on it?.The album is a bench mark. It has become a point of reference of where rock music went wrong. It was a major that ignited the New Wave.Considering all the rubbish that is around now, we need something as horrible as this to trigger off something completely different! ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Honesty is the best policy","review":"I am not arrogant. ...no better than anyone else - and I mean anyone.

Jon Anderson pontificates about finding the meaning of our existence in a hotel room in Tokyo, reading about Tantric yoga and the number 4 or something like that. Reading this crap reminded me of Spinal Tap, in that the whole thing seemed to be a parody of pretentious, prog rock excess, when in fact it was the real thing! As far as the music goes, I just remember Wakeman's pointless solos and Jon Anderson's PIERCING tenor. Ouch! A roomie in college used to play this CD a lot and I had to beg him to not play it anymore. He compromised and agreed only to play \\"The Yes Album\\" and \\"Fragile\\" when I was home, while I agreed not to play various non-prog selections in his presence. Anyway, I've gone on too long. I won't say YES is devoid of worth, but this album certainly is."},{"rating":"2","title":"great album","review":"being this and other works platformed before my present later times . officially through my scope band members from p floyd , g dead , l zepplin , and such others must of made some phone calls to these guys classifying ya took it ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Derivative of Themselves","review":"My recollection from listening to this over twenty years ago was that it failed to live up to the total concept experience it was supposed to be, and instead ended up being derivative of other Yes works. There are points where you think they're about to kick it up to notches unknown as the great Emeril says, but then they fall way short and grab a riff from earlier works. Again, this is working from twenty-some year old memories, but the impression of it has remained through the years."},{"rating":"2","title":"20th century classical music","review":"In 1973, I knew YES were recording a new album. Melody Maker and Circus magizines had quoted Jon Anderson as saying that the band were getting back to the roots, the basics, and we waited. I bought the album the day it was released and hurried home. I was stunned. From the opening chant through the last audible strains of music, I had never heard anything to compare to this. This was not rock and roll. This was (and is) that generations finest hour of recorded music. Perhaps it will take another 25 years for the music industry to acknowlage this. Yet,in 25 years we may well hear Tales on public radio"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Tremendous","review":"If you're not a Yes fan I'm not sure why you'd be here considering buying what is probably the most unique rock album of all time. And if you're already a fan you probably don't need convincing.This is classical music done with rock instruments and rock sensibility. It's not something you're gonna throw in your car stereo and fall in love with immediately. But if you like the song \\"Close to the Edge\\", you'll love this album.

I have a 17 inch MacBookPro (with intel processor) running OS 10.6 and even with every patch and update available, the game is very unreliable. It crashed frequently, and thankfully, early enough in the game that I had not spent too much time starting to build a city.Too bad - I have played Sim City games in the past and really enjoyed the series.

I mean bringing Sargonnas into krynn / an ally of the dark queen? Why cut it short and settle for an assistant when you can get the five headed dragon herself. A weak attempt of copying/masking the Takhisis scenario already done in by enough writers that it becomes to old for my taste. The companions portrayal here were bland. Not one of them really shone , neither as a whole ; which should be the basic concept here. Advertising wise it said : see the companions in their first adventure.

Then they began putting out books like this, trusting on name recognition to sell, and forever marring their book department. They've put out a number of good books in recent years but those books earn the wrath of many fantasy fans simply because of the publisher.

Most have bad plot, poor characterization and melodrama to the max - and this book is no exception to that rule."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where are the characters?","review":"Companions is a vast disappointment. All the main Heroes of the Lance are there but as seems to be the case outside of the core Dragonlance (Chronicles and Legends) everything is purely plot-driven rather than actually revealing more about a character. Others in the Meetings Sextet (Dark Heart, Kindred Spirits) at least try to explore the individuals. But here is nothing more than a straightforward plot about evil wishing to raise an evil god and good stopping them. When in doubt, throw in a bunch of new mysterious life forms!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a dissapointment!","review":"It is obvious to me that the author has never read a Dragonlance book before.

The writing is terrible - like the book I tried to write when I was 8, except it's 300 odd pages long and someone must have actually given the author money for it. The story is essentially like any disaster movie: meet the characters, have a few foreboding encounters with the bad guys, climax (ho hum) where some weird and previously unheard of allies suddenly spring to their aid. Character development is poor and inconsistent with other, far superior, Dragonlance novels. Even if you've just read the previous 5 novels in the sextet (as I had), I'd advise you to forego reading this, it illuminates nothing."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste.","review":"This is not just the worst Dragonlance novel I have ever read, it is one of the worst books, period.

You'll cringe as he paints his room black, proving his depravity! Watch out, folks! He means business!\\"But hey folks, if you can overlook plot chasms, awful syntax, and a boring and preposterous story that clearly never actually happened in the Dragonlance universe(one of the reasons we liked reading about Tanis and Raistlin and Sturm was that they were basically just ordinary people who became heroes through chance.

Usually I'm a smooth reader of just about any book. But unfortunately I could not read more than four pages. Those richly-designed characters we've all come to know and love just were not there. Where was Tanis's troubled heart and Flint's tender though gruff attitude? Where was Sturm's honor-bound ways, and where was Raistlin's concealed ambition? Truly this settled a dreary lassitude upon my soul. Frankly, it was a waste of money, though I wouldn't want to be hurtful to the writer. The writer has potential.... but I just could not feel anything with \\"The Companions\\".

I was the only one who thought the idea of running and running away was not something we should be encouraging small children to do. I asked my KG kids what they thought of the Mom's attitude and they all agreed she should not have taken sides with the sibling. We also discussed Sophie running and decided it was OK for her because (presumably) she was in her own garden and that it would not be safe to just run away if you lived in a city or an apartment. Surprised it got the awards!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Foster parent","review":"I will not read this book to the kids in my care. I am looking for books that are accurate for handeling emotions. I do not like the running away and the five year old I have now would do that. I do have several other books I can use, such as the Best Me I Can Be set, but they do not address anger as well as I would like. I do like the illustrations and the way the words sound when reading in this book; I just wish the little girl did not run away."},{"rating":"1","title":"not enough","review":"when sophie gets angry she runs away and comes back.that's the book. I would have appreciated more content. I understand that after I finish reading the book I talk to my child about how we behave when we get angry, but this could have given more to work with"},{"rating":"1","title":"Give Sophie a chance.","review":"The fun thing about this book is experiencing (through colors and text) the emotions that Sophie is feeling. We follow Sophie through the reds and yellows of anger to the soothing blues and greens of the natural world, and back again to the warm, vibrant colors of a happy home. The simple text sets off the illustrations, resulting in a rich emotional reading experience for any age.I give \\"Sophie\\" only two stars simply because it is not my preferred style of picture book, not because it lacks any of the criteria for good children's literature. I encourage you to give \\"Sophie\\" a chance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not read this book to your child!!!","review":"This book suggests to your child that when she is angry, she should run out of the house and run and run and run and hide in a tree until she isn't angry anymore. Am I the only one who sees a problem with this? I don't see this as a viable option for most families."},{"rating":"1","title":"When Sophie Gets A Caldecott...","review":"...I have to wonder what the judges were thinking. The art in this book resembles that of badly drawn comic books. It is loud, ugly, and unappealing. (In one scene Sophie's head is bent at an unatural angle giving the appearance that it is detached from her body. Yuck!) If the text were good, I could forgive all this. But when little Sophie gets angry she has a temper tantrum then runs away. There is nothing new or special here. This book doesn't work on any level and I was shocked when I heard that the Caldecott committee chose it for an honor book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fifteen riveted 4-year-olds","review":"I watched this book being presented to a class of behaviorally challenged 4-year olds. Circle time is never quiet with this group but this book had them so silent after about 3/4 of the book one boy asked \\"why is everyone so quiet?\\" I think this book is great for kids with high stress levels and emotional problems; the kids really internalized it. They came up with ways they deal with anger with essentialy no prompting. It's rare to find a book that really accesses kids emotions like this one. If you have a child who is high strung or has anger issues, this book seems to be a great access point."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beach blanket Bingo a NO!!","review":"The seller was fine and shipping just great.

I wish they would have included that show here. They also didn't include the 1982 Genesis reunion show with Steve Hackett and Peter Gabriel. Genesis with Hackett and Gabriel put out some of Genesis' greatest songs like Supper's Ready, The Knife, Watcher of the Skies, The Musical Box, The Lamb, Firth of Fifth, ect. That isn't the case here with Three Sides Live. They hired a disgraceful jazz fusion guitarist Daryl Stuermer and the band became a disgrace.

Percussive, dense and lush, not a musical genre is left untouched as a corcucopia of weird musical instraments seam in perfectly with early Fairlight sampling technology. Bush whispers, moans, and screams throughought ten tracks that deal with personal failings and humanity's capacity for wrongdoing. What should be a very weird and unsettling album is smoothed out by immaculate production, rendering it instead an extremely quirkly yet oddly listenable experience. It seems likely that the production airbrushes somewhat over the impact the album is trying to evoke, maybe the only thing that keeps 'The Dreaming' from being a perfect article of pure genius.Best Tracks: There Goes a Tenner, Night Of The Swallow, Get Out Of My House."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love,Love,Love it!","review":"I have been looking for this CD in stores forever.

Yes, the music is great, but the sound on this CD is very harsh and compressed. It sounds like a poor mp3 download really, with all the sound mushed into the midrange. Very unkind to the Kate's layered sound, it's almost unlistenable. I don't know whether this is because it was recorded in the early days of CD technology or whether this copy is simply from a bad master.

Period.","review":"Kate is one of the most talented musicians on this earth. The Dreaming was underrated when it was first released, but I think that has to do with the fact that it was way ahead of its time.

However, once I bought it, I quickly noticed several flaws. First of all, the player would shut it's self off if you accidentally knocked it. Second, the sound quality is extremely poor, even with quality headphones. And the EQ selections didn't help at all. Third, the volume was never loud enough, even with the amplifier. Fourth, the menus are difficult to use, especially with only one button. Finally, and I know this is silly, but the player never started on the first song on my playlist. For whatever reason, it would always start on some seemingly random point (although no shuffle feature is available). I always had to change tracks until I got to the beginning of my playlist."},{"rating":"1","title":"KENNY TRIED TO MAKE THE CROSSOVER, BUT CAME UP SHORT","review":"I think the idea that Kenny had about a crossover project was great, but like so many country stars find out, their voices will not work on the romantic standards. I read where Kenny wanted to follow Natile Coles' lead and do a similar project with many of the same people Natile used. Here again, Natile had the voice to make the project work.

Once we got the settings ironed out (they are sticky, and don't take effect until the programs are restarted) we were disappointed in the 3D quality. This movie appears to us to be adapted from a 2D movie. There were no 3D effects of note at all. We were disappointed to see that Jack Black's ass was rendered only in 2D, we expected that to jump out of the screen at us but it did not. This is not worth Five dollars for the effort, and this is not 3D. Save your money,look elsewhere, and wait for it to show up in the two dollar bin.

The story itself. The focus is mainly in Lilliput - just a few minutes of the movie was in Brobdingnag, and there was NOTHING of Laputa or the talking horses or anything else. This took away from the story a lot, and trivialized it. Jack Black was funny, but the Lilliput story arc had so much useless filler added to it that it defeated the story - I wish the writing had been more faithful to the book.For a really great visual telling of Gulliver's Travels, try the one with Ted Danson. It was a made-for-TV movie series, but it actually did a pretty darned awesome job with Johnathan Swift's original tale and was creative and fun.Hereit is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good movie","review":"This movie is awful front to back.

If I wanted to see robot actors I'd watch short circuit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a serious movie","review":"I had hoped this would be a fun remake of Gulliver's Travels, but it's more of a childish version of the story, brimming with pop culture references and corny jokes. Sometimes this was funny, such as Gulliver's claim that Vice President Yoda would take care of his country in his absence. Most of the time, it's B-movie material. I laughed at some of the jokes, but partly out of pity. Unfortunately, Jack Black movies are sometimes a mixed bag, and this was definitely one to pass up.

Say NO to 20 minutes of FORCED ads & previews","review":"Shame, shame, shame on Fox for treating its customers like dirt. You CANNOT watch this movie without waiting through nearly 20 MINUTES of ads and previews (no fast forward allowed). And if you accidentally hit the wrong button during that time or if you have to remove the DVD for any reason during the movie than you've got to wait for 20 MINTUES again! This is absurd. The studios are upset because people are looking for alternatives to DVDs. Well what do they expect when they make watching one so painful?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Family Movie --It's lewd and vulgar","review":"This movie should have been rated PG-13. To rate it PG is very deceptive as it is lewd and vulgar and highly inappropriate for children. Apparently Hollywood thinks everyone has lowered their moral standards in this society. G rated and PG rated movies now have to be prescreened by parents to determine the appropriateness for their own beliefs and values since PG and G movies now contain profanity, vulgarity and lewdness. Normally I check the IMDB parental guide to determine my interest in a movie in terms of profanity, sex, and violence.

I rented the DVD from Netflix and found out that in order to watch the movie you have to (are forced to) sit through at least one commercial and several inordinately long trailers. The reasons I say \\"forced to watch\\" is that not only is the ability to move to the main menu disabled during the commercials and trailers, but (and I have never seen this before) the fast forward was disabled so one is forced to endure the whole commercial block each time the movie is watched.Luckily I only rented the movie and did not buy it. Anyone who does purchase it is going to feel like a chump each time they are forced to sit through the same trailers and commercials in order to watch the movie they paid for.

It may be different on other blu-ray/DVD players, but on my Playstation 3 I could not skip to the main menu or skip/fast forward through any of the trailers. If you plan to get this DVD, expect to wait through ten minutes of commercials every time you want to watch the film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't fast forward through trailers","review":"DO NOT BUY. Everytime you put this disc in you have to watch all of the trailers before you can get to the menu screen. It will allow you to rewind, and watch a trailer again, but not fast forward.

Now take scenes from each of them and transpose them onto the plot of the first half of the book Gulliver's Travels, and you have this farce of a comedy. The original book, and the Hallmark movie by Ted Danson, is an exploration of different political systems and what they do to the people living inside them. This movie by Jack Black drops all of that and is basically a comedy outing. The comedy is good, for those who have never seen any of Black's previous movies. If you have, then a lot of it is a rip-off. For example, the various rock and roll scenes with the Lilliputians is just a rehash of School of Rock. And Amanda Peet again shows why she is a good supporting actress, and not much else. Her acting does little to help the movie. Overall, another letdown from Mr. Black."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very lame movie","review":"I never write reviews but I have to say this is a really lame movie. I loved Gulliver's travel's as book and I appreciate that you need to change the story, to give it modern spin so audiences of today can relate to it. But this movie was just lame.

While trying to impress Darcy, she sends him to do a story in the Bermuda Triangle. During a storm, he arrives in Lilliput where he is the size of a giant and the townspeople are small.

It is sumptuously photographed with wonderful special effects and rich colors.It also has a miserably cliched story further dragged down by obviously intentionally wooden acting. For some reason the \\"creative forces\\" behind the movie thought that the wooden acting was some sort of comedic tour de force. The truth is that it is just wooden acting.Jack Black is charming and funny when he's not TRYING to be charming and funny. Here he is trying very hard to be charming and funny, with predictably miserable results.There are a few bits here and there which could have been really funny. Intellectually I could see the potential humor. However, they are completely mismanaged and dry as presented in this film.

Lyrical descriptions of the souks of Damascus, the gardens and rich cultural melange found in places like Antioch (once a Christian kingdom ruled by Raymond of Aquitaine), the interior of a bath-house in (I think) Aleppo, the physical beauty of the Jebel Druse people, and, of course, the cedars of Lebanon, combine with snippets of history and what appear to be personal reminiscences.

His methods and canoe designs are simple and straight forward for even beginning wood workers.All aspects of canoe construction are discussed including materials section, design, assembly, maintenence and repair. There is also a chapter on making a good canoe paddles. Appendixes to the book contain plans for building several styles of canoes and also sources for supplies and information.Mr. Gilpatrick has made everything in this book simple and economical. It is suitable for any first time canoe builder. The only area in which the book is lacking is in some of the more advanced and specialized aspects of canoe building such as special finishes and fibers for certain types of canoes."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most useful book on strip canoe building","review":"I have many of the common books on canoe building. This book is by far the easiest to use. There seems to be two major schools of thought when it comes to strip canoe building: 1) floating furniture (The Canoecraft way) and 2) utilitarian (Hazen and Gilpatrick). I've built a solo canoe following Gil's methods and it has served wonderfully for 5 years. I've bounced it down rocky rivers and used it for many trips to the BWCA and Quetico and it has served admirably.If you wish to build a work of art, then perhaps you should follow Moores's methods. Personally, I don't like external stems on a canoe. They widen the entry line and just look weird to me. Building them is also a fiddly undertaking and I'm not sure that they really add much.If you want a functional and tough canoe . . . that is beautiful to boot . . . this book will help you reach your goal. If you have questions write the author, he has replied to my emails; usually the next day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wonderful content. Disappointing publishing.","review":"Fifteen years ago my kids and I used the first edition of \\"Building a Strip Canoe\\" to make a \\"puddle duck.\\" We were not great woodworkers but the boat is wonderful.

It has been bashed in and repaired and is a family icon.I have long since lost my copy of the 1st edition so I was excited to see a new, 2nd edition of \\"Building a Strip Canoe\\" here on Amazon. I bought it hot of the press and found . . . the typeface, ink, and glossy pages conspire to make it very hard to read, to the extent that it is unusable.In it's favor: the second edition includes full-sized plans for the canoes. The plans in the first edition have to be blown up (not hard on modern copiers.) Also the binding appears better now. My first edition fell apart -- I re-bound it with a simple spiral binding.I returned the new 2nd edition and intend to buy a used 1st edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"build a canoe","review":"I though it to be an excellent diy book great detail and several canoes to select from.

I like Gilpatrick's straightforward, no nonsense instructions. Your final product will be a quality boat but not one of such rarified appearance you will cringe at the inevitable scratches and dings that come with canoeing. Once in awhile lightly sand her all over, paint on a new coat of varnish and the boat will look like new. Don't anticipate the final product, just follow his instructions step-by-step and before you know it about 100 hours of work (not counting glue and epoxy curing time) will yield a nice canoe. Less expensive boat builder epoxy will bring your cost down to about $350 - 400 for materials. Shop around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"Like the previous reviewer, I built a boat from the first edition of this book, which I long since lost. I didn't find the newer glossy pages a problem; the finish is like a glossy magazine, but better paper. The full size plans included are a great value. Other books include offset tables, which can take some time (not to mention frustration the first time you do it) to loft. Most designers charge almost $100 for the full sized plans for each boat.The steps are great for a first time builder. Gilpatrick's methods tend to be more pragmatic and utilitarian than other authors. They're designed to be used, and used a lot. That said, a little bit of nice wood, and one could make these boats just as fancy as anyAlso the cedar strip paddle design is also unique and interesting, though I've yet to build it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good update","review":"Gil is a well known expert in strip canoe building .

This definitely falls into the manufacturer's range for the small. I began wearing the small V2 Supporter around 28 weeks, when I weighed a lot less, and it was far too small. It helped, but the elastic was so tight that I had to take it off for a few hours each day. I ordered the medium and that has been much better. I have been wearing the medium V2 Supporter 24 hours a day for the past 8 weeks and it has made a huge difference. It doesn't cure the problem, but it definitely makes the pain and discomfort more manageable. I only have one, so I have to go without it for a night when I wash it. Two would be a good idea if it's in your budget. I recommend the V2 Supporter and suggest that you order one size larger than the manufacturer's recommendation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too uncomfortable to wear!","review":"This garment is literally too uncomfortable to wear. After reading the other reviews, I ordered a size larger than what the sizing chart suggested, and that was a good decision, because the smaller size would definitely have been too small. However, the front part of the garment digs into my groin, and it was so painful that I had to take it off after just a few minutes.I have since bought a very simple maternity support band from Motherhood Maternity, and while it is not the most comfortable thing in the world, at least it is tolerable, and I find that it helps. I will never know how well the V2 Supporter Prenatal Cradle would have worked, because it was too uncomfortable to wear.

So flimsy, it barely holds its own form.Within 6 months, the case has begun fraying at the seams. Given my opinion of the product from the start, I've been quite gentle with case in order to protect the camera inside. So much so, I generally just carry the camera in my hands and leave the bag on my shoulder. It's really a testament to my initial impression.Much better cases out there for the money. Ones that hold their shape well, have many more pockets for accessories, and, perhaps most importantly, provide the confidence that your camera has a very good chance of surviving a short fall packed safely inside."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bulky and expensive","review":"The case is made of cheap material.It is bulky and uncomfortable to carry and it appears not to be made specifically for the Sony Alpha.It does fit the Alpha easily, with lots of extra space.

I expected much more since Skid Row's debut & Slave To The Grind were great records. This record was released in the mid 90's, and it's obvious the band wasn't sure which direction to go in. This is not a metal record as some of the other reviewers have claimed. One song was punk. Only 2 tracks were melody based, and sounded good. There was a lot of great playing on this record, but no great songwriting. Several of the pieces used odd time signatures ala progressive rock. Many of the pieces tried to borrow from the then hot alternative rock scene. I could here Alice In Chains types of guitar riffs, and big diminished chords ala STP. Boz's singing was more of a raspy hurl then actual singing. Nowhere on this record is a great sustained note like in \\"18 and Life\\". Overall, I am super disappointed, and plan to put this back up for sale."},{"rating":"2","title":"Skid Row's best album--BY FAR!","review":"This album went almost totally unnoticed and unappreciated when it was released, which was not surprising considering the period. However, Skid Row's swansong is a much more mature and focused record than anything else they have ever producing. Moving past the hair metal posings of their debut record, and the inconsistency of their second, this album puts the band on a pedestal comparable (as surprising as this may sound), to Guns N Roses. Yes, that may sound strange, but songs like \\"My Enemy\\", \\"Firesign\\" and \\"Into Another\\" are that good. I was a decent Skid Row fan until this album came out, but this one made me a huge fan.

Its not old school Skid, which at 1st will drive you nuts, but one time through and youll be hooked! BREAKIN DOWN shouldve been released, I guarantee that wouldve been huge and wouldve no doubt established Skid Row as the best 80's band still rockin in the 90s and probably still today.

Ultimately it is Jarrett's version that I find myself listening to most often. My main gripe with Nikolayeva is that she can be excessively slow. Ashkenazy -- though technically strong as one would expect -- has a tendency to hammer out some of the fugues in rigid staccato that suppresses the natural lyricism of the music. The flip side as argued by another reviewer is that Jarrett is sometimes \\"mushy\\", but that seems a little harsh to me. Unless you have a very particular opinion on how these pieces must sound (in which case you can listen to them yourself) this recording makes a fine choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"I want to give it 6 stars","review":"This is my one of my favorite CDs of all time. I also have the Nikolaeva version, but I like this one better. I have bought it three times: once for me, once as a gift, and once to listen to in the car. I don't know what to say about some of the recent reviewers who pan it. I don't think they listened to the same CD as I did (or as many times as I have, i.e. hundreds). I bought it first in 1992 (I don't think the release date shown as 2000 is accurate).This is the first Shostakovich recording I ever bought, and since then I have become a big fan of Shostakovich, particularly his string quartets.I think it is a shame that not many modern composers have gone through the 24 major and minor keys, and have written prelude-and-fugue pairs on them, the way Bach did, and Shostakovich after Bach.Update, Feb 2013 - I just bought it a fourth time (as MP3s). I reviewed this originally in 2003. This is still one of my favorite records of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"an old fan of sport","review":"I understand that most sports fans have never heard of this book, however this could be one of the most entertaining accumulation of sports stories and trivia you have ever read, particularly for the older fan of sport.

Some of the obvious ones are included as well: forgiveness, music, journaling, talking to God and listening in return.

The author achieves an artful balance of the theoretical with the practical. Given that my emphasis is on applying the principles of FFT processing in a manufacturing environment, his approach proved quite helpful.Throughout the book, basic concepts are initially presented within a mathematical context. Subsequently, they are reinforced with examples. Often, hardcopies of traces from a signal processor's monitor are provided--these are effective in driving home key points.After reading this book over two days' time, I was left wishing to see a companion volume that adds more on real-life problem solving, plus material on advanced techniques (e.g., cepstrum).

I told the clerk I needed one for my neck (I got a look that said, \\"Yeah, right.\\") I chose this exact one (for more than what Amazon charges, turns out) and immediately put it to work on arrival home. It's a plug-in model with a LOT of power. Two speeds. I was using it every few minutes for the rest of the day. The device was able to reduce my upper back and neck pain by about 1/3 by the time I went to sleep. Next day, there was much more progress. If you are prone to such problems, you need this.

Tori Amos and Robert Plant on Down By the Seaside is interesting and gets a star itself, but many of the other bands suck and suck even more trying to tribute to Led Zeppelin. If you are a die-hard ZepHead you might want to by this to respect LZ more, or for a few good songs, Hey, Hey..., Down By the Seaside... But there is too much to be ashamed here about. As Artus Urbe (NHL goalie) pointed out to a S.F. Bay Area radio station, Led Zeppelin cannot be imitated. (he called up one morning and started saying how he was ticked about all the Zep remakes and wanted some reasl LZ!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"the cover versions sounding the same like the original one","review":"yes in fact these commercial various artists are sounding the same like the original one (the way they are imitating Robert plant voice so much!) then I would like tobuy the original albums of ZEP than buying this cover version songs.My opinion of another cd: the tribute to DEEP PURPLE cd is much better than this one, because the rap, funky, soul musicians on the tribute to deep purpleaccording to new york, did not imitate the deep purple original sound.

A completely different feel. Tori said she thought she should wear her confirmation dress for this one. It is that ethereal. Led Zeppelin can even transform Hootie(Hey Hey What Can I Do) and Duran Duran (Thank You). 4 Non-Blondes and Sheryl Crow are non-original covers. 16 pages of interesting liner notes."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste of Money","review":"This could have been a great C.D./tape if they had gotten better bands to remake the songs. The only good band on the C.D. was the Stone Temple Pilots. Most of the others were bands I've never even heard of."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not LZ, but a great tribute","review":"Let's not forget that this album is a tribute to LZ, not an impersonation. Some bands did very original versions of the songs while others attempted to duplicate exactly the Led Zeppelin versions which was also ok, because for the most part, they did a good job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Led Zeppelin fans","review":"The problem with this CD is that some bands (or artists) don't have personality enough to give something else to the original songs. They played the songs the same way Led Zeppelin did, in some cases the vocals tried to sing like Robert Plant. The first track is ridiculous. It was disgusting when they tried to make Samba (?!?) in the middle of the music. Believe me, I know what Samba is. There are good performances like the songs played by Hootie and the Blowfish, Helmet and Rollins Band. They didn't run away from their style. Finally, what to say about a tribute to Led Zeppelin where even Robert Plant was disapponting?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the LZ purist","review":"If you are a Zeppelin purist, this album is not for you.

It was not. Have you ever felt embarrassed for an artist because their attempts were so bad ? This is all you will feel on this CD. Not one good song. Sorry. Don't buy it"},{"rating":"1","title":"This CD/tape is a waste of hard earned money","review":"I think it sucks when no name band, such as 4 Non Blondes and others try to compare themselves to the best. It's an insult to me and other Zeppein fans across the world. I say if somethings not broken, don't fix it. Nobody will ever come close to being as revelutionary as Led Zeppelin at any time in their musical careers. I find it a tribute to the late, great John Bonham that Plant, Page, and Jones called it quits when they did. Its a testament to the loyalty they showed each and every day. Has anybody stopped to think why Led Zeppelin hasn't made any new albums, I wonder. In my eyes Led Zeppelin will always be the greatest rock band ever, even if they never play another note again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Download the Good Ones","review":"Sheryl Crow's Dyer Maker and Hootie and the Blowfish's Hey Hey What Can I Do are the only worthy songs that appear on this record.

But these various artists are too much over acting. Certainly there are many more better rock n roll bands than ZEPPELIN."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I thought, for the most part, this tribute was very good. My only question to these ... moaning teary-eyed reviewers who keep complaining that the cover songs sound nothing like the originals is this: What in god's name is the point of buying a tribute album in which every single song sounds exactly like the original when you can just buy CDs of the actual band being covered?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad...","review":"I happen to be a hardcore ZepHead who actually likes this collection.

You should know before you ever listened to it that it wouldn't be like true Zeppelin, but that's not the point. It is the artist featured putting their own self into a Zeppelin song. I happen to LOVE Sheryl Crow's Rendition of D'yer Mak'er, which is my favorite song of all time. She does a great job, in my opinion, just as good as Zeppelin, but in her own way. And if you buy the album just for Plant and Amos doing Down by the Seaside you got your money's worth. There is no song on this album I do not like, there are some I can see where others wouldn't, but the album is not a waste of money, as long as you don't try to look at it like you are buying a Led Zeppelin album. It is it's own album, seperate from Zeppelin as a whole."},{"rating":"1","title":"uninteresting","review":"I'm always open for hearing band's takes on songs by other people. Sadly, there really isn't much to say about this album. There's nothing too original, which is sometimes okay, but I think there's a lack of energy or something... There's nothing to listen to this album twice over. But of course, this is all my opinion. If you are a fan of any of these bands then maybe this will be more interesting than it is to me. The bands did all choose good songs to cover, so that's a positive thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"STP - Maybe. Sheryl Crow? Duran Duran? What IS this?","review":"This album just does not do Zeppelin justice. I don't think anyone would expect modern rock to completely recreate the sounds of Paige's flaming guitar work or Plant's wailing vocals - but we can expect more than this. Most of these remakes are 2nd rate b-sides that don't really deserve to pay homage to one of the most original and inspiring bands of all-time. Quality of music on this album is sacrificed for variety of groups.*Nothing against Sheryl or Duran Duran - This just isn't their thing"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why Is Sheryl Crow in this?","review":"This album/cd is probably worth a 3.5 to 4 just because there are some decent artists included. But my question is, why is Sheryl Crow in this? Her version of D'yer Maker alone made me sell this to my boss(I HATE MY BOSS!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be renamed Incredibly simple 5 minute mysteries","review":"I'm a big fan of mind puzzles, and especially of the \\"whodunnit\\" type, often titled with a variation of \\"minute mysteries\\".

Nice collection of mostly unknowns and the under promoted. You will appreciate the continuity of this compilation, it's smooth and relaxing with a little spice tossed in the mix. The harmony on \\"Friendly Pressure\\" by Maysa, is simply outstanding!There are some other excellent cuts on here by Carmen Rodgers, the UK duo Kloud 9, Nadir and Karen Bernod..pretty much the whole CD...lol!If you want a nice mix of neo/nu soul from fresh, uncorrupted, non-flashy, purely vocal artists...then this Cd belongs in your collection. You won't be disappointed. It plays well while you're alone and also for the crowd (BBq's, picnics, card games and parties). I'm always asked by friends, family and guests.,who's singing and where did I get this fantastic collection of songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soul Sophisticated","review":"Of the featured artists on this disc, I only knew Maysa & Laurnea. I primarily bought it to hear the Carmen Rodgers tracks because I'd heard a lot of positives about her debut cd but it was out of print so I couldn't get my hands on it. Her tracks plus Maysa's (unfortunately 1 track from her) and Karen Bernod's, whose warm jazzy inflected vocals are like listening to warm honey (if one could) would make this disc a worthwhile purchase. Honestly these women could sing the phone book & I'd buy it. Rounding out the artist list are Kloud 9 - a soulful duo & Nadir neither of whom I'd ever heard of prior to getting this disc.This is an excellent collection by a group of lesser known but supremely talented artists. If you, like I have heard of one or two artists but aren't sure if you want to invest in an entire cd, this would definitely be a good way to introduce yourself to some great modern soul music."},{"rating":"1","title":"glc123","review":"I'm completely blown away that anyone would rate this 5 stars!

I already speak a good deal of German but had lost my fluency so I gave the program a shot. I agree with other reviews in that the book is very good but the overall program is weak. Moreover, one of the male speakers on the CD is either a native of one of the many dialects spoken in Germany, or he is simply not a good speaker. Either way, I don't think his sentences are clear, especially if the listener was a German first-timer. I've tried the Italian course, and it's much better. For language courses though, nothing beats Pimsleur's comprehensive programs, but they cost three times as much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Float Rod Guides","review":"This product worked great to replace the corroded float guides on my existing sump pumps. The product I received did not look the one in the picture. The picture show the metal version. I received a plastic/nylon type float guide.

If I was looking to weight 11.2 oz it would fluctuate too much, going from 11.0 to 11.7 and back and forth. I found that if I zeroed out the scale and just put my hand over it without touching it, it would start a reading. I've tried it on my counter, on my floor and and my cement walkway, it did the same everywhere. I have since purchased an Escali scale and is currently working like a champ. No magic hand movement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money.","review":"I have been using this scale for a couple of weeks, and I am so disappointed with it that I am giving it my first Amazon review ever!It shuts off while I am in the middle of doing things, making my weights completely useless. And it's not that I'm not fast enough... I scoop some protein powder into my mixer, immediately go to put a second scoop in and the thing will have shut off!At first I thought the batteries it came with were dead, so I went to the store and spent $10 getting replacement batteries, which I put in yesterday. Nope!

But be aware.UPDATE: That auto shutoff gets more annoying all the time!UPDATED UPDATE: Changed rating from 3* to 1*. Auto shutoff became erratic and much too fast. Ruined the utility of the scale. If the auto shutoff was reliable and set to much longer (like 3 minutes), it would be a solid 4* item (coin batteries still a problem- they wear out way too fast even with the auto shutoff). As it is, don't buy; check out the Ozeri scales.

No wonder there's a life time warranty.Cheap like all Chinese made products, nothing is made in this country anymore so we get what we pay for, but not what we want. I found OXO scale a good purchase comparing to the cheap Chinese Taylor. I don't even recommend it if you use it daily, a real little junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aweful","review":"I bought this scale on sale and it seemed like a great deal. Started to use it, but mid-weigh, the scale would shut off before I had a chance to weigh my material (ball bearing shot for fishing weights). If I didn't get to the weight I wanted before it shut off, I'd have to take the shot off of the scale before turning it back on because it would zero out (tare) with the shot I already had weighed out. What a pain.At first I thought I'd gotten a defective scale, so I came to Amazon to check out reviews to see if anybody else had the same issues I have with the scale. Sure enough, others have complained about the same problems.

These performances succeed further by their executant's rhythmic characterization, where he pushes, pulls, teases if never actually seduces melodic lines and inner voices, intuitively emphasizing subtle dissonances and their resolutions for their intrinsic emotional value. Never does Grante impress upon the listener a need to impress through his mechanism, which is in any case perfect in its precision, velocity, and most importantly its direction by the most acutely perceptive listening apparatus. Grante's pearly clarity and stunning ease of execution alone are worth the price of admission, and the whole is an astounding accomplishment of concentration, poise and authority."},{"rating":"1","title":"And yet another..","review":"And yet another disapointing self help depression book up on the shelves..Why can't the authors, instead of trying to cross over their in-house recovery programs to books, just get these therapies to us directly..I am so tired of writing lists of negative thoughts and behaviors and then thinking I'm gonna connect with this stuff and solve my own depression..It never works..Were only told that if we follow along and do the exercises, we'll be much closer to normal..SURE..Jeez, I hardly have the motivation to turn the page..This stuff needs to be taught and pushed first hand to people..Bring it on and stop trying to sell books that fizzle after the 1st 2 chapters.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Regurgitated Pseudo-Scientific Garbage","review":"This book is absolutely laughable in how it tries to deal with clinical depression.

People who decide to live together, need to set up a legal contract. When things fall apart, the last thing needed is the distress and lawsuits that don't have any validity of who or what is owed. In a society that pushes marriage on men and women, it's refreshing to know that there are people who choose to be happy with an alternative lifestyle. When the marriage falters, couples have to seek legal assistance to end their marriage. And divorce drags on for years because the courts fuel the fire which drains both parties emotionally and financially. And children are caught in this mudslinging. Perhaps an alternative to marriage may change the divorce laws in this country."},{"rating":"2","title":"Once you start listening to it you don't stop til the end","review":"Once you start listening to this excellent production you don't wanna miss any song.

Amazon should contact the manufacturer of this blu-ray DVD to make sure the future releases would be compatible and playable on US blu-ray DVD players. In addition, they should also warn their US customers not to purchase this blu-ray DVD until the compatibility issues will be solved. I own well over 4000 blu-ray DVDs and never had any compatibility issues until now. I am a huge fan of WWII movies and would love to have this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cant Read BluRay","review":"Unfortunately, unable to play this Blu Ray in both my and my parents Blu Ray players. Upgrading the firmware on my player did not fix. Amazon was great and sent a replacement copy that arrived in a couple days. That copy also did not play in my Blu Ray player. Wondering if this Blu Ray is regionally encoded but the CS reps didnt think that was the problem.I really wish that Amazon would permit an n/a for ratings.

I watched the movie with a person who helped Max Manus escape and who actualy lived this story. He thought this interpretation was very realistic. Even some of the characters looked like the ones he remembers. A fantastic movie about a WWII chapter we rarely hear about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Death Medicine","review":"This is easily the worst book I have read in a long time. To start with, I've lived in Texas all my life and there never has been nor would there be a blizzard to equal the one in the book. And a B&B that has snowshoes! Give me a break. It was so bad that I started to notice quirks, like using seen for scene, and the incredibly weird font on the first line of every section. And the Jamaican porter talked like one of Harry Potter's house elves and not like any Jamaican (or other human being) that I have ever heard. Find something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Much.","review":"There is too much to wade through in this story -- exaggerated accents, Indian lore, extreme weather conditions, improbable behavior, unlikely relationships, secrets within secrets. Yet the romantic outcome is a foregone conclusion from the start. I wanted to like the book because it is different. But, after picking it up a dozen times only to lose interest each time after a few pages, I finally skipped straight to the last chapter. (I did want to know who committed the murder and why.) I haven't resorted to that in years. Just couldn't get into this story because of all the wierd, unnecessary distractions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most enjoyable read","review":"This is the second in a series of Willi Gallagher/Quannah Lassiter novels penned by Kat Goldring and each seems to get even better than the first. Kat weaves her plot masterfully through the sometimes touching, sometimes comical relationship between her characters. Decorated by a thread of the Native American culture, used well in the rapport between Willi and Quannah, this book is sure to capture almost any reader. My advice, as a reviewer for this newspaper, is that anyone should read the book carefully before reviewing it on this site. It is both entertaining and thrilling."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Cute Lamp!!!","review":"I have this one... It is so Cute! I can put a soft light bulb init and it becomes a great nite light!

I wasn't sure how this would go over, as we are used to reading picture books (and reading an entire story in one sitting). My son LOVED this book! We did have to get over the concept of reading only a few chapters per night, but he did amazingly well at remembering where we left off and picking up on the story line.Obviously, at age 4, he can not read these books by himself. But there is a picture every couple of pages and that holds his interest really well. And the humor of the story line is very age appropriate.I would absolutely recommend this as a first chapter book for ages 4+"},{"rating":"2","title":"Openions about Captain Underpants Books","review":"I like Captain Underpants books because It is very funny and humorous. It keeps me laughing all the way through the book. It makes you want to keep reading more books. When I start reading a book I don't want to put it down till I am finshed. Then I am anxious for the next book to come out.I have read all the Captain Underpants books, they can be inexpensive for the soft cover, a little more for the hard cover, still a good deal for the money.I also love the flip-O-rama. Which is when you can flip the pages and it makes it seem as if the characters are moving or animated.My parents don't mind spendng money on the Captain Underpants books because they are happy that I am reading so often.My favorite book is \\" The Attack Of The Talking Toilets."},{"rating":"1","title":"lsms","review":"I read the Captain Underpants book in 3rd grade, and even then found it immature. It is one thing to have a superhero be a man that flies around in his underpants, but the books are filled with nothing but jokes about toilets and such. I can't believe these books are allowed in school. If children talk about that kind of stuff in school, they are punished, but still allowed to read about it. If I were the author, I would be ashamed to be a grown man, and be writing about toilets that attack people. Only little kids write about that."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate it","review":"Captain underpants is a stupid book.

They want more!","review":"I am a fourth grade teacher and used this book as a read aloud book for after lunch. The book was an instant success. Whenever I finished a chapter, they would beg me to please read another. I also had to create a lottery system so they could borrow it and take it home. I was able to get them to do some writing activities out of this book, which they usually hate to do. I highly recommend this book to all middle grade teachers or if you just have a child between 8-10.

They make comic books in their clubhouse. The principal of the school named Mr.Krupp hated them. The one time the boys pull a major prank and Mr. Krupp catches them and they have to mow Mr.Krupp's grass and wash his car at six o'clock in the morning every day. They get extra homework. Then George and Harold buy a hypnotism ring and hypnotize Mr.Krupp into Captain Underpants. Captain Underpants is a superhero that George and Harold made up. He fights lots of bad guys and defeats them. Finally when George and Harold catch Captain Underpants they turn him into Mr.Krupp again and and go back to their normal life pulling pranks and getting into trouble. I recommend this book to anyone who likes funny books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Underpants Will Never Be The Same!","review":"This series will never get old! Time and again we read these books and the entire family is kept in stitches. These books are chalk full of belly laughs for everyone. My 6 year old daughter is fanatical about Captain Underpants, Harold & George! We anxiously await the next epic addition to the stories of what true Wedgie Power can deliver. This is innocent kid fun - a far cry more suitable for elementary school kids than alot of the media garbage that's marketed to them these days. These books stay away from alot of the typical things that one sees in today's \\"kid\\" oriented media and sticks with what kids can identify with and love to poke fun at naturally - principals, teachers and underwear! It steers clear of \\"adult\\" humor, sexual connotations and gory visuals - a quality that I wish Disney would catch on to!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A convert to potty humor","review":"Potty humor has never been my thing but after reading a poll of children's authors naming Dav Pilkey today's funniest children's writer I broke down and bought the book. I was laughing so hard I could barely read it to my children. Okay, I'm exaggerating, but that is almost true.Pilkey actually uses wonderful vocabulary words and intelligent humor along with his doo-doo words and diaper jokes. The mix is fantastic and shows that intelligence does not preclude silliness and the lack of intelligence may cause you to miss out on a lot of fun.The illustrations are integral to the story beginning on page one. There are pictures (very amusing pictures) on every page which keep my 4-year-old interested and the flip-o-rama action is genius (in a low-tech sort of chapter book way.)Don't be afraid to check out this book...you may actually enjoy it or even love it like I do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Toilet humor par excellence!","review":"My 8-year-old son has read and re-read this book with great gusto. I have yet to meet a 4- to 8-year-old boy* who does not dissolve into gales of giggles at the mention of bodily functions. Although I don't fully understand the appeal, Captain Underpants has taken me one \\"wedgie\\" closer to getting the universal phenomenon of toilet humor. Thanks, Dav, for letting me in on the joke! We look forward to the Talking Toilets with great anticipation. May the adventures continue for years to come! *(Please forgive any sexist allusions, but in my experience girls are just not quite as enthralled with toilet talk.

I don't know how they expect for an infant/toddler to sit in this chair in a functional position to eat. Are the Italian kids giants or what? I have to put a small pillow under her bottom so she can sit tall enough to reach her food while in this chair. I have a Fisher-Price Healthy Care high chair half the price at a relatives home, and it is SO MUCH better in this regard. Also, don't waste your money on the Prima Pappa Rocker. I folded it up one night and it fell over (doesn't stand up well even when leaning against counter), and the seat unit was bent (basically broken and unusable). Anyway, who wants to rock their child when at the table? Don't waste your money. Buy a wooden chair as above or Fisher-Price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Mistake Buying this chair...","review":"I bought this chair (same chair tan leatherette)a couple years ago. I didnt like it then, and I hate it now. I use it for my 2nd child & its soo messy. Cleaning it is next to impossible. The tray is too far out and food gets spilled easily down the front. Also,the seat on the chair seems to lean down on the left side).I wouldnt waste the money on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sea and Cakes ALL TIME WORST !","review":"In a career that outshines all the indie pretenders The Sea and Cake have had more than their share of clunkers. Before you is the bottom of the barrel. Slickness and Gloss can be truly amazing when done right. Prekop steps up to the plate and falls asleep.Worst of all-There is no CONTENT here! Mumbles and electronic mediocrity. Look anywhere else to get the real deal. Completely vapid stuff! Truly horrible!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to Sea & Cake?","review":"I'm stunned by how weak this CD is. Owning all their previous work hadn't prepared me for this. What's wrong? Hmmmmmm. Well to begin with it's terribly monotonous. The electronica/drum machines, etc. (they seem to have taken over here)drone and parallel Prekop's indistinct vocals. Most tracks lack the subtlety, spacing and breath of all their earlier releases. Their usual playfulness and inventiveness are missing too. What can I say- a major disappointment by a superior creative team."},{"rating":"1","title":"Geez... timid album","review":"Probably the weakest of their last three. These guys need to move in a new direction. Can you say stagnation? I knew you could! Terrifc cover though."},{"rating":"2","title":"A cohesive electronic statement","review":"This album is a huge departure from The Sea and Cake's previous album, Oui. On Oui, the songs were very warm, the synthesizers were used to support the traditional rock instruments. On One Bedroom, the songs, while still engaging, are more electronic and alien. The guitar steps aside for the synthesizer, and the drum machines seem to appear more than the drum set. The division between songs that center on more traditional rock arrangements and more electronic compositions is actually pretty equal. What's amazing is that the album is cohesive enough to make the instrumental songs flow seamlessly with the heavily electronic songs. Not only do the songs flow well on this album, the cover of David Bowie's \\"Sound + Vision\\" makes sense next to the original compositions. So, if you're interested in the Chicago music scene, if you like electronic music, or if you're a fan of tasteful light rock, go listen to this album now."},{"rating":"2","title":"what's not to like??","review":"I happend on this cd after reading a review in a magazine. Like their Chicago counterparts The Aluminum Group, The Sea and Cake make seemless skyscraper pop. The album provides perfect auditory wallpaper for a cocktail or lounging around on the weekend. Let's not take pop music so seriously, it's message is always, \\"ligthen up!\\". Like this? try Ivy and/or Club 8's magnificent cd \\"Spring Came, Rain Fell.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Picks up where 'Oui' left off.","review":"The Sea and Cake's latest is very much in keeping with the moody pop soundscapes that filled much of 'Oui.' It's definitely a more electronically-oriented sound, and although it isn't quite as melancholy as Oui, it does have the same quiet intensity of that album. This group has never really been about the lyrics, thanks to Prekop's stream-of-consciousness writing, and here they do more to compliment the sound and heighten the mood than ever before. I also thought this album was more solid throughout than any of their previous releases. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, but with poor tapes.","review":"These diapers have fantastic absorbency and are a great fit! The plastic is very comfortable and soft, but a little bit noisy (I don't mind it, but you might). They are probably the best value per diaper of any on the market right now, at 84 per case. The only major con I could find was the tapes. They tend to slip and pop off rather easily. If they were wider and longer, I think it would be less of an issue. To prevent them from popping off, press down and pull back to make sure it is really stuck. Over-tightening can cause them to pop off while sitting as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cat Carrier -- too small","review":"Any critter would be claustrophic in this except the tiniest baby thing.

It can be assembled in five minutes if you look at the five clips and see where to snap in the plastic piece in the clip's slot. There is no other logical place to put them. The door is simply line up two holes.There are predrilled holes to add screws (you need to supply) if you are going to expose the carrier to rough handling. If you are going to stay in control of the carrier then the five snap on clips will work fine.

I am a huge HIP fan and this set is the peak of their greatness. I agree with the other reviewers that this is the rarest of albums in that you must listen to it in its entirety. Very seldom does a set come along that must be experienced as a whole. I compare this opus to \\"Dark Side\\" by Pink Floyd or \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" by The Beatles in that it's separate tracks are awesome but the whole fifty-five minutes is the true gift. The band could perform this set live in its entirety in a concert and the audience would not be disappointed. \\"Grace Too\\" is the best live song I have ever experienced and \\"Thugs\\" and \\"Nautical Disaster\\" are on my top ten greatest songs of all time.

It works really well, but Gerson's instruction on the video for singing is outstanding. She's a great coach. The real deal. There's so much information, but she's methodical which I like. Sometimes she talks a little too fast, I had to rewind a couple of times. The instructional vocal warm-up CD it comes with is also great. I put it in my car and use it to and from work.

Would you play, walk or run on a sprained ankle, or with any kind of pulled muscle? At least Mr. Anderson talks about breathing and ease of production.

Even Paula and Randy appear cheap and second rate in their 30 second bits. A HUGE DISSAPPOINTMENT. When I saw how bad ultimate voice coach was put together I felt like an absolute sucker. I read bad reviews and still bought it, and it's my own fault for being optimistic. I just wanted to learn how to sing.

It was made on a shoe string budget and looks like it was thrown together in a matter of an afternoon. The set includes a DVD of voice lessons, a practice CD (which is really only the audio from the DVD made to fit on a 70min CD...totally a joke) and an embarrassingly bad Karoke CD.

LOLReally though there are so many songs on this particular cd that are off kilter in being a laid back lounge sound. They must have changed producers, ran out of material, or something. The only song I actually like is Harmony by Atjazz.

Whereas some mobiles function moreso to match decor, other mobiles are educational attachments to the crib. Keep in mind that pastel colors are not appreciated by infants for months. The panda bear was the first animal seen by my infant b/c of the black and white. The primary colors of Blue Jean Teddy then become noticed. The green gingham pattern on the dog and the softer hued duck were spotted after further development. My baby is now a sitter and she still likes to look at the panda the most. The only con of this mobile is the wind-up music box. I would have preferred a battery-operated one so that it can play as long as I and my baby wanted. But the reasonable price of this mobile AS WELL as the cute look of it made it a great buy.

It's hard to believe this was the woman who gave us Skye O'Malley."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not like her other books, but amusing!","review":"At first, the book started out a little dull but then it got interesting.

What happened to the deep characters, the catch-you-by-the-throat-and-pull-you-in plots that have charcterized her previous books? This book was wishy-washy from the start!

I agree with other reviewers that some characters appeared one-dimensional--namely the heroine's sister. Further, later actions and thoughts of the heroine with regard to her sister--after a middle of the book climax, I found a little hard to believe. But aside from having to suspend belief for those few actions and thoughts, I thoroughly enjoyed the book.

Ms. Small is still one of my favorites."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing.","review":"As an avid fan of Ms. Small, I found this one rather boring.

Aurora and Cally was such coniving little witches! What they did to Valerian was unforgivable. I knew that the sisters would switch places. That was why I wanted to read the book in the first place, but the author made it turn out so bad for the hero and Cally ,that it was not cute anymore. I also felt no attraction for the hero. Maybe it was because Cally treated him with such scorn. I am sorry, but I like my heroes to be appealing and wanted! This was my third book by Bertrice Small and I find that she is not to my taste. The only thing I like about her books is her sex scenes!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not her best","review":"I am a huge Bertrice Small fan and own every single one of her books but this is easily my LEAST favorite and the only one I have only read once.

Some of the advice is amazingly impractical, i.e. when they talk about forgiveness. Mrs. Garcia-Prats cites a saint who forgave her daughter's rapist. In the framework of a marriage, this seems like a reach.

The history often includes detailed information about the designer and builder and the Lighthouse Attendant. I found their lonely lives to offer insight into what it was like to attend a Lighthouse.

I saw her backed by Ima, at the Park West in Chicago, during her Rising tour. It was one of the most profound musical experiences I have ever had the privilege to experience.

So throw away your preconceived notions about her.She's amazing, and she's finally being paid her dues. For a few years now, she has become more popular, due to the remixes of her older songs-which by the way have given her many top ten hits on the dance club charts.

The linear notes alone just add to the story.There are some exceptional tracks here, notably, the first two, Rising II, and It's Time For Action which just begs for a remix on some format.Yeah, Yoko can be said to be the first lady of rock.

If you're going to learn something in three weeks, you can't take the seat-of-the-pants approach -- you have to attach the subject vigorously. Merely repeating the vendor online docs isn't going to cut it.There are also numerous technical errors in this book.

For example, the various forms of Realist painting that arose in the mid-1960s, and continued to be vital forces at the end of the century, are mostly ignored.

Along with reprinted, and new, poems about food, BUTCHER'S APRON also includes the long-awaited 14th installment of her epic poem \\"Greed.\\" In it Ms. Wakoski explores the \\"Greed for Purity\\" through food, again, and provides the reader with a sadly rendered still-life portrait.

The reference to quantum physics is another attempt to rebel against contemporary society; almost as if to elevate the poet's unique character and diminish every scholar's existence. Obscure language and archaic metaphors were \\"in\\" thirty years ago, but now, especially when it's \\"cool\\" to be \\"out,\\" such literary devices are, in fact, \\"out\\"-dated.

Problem is, Carraba's material works best with its shared intimacies - those hushed moments racing along to the next rousing chorus on the cusp of audience participation.

I think that Chris needs to go back to Further, because their new singer [is weak] anyway. See what happens when good bands go mainstream?

I saw TBS in concert, though and they were okay. But i also saw Dashboard Confessional the previous year and you could not compare the two acts. I wouldnt say TBS is bad though, because the main singer seems like a really cool guy and i'd give them props for that. not so much into their music though. oh well. just an opinion.anyway, this albulm is the best!

I have been a die-hard Dashboard fan for 2 years and I am completely in love with The Places You Have Come To Fear The Most and The Swiss Army Romance.

The Cult of Carrabba is truly a frightening prospect: A bunch of moppy haired emo boys and whimpy girls who have never heard of Bob Dylan or Elliot Smith and who follow a 27 year old untalented singer who obsesses over high school romance.Most people say \\"What you have a problem with singers who aren't afraid to show their emotions?\\". The answer is no, I have a problem with singer songwriters who aren't good at what they do.

Over all this is a must buy for music lovers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so disappointing considering he wasnt too good to begin","review":"Chris is just another one of those mtv-wannabes who try being emotional, and a true artist. It's not working. with his newest album, its only another display of his extremely limited vocal range which holds no sort of rich emotion at all. the acoustic guitar can be turned into so many things, but he chooses to use it in the same type of tune over and over again that only the younger of us can bare to listen to. grow up, then buy some real music. people who give this cd five stars is probably some sort of blinded fan that thinks anyone with a tatoo, a guitar, is on mtv, and their friends think is cool likes this cd. theres no use even trying to reason with the likes of such a person. save your money"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Music, Bad Case","review":"Dashboard Confessional's music is by far some of the best I've listened to.

Sure, it's better than a lot of the cd's out there, in fact after returning 3 cds I would say this is the best one of what I got, but all the songs are so similar you might as well just get one single.I may not be easy to please, but I expected more being a fan of their type of music. The vocals put me to sleep and the repetitive tune is not much better.A lot of people seem to like it though, so I recommend listening to a couple of their (non-soundtrack) songs and then choosing whether or not to buy it.simply put, I found it boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"brave, smooth but charming","review":"as chris sings on I'll be true, I'll be useful, I'll be cavalier, I'll be yours, my dear...you finally settle yourself down for another dashboard ride, one that will take you through heart aches, happiness and most of all hope...A mark, A mission, A brand, A scar may not be like \\"places you have come to fear the most\\" this album is an experience on its own, a heart felt display of musical talent.

But in this CD drums, electric bass and electrc guitars is added to all the songs... now he sounds like every other band. He really should have just gone back to Further Seems Forever if he wanted to be in a band like that. Sounds more like 'Further Seems Forever' Than it sounds like Dashboard Confessional.

The first few songs are alright, and some of the songs he wrote a while ago (like \\"Hands Down\\" and \\"Ghost of a Good Thing\\") are great, but Chris Carrabba's newfound MTV-streak is disappointing and gives emo a bad name. If you're into MTV \\"punk\\" like Good Charlotte and Simple Plan, go ahead and buy this CD - you'll love it. But if you're an actual emo-kid like myself, this CD will leave you wondering what the hell happened to Dashboard. You're better off buying his older CDs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Carrabba's Curse: His Fans","review":"The thing about the reviews that precede and follow this is that the majority of them are written by rabid Dashboard Confessional fans, and I realize that combining \\"rabid\\" with \\"Dashboard fan\\" is an exercise in redundancy. First things first: This is not a change. This isn't Dylan in 1965 at the Folk Festival. Carraba's style hasn't gone hip-hop or pop or post-rock. This is still pop-punk. If you like Vagrant bands, odds are you'll like this.In the context of pop music as a whole, this will be a smash because it's great pop album. It has all the earmarks of overdramatic, pimply-teen mall muzak. This is not rock 'n' roll. It's not meant to be (and therefore should not be knocked on the basis that it doesn't rock). It's not a sell-out record, either. Carraba is taking this in the direction he feels most comfortable with, it's just a shame that he's an underdeveloped (especially musically) Elliott Smith."},{"rating":"1","title":"I must be too old","review":"I have a confessional to make: I left this on my dashboard, hoping the sun would melt the case. Greeting card lines coupled with paint-by-numbers melodies fail to stimulate my thinking. \\"Hands Down\\" is a great song, but the rest sounds like Buddy Holly redux - not his popular stuff, some of his demos."},{"rating":"2","title":"Carrabba at his best!","review":"The emotional tone of his voice is still there, as Dashboard Confessional released their much anticipated album Tuesday (12 August 2003). The single \\"Hands Down\\", though wonderful in its own right, does no justice to the amazingness that is the rest of this album. I literally got shivers listening to a few of the songs. Both Carrabba and his band are at their best.Suggested tracks: 13 Several Ways to Die Trying9 Carve Your Heart Out Yourself8 Morning CallsUltimately, though not quite as heart-broken emo as latter albums like \\"The Place You Have Come to Fear the Most\\" and \\"Swiss Army Romance\\", \\"A Mark, A Mission, A Brand, A Scar\\" definitely is pure Dashboard Confessional. Those who claim they've sold out by being slightly more 'peppy' are insane; Chris and his band are still amazing and convey words like no one else can.Rock on forever, Chris! I love you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Awesome CD by DC","review":"The new Dashboard CD is just how I expected it to be, awesome. Rolling Stone gave it 4 stars and it is probably one of the best CD's to come out this year. It still has Chris Carrabba strumming on the acoustic guitar, but it is a lot heavier with more electric guitar than on any of his former albums. Hands Down is a great song even though it has been out for a couple of years. I think Ghost of a Good Thing is the purest moment on the CD. All 13 songs give a different perspective at love and relationship. They are all great and I would recommend this CD to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dashboard just keeps getting better..........","review":"I'd been waiting so long for this album to hit the shops, to hear some new material from the talented Chris Carraba. Unplugged was fantastic, but was really just re-workings of already brilliant songs - A Mark, A Mission, A Brand, A Scar delivers so much more!The album opens with a brillant new verison of 'Hands Down', which is now complete with heavy guitars and lots more energy - Amazing! The rest of the songs see Dashboard experimenting more with electric guitars (almost sounding a little like one of Chris' earlier bands, Further Seems Forever) but are truely great!I saw Dashboard in London last night and was totally blown alway - the new material from this album was fantastic and is already stuck in my head after only hearing it a few times.If you're already a DC fan then you'll love this, if you're not - then buy this and you soon will be!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A \\"new\\" sound","review":"This is the first Dashboard Confessional cd I've heard and I think it is beautiful.

If you want to get dash which i suggest cos they dont suck, except for this cd, go for \\"the places you have come to fear the most\\" very good cd this one sucks so much ass it makes me want to kill myself or perhaps just james for liking dash so much 311 rules"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dashboard Confessional is washed up, sappy, horrible noise","review":"Chris Carraba left Further Seems Foerever for this crap? what a loser. a real jerk for leaving too. it was better for FSF because Carraba has one of the worst voices ever. he is whiny and his voice is by no means melodic. im a highschool age kid with relationship problems and this just seems like more sappy \\"you-broke-my-heart\\" music. if you're into this stuff at least listen to Taking Back Sunday instead because they have talent, not a few cliche lyrics with bad musicianship like this worthless piece of crap band that never should have made it out of whatever garage they started in. i should buy this album to have the sincere pleasure of burning it or maybe hammering it. the sound of power tools drilling into it would make me happier than listening to this garbage. listen to something real."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just As Good As \\"Places\\"","review":"In his new studio album, Chris Carabba, now pictured in the CD jacket with his band, matches much of the same intensity in contrast with balladic emo as he did in his \\"Places\\". Hands Down, my favorite track, reminds me much of my favorite track on the last disc, The Places You Have Come to Fear the Most. His soft, but melodic voice presents the awesome lyrics before he busts out into his cries which just sing, not scream, the amazing chorus.Other favorites are the softer Ghost of A Good Thing and Carry this Picture, revolving almost entirely around his penchant for the acoustic guitar. The refrain had me singing at the top of my lungs only the second and third time through the disc.An amazing disc that pays homage to the many talents of Carabba and the band. Can't wait to see them live in September."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome as usual","review":"Well this album is good as expected. I love Dashboard and they sure didnt let me down!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Album","review":"This is a very solid album by a good artist/band. This album is not like his older albums. This album is more rock then all of his other albums. There is still some acustic in here but not nearly as much as his older cds. Overall if you are a fan of Dashboard Confessional, pick up this album, just don't expect an album like Swiss Army Romance or The Place you Have Come to Fear Most. Worth buying though."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Mark, A Mission, A Brand, A Scar","review":"Well, its definetly Dashboard. This cd is worth a listen. If you like the other dash. stuff then you will seriously enjoy this cd. It was less of the acoustic sound that I had loved on their last two cd's. But the full band plays much more of a part on this cd. The one acoutic song, \\"Ghost of a good thing\\" is probably one of my favorites. But my favorite would half to be \\"am i missing,\\" in this song they have a soaring chorus with chris changing out the melody and the harmony. It not the catchest cd. After a few listens i found myself singing along and enjoying every song. So give it a listen, its worth your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Their Best","review":"Don't get me wrong. I believe that dashboard confessional is one of the best bands out there. chris carrabba's music is the heart-wrenching, cry-yourself-to-sleep kind. but when I first got this cd, I was rather disappointed. The lyrics are still as emotional as always, but they don't have the same impact as there is on their other cds. chris' voice is mellow without the kick it usually has, and they have diluted their sound to mere pop. judging from past work, this cd isn't as \\"full\\" as it could be. they are capable of much more."},{"rating":"2","title":"FOR THOSE ABOUT TO GO ELECTRIC","review":"Okay, kiddies, don't go bashing Mr. Carabba for plugging in now. Remember a little soul named Bob Dylan and all the flack he got at Newport Folk for doing the same? Attempting to compare DC's earlier works with this album is silly and futile. I loved \\"Swiss Army Romance\\" for its sheer purity and that's what made that album great. But this one- with the addition of a full band- is wonderful in a separate way, namely because the addition of electric guitar and drums boosts the emotion of Chris' voice. I don't feel this particular set of songs would work as well acoustically. It might be interesting to hear but the swell of instruments on \\"Bend and Not Break\\", \\"Am I Missing\\" and \\"Morning Calls\\" especially, just makes my chest ache! This is a great DC album, on par with \\"Swiss Army Romance\\", though different. So take the time to allow your ears the adjustment to some raucous rock instruments and dig on DC's new sound. It's truly beautiful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Dashboard","review":"This is not Dashboard quality when you put a dashboard cd in yout cd player you expect to hear sad slow accoustic songs. This album is not that at all more electric guitar as well as HAPPY music. some of you might like that but whatever. hope this helps. Not worth buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Their Best","review":"The newest edition to the Dashboard Confessional library is outstanding. When I listen to it, it makes me want to just replay it over and over. \\"Hands Down\\" and \\"As Lovers Go\\" are both excellent. Chris Carrabba shines yet again. Compared to \\"The Places You Have Come to Fear the Most,\\" \\"A Mark, A Mission, A Brand, A Scar\\" is three times better. Every track has something special. Great quality music for the Dashboard fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"different in a good way","review":"This cd is different than the usual DC stuff. It is much more amped up than the other 2 cds, which were basically just Chris and an acoustic guitar. They have made some changes like adding electric guitars and more drums. Having heard their older stuff I understand that some DC fans are mad because of the new sound. To new fans I would reccommend this cd as well as \\"The Places You Have Come to Fear the Most\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD!","review":"I wasn't a fan of Dashboard Confessional until I found out that the hit song \\"Hands Down\\" was by them. Since I was not a fan in the past, I can't compare this CD with their previous works. All I can say is that I love this album and I can not stop listening to it. No matter what mood I'm in, it always makes me feel good. Chris is a very talented singer and he sings with so much passion and emotion. Every song has a specific meaning. Some of them may have to be listened to more than once before the true significance comes out, but it's there. Also included with the CD is a DVD that shows Chris on a solo tour and the makings of this album. The DVD shows how talented Chris is and takes his acoustic side into effect even more. All in all, I think it is a great CD. It was well worth my money and I am looking forward to whatever else Dashboard Confessional is going to dish out to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Emo\\" Kids","review":"As a reviewer stated before, this is not emo, this is basically the mainstream equivalent of emotionless emo... Which would be nothing, which is exactly what I would spend on this album if I were you. I borrowed it from a friend and I felt ripped off since I would never get that time back. Check the other recommendations below for real emo and find out what it's really all about. Chris is a chronic bitcher, not an emotional being. Which would you rather be around? Probably the emotional being, unless you're a dumb high school student who feels they need to jump on the bandwagon of every music scene and listen to the worst possible representative band of any \\"genre\\" because it's popular. What's popular generally sucks... Think with your head. If you like this, it's not your fault you don't know what good music really is..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Irony is Beautifully Tragic","review":"\\"If you're as tired as I am of hearing people praise wannabe, no-talent bands such as New Found Glory and Good Charolette, then take my advice: you will LOVE Dashboard.\\" wrote 'A Music Major'.In a twist of irony akin to soured relationship (somehow, this idea seems vaguely familiar... oh wait, it's almost singularly the topic of Chris Carraba's music), that reviewer wrote one of the better jokes I have recently read. New Found Glory and Good Charlotte are a cheapening and ruination of punk as much as Dashboard Confessional is a mockery of real emo.Want to listen to some real emo, not Carraba's imitation for teens who want to feel as though they are emotionally distraught and actually delude themselves into depression? Try Antioch Arrow, Heroin, Rites of Spring, Moss Icon, or Mohinder.Then as DC where their hearts lie, because its not with the genre. Emo is already dead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Bad Review","review":"What can I say? Emo has became an embarrassment to music in general, but mainly Punk. Seeing as how these little teenie boppers and mall rats have become infestations to deal with that claim to be punk when they have not even the faintest glimpse of what true punk is. It's sickening. Do me a favor and next time you go to the mall, count how many \\"punks\\" you can see, the total would be somewhere around 50. I say we start a protest against the infidels!To those of you teenie boppers, listen to some real music, like Slayer or perhaps Misfits."},{"rating":"1","title":"We have them to thank for emo stereotypes","review":"This is by far one of the worst albums I have ever bought. It is right on par with Good Charlotte and Simple Plan. Their fan base consists of 14 year old girls(Im 14 and know plenty)who realized that people didn't find Good Charlotte cool and decided they would try to seem deep. These posers sit around listening to dashboard and saying that they're going to go cry later. Dashboard decided to call themselves emo and people started to mistake true emotion and expression for this commercial crap. Thanks to Dashboard geniuses like Conor Oberst are less appreciated. Lets hope Chris doesn't see the bad reviews or he might start crying."},{"rating":"2","title":"A leap...A bound....","review":"I have to say that I am extremely impressed with this album. Even the fact that it can truly be called an album (an all-too-rare thing these days) is refreshing. Every song on it is excellent. It covers far greater emotional range than their other albums and the lyrics are by and large, superb. This is an album that I liked at first and the more I listened to it, I grew to love it. These guys put on a great show and they are the real deal. I have the feeling that they are about to break into the big time and I hope they do so with their integrity intact and that they continue to make such wonderful music."},{"rating":"2","title":"same, but good","review":"dashboard confessional has been known for its breakup, guitar driven songs. they don't stray too far from their winning formula. this album is a nice, easy listen album. this album's been a lock on my cd player for awhile. try not to bother yourself with its lyrics, but its mellow, and soft guitar songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"great cd","review":"this is a cd for the types that like to listen to what isnt on the radio alot of original content great cd can listen to over n over go buy this cd hands down is a great song so is ghost of a good thing"},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this Dashboard? I guess...","review":"Well, I can recognize the voice, and I guess the words seem kind of Dashboard-ish, but this whole CD has too much of a punk feel to it- the acoustic guitars have been switched to electric, there's a constant drum and cymbal beat, and the songs seem more geared to be played LOUD than the calm and quiet Dashboard I'm used to. Candidly, I'm disappointed in this CD. They really should have stuck with the tranquil acoustic sounds of the Swiss Army Romance. Oh well."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Ho Ho Ho\\" Parodies will make you \\"Ha Ha Ha\\"!","review":"Seattle's Bob Rivers and his Twisted crew have gathered the best of their Christmas parodies into one safe place - a 3 CD box set.

There are a lot of people out there who completely wrote this product off because it took their beloved Greyhawk campaign setting in a different direction. I am not one of them. I think Carl Sargent did a superb job of creating a post war feel to the lands of Flanaess and gave the old Greyhawk setting something it needed, personality. The writing is excellent, the maps are beautiful, and the card stocks were very useful. My only complaint is that there wasn't a detailed starting point for a campaign like a village, town, or even the City of Greyhawk itself. There are also very few supplements for this outstanding version of Greyhawk, and the ones that are out there are hard to find and rather expensive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Used replacement?","review":"This replacement product did not work with my Zeno device and, believe that it actually broke the device since it stopped working (i.e. wouldn't even charge) after I swapped the cartrige.

This book must have been 'naughty' and 'edgy' in its day, but it hasn't aged well. At all. The first person narrative feels forced and the repeated sex scenes are boring and do nothing to further the plot - wait a minute - there is no plot. The only female character is reduced to a cut-out with bad breath and a lovely back. The most developed character is the car. This is watered down Hemingway, except even more two dimesional. The only reason I gave it any stars was that there are some gorgeous descriptions of France that are so true and so real you feel you are there.

The beauty of the prose and imagery that Salter offers is nothing less than remarkable. Few authors have the ability to completely draw the reader into their world with the masterful skill that I so enjoyed in reading this book. No words are wasted, and each sentence makes the relationship between the characters and the reader a bit more intimate. \\"A Sport and a Pastime\\" is, quite simply, the best novel I've read in a very long time.

The book somehow conveys easily the story of Bobby's hustling, the history of amateur tennis, the disfunctionality of his marriages, the chaos of his match against Billie Jean King, even the agony of his dying--I mean, WOW!!--what a book! No sooner had I started reading it than friends told me they had heard about it on the radio and asked me for my copy.

The little creatures do look neat if you get them to grow, and your kids will learn something about life and death and extreme responsibilty and time commitment, but it is just not worth the time! You have to change the water every other day, and the saurs are very vulnerable to water changes, so this becomes an experience of bated breath and prayers your saurs will survive another day.

Maybe I misread the instructions, but I did not see anything about cleaning the tank or changing the water. The only caveat was that you need to be careful not to put too much food in the water (which might cause too much algal growth). A number of our aquasaurs hatched and two survived and have grown to about an inch in two weeks. They are interesting looking creatures (very different from brine shrimp) and very active. A little algae has grown on the bottom but it is really no problem. My understanding is that these things evolved to live in puddles, for crying out loud. Leave them alone. Let them live for a few weeks and when they die, throw out the water. My son loves watching them grow and cavort around the tank, and I hope we will get another batch from the remaining eggs."},{"rating":"2","title":"really neat!!!","review":"my son loves dinosaurs. so i thought this would be a great gift. it took several weeks for the aquasaurs to hatch. i had almost given up on them but they are worth the wait. especially becauuse you know they were here before dinos. for heating i just used a regular desk lamp and moved it closer or farther away to adjust the temperature. as far as the water if the green water doesn't bother you it doesn't bother them. i doubt their natural enviroment is clear.when it got too bad i scooped out most of it and added bottled water. they aquasaurs adjusted easily.we started with two aquasaurs from 1/2 the eggs. as luck would have it a male and female. you can see the egg sacks on the female. after about 60 days they died. i left the water and a week or so later--- WE HAD BABIES. about a dozen. i was hoping some would die off. but not yet. and at least 3 pregnant females.my only problem-my tank is getting to small!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Cool and Educational","review":"We recieved this item as a Birthday present last year so I did not have great hopes that the Aquasars were still going to hatch.

Yes the film has funny lines and scenes but the way David (Cage) talks about women's bodies is disturbing. When ever they flashed a breast or anything unnecessary, it made lost interest in the film. Cage is a wonderful and a gifted actor (check-out Leaving Las Vegas instead), but lately he has been in some pointless films in the past several years.

Nicholas Cage is about 50/50 when it comes to good films, but Michael Caine looked like he'd carry the story in the previews. I couldn't have been more wrong.Cage is a conflicted character, clearly he's unhappy. He's a bad father and his children and ex-wife are evidence of that as well. The preview made it look like a father-son film about being a better father and better man. For every step forward Cage takes, he takes at least two backwards.The sad part is through all of this conflict, there was a tremendous potential for the character to grow, but that never happens.

There's a very touching scene between Cage and Caine (as Cage's highly successful father) in a car playing a song Cage has dedicated to his dad.

There was no emotional attachment to the depressing existence of the lead.When it was all over I just felt angry that I had wasted my time so I write this to hopefully help you to not waste your time on the worst movie ever.

This movie is so boring that Cage himself couldn't get interested in the only sex scene, in which he was a participant!Liberals will love this film because it portrays the values of the Progressive culture (don't ask, don't tell, don't be judgmental, and for Heaven's sake don't hurt the self-esteem of your children).Michael Caine's supporting role needs a supporting role. He struggles to hide his British accent and garners no sympathy as he dies of cancer. It's just sad, not the part, the acting.Gore Verbinski as a director of this film has achieved the ultimate cure for insomnia.The best advise is to use your money on something better, like a lobotomy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did these people read the script...","review":"before agreeing to appear in this nauseating mess?

Lois Hunt sings superbly, too, although without the last bit of distinctiveness that characterizes Wrightson. Percy Faith's contribution here is entirely welcome. His orchestrations are lush and vigorous, complementing the two singers admirably. A highlight of the CD is Ol' Man River, in what is probably the best version I have heard after Paul Robeson's.

Not only is it educational, but it reads like an enjoyable novel. It is written in a witty, autobiographical style by someone who has been through it all....sucess, failure, happiness, and sadness. The author teaches you the pitfalls to avoid and what to look for through his first hand personal experiances. I have made a space for it on my personal bookshelf of \\"keepers\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"SAVE YOUR MONEY","review":"Now, let's see if we've got this straight: the author, Kash, comes from a solid, two-parent, white middle-class American family that affords him the opportunity to seek a college education and he has the audacity to depict himself as having bootstrapped his way from \\"humble\\" beginnings to the top of the corporate heap?? Gimme a break. This is hardly a rags-to-riches, here's-how-you-can-do-it-too guidebook, despite outward appearances to the contrary. Moreover the alleged lessons he articulates (i.e. \\"Be nice to people and they will be nice to you\\") are little more than common sense mantras that any aspiring tycoon with a modicum of integrity can realize on his/her own, B-school or no B-school."},{"rating":"2","title":"Appears to be made for a specific 4.5\\" Makita grinder","review":"I purchased this case to fit one of my two 4 1/2\\" Makita grinders: an old 9503BH and a new 9564CV. The case appears to be made for a specific Makita 4 1/2\\" grinder.My older grinder fits pretty well but not perfectly. For example, there is a cutout in the lid of the case to snap-in the grinder handle. My handle is smaller than the cut-out and it falls out when you close the lid.My newer grinder has a longer and more slender body. It is too long for the impression in the case, and the lid will not close. I generally prefer metal cases because they are much less bulky, and they can be padded with foam to achieve a custom fit for your tool. This would be a great case, if you happen to have the model that it was made for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for hobbiests!","review":"For months I had been looking for a low (below 25\\"), heavy duty, counter style stool to use between my 2 craft tables yet still be comfortable and not hurt my back.

I have more or less successfully managed to hook up stereo and TV components for more than 50 years . Usually I refer to the User's Manual. JVC has created a User's Manual for the TH-D 60 that for complexity rivals anything I've ever seen. The Home Theatre system seems to work fine which is why I gave it 4 stars but I still can't figure out whether it is hooked up correctly. If you have just a basic TV and a simple DVD to hook up I suppose you can do it but if you have a complex HD Sony 50\\" TV and 4 different components it is a nightmare. Thank God Sony puts out a separate folder with the TV that helps immensely. I'm in the market for another home theatre system for a dedicated TV room and JVC will not be on my list. This Manual is unbelievable. Trust me. By the way, the best manual I've EVER seen is the one that came with my $128 NB500MGX Magnavox Blu-Ray Player I bought the other day.

SO I bought this one. I have had for for maybe 6 months and used it probably 20 times. First time I used it a horrible burning plastic smell filled the kitchen. I thought it was just the newness of the grill. But it didn't stop. Pretty much every time I used it it smelled like it was melting somewhere. I turned it over last night and lo and behold a piece of the heating element seems to be melting through the bottom. I have only grilled chicken breasts on it, and hamburgers, no giant slabs of cold meat.I am very disappointed in this machine, and will likely not buy another.

A superb machine by all standards!This one I purchased for the conveniences it offered:1. A timer, which is not really necessary2. A temperature control switch that does not work for the following reason: Once the 5 minute pre-heat cycle is reached automatically, it becomes impossible to defy physics and (presto!) lower it to the suggested 160 degrees to cook (for example) shrimp.3. The detachable plates rest on two rectangular elements that interfere with the even distribution of the heat, resulting in undercooked stuff near the edges of the cooking surface.We ditched it an will stick to our old and reliable regular grill.I will not recommend it to any one at all!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wussed out in less than 2 months","review":"Bought one of these in December, by February it was dead.

I've also tried several of the recipes included and all have been very good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor design","review":"This grill is poorly designed. It does not cook evenly. Food on the back of the grill cooks much better and faster than food on the front of the grill. First cooked chicken. The chicken on the back of the grill was ready and the chicken on the front was still practically raw. See no purpose in taking up so much space in the kitchen for such a good sized grill if you can only cook on the back half. Had the same problem when tested it with grilled cheese. The sandwich in the back was ready, cheese melted, and the sandwich in the front had not started to melt. I would not recommend this produce."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"I had a smaller, older model GF grill which I loved, but the finish was peeling off the plates, so when I heard about the removable plates that could go in the dishwasher I was excited. To my great disappointment the new and improved \\"Next Grilleration\\" merely steamed my food, there was no hint of a grilled texture. I tried burgers, chops, chicken breasts and sausages and was disappointed every time. Now I'm sorry I gave the old one away. Incidentally, after paying approximately $100.00 for this, I found it a week later at Wal-Mart for about $60.00.

Each time was a disappointment. I have an older family size GF that works well, but is difficult to clean. I bought the new one because of the removable plates. They are quite easy to remove and clean. The old GF is such a pain to clean, that I only used it for grilling sandwiches.The GFP99 is much slower to heat up than the older GF. I think it takes roughly 15 minutes to achieve it's highest temperature. Unfortunately, even at it's highest setting, it still is not as hot as the older GF. I tried cooking small(bone in) lamb chops -- after 20 minutes I removed them and cooked them in a pan. I cooked turkey burgers, scallops, and grilled sandwiches. It took much longer than pan frying, or the older GF, and the results were not very good (uneven cooking, no searing).I plan to return it to tomorrow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor heating","review":"This George Foreman does not provide the heating of the older models.

Thanks for the reviews, wish I had read them before."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad outweighs the Good","review":"Sadly I've had a number of the same bad experiences as other reviewers. The grill emits a strong smell of burning plastic whenever I use it. When new, I assumed it was a manufacturer's coating burning off. However, after numerous cleanings and uses, it still gives off the smell (it looks as though steam from the food is melting the plastic top as it cooks). Also, the temperature is not hot enough for true grilling and the food looks and feels uninviting. It's truly a shame that the ease of cleaning was not properly combined with the extraordinary function of my older George Foreman."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea-bad implementation+safety hazzard-Save your money","review":"Completely unsafe. Spewed large amount of burnt plastic smoke, rickety clamps to hold on plates, steamed, did not \\"fry\\" hamburger.

Did I mention it smelled like burning plastic for the entire time it was on?"},{"rating":"1","title":"It is a piece of junk","review":"Pretty bad, because:-grill heats unevenly. Cook a full grill of bacon and see what I mean.-alarm sounds right at the frequency that is most often lost to hearing, especially in older men.-plastic case arrived broken. It is poorly cast. Fortunately the 3\\" piece that was broken off did not affect functionality. There was no damage to the shipping carton-it came from the factory that way!-the appliance takes up at least two inches more counter space in both directions than it needed to, had it been designed correctly.-Amazon would have taken it back but we decided to keep it because we don't have time to chase down a Delonghi right now, so Amazon gave us a partial refund.

I was expecting something that actually gets hot enough to cook my food to a grill type consistency. At least leave some marks where the raised parts of the grill plates were in contact with the food. But this grill won't heat up to the max temp. even after ten minutes of pre-heating.

Bad mistake. Number one, it is very slow to heat. Number 2, it never seems to heat up hot enough. Number 3, it is confusing (there is a little timer which is sometimes operating to countdown on the (eternal) prewarming process, and is sometimes your own cooking timer.

Tried calling the toll free number in the book and after being on hold for so long they wanted for you to leave a voicemail and they will call you back in 24-48 hours. The book ask to not take it back to the store but that is exactly what I will probably do. I have had several George Foreman grills in the past and they all still work. Just bought this one because of the removal plates is a great convience. As for the cooking, when it cooks, is great. Just getting it this particlar one to work and finish cooking is another matter. The cooking is the only reason it got 2 stars from me. Maybe this is just a bad one I don't know but very dissappointed in this particular grill.

That's one thing I noticed as soon as I started using the new one. Some of the food I first cooked on the old one wasn't sticking on the new one. The non stick coating is improvment over the old.

It's obvious that the manufacturer is not packing the grills to be individually shipped. It's very frustrating and I'm reluctant to try another replacement shipment. However, I'm hoping the third time's a charm and I'll actually get to use the grill that I've heard so many good things about.

From the first use it has had an electronic burnt smell when it was on. We have used this grill countless times since Christmas and always with the foul smell. Also it takes forever to heat up. Tonight we tried pork chops at 425 degrees. After 20 min. it said it had reached the 425 degrees. We cooked the chops for 10 min. but they never browned. After that I checked the temp. with an infrared thermometer. The top plate was only at 380-390 degrees and the bottom plate was around 400 degrees. Far below the 425 degrees it was set for.The bottom line is this is not a very good grill and I would not recommend this grill to anyone.

I just throw them in the dishwasher and they come out great. Be careful, some grills don't have this feature and I bet would be difficult to clean."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Family-size grill so far","review":"We have used 2 of the George Foreman grills before. The original small Foreman grill and the large family-size grill. Both are great but cleaning the grill plates is a tough task. The size of this grill and the removable plates make this grill 100% better than our older grills. Plus the temperature control is fantastic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Unhappy","review":"I purchased this grill for my family of four, about two months ago. I have only used it three times. Each time I use it, I have such a difficult time afterwards cleaning the \\"top removeable plate\\" to the grill. I just cannot get the plate clean... I use a gentle scrub-sponge with dish soap and then rinse with hot water. Even washing it the last time I used it, three times, it still has food stuck in its grooves. I am so upset, for I have wasted my money on what I thought would be a great addition to our kitchen. The cooking surface is cheaply made, the silicone coating is really thin. Any suggestions on what to do.... before I throw it out!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"George Foreman GRP99 Grill with nonstick removable plates","review":"I am quite surprised at the great reviews for this grill. I owned the exact same model for years, and when it died I ended up ordering the same grill because the size of all the new grills with removable plates was just too small. When the grill arrived, I noticed immediately that the plates were made of much thinner material than the model I had, and when plugged it there was just too much sizzling and popping sounds from the grill. I had Amazon ship a replacement on the off chance that this was just a defective model, but the new one had the same issues. It just did not measure up to my original grill; likely because it is manufactured by a totally different company even though it retails under the same name.I miss my grill but will have to keep searching. I just was not impressed by the craftsmanship on this model when compared to the original design."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reliability an issue","review":"I've seen reviews stating that the reliability of these grills is an issue and can confirm that mine packed up in less than 4 months with very little use. Amazon have been great and sent me a replacement but if they hadn't I wouldn't be rushing to purchase another one, probably go back to one of their older models and live with the horrible cleaning."},{"rating":"2","title":"A cook that never cooks","review":"This is the first time I use an electric grill. It was easy, once you know the duration for each grilling. This grill is heaving and takes up a bit more room than a ordinary notebook computer. The grilling is fast- usually less than 4 minutes for most foods.The best part is the cleaning- you get to take the grilling plates off!This grill is better suited for family or people who have enough room on the kitchen counter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love my George Forman Grill","review":"I have used a Farberware grill for over 20 years but the element went out. Since I had heard so many great things about the George Forman grills, I decided to order one and I love it. It heats fast, cooks fast, doesn't smoke up the kitchen, and clean up is a breeze. We cooked steak tonight and my husband cleaned the grill..he said it was so nice cleaning this grill and not cussing because it took so long to wash. He hated cleaning the Farberware grill. Thank you for a wonderful product!I am updating my previous review. After using this grill for a period of time, we were unhappy with how tough steaks, pork chops cooked on it. It does make great hamburgers though. Ended up selling it on a garage sale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let the Buyer Beware!","review":"I had another George Foreman grill that I used every day for years. Eventually it died. I loved it! So when it came to buying another, I came to Amazon and started to look at the newer models. I purchased this version, attracted by the timer and heat setting, features not available on the gril I previously owned. And the removeable grills for cleaning! Wow! That must be great! Well, no! Since day one the grills barely attached to the body. Took so much effort to get them to adhere, I took to cleaning it the old fashioned way. Half way through grilling, the top grill would come flying off. Since it was heated up to 425 degrees, there have been quite a few burns, and a couple of close calls with it landing nearly on top of my bare feet. Great concept, very poorly executed. Very disappointed. Does a great job grilling, however."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great grilling machine","review":"I had a GF grill before. But cleaning it was difficult. I love the removable plates on this grill.The timer is a nice addition. I can clearly hear it from the other room.In fact, this machine would be perfect except for one thing. I put the plates in the dishwasher. The back of the plates lost the coating. Not that it matters but it came off black on my dishtowel.The cooking service is true non-stick and it comes clean easily."},{"rating":"1","title":"The grill almost BLEW UP in my face.","review":"During my first use, the grilleration malfunctioned while I was cooking chicken at 375 degrees.

In any case, I caution all future users to think twice before buying this piece of crap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very pleased!","review":"I was relucant to buy this grill because of the bad reviews that claimed it was unsafe, but I have had my grill for over 3 months now and never had a moment's trouble with it.

The very best part about this item is the removable plates which makes cleaning very easy. She loves it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A slight disappointment","review":"This grill is better in theory than practice. I'm not sure it heats to the temp it shows on the display and it really isn't practical for steaks except very thin ones. It's pretty handy for hamburgers and also makes good panini sandwiches. I haven't tried some of the other recipes so I can't really comment on anything else. It is easy to clean, so that's a plus."},{"rating":"1","title":"This item is DANGEROUS!!","review":"Unlike the other reviewers who pointed out the dangers of a melting heating element, my issue is what I consider to be a dangerous and defective design, namely, the removable plates. They are held on by thin, cheap, flimsy clips, that, apparently, can deform or come loose when the unit is heated. Several times now, when cooking, I have lifted up the top only to have the \\"removable\\" part come crashing off. A 350 hot piece of metal landing on your feet, your cat, or God forbid, a child underfoot is not something anybody would want. Stay far away from this piece of junk, it could burn you or worse. This issue, combined with other safety issues made in other reviews make me wonder how on earth this item ever made it onto the market. George, you oughta be ashamed of yourself for foisting this junk item on the public."},{"rating":"2","title":"great and clean","review":"I have had several different electric grills.This one is easy to clean.And with temp.contolecooks even and no guessing."},{"rating":"2","title":"we use it all the time","review":"This product is awesome. We use it to grill sandwiches, veggies, salmon, chicken, and everything is perfect every time. And clean up is a snap. Although the plates are dishwasher safe (which is a biggie for me) I've never had to put them in the dishwasher because they are so easy to clean. I'm glad I didn't let the one negative review on here scare me away from this one. It's a keeper and we use it all the time. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"works until it melts and the cooking plates fall off","review":"Got this thing about a year ago, and the removable plates, timer, and adjustable temp are big improvements over earlier versions. But after a few uses, the plastic cover on ours melted a bit and is now a bit deformed and ugly. AND the top cooking plate tends to disconnect when opening the thing. Today it fell off clanged onto the floor just missing my foot, spattering grease all over the place.Hamilton Beach and Cuisinart make similar products, and they are probably better engineered. Even though this one is no long under warranty, it's getting boxed up and shipped back to the manufacturer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!!","review":"Received this grill as a Christmas gift...since then have prepared 10 meals on it. The chicken cooks up evenly, stays juicy, with grill marks and all. Shrimp, scallops, and burgers taste great--have made chicken cheesesteaks for lunch as well as paninis. Cleanup is simple-seriously. No fat cooking that stays juicy. Definately planning on using this indoors until at least April for all our grilling needs, and will probably continue in summer for certain meals. A great product, and for me one of the best gifts I have ever received."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Choice","review":"This George Forman Grill is the only one I could find with time and temperature controls that also has removable cooking surfaces that are diswasher safe.Liked it so well that we bought another for our vacation home."},{"rating":"2","title":"He's Done It Again!","review":"We \\"traded up\\" to this larger GF grill. This grill fits 6 burgers, 4 LARGE chicken breasts, steaks and pork chops with no problem at all. {I really had to squish meat to fit on my smaller GF grill!} The only thing I noticed about this larger grill, is that it doesn't automatically heat up as hot the grill I had. It's default temperature is 300 degrees. The temperature can be adjusted, which is a great feature. I tried cooking 4 large chicken breasts using the recommended cook time for 300 degrees {10 minutes}. They weren't done all the way the through. I added an additional 5 minutes and they came out great! I'm going to be adding 3-5 minutes of cook time to the recommended time on the chart or increasing the temperature to 350 degrees. Overall, I would recommend this grill to anyone. It's quick, easy to use and the cooking trays can go in the dishwasher! What more do you need?!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great item","review":"I love the Next Generation Grill. I got one for my parents and myself and we are very happy with the removable Plates!

I purchased this model and started to cook and the unit shut down no power the unit just burnt out hadn't even finished cooking hamburgers called the manufacturer and they advised me to return it to the store since the 30 days hasn't expired exchanged it for another and power problem was fine but during the cooking the top of the unit bubbled up and now has 2 big bumps on the top and I have since returned that one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, But Not Great","review":"This version of the George Foreman Grill is better than the original. I enjoy the fact that the heating grids are removable, also that the temperature can be altered for cooking. It is still annoying that the grill must be unplugged after use (after all, a stove is not unplugged when you are done using it). Perhaps if future models had an automatic shut-off (like a coffee pot or iron) it would not necessitate the need to unplug it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Returned to store","review":"We were'nt completely satisfied almost from the day of purchase. Bought it primarily because of the removable grill plates. We were happy w/ our first GF grill, but the plates were not removable. First concern was excessive preheat time required. We never did cook on any setting other than the highest heat setting. When the teflon coating began to come off the grill plates within 60 days of purchase, we were only too happy to return it for a refund (not a replacement)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsafe","review":"I've found that the upper grill plate on this grill consistently falls off after the grill gets hot. I securely fasten it before cooking (when grill is cool), but as it heats up and you open it to check on your food, the lid portion of the grill falls off. I've learned to be armed with hot mitts to catch it as it falls, but I was caught off guard once when it fell off, burning my hand and nearly falling on my foot (instead, it hit my linoleum and left an ugly scorched spot). The basic product works well except for this fatal flaw. If this defect could be fixed, it would be worth re-buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this Foreman","review":"I love my Foreman grill.

Great product and best price that I could find."},{"rating":"1","title":"George Forman grill is overated","review":"The George Forman grill is highly overated for the price. the removable plates never really get hot enough to grill and sear the meat, it more likes steams the meat, you do not get that real grill flavor. Very poor design with the removable plate,its a chore to attach them. not a good deal for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trading Performance for Easy Cleaning","review":"If you own a first generation Foreman grill, you know the one aspect of using it you'd like to see improved. Cleaning it is a chore. This grill is a snap to clean, pop out the plates & into the dishwasher. Unfortunately this major improvement comes with a severe price. The performance of this grill is simply awful. The heating elements are, out of necessity, located behind the grill plates, relying on conduction to heat the actual cooking surfaces. Bad idea, or at least bad execution. The plates NEVER get hot enough to sear anything, even when preheated forever at the highest temperature setting (425 degrees, don't you believe it!). No browning, no sizzle, no flavor. Forget doing steaks in this, unless you like them ruined. 1 star only for ease of cleaning, otherwise, no stars. Why would anyone want a grill that doesn't grill, no matter how easy it is to clean?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best indoor grill unit!","review":"I have been through several previous Foreman grills, Hamiton Beach, DeLongi, etc.This is the best indoor grill, bar none.The timer is wonderful.The heat control is very accurate.I just made a grocery store standard porterhouse (.75 inch not a huge one) at 425 degrees and it came out with caremelized marks and perfect doneness. Follow the charts and subtract about half a minute at this temperature.I am one happy camper...clean up is a breeze in the dishwasher.Bravo to Salton."},{"rating":"1","title":"This George (GRP99) is defective and could be dangerous.","review":"I have had this new George Foreman GRP99 Next Generation Grill with Removable Plates for 3 weeks and last night it shorted out and nearly started a fire.

But after last night, I'm going back to my older grill.Please be very careful with the new George Foreman GRP99 Next Generation Grill with Removable Plates."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasted Buy","review":"This is my third Foreman grill and I feel it was a wasted buy.The grill doesn't stay hot enough to give it that grilled taste and look. Generally, the meat tastes and appears broiled. I'm really disappointed. On the plus side, it's very easy to clean the detachable plates."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Fantastic","review":"This is my 1st GFG and it's fantastic. I was able to grill 8 hotdogs for the kids at once and then grill chicken right after. Both were perfect and everyone was happy.The removeable plates were easy to clean and was what inspired me to finally purchase this machine. I feel that the controls are easy to use and understand. Very straight forward.For me it looks good, feels good. It also saves time from using the traditional oven."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loved it till it died","review":"We bought this grill in August 2005 and pretty much used it every day for something, usually bacon. I loved being able to put the plates in the dishwasher. Then Sunday as I was grilling steaks for my son's birthday supper I noticed the power light was off. We checked the ground fault breakers and the plug in. Nothing wrong there. Then we looked under the grill. The bottom has what looks to be a wire that has melted through the bottom and is visible on the outside. I was really surprised that our countertop wasn't damaged. It is definitely a fire hazard. The Salton company is sending me a postage label to return it for replacement but I won't be able to trust this brand of grill now and will buy myself a different brand. I have seen several reviews that have had this same problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to clean!!","review":"Love to grill veggies on this! My husband and I both think vegetables taste better grilled than steaming, stir fry, or saute-ing. The clean-up is a breeze! It also came with 2 drip trays so I throw one in the dishwasher and am still able to use the grill (the plates are easy to clean and aren't as greasy as the drip trays). The gray, stainless color matches my stainless kitchen quite nicely. Yes, it's more expensive than others, but the low-maintenance factor really won me over!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great","review":"I ordered this for my husband for christmas and paid alot of money to have it sent to me.

What a difference to be able to remove those plates. I just rinse them off and stick them in the dishwasher! I love the timer and the sleek new silver design. The only drawback are that it does not have as much cooking space as the last one I owned. And of course the actual cooking times are a few minutes longer than the instructions say, but then that was the case with my last grill too. I am VERY happy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A vast improvement","review":"Like many others I had the original Foreman grill that cooked great but was a pain to clean, so I was delighted to see it reinvented with removable plates. I read through the reviews here and was sufficiently impressed enough to get one, and so far I've been very happy with it. The complaints about loose plates? Well, here's an idea--before you turn it on attach the plates, then give each one a tug to make sure it's latched properly. Takes ... I don't know, a whole five seconds? I've done steaks, burgers, chicken breasts, sandwiches and bacon in this and all have turned out well, and clean-up is a breeze. If you're expecting a recreation of your outdoor grill it may be a disappointment, but I've always gotten nice grill marks and have no quibble with the taste of the food. If you're a fan of the original GF grill you'll like this one even more.I gave this four stars, but Amazon's only showing one, sorry!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality slipping?","review":"This purchase was to replace an older version of this same model. The newer version didn't produce the same temps, and the plates imparted a metallic / foreign taste that continued even after the unit was used over a year and a half. I suspect the non-stick coating was the culprit. We went back to using the old unit.This will probably be the last time we buy a George Foreman grill."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow! Just wow!","review":"We live in a multi-unit dwelling and local ordinances disallow the use of patio grills. After finding out that Mr. Foreman's product line now has a grill with removable, dishwasher-safe grill plates, we took the plunge! Our first meal was a pair of chuck steaks from Trader Joe's (which we used to make on our infrared gas grill before losing that right due to local pyromaniacs burning their apartments down). The grill works great in the kitchen! Zero smoke, perfect grease drainage, leaves great grill marks, and the clean-up is conspicuously easy. Our next meal attempt will be suckling pig and couscous. Mr. Foreman has new friends in our household!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke on second day","review":"I bought this to replace the same model that had a heating element fail after about 4 years. The replacement had a handle crumble off one of the plates on the second day. I would be in bad shape if I hadn't saved my old plates. Two weeks later, I don't have a replacement part. If yours breaks, send it back. Calling the 800 number for warranty is not worth your time. FYI Black and Decker is the factory name."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"We spent a lot of time searching for an indoor grill and came across this amazing product.

I thought this would be so much better as the grill plates are removable plus the added bonus of temperature selection. I thought it had enough 5 star ratings to assure a good purchase - Wrong! Maybe there are just a lot of lemons out there and I got stuck with one but I won't buy another to find out. This grill just does not get really hot! My meat took three times as long to cook and there was no grill marks - just grey looking meat. I have now read the 1 star reviews and can see there are many like mine. Now I didn't have a problem with anything melting. Maybe just didn't use it enough for it to happen. I gladly returned it!

I had it set at 425 degrees, which is pretty hot for frying bacon, yet it barely sizzled. It took 40 minutes to fully cook a few slices!I only have one question: What good are the digital readouts if they're not giving accurate information?I do plan on doing some research to find out if this is just a faulty unit, or if it is a common occurrence with this \\"Next Generation Grill\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"George Foreman Grill","review":"We were not very well pleased with the grill.

That is to be expected in traditional Swedish knitwear designs. It is not terribly hard to make the changes to avoid steeks if you chose not to work in that method. Don't let that put you off this cheerful, well done book."},{"rating":"1","title":"No tonal notations - worthless book","review":"The book only has very few tonal notations, a with there being five tones for the same word; they are extreamly important.

There is no substitute for his voice and once you hear him sing the role of Jekyl/Hyde, you'll be disappointed with all other voices. I saw this musical on Broadway back in '99 and was not as impressed with the actors' voices as I was with the ones on this recording. Warlow is impeccable and his interpretation and \\"vocal acting\\" will blow you away. I adore this recording!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Goth","review":"Well I've watched david hasselhoffs production of this musical and although he is a brilliant stage actor. He's not a touch on Anthony warlow. Just listening to Anthony sing his part in the c.d He really makes the part his own, and what he does with hyde is just amazing,truly a great achievement. Well worth the listening."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best J & H records available!!!:D","review":"I own this 2 CD set and it's my favorite broadway muscial.

Besides, the presentation of the album is flawless: you have the text for the lyrics and the case is very elegant. Not cheap but worth the price and the experience to have the best and most complete version."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST. MUSICAL. EVER!!!!!!!","review":"Oh jeez...how to begin....Anthony Warlow has the best voice There is in the world.....better even than Terrance Mann if that's possible....The story has everything....action, murder, love, a touch of comedy, some songs are deep and evilly dark and then your lifted up with songs like \\"This is the Moment\\" \\"A new Life\\" \\"Someone like you\\" and \\"Take me as I am\\"I would have to say my favorite songs are \\"Alive!!\\" \\"Your work and nothing more\\" and \\"The confrontation\\" Im also find of \\"This is the Moment\\" \\"The World has gone INsane\\" and \\"A new Life\\"Despite Les Miserables being my favorite musical ever...I would have to say this has almost better music...its more modern... I wouldn't care if this CD was 5 dollars or 500 i would buy it!! I dont know what id do without this CD"},{"rating":"1","title":"A real disappointment","review":"With material as rich as Jeckyl and Hyde, this was a real disappointment. Saw the show in New York, and although the vocals were good, the songs were fair and the plot was mediocre. A previous review says that fans of Sweeny Todd will like this, but I am a BIG fan of Sweeney Todd and I thought this was not in the same class at all.

Just like those two giants, I can listen over and over to this CD. The story is almost completely told with song. The lyrics are thoughtful and the music is passionate. The two together have sent chills up my spine. I fell in love with this work based on the CD alone and found the reworked traveling Broadway production a let down by comparison."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE THIS CD!!!!","review":"This CD definitely beats everything I have ever heard! I saw the musical on Broadway and heard the other CD recordings and I was VERY dissapointed! This is the only TRUE Jekyll & Hyde recording, and it is by far the best thing I've ever heard! It's sinply amazing, and I have been hooked on it for months now (i.e. listening to it non-stop)!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow! The best J&H CD avaliable!","review":"I recently purchased this CD because the Australian released version only has about 45% of the songs that this one had. It is said that Anthony Warlow started the seperation [vocally] between Jekyll & Hyde, and the way he does it is amazing. Anthony Warlow is a very talented singer and his voice is perfect for this genre... if only he was on Broadway...The best songs that he does is 'This is the Moment', 'The World Has Gone Insane' and 'Confrontation'. Of course the rest of the cast are fantastic. There are a few omitted songs taken out from the broadway version of Jekyll & Hyde, and I strongly suggest purchasing this CD to listen to 'long lost' tracks from the off broadway show."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greater Understanding","review":"The bible is packed full of people who experienced God speaking through dreams. God is the same yesterday, today and forever right? So He still speaks to people through dreams.

It is something that I feel if you are a person whom God gives a lot of dreams too, that this would should be part of your tool along with the Bible to understand God's destiny and plan for your life.

But on 3 occasions I had dreams, of which 2 of them were a warning of what was happening at that time. I was searching for an answer to my recent third dream and a friend passed this book to me.This book covers on the possible interpretations of colors, animals, places and numbers in dreams, without giving any contextual or environmental contents or conditions. After reading through this book, I felt each of us has to interpret the symbols in our dreams in the right context. And the interpretation of symbols given by this book may or may not be valid to your dream. So be forewarned to merely use this for references. Eventually, you have to pray and let the Holy Spirit guide you in your interpretation of your dreams.The giver of the dreams holds the key to the messages behind the dreams you dream."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Limited","review":"Very disappointed with this book. It was very limited in its scope, as well as the symbols listed. The book simply left me with the view that more thorough information could have been provided. The list of symbols was very incomplete, and the extremely short explanations (many of them one worded) left too many possibilities. There are many other books that are much better and more thorough in helping understand dreams. This one did not satisfy me, at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"A must have for any dreamer, there are two books I recommend them both but if you can only get one get this one and the other later....must have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Offers Very Limited information","review":"Was looking for a book that would be an easy and somewhat comprehensive reference to biblical dream symbolism. Upon looking thru the book I found that (in my opinion) the information offered in this book has a very narrow and limited perspective as to the biblical symbolism in dreams. Had I not taken a dream interpretation class taught by John Paul Jackson, a respected dream interpreter of the day, I would have accepted this book as having a more comprehensive viewpoint, but it does not. Bottom line is that the information provided is very much \\"in the box\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointed","review":"I purchased this book because I had the same recurring dream.

This one was no exception."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing new","review":"This book had the potential to contribute to the anemic information on this fascinating early modernist architect. Instead it repackages projects and information readily available through other sources. The analysis of Schindler's work seems to border on cheerleading, rather than presenting a crticial dialogue about his ideas and built work. Check out Sarnitz's 1988 book (if you can find it) for a more intersting read on the work of Schindler. If this book aspires to the coffee table variety - which it seems to - it could have been more like Lamprecht's excellent ouvre on Richard Neutra, which is more scholarly and comprehensive. The one star received is for Mumford's beautiful photographs, which save the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A soundtrack better than the movie","review":"I saw the movie in the theaters and grimaced throughout, but found the music continued to meet my expectations of what Batman should invoke, and so I had to get this CD. Unlike the film itself, this project was well executed and gave much more of an emotional connection.There is a little bit of rock, punk and R&B on here to appeal to a wide variety of consumers---or somebody with one very ecclectic palate--so even if you were soured by the single overplay from this album do not let it stop you from going out to get this treasure."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Collection of Under-appreciated Music","review":"I don't think this CD was very popular when it came out back in '95, but now some of the artists on here are no longer \\"no-names\\" - case in point, the Flaming Lips have rocketed in popularity since the release of Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots (which I suggest you pick up if you like the song on here) and Massive Attack has grown more popular I think (pick up their album Mezzanine for some really good trip-hop).The U2 track and the Seal track are both classics, Nick Cave is awesome (his album No More Shall We Part is excellent - another good buy) and the rest of the album make this better than the average soundtrack.It's not spectacular, but if you want a sampling of good groups to get into, give it a try."},{"rating":"1","title":"you've got to be kidding me","review":"Three decent tracks, that's it.

Of course there is Seal's lovely 'Kiss From a Rose', and the best songs on this soundtrack are Massive Attack and Tracey Thorn's fabulous 'The Hunter Gets Captured by the Game', Mazzy Star's 'Tell Me Now', The Devlins' 'Crossing the River', and the goofy-funny 'Bad Days' by The Flaming Lips. Not the best soundtrack I've heard, but there are certainly some great tracks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Music","review":"I can not express how great the music is. The compilation of the music is amazing. Along with a great song by Michael Hutchence called The Passenger makes one inclined to want more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great variety - I never tire of this one","review":"Ooooh, what a lovely mix of songs. When I first got this, right after the movie came out, I was a foolish little girl and only listened to the first half of the CD. Literally. I turned it off after \\"Tell Me Now\\". Then, a few months ago, cleaning out my CD collection, I put this on and let it play all the way through. Thus, I rediscovered a gem of a CD. It has beautiful ballads like Kiss From a Rose, Nobody Lives Without Love (one of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard), and Crossing the River. And then you've got some nice bad-a$$ rock - There Is A Light, The Passenger, Hold me..., The Riddler... Ah, the list goes on. Great CD, whatever your mood is. Unknown artists that I'd love to hear more from."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Holy good soundtrack Batman!\\"","review":"I can safely say that the first 7 tracks on here are excellent. After that, not bad. Obviously the U2 and Seal songs are the big ones, but the tracks from Mazzy Star and Flaming Lips are good too, as are most of the rest. I've never heard of Eddi Reader before, but that song is beautiful. I actually like the Brandy song too, and a cool solo song from Michael Hutchence of INXS. At least this soundtrack isn't all Prince, though I do like him. Now lets see if Batman Begins is gonna be any good, with Christian Bale."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this CD!!!!!!","review":"\\"Kiss From A Rose\\" by Seal is one of the best songs ever written, it is wonderful and totally worth buying this CD!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Eddie Reader is WONDERFUL on a sucko album","review":"The U2 song was the first one I deleted from the Ipod so I have no clue what the praise in the good reviews are about. However, after enduring all the songs on the album, I gained awareness of Eddie Reader formerly of Fairground Attraction. \\"Nobody Lives Without Love\\" is a perfect song to me. Crossing The River by The Devlins is the other enjoyable song on this soundtrack album. You shouldn't have to try to like a song just because there is a carcaphony of praise for it. I don't CARE if there are big names and cool indies playing on this album. I think their songs are all awful."},{"rating":"2","title":"One album to be proud of in my collection","review":"This is a pretty solid album with a lot of interesting songs and sounds.

He is to be commended for bravely putting forth his new framework so well.

This author has potential."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heroine is unlikable, romance is implausible","review":"I'm not hard to please when it comes to reading. I really expected to find this as another guilty pleasure. I love tough heroines and unique romance! However, I was disappointed by how unlikeable the heroine was. She wasn't supposed to yell because of her powers as a necromancer, but most of the book, that's exactly what she was doing. She was always full of acid and when she was nice, it didn't really make sense. The competing romances were also disappointing. This book made me feel like the author was actively hating men while writing it. She couldn't appreciate men for anything other than their muscles. I was quite disappointed. If I want to get away from the depressing aspects of life, I don't want to read a book where the main character is so depressing. Interesting world, unlikable characters.

The characters just never came alive for me - they postured and went through the motions like puppets, rather than representations of real people."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 +++","review":"I was really kinda skittish at first about this book, maybe it was the title, but in the end, I had tears in my eyes.

Patricia Briggs especially tells a great story. Because of them, I decided to give Working for the Devil a read.The main character, Dante is a real very hard to like. She lives in the future where things seem to be vastly different. The author tells the story in a confusing way. She seems to bring in new ideas as they come into her head.

It is a great break from vampires and werewolves. This is one of the better paranormal books I have gotten my hands on.

It made for a very entertaining story.It took on a new view of the religious side, if you can call it that. It mixes quite a few Gods from different parts of the world. It was interesting.

Rembering how much I liked my previous pair of H2Optix, I decided to buy 3 pairs of these - so'd I always have a spare in case (when) I lost or broke one.The lenses on these sunglasses are excellent, just as on my previous pair. They totally eliminate glare and allow your eyes to relax. However, the frames are quite flimsy and with even the slightest torque, the lenses pop out of the grooves on the sides of the eyepiece.

Searing solos, bouncing feedback, a rhythm section that will tear your heart out: this has it all. It makes you sad thinking that this group of individuals may never record again. Steve Wynn's solo stuff is OK, but this document is an essential part of any true understanding of american popular music. Most of the songs come from either \\"Days of Wine and Roses\\" or \\"Medicine Show\\" and the sonic assult of \\"Halloween\\" is quite possibly the best redition EVER. I can't recommend this enough.

I also have no disagreement with the critical aspects of the Library Journal review. In my workshops on storytelling I tell participants that I have never seen a story written by a psychologist that was any good. In my defense, though, I would point out that the short stories from the Butterberry Hill program were meant to be retold (not read) and paraphrased by the teller. In a revision I'd probably leave them out. If you are interested in the social development of children, take a look at \\"The Peaceful Classroom: 162 Easy Activities to Teach Preschoolers Compassion and Cooperation\\" listed here at Amazon. That book has been translated into five languages and is still in print. Another book on the origins of courage in children will be published in the fall of 2004."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is awful!!!","review":"Regina Carter, You are so beautifully talented!!

It reduces huge epic stories, most originally composed in poetic form, to brief prose tales. Goodrich's word choices are poor, as are her deciions about which selections to \\"keep\\" and which ones to delete. Even seemingly small changes cause students problems in years to come. For instance, instead of using the standard English name for the great Frankish king (it is a translation, after all), that is Charlemagne, she translates the name awkwardly as \\"Carlemagne.\\" Similarly, Roland is \\"Rollanz,\\" Gueres is \\"Guenes,\\" etc. These odd spelling choices make research difficult for students. Unfortunately, this book is completely worthless, and may even do damage if people read it and learn to hate medieval literature."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is overrated.","review":"Even though there were some interesting points in this book, it really just put me to sleep. Overall, this book is boring, and I couldn't even finish it. I'm sure there are some more interesting books about medieval myths that I would suggest people read. I gave this book a 2 star because 1 star means that I through it away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre Book on Medieval Myths","review":"This book was the only text used in my Medievial Myth class, and while I was at first very excited to read this compilation it soon became a burden. Goodrich has lofty aims - to bring the origional texts to the reader in her own way with a minimum of abridgement and interference. Unfortuntally the text through the whole book is just confusing. The stroy of Peredur, a distant begening of the Aurthur Legends, is so disjointed as to be unreadable. Stories are also in modern language and story form, so although Beowulf was originally a poem, it is not in this translation. It was very dissapointing to have such high hopes for a valid littery work only to be left confused by the translated text. A better work is H.A. Guerber's Middle Ages from the Myths and Legends Collection. At least that work mixes coherent modern story with noted original translation to bring home the point."},{"rating":"1","title":"Product Never Received","review":"I was not pleased from the start, when I ordered the product I was immediately sent a response that the product was shipped via USPS without a tracking code, and to expect delivery within 23 days. No where in America should product shipment take 23 days, even at the least expensive mailing method. This was required summer reading for school, and this meant that delivery would be the same as the first day of school. The book was never received. The seller refunded my money on request, but did not apologize, they stated it was shipped. It still has never been received. I do not believe that it was shipped. I will not try to buy a used book online again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing to crow about","review":"My jams were very runny when using this. Not only runny, but the fruit & liquid seperated!

Forget having a sandwich at work! I needed a fork for the soppy mess!

And I've also long been a fan of emo rock like Death Cab for Cutie, Wilco, and Belle and Sebastian. Now mix the two in in a strikingly beautiful album, and you have Dntel's \\"Life Is Full of Possibilities.\\" I came upon the album about 3 months ago after seeing a reference to \\"(This is) The Dream of Evan and Chan\\" in a Death Cab review on Pitchfork. I checked out the album and fell in love. Sometimes the shrill tones in techno can get on my nerves, but the sweeping tones and emotion-driven chirps are nothing short of amazing. Then you layer on some big name vocalists and what results is sheer delight. I highly recommend this album, as well as The Postal Service's \\"Give Up\\" album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great cheese, but maybe order it in the fall","review":"The only reason this doesn't have 5 stars, is it arrived in an almost liquid state.

The recipes are easy-to-follow, first of all. I learned how to follow recipes by using this book with my mother.One of my first-ever on-my-own cooking experiences came from this book, the orange chicken. I'm still alive and well-fed, and everyone loved that meal. So the book works.When I hosted my first dinner party a couple weeks ago, a Thanksgiving feast, no less, this book taught me easy ways to do EVERYTHING required.

I have loved it and used it as my go-to cookbook for 22 years..I noticed the new version had lots of newer, more modern takes on various dishes as well as nutritional info (very helpful!) - but alas, the recipes were overall a disappointment. Simple recipes were over-complicated, more challenging dishes used too many processed ingredients. I was underwhelmed. Fortunately, I still have my old copy.

I like the variety of not only American, but also international recipes found in it. Anything I've made has turned out delicious. The steps are explained very clearly for anyone who's not an expert in the kitchen. Another feature which I like living abroad is the fact that there is a metric conversion chart. There is also a section which gives advice on substituting certain major ingredients, which may not be easily found abroad, or for emergency situations when you can't run out to the store."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better Homes and Gardens New Cook Book/Ringbound","review":"The best for me, Linda, the non-cooker!

Even the most basic dishes are loaded with fat: the waffle recipe calls for half a cup of oil -- 115 grams of fat or 1000 calories right there!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Average recipe book","review":"It has a lot of recipes in it but without pictures it's hard to tempt the chef into trying them..not to mention some recipes can be complex and a photo really assists the inexperienced baker (like myself).After buying this I really regretted the decision and should have gone with a picture book instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Measurements","review":"I think this cookbook is awful. Last weekend, I tried to make the spinach quiche recipe. It called for 1 pastry crust and a mixture of bacon, cheese, spinach and 8 eggs! I thought 8 eggs sounded like a lot for 1 pie crust, so I used 7. But, I still had twice as much filling as I needed. So after I had already cleaned-up the pastry making mess, I had to start all over making another pie crust. My only other choice was to waste the other half of the filling. You would think that when people write a cookbook they would make sure the amount of filling in a recipe will fit in the amount of crust they tell you to make."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Kitchen Staple","review":"i like that there are tons of recipes that are low fat (or can easily be converted to low fat). there's a nice array of different styles so that i can expand my abilities. the recipes are written in an easy to understand way, and are not overly ornate with directions or ingredients.the only thing i, personally, didn't like is the quite high proportion of sweet cooking. i'm not one for candy making, desserts, pies, and the like. i'm more interested in getting supper on the table."},{"rating":"1","title":"not like the classic","review":"I am disappointed in this cookbook. I have a hardbound copy that has fallen apart and only wanted to replace it. The format is strange, a number of my favorite recipes are not in this 'newer' edition.

While it appears to be a good basic cookbook, Betty Crocker and Good Housekeeping each have their own basics which are far superior in my experience. Many of the recipes I tried in this book, such as banana bread, had errors in measurement for ingredients. Other just tasted awful, such as the devil's food cake, which with the suggested frosting is now the primary reason I can't stomach chocolate. I have been cooking since I was about 8, so for about 14 years, and have enough experience to catch some mistakes or modify seasonings, time, temperature. However, a less experienced cook may find this book frustrating. Additionally, I have never been fond of this series of cookbooks which requires you to assemble it yourself (three ring binder) and is more prone to pages wearing out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Thought","review":"I was excited to get my cookbook today.

In other words, they are garbage.The only people who he writes \\"dirt\\" about are dead and unavailable to defend themselves. The rest of the time he trashes Mary Wilson. Why? Because he's a disgruntled former employee who was fired by Mary years ago. It's not worth your time, or your money.By the way, Tony was sued over this book by the big man at Motown himself. Tony lost. That's why this book is out of print and will probably never come back. But if you're looking for a good read, this is NOT it. Don't waste your time. If you think its a collectible, its not, you can have my copy for free, I don't want it.Bottom line: Read the autobiographies of Otis Williams, Mary Wilson, Berry Gordy and the many other reat Motown books out there.

I believe he has exploited them just as he said Berry Gordy did. He sounds and I believe is very bitchy and vindictive. I have also read Otis Williams' book, The Tempations in which he did not trash anyone as Mr. Turner has and is far more classy. I think Mr. Turner should stick to selling real estate or whatever it is he does. I think it's pathetic what some people will do to make money. Mr. Turner should be ashamed of himself, but somehow I don't think he is. Why didn't he pay for David Ruffin's funeral?

The video is fine (Curt Gowdy & Don Meredith) and the fades to and from commercials are much better than previous releases, but the NFL still refuses to put out complete games. This particular game has roughly 14 plays missing from it (I lost count).One of the trickiest edits they put in was with 5:40 left in the game, the Vikings brought in their backup QB, Bob Lee. They showed Lee throwing a pass, then cut to the sidelines, then they showed Lee throwing another pass. The problem is that the second pass came with less than 2 minutes remaining in the game. They cut out about 3.5 minutes of game time in between the two passes, which included an entire series by the Raiders. Obviously, they tried to make this unnoticeable. Give me a break!If Major League Baseball can release full games that take up over 2 hours, why can't the NFL?

It covers all your basic repairs and complex installation jobs as well. This was the best book I found for the beginner (and I looked at a lot). I wouldn't recommend using this book as your only resource if your going to tackle a complex job.

In my case also within 5 or 6 months, and only on the right side. I tried Krazy gluing it back together but that was in vain because it just broke again after a few days. So then I used packing tape and that works for now but the right side doesn't fit quite as snugly against my ear as the left one does, though it still sounds fine enough. At least I got them on sale but they still should've been made of stronger plastic. Unfortunately, these are all that I'll have for now till I can get another, better pair. I've been looking at several Sonys mostly.Anyway, my advice is to avoid getting these headphones.

More liberal or just plain different approaches to understanding the bible exist, but they aren't really even offered a mention in this book.

The only shortfall is the speaker volume may not be loud enough for some people, the recorders not ment for casual listening of music. In a work environment like in the office its volume is fine but out at the park or beach you will be disapointed. I do not believe any recording device as small and light as this one is loud enough for use at the beach or a park but hook it up to some external speakiers and its just like an IPod.

It lasted for about 40-50 hours of recording - this is my first recorder, so I'm not sure if that's a good amount of time for the batteries to last. It would have been nice if the recorder was designed to recharge rather than requiring new batteries. That way, if I were in class with my laptop and the recorder was dying, I would be able to plug it into my computer and continue using it, which is not possible with the current design.

It is also easy to navigate to former tracks with one click. I generally listen to the lesson with headphones and have not yet downloaded to my PC, but looks easy.

The only issue that I had was that if you delete the files from the recorder without using the interface, it will think the data is still there and takes up space.

I tried putting it in a case, in the side pocket of my bag, in the inside pocket of my purse...still turns on by itself and sometimes actually begins playing recordings all by itself.

It combines better than other CDs the best, the best known, and the most representative sampling of their work. Its only drawback -- and some might not consider it so much a drawback but as an example of how broadly representative this sampling is -- is that it includes a few selections from the two sextets formed after the Nazis forced the separation of the three Aryan from the three Jewish members, and neither group was anywhere near as good as the original."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product...","review":"Very good cocktail spoon.

It was a socking stuffer for our 2 year old who loves to color with crayons and markers. It takes FOREVER for the color to show after he's colored. At least 30 seconds, sometimes longer. That may not seem long, but for a toddler thats an infinity. He's long since moved on by then to coloring another area or gotten frustrated \\"its not working mommy!\\". We have a new baby coming next month and I was hoping for a coloring kit that I wouldn't have to be as hands on with. This is the perfect idea since it really does only work on the special paper and there's no chance of him destroying his clothes or the furniture, but delayed gratification is just not something a toddler gets very well.

In fact, the entire album is great.

Not trying to be sappy, I can't help feeling the song is telling us that no matter how bad things seem, or how bleak the world can be, having one person who loves you, and is loved by you, can provide shelter and calm, and help maintain sanity.

Although some of the info is true, the majority of it reads like he ripped it from the headlines of grocery store tabloids. The Mandrells are a strong family, who has certainly seen their share of heartache with failed marriages and Barbara's accident, but they remain true to their roots and supportive of each other.

The gameplay has also been improved. Finally, Samus can grab onto ledges and roll into tight spaces from this position. Gone, however, is the multiple bomb blast jump. Also, for those who liked to skip ahead, the game is surprisingly linear.

Excellent.<Gameplay> 3/5 Sometimes youll find yourself beting the game in under 2 hours (i did). and it so fast and the story line isnt that great but it leads to some cool action"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good game but short comming In @ 5 hrs & DEFINITLY not worth $80","review":"Just wanting to put It out there that this game,just like every other Metroid game ever, IS good...but this game Is VERY short & NOT worth the $[...] that the current seller is selling this for.The reason I'm giving this game such low stars is because of the length."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse Metroid Game yet","review":"I Have played many metroid titles and this one is the worse i love metroid but this onw sucked this game is harder than metroid prime i am stuck on a boss called shadow When you kill a boss it has a second VERY powerful form if you kill it you need the kill the x that controls it! THE BOSSES ARE VERY hard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring side scroller","review":"Metroid Fusion is a classic 2D side scroller adventure. You walk around a maze and jump up and down to complete each objective, on the way blasting away aliens/mutants/ugly videogame characters. I appreciate its ease of controls vs. Castlevania, the latter requiring you to press all the buttons at the same time. The graphics is also among the best I've seen, and finally visible on the sidelit screen of the SP. But games like this are pretty boring after a few minutes, and if you are good you can beat it in a couple hours, with little replay value. Try renting first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pbbbbbt","review":"Instead of writing a full review [i dont think it is worth the time] i will give you some words that describe the game.DumbSlowEasyShortCornyStupidUnoriginalIn other words while at [a local store] for 2 hours i was able to complete the entire game. In my words, \\"go get a real game\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Game!!","review":"I have played every version of Metroid and considering that this is for the gameboy it is an excellent game. It's slightly linear though because you are given missions and cannot really go anywhere else other then finishing the current mission then going to get a new one. It is still an awesome and challenging game. I would highly recommend this game as one of the best on Gameboy Advance. And if you didn't get enough of Metroid through Metroid Fusion and Metroid prime, through the Game boy connecting cable you can play the original Metroid for NES on the Gamecube after you beat Metroid Fusion. Gimmicky? Yes. But it's still a great incentive to get both."},{"rating":"2","title":"IT'S THE BEST","review":"This game is great!!!There are some very hard spots that make it difficult but it's good because it makes you think.It's an action packed game that keeps you playing.once you start it is difficult to stop. it is an exelent game you should buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"great game","review":"This is an action packed adventure game. The game can get pretty frustrating there are tons of secret pssages you need to find in order to beat the game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Make it Longer","review":"Too easy, I would reccomend buying, but keep in mind that this game will give you alot of frusturation(did I spell that right?)I was able to beat Metroid Fusion in a day, but I have gone back, again and again to get Samus w/her clothes off(under 2 hours and 100% items)Weell worth it, for that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Metroid Fusion Rules The GBA","review":"Metroid Fusion is a great game that is the forth in the series. It comes after Metroid(NES), Metroid Prime(GC), Metroid II: Return Of Samus(GB), Super Metroid(SNES), Metroid Fusion(GBA)! Metroid Prime is not included in the official count. Metroid Fusion includes a great storyline a lot of 2-D action that is famous with the Metroid Series. Great Game I highly recomend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Luanne Fogarty!","review":"I enjoy all of Glynn Marsh Alam's books since my mom introduced me to them. I'm so glad they are available on Kindle! Love the characters, especially the main character, the Florida Swamps and sinkholes! I can see some of my relatives and their pals in her characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"great depiction of North Florida","review":"4th in the Luanne Fogarty series, which take place in the northern, swampy areas of Florida. Luanne is an assistant professor in linguistics at the nearby University, but she supplements her living by diving for the sheriff's department in the rivers and caves that penetrate North Florida. Luanne prefers her privacy, like most of the denizens of the swampy area. The mystery begins with the disappearance of a teenage boy whose family is influential in the area. The authorities are searching the river for the boy when they happen upon an old boat - with a skeleton. Suddenly they are working on more than one case. Luanne is trying to deal with her lover from the sheriff's office while at the same time trying to help her former lover recover from a diving accident, which is causing a little bit of tension. Add into the mix a crazy naked lady appearing haphazardly in different parts of the swamp, and you have an intriguing, descriptive mystery to enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Read!","review":"This was another great book by Glynn Marsh Alam. She definaley knows how to create a atmosphere that is true to the swamps and rivers of Florida. Once you pick this book up, you won't be able to put it down until you find out \\"who done it\\". I actually stayed up until 4 a.m. a few nights because I was so wrapped up in the plot."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Lovely, Refreshing Manga","review":"Aria volume 2 improves upon the story from volume 1. After reading this one, I became hooked on the series. Akari, in all her cuteness, leads her friends in the little adventures life throws at them. It's beautifully drawn, and the stories left me with a positive feeling; here are characters who do what they feel is right, without debating themselves about it, while facing interesting normal life situations and interpersonal relationships on a special and magical planet. It is very sweet. Aria proves that it is possible to be entertained without major violence or drama. Something we could use a little more of."},{"rating":"1","title":"No plot, no adeventure , no nothin!","review":"This book has excallent art and fun charaters but my point is there is no plot no adventure or anthing! This story is about a girl named Akira who is sixteen but ats like she is seven. What I mean is she's like \\"yeah Mr.Snowbug!\\" and acts like a child. If the story was about Akia (Akira's best friend)the story would be alot better because she acts her age and is a really fun charater. What What is really sad is every chapater is about something Akira did that was special to her but the stuff was like metting a snow bug or in the first book washing a gondala. *snore* And Akari is baby-ish as ever. I can't really say the book is terrile because some people like these type of books but books I recamend are Tokyo mew mew, Rayearth and Pretear because they actullaly do something!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for Skyping","review":"This works just fine for Skype.The mic works well, the earpiece is fine.All that needed to be done was plug it in.If you don't need to spend big hours in conversation, this is well worththe price.Nothing fancy.

I had to return the item at my expense and re-order another and pay shipping again.I returned the item, paid for the return shipping and did not order another.Now I am out shipping from and to the supplier and have no headset.I am very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"The writer of this book is not a \\"fan\\" of the Rev. Dr. Dabney. I'd politely suggest instead that Thomas Cary Johnson's biography, \\"Life and Letters of Robert Lewis Dabney,\\" be read.

By day, he works on a Capitol Hill committee involved with rail transportation, and by night (with Ben Bailes) he makes ambient techno based on trains, railway stations and movement along the tracks. Chessie's interpretation of its obsession is more suggestive than literal, making for an immersive composition that still holds up apart from its concept."},{"rating":"2","title":"last track","review":"the last track has a short bit of dialog in german, otherwise it is as described below. if you know german it is quite interesting. one of the members of mouse on mars describes what he believes consciousness is, using \\"die innere orange\\" (\\"the inner orange\\") as a metaphor. using his definition of something through which we make \\"sense\\" of our senses and experience the world, the first several minutes of near-blank white noise contrasts wonderfully with the last few containing something like beautiful music so distorted and garbled that it is nearly unrecognizable as such."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tiki Bar Electronica","review":"As a rule, I'm not a huge fan of either Polynesian-derived exotica nor the bleepy electronica practiced by Mouse on Mars on other albums. More rhythmic than most electronica, and more varied than most exotica, \\"Iaora Tahiti\\" far exceeds the sum of its parts. I can't image better background music for the post-modern Tiki Bar."},{"rating":"2","title":"SO HAPPY TO HEAR AGAIN. . .","review":"It is so good to hear this music again. I had been searching for the \\"Let us go into the house of the Lord\\" album on cd, but was unable to find it. It wasn't until I read D.V. Lindner's outstanding review that I saw it was available under a different name. Thank you so much, D.V. Lindner. I didn't realize it at the time, but listening to this music during my teen and young adult years helped me to keep my mind on the Lord and helped me to keep my mind pure and holy. I wonder if Edwin Hawkins knew, nearly 40 years ago, that the music he produced would change the world and bless millions. I feel we owe him a tremendous debt of gratitude. Thank you, Edwin Hawkins, for letting the Lord minister through you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Black Choral Gospel at it's rawest power","review":"This CD will remind you of an actual service on Sunday morning in a Black church with a strong youth choir. You can almost see the sisters with their elaborate hats and little girls with Shirley-Temple curls when you listen to this one. This was recorded live at the Ephisian Church of God in Christ in Berkely, Ca. in June of 1968 on an old-fashioned Ampex recorder. The record company bought the tape as is and thus this album/CD. Yes, crude technonolgy for the audiophiles, but that gives this a down-home feeling that's part of the charm. If you can listen to \\"Oh Happy Day\\", \\"In My Father's House,\\" I'm Coming Through\\" etc. and STILL be in a bad mood, then you REALLY have problems! Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Weeping may endure for a night, but Joy, Joy will Come!","review":"Most folks of Boomer age will instantly recognize \\"Oh Happy Day\\" as a popular radio tune.... Moving into the album from track one you get a rich, mellow piano intro and Choral blending of \\" Let us go into the House of the Lord\\"... an instant balming wash of goodness... turn it Up! A couple of fast clappin' numbers later you are at My Favorite... \\"Joy, Joy\\"... If you are looking for some Godly assistance, this tune is a magical blessing you should take a moment to enjoy. I get teary-eyed just thinking of how much you and I need this kind of music in our lives. We keep it on the Disk carousel all the time at our house... Send one to your friends in need."},{"rating":"1","title":"sorry","review":"I am sorry I paid so much for an album that had so little.

The result is a piece worthy of scholarly recognition, yet accessible to everyone. A true rarity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Manual labor at its best","review":"Using the wood splitter is work, however, it does the job and is better than trying to split wood with a splitting axe.

Instead, we were sent a \\"Super4rce\\" Chinese-made unit with questionable welds, unhardened steel and a hydraulic pump that malfunctioned after the first few logs.After fixing the hydraulic ram we were able to split several very hefty maple rounds with no trouble at all. As we continue to operate this splitter in the future we will always wonder if it will work hydraulically. We'll also be concerned that the soft-metal construction so typical of Chinese tools will become compromised and bend. And we'll watch the welds to see if they crack or disintegrate.The splitter is a GREAT idea! It just needs USA grade construction -- and a larger splitting wedge as well.Time will tell if this was a smart purchase.

The authors manage to turn what should be a 5-page magazine article into 125 pages through the use of generous font-sizes, spacing and margins.The text truly has no redeeming qualities. Definitions and characteristics of nine personality types are reasonably clear, but information/techniques on identifying which type you are (or your coworkers) is totally absent. Strategies for managing interrelationships are left out, except for a comment that \\"understanding types and managing relationships is important.\\" Duh.The lack of accolades on the back cover further should remind one that this book is best avoided.

Sorry, but this series is just horrible! While the sound words are fun, what those books seem to reinforce and deem acceptable is misbehavior, which is not appropriate. After having read this particular book, my 2 year old son thought it was okay to slam the cabinet doors, answer with a moody \\"What?\\" when called, bang the spoon on the table, throw the spoon through the air, and pull down the tablecloth (just to mention a few).
