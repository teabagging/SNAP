I try to get in 30 minutes at least 2-3 times a week rather it is walking, doing the elliptical, or just doing some cardio. I would say that I am in average shape but I could stand to lose 5-10 pounds.To say that this DVD KICKED my butt is an understatement! Level 1 was a struggle for me. I think I need a level -1. It was almost discouraging for me!! However, if you can stay focused and do what you can, it will pay off. It really is a great workout and you can definitely feel the difference. My legs were sore for 2 days after my workout!I'm not a big Jillian Michaels fan, in fact, I find her sort of annoying! But let me assure you she will push you in this video and you will get a good workout!If you want a good workout that will truly give you a feeling of an accomplishment this is your DVD!! Just stick with it and start shredding :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very effective!","review":"My first day of doing this dvd I weighed 227 lbs. For a 25 year old, 5'8\\" female, that is pretty horrible. Fast forward 12 weeks and I now weigh 190. I love this dvd! The workout is tough and you will feel it, but it's a good burn that lets you know that you're accomplishing something. I don't rely solely on this dvd, I've also taken up running and I have myself on a strict 1200 calorie a day diet, but this dvd is definitely what gave me the motivation to change my lifestyle. I highly recommend it for anyone looking to make a positive and healthy change in their life.Also, even better than the weight loss is the change in clothing size! My favorite store to shop at is The Limited; I've gone from an XL top and size 16 pant to a M top and size 10 pant. Just did some shopping as a little reward for myself! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Its what you make of it...","review":"I bought this dvd because I was \\"skinny fat\\" with the pooch on the tummy and all. I could barely get thru level 1. Im now doing my 3rd round of this dvd and if you commit to doing 20 minutes of this 5 days a week, you will see results. Add clean eating and an additional session of cardio a day, the results are amazing. Im now spoiled cause I refuse to do a 1 hour fitness dvd when I can get the same results with a 20 minute workout. This dvd is priceless!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beginner -- Very Powerful Workout - Can feel it working!","review":"I am a beginner in exercising...so I promised myself to wake-up and do this every day this week; I started on Monday and was not able to do this workout again until this morning(Friday)because my entire body was aching!!! ---that was just from LEVEL 1This is unlike any other workout dvd I have tried....I can feel it working (and especially in the following days you'll feel it) I hope to be able to wake up EVERY morning and do it....because in no time...I'll be thin!Thanks Jillian!!P.S.

She's bad to the bone and you feel like she's right there with you---making sure you don't give up! I truly can't wait to get to the next level!!!I have really bad knees and I'm jumping, kicking and squatting and my knees are getting stronger and stronger!I may not be seeing the weight drop as I only need about 20 pounds to reach my goal but I see the inches dropping and the muscles coming.This is a Sweaty Butt Kicking DVD!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Jillian","review":"This is like having Jillian in your livingroom.

Highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shred","review":"Really, liked the video. It was a major challenge at first. However, hurt my knee from doing all of the jumping jacks. this video is high impact and I would not recommend it for anyone with any past knee injuries. Jillian is a great trainer and does not make you feel stupid, as some do. The workout was great, but annoying that you can't fast forward straight to the video, it makes you watch some ads."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a work out!","review":"This is a really good workout video. If you are pressed for time and want a good work out, get this DVD you will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"No weight loss yet, but...","review":"No weight loss yet, but that's not Jillian's fault. I haven't been able to do it every day yet, since I have two babies in the house and we've all gotten sick. The workout itself is fantastic - doable, yet makes you feel like you're gonna die, just the same. I did do the workout consistently for about a week, and was noticing my abs looking smaller/tighter - only then everyone got sick, and I had to stop. Will pick it up again as soon as we're all healthy again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad for the Knees!","review":"I did this workout religiously in the for 4-5 days a week. I consider myself to be in very good shape and regularly exercise but thought I would give this video a try since my schedule was compressed and I had less time to workout. Needless to say after 2-3 months I have strained one knee and tore a ligament in the other. This video does not allow for muscle recovery time and is too fast of a pace to properly do the lunges, squats, etc. Not to mention my thighs bulked up which wasn't quite the physique I was after. I am back to doing power walking, pilates, yoga and my own version of calisthenics. Yet my knees still aren't the same 6 months later but least I have slimmed down without the bulk. Not worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard","review":"This workout is very intense, Its quick but hard. As a woman of 50 years old its difficult, after doing it several times in row it does get easier and goes by quick."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jillian is a BEAST!","review":"You really get more than your monies worth out of this video.

Totally lived up to my expectations and then some."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great buy","review":"I found the 20 minute work outs to be very effective and challenging in the beginning, but if you are looking for the quick sweat and a good burn, this is a perfect choice. However, I would not reccomend for beginners."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Workout!","review":"This is my first Jillian Michaels workout. I don't watch her on TV, so I bought this dvd solely based on the glowing reviews. Sure, I've seen routines with better cueing, better music, better dvd chaptering,...etc., but I have gotten RESULTS (which is what I'm looking for) after only three workouts on level one. I am seeing more muscle definition and have lost about an inch already, and the other routines are longer, to attain similar results. Also, there is no dread factor with this one; I figure I can keep up with just about any trainer for less than 30 minutes. For the price, it's a good investment in my health and fitness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great workout! Try Jillian's other DVD...","review":"Loved this DVD! This is a great workout, and even as a fitness trainer, Level 1 got me to sweat. I did notice that some of the same exercises are repeated in levels 1, 2, and 3. If you want the \\"Level 4\\" version of this workout, buy Jillian's \\"Banish Fat, Boost Metabolism\\" DVD instead, and especially if you are already an intermediate/advanced exerciser, skip this one altogether and go for Banish Fat. I'm glad I bought that one instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my favorite","review":"This dvd has three 20 minute workouts with each getting more difficult. It reminded me of elementary school gym class. The exercises are hard and it does give a good workout. It is easy to follow with uncomplicated movements. I just think it's really boring. I did it twice. My daughter is 16 and loves it, so it was not a waste of money. This dvd would be good for people that hate working out and want to spend very little time on exercise."},{"rating":"1","title":"This should be banned!","review":"I was trained by professional athletes, and almost everything they said NOT to do, Jillian does!!! This video is full of exercises to tear ligaments, destroy the back, and guarantee you'll be seeing a doctor eventually...maybe for life!This is one of the worst trainers I've ever seen! Seriously, it should be banned for completely wrong forms and routines that WILL injure people, as it has according to the60 complaints I've read from people who've used this video who WERE in great physical shape before doing this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick Workout With Big Results","review":"I've had this DVD for going on three weeks. I've done Level 1 and Level 2. I like it a lot, but for one thing. In both segments, she cusses. I mean, really? I have to listen to this everytime I work out. For me, it's enough to be irritating since I don't swear.It is an intense quick workout and it really makes my fat cry (sweat). I noticed the difference in my stamina after the first week. I was able to do a lot more of the exercises and work my way up to some of the nonmodified exercises.For beginners, there are modifications. The stronger you get, you can intensify the workouts. In reality, there are six workouts in the three levels, since you can do either the Beginner or the Advanced versions.I would recommend this workout, but Miss Jillian needs to chomp on a bar of soap before she does her next video. :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great and challenging!","review":"Great workout and challenging! In less than half hour you know you got a solid workout done. I just wish you could fast forward through the beginning. Listening to the same thing every day is not necessary. Also, a workout plan should be laid in more detail, ie does this need to be done everyday? Work through soreness? If I want to continue after the 30 days, when are good rest days?"},{"rating":"2","title":"great, quick workout","review":"This is a tough workout in a short time, with options to continue growing and improving"},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW It's tough!","review":"This is my first workout DVD. The other reviews were right when they said that it wasn't easy. I knew I was out of shape but I thought that I could last longer than 10 mins the first time. Boy, I was wrong. I did last 20 mins. the second time. I am not going to give up. I am getting married in May & I am going to keep at it. Wish me luck (I think I may need it)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gym Substitute","review":"I usually go to the gym for about 45-60 minutes of cardio daily, and 30 minutes of weight lifting on alternating days. I went to visit my mom for Thanksgiving and replaced my usual workouts with this and was actually sore. This is a great short workout (about 25 mintues), although the stretch at the end is much too short."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"I just finished my first workout with this dvd and wow! I work out once a week in an advanced yoga class with lots of plank holds, push ups, and lung type exercises and thought this dvd would be easy/medium for me. Boy, was I wrong. I just did the first class a few hours ago and my arms are sore already. (I did just do another bootcamp video yesterday and I am sore from that too.) Jillian kicked my butt and I'm ready to go back for more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Butt Kickin'","review":"Think you're in shape? Run on a regular basis? Me too, until I hooked up with Jillian's 30 Day Shred. She kicked my butt! By the end of the level 2 workout I was so overheated I skipped out early and headed straight to the shower to cool off! I'm a Physical Education Teacher, and while Jillian let's a couple of colorful words fly preventing me from using this video in class, I can't think of a better 20 minute exercise routine! I'd recommend this over and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jillian","review":"Love the workout you get. I am only on the first of three stages, but love it. Just when you think you can't take anymore, she either gives you the words you need or it comes to an end. It's only 20 minutes, but you work it all. Highly recommended!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"No Nonsense Work Out","review":"This is a great video that is very challenging but doable. It took me a week and a half to complete a 20 minute workout from beginning to end but it feels great to know I am getting stronger. I do this first thing in the morning and I feel fantastic and energized afterwards. This is hard, but if you stick with it, even if you can't finish the routine, you will find yourself in much better shape. Also check out Jillian's Cardio Kick Box. I gave four stars because you can't fast forward the intro but I now start the video and use the extra couple of minute to warm up and get some water, you will need it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tough but awesome!","review":"Ok first off as bad as it may be I never write reviews on products so the fact that I am writing a review is a testament to how much this workout video meant to me. All of my life off and on I would get into a workout routine and then fall behind and then start again etc. I have done dvds from yoga, pilates and taebo and NEVER felt as good as I do after one of Jillian's workouts. I also own her boxed set of \\"the biggest winner\\" dvds (which I highly recommend as well). I often read about working out and the most effective ways to lose weight/exercise and all the stuff I read about Jillian does and recommends so I really feel like she is really good and knowledgable at what she does. I will never do another dvd that does not have her on it. I highly recommend all her products! In a world where laziness and instant gratification rule, she makes you get to work to earn your reward and you are the better for having done it. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great great workout","review":"I have never purchased a workout DVD before, so to be honest, I just stumbled upon this one, and I am so glad I did. This workout is incredibly challenging, but in only two weeks I am seeing real results. The downside to this DVD is that you have to listen to her 5 min narration at the beginning of each workout, so that gets a bit annoying and is totally unncessary. Also, I am not sure I would recommend this DVD to guys because the workouts seem geared towards women. The rest of the DVD is great. The level one is incredibly challenging, and I am soon to begin level 2, and that has me both excited and nervous. This was a great purchase, and I just recommended it to my girlfriend who is getting married in a few months...if she follows this, she will be wedding-ready in no time."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent","review":"THIS WORKOUT IS DEFINATELY THE BEST I HAVE TRIED.

It puts too much stress on the whole spine especially the lower back and also the hips, knees and ankles as well. It is irresponsible with all the information and education available to allow this type of exercise in any workout. It would not be as bad if it was labeled a workout for people who are not overweight - or if it had a disclaimer stating \\"may cause back, hip, knee problems\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forced Talk Time","review":"To be fair, I didn't actually do this workout. I do not like being forced to listen to someone ramble on every time I play a workout video. There is no way to fast forward through Jillian's introduction. I usually watch a workout video before actually doing it. Because Jillian's introduction is longer than I care to endure every time I put it into my DVD player, I decided to discard this tape. I own the \\"Banish Fat Boost Metabolism\\" tape, but was bored with it after about a month. I am athletic, so it is, at times, difficult for me to find challenging workouts that will hold my attention for an extended period of time. The concept seems great, but I don't have the stomach for the long intro."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORT VIDEO EVER. WOULD LIKE TO RETURN FOR REFUND","review":"WORT VIDEO EVER.

I never felt a burn in my abs or legs, and only slightly in my arms (with 5 lb weights). I will probably still use this workout, but only as a cardio workout on days I don't want to strength train or do anything intense. I think if you are in fairly good shape and workout pretty often, this will offer a quick cardio routine, but I don't think it offers much strength-training for the intermediate level."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not use if you have ever had a shoulder injury!","review":"I did this DVD ONCE!

For all her \\"in your face\\" talkI was waiting to see Her walk the walk so to speak. I have Way more respect for CathFriedrich who does it all with her girls. If you want some really toughworkouts with results other then injuries go for Cathe or Amy Bento."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely spot on","review":"I bought this DVD about a month back and decided to follow the rules and work out religiously. I started the 30 day shred about a month back and the results have been phenomenal. After a week into the work out I noticed dynamic changes in my body. I was toned, had more strength in just a weeks time. Seeing these results I have continued it so far and am extremely happy with my purchase. I am not the kind of person who purchases work our DVDS but I would highly recommend this. I must say the 20 minute work outs are very convenient. A must say for anyone who needs to shed weight or need some toning."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best choice I ever made!","review":"I am not an excerciser at all. When I decided to finally start getting in shape I did my research and finally bought 30 day shred. It has been the best investment of my life! I am 5'4, 190 lbs and wanted a dvd that didn't require a lot of fancy moves. This DVD is simple moves that make you work. Participating in Jillians workout is tough, but she continues to inspire you as you go through the excercises. Just when you don't think that you can handle anymore, she pushes - and tells you that you can, that you are worth it. It has only been ten days, but I feel my body changing. I am giving myself 4 weeks at level one before moving on. ( We will see how it goes.) Just like she tells you, if you want a 20 minute workout, you have to work for it. This is the DVD everyone should own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, intense workout","review":"I originally decided to try this workout because i had plateaued with my gym routine of jogging and weights.The added strength, cardio, and abs moves really switched it up good. within 3 week of doing the dvd almost every day i had lost 3 inches in my waist.The only thing i would recommend to anyone who does this dvd is added some extra warm up and cool down stretches in the beginning and end. I do have tendinitis in 1 of my knees pretty bad and only doing a minute of stretching left me stiff and a little sore. when i added some extra stretching on my own i felt alot better after.Overall i;m very pleased with this dvd and find the workouts very intense, which is what i like. if you don;t like intense workouts you will no like this dvd."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW","review":"For a 20 minute workout, this is pretty tough. I work out quite often,about 3-4 times a week, and found myself out of breath not even half way through this work out. Jillian is tough, and doesn't let you rest. Even after doing level 1 about 4 times, I already feel a little stronger and leaner. I recommend this video to any one who wants to lose weight.After doing the Level 1 workout, I could definitely see why the video is called \\"30 Day Shred\\". I could barely walk the next day. My calves hurt so bad!"},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE this","review":"This is easily my favorite workout DVD. I use to be addicted to P90, but forget it. Tony Horton is covered in dust.

It's the most intense one I've ever done, and the best part is that each one is packed into 20 minutes. It's great on busy days. There are also two levels within each of the three workouts, so I can choose the intensity I want that day. The combo of cardio, strength, and weights is awesome, and I can see and feel a difference in my body right away. Highly, highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you want results, you need to bring it!","review":"It is a very hard workout. Depending how much hand weight do you use it will be the intensity... but, if you want result you have to push yourself. I been doing P90X for over a yr now and this workout DO NOT compare with P90X, ever. The main reason is because you don't rest and as she said you keep your heart rate very high, plus is only 20min. I wish that she could recomend how much weight should we use. I been using 5pound,I think it is a lot, but I want to feel the workout, so I will not go down in weight and push myself. I usually burn 240 calories in those 20min and my heart rate goes higher than 170!100% recommended!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Butt Kicker!","review":"This video kicked my butt! I could hardly move the day after my first work out. I'm still on Level 1, but I could see this video getting boring.

Well, I am just today returning from the Dr. with a cast up my leg and cruthces as I have a broken tibia - (3 inch fracture from one side of the knee to the other).

I'm hoping to start the dvd again when I can find time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated it","review":"I did it for a full month and didn't lose a pound!

I like how they show modifications to some of the workouts on the dvd, which makes this dvd really great. It makes it easy for everyone to workout. I also like how there are three different levels of difficulty in it. All in all, this is a great workout video. I would recommend it to anyone who is trying to lose weight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Exercise VIdeo","review":"This is an excellent work out video. Its short but gets the heart rate up. I think it's perfect for people who don't have a lot of time but who want to get rid of those excess calories. I don't have to spend an hour or more at the gym. In 20 minutes I get more of a workout than an hour at the gym."},{"rating":"2","title":"not what I expected, but...","review":"a good workout, but not what I thought would be coming from a person with her reputation.

It is a quick fast paced workout that is easy to follow... I have lost 6 pounds and I am seeing awesome results!! I Love this tough trainer!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"SORENESS","review":"The first day I did this video I was feeling it.. I couldn't even walk down the stairs in my house and I was sore for two days afterwards... good product!! Definitely kicks your rear even doing the easy routine.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Pain","review":"I tried giving 30 day shred a fair chance 5 different times. I workout 6 days a week and am in relatively good shape and this was just miserable for me. It made my knees and my back hurt terribly. I got bored with the workouts quickly and felt absolutely zero desire to ever put myself through that agony again. I will most certainly try other avenues for getting into shape."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Work out!!!","review":"This workout is great!! I highly recommend it! If you are serious about knocking off the extra pounds then you must buy this workout, it is very hard but Jillian motivates you the whole way through. If you don't do it you are only cheating yourself out of the potential weight loss. I have a big event coming up so I'm going to do it everyday!!! I highly recommend the 30 day shred!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Workout!","review":"The first time that I did level 1, I had to take a few breaks. I workout between 4 -5 times a week and thought I was in decent shape. This is a good workout and gets you in shape quick. By the 2nd time, I was able to do the entire workout and then proceed to level 2. The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because there are a few things that affect my knees. It may be too much stress on the knees if you have knee problems. Other than that, I like the fact that it's only 27 minutes total and it gives me incentive to keep on doing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Effective Workout","review":"This is the first exercise video that has given me the results it promises. I have used the dvd for 13 days now. I have lost 5 lbs & can tell a HUGE difference in my body. Combined with lower calorie diet, this has been a really effective weight loss program for me. I cannot wait to see what the results are once I have completed the full 30 days. I will definitely purchase Jillian Michaels dvds in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jillian Michaels kicks my butt","review":"I haven't worked out in a really long time but I thought, \\"Hey, it's 20 minutes, I can do this!\\" OMG, dying. She kicked my butt!! This is a real workout, not some frilly pretend workout. It gave me immense satisfaction at the end knowing that I managed to stick with it for the whole 20 minutes and yet even though it's such a short workout it definitely made me sweat. I am so pleased with this purchase, I was afraid it would be a waste of money, but this is a short amount of time out of my day and it's easy to stick to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much emphasis on shoulders","review":"I just finished the first workout immediately after a hard jog. I really like how she does circuits, but she puts WAY too much emphasis on the shoulders. A person should focus on the deltoids twice a week max. I also take muay Thai three times a week and Brazilian jiu jitsu twice a week, and I simply wanted to add a great cardio and abs workout to my regimen. I wish she did 3 min cardio and 2 min strength training instead of the reverse. I was very unimpressed with the cardio. I wasn't even breathing hard. So far, I am liking Billy Blanks Boot Camp MUCH better. I guess this would be a good workout for those who are not already active, though..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great basic workout","review":"This is just what I needed to get a quick workout in after working all day.

It will have you sweating and sore but it is SO WORTH IT!!!!!!!! My 5 year old LOVES doing the workouts with me :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"This purchase really exceeded my expectations. The workouts are challenging but, as Jillian herself says, \\"effective.\\" I am a couch potato typically, but have actually gotten to the point where I workout every day in the morning before going to work. 20 minutes is something anyone can do. Jillian seems to know her stuff! I've lost about 10 lbs. in 6 weeks without much change in diet. I'm a fan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"She is a Bully..but I love her","review":"Jillian is one of the best instructors I have ever come across, of course, once I owned the video, I stopped exercising. But I can promise you this, you WILL lose 20 lbs. in 30 days. I actually lost 28 lbs. so I know when my exercise room is done, I will lose another 10 - 15 lbs. and look cut...that's the best part of the whole thing, you can actually see your muscles becoming defined with this video. I would give it a 10 star if I could. The shipper got the video to me fast & cheap, and that was totally awsome!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Harder than they look","review":"These three work-outs are harder than they look. The only thing that bothers me is that you can't skip Jillian's intro to the program everytime you use it. On my P90X DVDs I can skip right to the work-out. Jillian definitely rocks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I consider myself in pretty athletic shape and this video was still a challenge. She really gets a great workout in 20 minutes! I couldn't be happier because I now have a back up plan for those days I can't make it to the gym or don't have a whole heck of a lot of time to invest in my workout. I love that she is not cheesy like some can be! This video works all parts...arms, abs, legs...I love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyed this tape.","review":"Three different levels you can choose. Great if you don't have a lot of time to work-out and is challenging."},{"rating":"2","title":"shred and rebuild","review":"I bought this video to get out of my tae-bo rut, which I have been doing for a few months. I thought I was in decent shape until I met Jillian. I was panting with level one and I have seen results in less than a week. I had to buy new shoes to deal with all the high-impact but it is so worth it. My goals were to get fit and toned with losing some weight as a bonus. I am so pleased with this that I am taking it on my seven day tropical vacation (no kidding-my husband volunteered to carry my weights in his bag)! I am working out between levels one and two (two is tough). I was too busy dying to notice the bad music and I wish that you could fast-forward through her intro but not a big deal. If you want to see results in only twenty minutes, get this video. It is worth the small price tag."},{"rating":"2","title":"30 Day Shred","review":"This is a great workout.Jillian does a great job with explaining moves and why she is combining moves.I like how she says not to look for a modification on jumping jacks. It makes me chuckle every time.I work out about 5-6 days a week. I have not tried to do this work out for 30 days straight. I do this workout about 2-3 times a day and I feel stronger and can make it through level one without feeling like I am going to die now.I think that next week I will try to move on to level two.The background music is very boring and not motivating, but Jillian's cues are on spot most of the time. She is encouraging, but not annoying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product!","review":"Great workout. Really works all your muscle groups and she's super encouraging. Def recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Work out for the price","review":"I have always liked Jillian on biggest looser the video is set up into 3 20 minute work outs, starting with level one and then progressively becoming more difficult.

Lots of jumping around and jumping jacks."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Workout From Hell","review":"I'm not going to lie....this is the workout from hell.Jillian Michaels will make you cry, especially if you don't exercise regularly...which I do not.

My entire body hurts, but I'm already seeing a major difference."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Workout","review":"I just recently used this video for the first time and I really did feel it EVERYWHERE the next day! Not in a bad way either..

I haven't been working out as often as I should, I bought this Dvd to help jump start the process of getting back into the game. I must say you do work your butt off, but it's not as bad as I thought it would be. There is a lot of jumping, but I'm getting better and can do most of the exercises with little or any modification. My next step is to get Level 2 to help mix things up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth it","review":"I have done MANY different types of workouts in the gym and at home. I am not in top shape at the moment but only about 10 pounds overweight. I am also 49 years old. The 3 workouts are actually closer to 30 minutes which is great. It's amazing how she can pack a great workout into 30 minutes. I think it's a great place to start. I also own P90X and found it disheartening because it is SO difficult and there is no way I can make it through a whole workout. I am hopeful that this DVD will be a good catalyst and buildup to P90X. The 30 day Shred manages to hit all of the body parts and incorporate cardio, strength training and abs. I would say that it is a great $10 investment. All you need is a mat if you are not on carpet and a pair of hand weights. I used 5 pounds and managed but it was taxing. This is a great place to start but by no means easy. All of my body parts hurt and it's a great feeling. I would also recommend this for males. It is a mini boot camp type workout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Butt Kicking","review":"Jillian kicks your butt and makes you believe you can keep going even if you think you can't!

This video was great; challenging, motivating & thorough. The only complaint would be the ab exercises are a bit easy compared to the rest of the workout. To solve this problem I just add about 5 min or so of exercises on. I have already recommended this! Thanks!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Day one and OMG","review":"Received DVD this morning and decided to get right on with it , did easier on level one and managed to keep up although as I have a hip problem so did march instead of doing all jumping jacks , thoroughly enjoyed it , I didn't feel like I had done 20 mins went very fast , and on the plus side even now two hours later still feeling like I've actually worked out :-) like having an easy and hard version as well and the fact that Jillian talks you through as some DVD's where they have two levels you just get told to watch .Looking forward to doing it again tomorrow , have done weight and measurements so hoping to see some changes next week :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Short and sweet","review":"Jillian does not disappoint. I'd heard about the 30 day shred for years, and I finally got it. I workout otherwise, so I don't do this multiple times a week, but when I do, it's always a good workout.

This is a great video for beginners because she shows you a lot of modifided movements but it still whoops your butt. I did the full 30 days and I still continue to use it as part of my workout through out the week. I'm stronger, thinner, and cut up after doing the Shred. Furthermore, I've purchased 2 other JM videos and found this one to be great to start out with if you're not a regular at the gym."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far so good!!","review":"I like how quick the workout is, but I still sweat my butt off too!

I feel like I'm working hard the entire time. I also like the 3 levels of workouts - I can use this DVD much longer because as I conquer the first workout then I can start doing the next level up.The only complaint I have is that Jilian swears once during the DVD.

Really great for any fitness level."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"This video arrived quickly. My friend did two days of the video so far. And man with just a 20 minute video, Jillian kicks your butt on the first day. It's quick and easy to follow...doesn't mean that it's easy to do though! Still an amazing workout with us dripping in sweat and huffing and puffing along during the video. Definitely will keep up with this. Thanks, Jillian."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whipped me into shape!","review":"This was my first time purchasing an exercise DVD, and it has been great. I have since tried some others, but Jillian Michaels has been my favorite so far. The workout is an intensive 30 min workout. No resting, no breaks! It took some time for me to work up my fitness level to do the exercises without any break, but when you get the hang of it, its kinda fun. The exercises have whipped me into shape! I did not lose much weight though but I look slimmer and well toned."},{"rating":"2","title":"My other dvd's are collecting dust now","review":"I have NEVER written a review on Amazon before, but since I purchased this DVD I have not touched any of my umpteen other ones. I work out in the mornings, and if I have a hard time waking up I can talk myself out of it. But now knowing that I can get a great workout done in 25 minutes, I have no excuse, I can get in a few more minutes of sleep, and I feel great afterwards. I work out one day a week with a trainer, and she gets me pretty sweaty in 1/2 hour. Now with the 30 Day Shred, I feel like I'm working out just as effectively as I am with the trainer, and boy do I get sweaty! I would love to have the trainer every day but I can't afford that, so this is as close as it gets."},{"rating":"2","title":"How get fit in 20 minutes!","review":"You can't get fit in 20mins without those 20mins being focused and intense. I've spent years \\"phoning it in\\" (a Jillian-ism) at the gym and these workouts are more intense but vastly more productive. This is not your typical workout video. With most workout videos a relatively \\"fit\\" but inactive person (I don't rock climb for fun) will find them generating a small sweat but producing next to zero results. Might as well just climb the stairs a bit and park in the far end of the lot. This is not one of those videos. Want to not take the stairs, park upfront, and see results? This is the right video."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE THIS DVD","review":"This is what I've been looking for I swear. Jillian is awesome and I love this dvd. She combines cardio and strength in a way that has your heart rate up in no time and strength that makes you want to throw the dumbbells at her through the tv in a good way...don't get me wrong she makes you work. The 20 minutes is intense ...it is not a joke. I love the fact that it has 3 levels. I've only complete level 1, I previewed level 2 and I said she is NUTS!(in a good way if you want a good workout) She is NOT complicated with her moves she keeps it simple and efficient. I sound like i work for her but I am so pleased!! I never honestly never knew you could sweat (get such an intense workout) so much at home i thought i needed to go to the gym to get that kind of a workout but not with the 30 day shred."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shredded!","review":"Like all the other reviewers mentioned, it will kill your knees if you have bad knees and you don't modify any moves. I read the reviews and bought this with the expectation of a killer knee workout and I have somewhat bad knees. However, I just modified certain moves on level 1. For the static lunges/bicep curl I replaced that with a squat and bicep curl. I did level 2 once and I noticed my ankles hurt that day and the next... but I have terrible ankles due to several sprained ankles during H-S Basketball. I have had this for a month and I do it 2-3 times per week and Mtn bike on the weekend. I have changed my diet to lots of fruits and veggies and around 1500 calories a day and I have lost 10 lbs. I had a baby 9 months ago and NOTHING has worked until the shred, and diet changes. I have noticed my arms and legs are toning up. I would recommend it to anyone who understands that there can be knee problems and to modify some moves if you have knee problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, challenging workout","review":"Never mind the fact that this work out is \\"only\\" 20 minutes, because it is challenging! You will be ready for a break by the end of the DVD.I am an avid power-walker, walking nearly 30 miles+ each week. I have a decent pace, but I was still not achieving my goal weight.Enter the shred.I LOVE this workout. It incorporates it all-you have your cardio, toning, and ab work.Since I've incorporated the shred into my fitness plan, I have not only achieved my goal weight, but I am LESS than my goal weight now. My mommy-bulge is finally going away!I can't say enough to encourage you try this workout.It's tough, but worth sticking it out. You do see fast results if you're consistent.It's worth every penny, and every drop of sweat!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great workout!","review":"I love this workout! Although I'm not following a diet after 1 week I can tell that I am getting more muscle definiton!! I also had knee surgery 4 months back and didn't think I was going to be able to complete some of the lunges, but I pushed through (although my surgeon would not be pleased) I think it is building muscle around my injured knee. I am still on level 1 getting ready to move to level 2...I highly recommend this, just be ready to work!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Something I can do every day","review":"I like this video for the plain and simple fact that on Level 1, Jillian changes the exercises every 30-60 seconds. For me, that is important as I get bored easily with one exercise for a long period of time. I am on day 6 and find that each day gets easier. I have not made it to Level 2 or 3 yet. The first day after I did this workout, I could hardly walk because my legs hurt so bad. If Jillian \\"grates\\" on you, then no, you probably won't like this workout video."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great quick workout","review":"I've had the dvd a week and I really like it so far. I've been doing the Biggest loser cardio/sculpting dvds since January but it's hard to set aside 50 minutes to work out most days. The 20 minute workouts are great and I still feel like I get a great workout. I've been doing level 1 for the past 5 days straight and my shoulders are killing me. It's not really clear if you're supposed to do the workout every day but I'm going to try to keep it up as long as I can!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Take care of your knees!","review":"This is not good for the knees. I thought I would buy this cd to stay in shape and exercise at home instead of going to the gym. The only problem was they hurt the knees. I used this cd for a few weeks. At first, I started out with level one to get the hang of it, and then I tried level 2. Well after doing level 2 that one time I began to have this unusual pain in my knees and it never really left. Her workouts require a lot of pressure on the knees. I'm still young and I never had knee pain, until that workout! I'm really hoping it goes away, and soon! By the way, don't be fooled that there only 20 minutes lol, they are tough as hell and by the time those 20 minutes are over you'll be fighting for your next breath."},{"rating":"1","title":"5lbs down :::: UPDATE!!!!!","review":"I just finished my first week and so far I lost 5lbs and thats not the best part my pants are fitting looser thats a great feeling! Make sure you listen to her and pay attention when she talks about moves that might strain your knees...focus and dont slack up....UPDATE:::I really love the 30 day shred i think Jillian is amazing so this really isn't about her its about the low quality of the dvd itself it cracked in the middle circular part ...so disappointed but so far I have dropped 20lbs the workout is wonderful"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I had heard some good things about this video and that's why I bought it. I was very disapponted for the following reasons. Jillian does a lot of tough talking that becomes annoying to listen to after the third workout. She is not friendly and is certainly not someone I would look forward to spending 30 minutes with every day. I also don't recommend this video to anyone over 40 or who has had children. A good portion of her aerobic section consists of Jumping Jacks for which she offers no alternative. The routine is both shin-splitting and pant-wetting. yuk!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I could return it!","review":"The beginning was OK, but as I got into it I think it was the way she spoke to the the ladies that were helping!

Not my thing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"I ordered the dvd from Ireland and when it arrived it wouldn't play in my player. It's only made for usa dvd players.

It is a hard workout, not boring at all and you will see the difference in no time.You get 3 levels of workouts in one DVD. Each level shows a low impact and high impact workout. So once you have level 1 workout down then you can go to the next level. You get the full workout in just 20 minutes! And being a mother of 4 with a full time job, 20 minutes is all I can spare.I have a waist now, my arms look cut (not like Jillian's but I'm working on it) and I'm down to the size I was 20 years ago! YOU NEED TO GET THIS DVD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Gets your heart rate up, but not worth it","review":"I must say, I did not like this DVD. I'd never seen Jillian Michaels before, but her style really annoyed me. What bothered me the most, however, was how unhealthy this workout actually was! She gets your heart rate pumping, then has you lie down for ab work. The \\"cool-down\\" was just going straight from the ab section to stretching, which jarred me and actually made me sick. If I ever did this DVD again, I would have to add a 5-minute cool-down so I could get my heart rate lowered before I started stretching. She keeps saying she doesn't want people to get injured, but between high-impact cardio, jarring shifts in position and the abrupt ending, this DVD seems like a great way to hurt yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money!","review":"I could not even view this product due to the fact it skipped and stalled throughout the whole work out!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"I got the DVDs in a timely manner and none of them have scratches on them.

Number of repetitions varied from exercise to exercise and even sometimes within the same exercise. The music did not go very well. It felt like it was added in AFTER the video was made. Maybe there should be a clock timer that we can all see so we know that we are doing numbers based on time and not a particular set number."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jillian is my new best friend","review":"I am still just starting out with this workout, about 2 weeks in, and I have been enjoying it. I definitely feel the benefits and hope to start seeing them if I keep it up! I love that it is a short workout as I am a working mother and don't have an hour or two a day to dedicate to working out. Trying to shed this extra baby weight!! I like there are different levels.

I have just finished the first set of 10 day shredding and tomorrow I will start the second level."},{"rating":"2","title":"Take it slow","review":"I have been doing the 30 Day Shred for 5 weeks now and LOVE it. The modified version helps you to ease your way in. I added the hand weights for 1 week then stopped using them. It was too much, too fast ~ for me. I started having a lot of shoulder pain. That ceased once I quit using the hand weights.I found Level 2 to be the most difficult ~ but I have touchy knees. It was too much impact so I went back to level 1. I began Level 3 just this week and it really steps up your workout. There doesn't seem to be TOO much impact on the knees but I'll know more in a week.During the 5 weeks, I have lost 18 pounds which I am thrilled about. I was afraid that the workout would be too advanced for me, as I am quite overweight. But, I'm taking it slowly, adding as I go. I highly recommend this workout if you have a limited time schedule."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Much!","review":"This workout will KILL the novice!

I think it will be great once I build up my endurance, but that's going to take a long time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good workout but a big pet peeve","review":"OK, the work outs are very good, she's good and you do see results quickly, but a HUGE TURNOFF to this DVD is that I can't skip the 10 minute intro before I can begin a workout. I accidentally stopped the DVD, so I had to wait another 10 minutes for everything to reload and play out. Come on already, stop with the advertising and just give us what we paid for. I don't need to be sold on the Biggest Loser or anything else, and this wastes 10 minutes of time when I could be working out. Thanks for listening."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great workout","review":"This is an intense workout. I have definitely seen results, in toning my muscles, as I just moved to Level 2. I am at a weight loss plateau and this seems to help just a bit as long as I eat extremely cautiously in conjunction. Since it is a 20 minute workout, I can see why Jillian doesn't allow a water break, but due to it's intensity, it is impossible not to stop (and miss some exercise) in order to hydrate. When doing this workout, I have to give myself a lot of positive self talk, as it is extremely intense, and Jillian lacks in this department. I am hoping to figure out how to turn off her voice next go around. She is pretty rough around the edges and is the only thing about this video I wish I could change."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intense workout","review":"What a great workout tape. You get in take care of business than get out all in 20 minutes. To fluff no hype just good ole fashion workout.I love this tape.Jillian Michaels - 30 Day Shred"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great workout for 25 minutes","review":"When this first came in the mail I waited 2 weeks before starting it. I think that I was a bit intimidated by the other reviews. I didn't want to start something then stop because it was too hard. After finally putting it in and finishing the 25 minutes I knew I was hooked. This is a great workout if you are pressed for time. She definatly makes you sweat! I'm only on level 2 and won't advance until I can make it through without taking a breather. I was definatly sore the next day only I'm not sure if it was due to the short cool down and minimal stretching or if it was because of the workout. I haven't seen any changes in my weight yet but then it hasn't been 30 days. I also just started weight watchers so I will keep you posted. 5 stars for the hard core workout. I make sure to add a bit more stretching at the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Do not like the format","review":"Really like the workout and really like Jillian...except I have to wait 10 minutes to get through the intro before starting the workout. It won't let me skip; stupid format"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great way to Exercise in 20 minutes!!!","review":"I really enjoy this video.

I feel so much better after I have done this video."},{"rating":"2","title":"good video","review":"this was a great video. i didn't do the 30 day workout as suggested, since I tend to workout late at night and being in an apartment complex, I thought some of the moves would be a little noisy for my neighbor downstairs. but otherwise she was very motivating and moves were easy to follow."},{"rating":"2","title":"QUICK AND GETS THE JOB DONE","review":"If you want a quick effective workout that does just what it promises then, BAM!

I have just been diagnosed with a patella/knee inflammation in both knees from these exercises in this DVD. Please be careful - I am now in physical therapy for a month to undo the damage from improperly squatting (although I followed Jillian's advice on how to squat according to her instruction). Workouts 2 and 3 are way too intense with stress on your body. I agree with the other reviewers that there is not enough stretching."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Workout -- I'm Too Out of Shape for it","review":"Twenty years ago I could have handled this workout. But now that I'm in my late 50's, it proved to be too much too soon. I'm sure others will benefit from it. I need something that starts out slower. I've been away from the gym routine for 15 years -- it was just too much for this old girl."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I love this video! The workout is intense but goes by so fast, so it's easy to be diligent in keeping with the program. I started feeling stronger immediately. I'm currently on day 18 and I feel great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this but be warned!","review":"This is a great video if you're short on time (30 minutes overall)and it will kick your butt but I don't think doing it for 30 days straight is good for your knees. I am in good shape and walk 4 miles regularly during the summer. I didn't have knee pain until I did this for 2 weeks straight. My muscles did get toned (a little too much-adding bulk to my butt and thighs) but the 2 minutes of cardio in between the weight training is very high impact- jumping jacks, butt kicks, jump rope in place. And that was just level one. There are three levels. You are supposed to do level 1 for 10 days, level 2 for 10 days and level 3 for 10 days. I think it would be more effective when alternating with a cardio DVD.Great DVD overall but be careful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rips you a new A$$hole!","review":"Wow I hate working out but I love this video! It's honestly the best workout tape I've ever done and the best part is you can see the results quickly. It's worth it to power through because it's only 20 minutes. I think Natalie from the video wishes she was doing the modified workout ;)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kicked my butt","review":"At first I was skeptical that a home DVD could give me much of a workout, but boy was I wrong. I hadn't worked out for awhile when I started this program. After the first day I'd never been so sore in my life! Anyway, the only criticism I have is that I don't like working out with weights 2 days in a row. I had always been taught that you need to give your muscles at least a day to recover. So I bought the \\"Biggest Loser Cardio Max\\" to alternate and to give me more of a workout variety. So far it's been great. My clothes are fitting better and I just feel a hundred times better."},{"rating":"2","title":"O.M.G!!","review":"What can I say! I'd read all the reviews about this dvd and thought I'd been prepared....how wrong was I! This is intense but you can really see how its going to improve your body. The 2 different levels help ease you into the moves and it doesn't matter how long you stay at that level. I plan on doing level one for atleast a week and a half and see how I feel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good workout!!","review":"I received this item in good time from Amazon. I started the 30DS yesterday at level 1 and it was just about the right level of challenge. It worked all the main areas of my body and I can imagine after 30 days it will definitely have an impact on my all-round appearance. The only criticism I have is that the cool down at the end of the workout was not long enough. The stretches should be a lot longer, but I guess that is something I don't really need Jillian for anyway. She explains all the exercises well and is motivating throughout. I have yet to do level 2 and 3 but am looking forward to feeling the shred over the next month! When I have completed the 30 days I will update with my results."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly Amazing Workout!!!!! Went from size 8 to size 4. SUPER HAPPY!!!!","review":"Started the 30 Day Shred with two of my friends... we only did the shred twice a week. Every once in a while we'd throw in a fast-paced long walk at the park. At \\"our pace\\" I went from a flabby out of shape 8 (yes you can be an out of shape size 8!) to a SUPER toned size 4. Couldn't be happier with the results. I BELIEVE IT saying it's a 30 DAY SHRED... About to take the challenge again, as getting married and baby time has brought back some weight. SO THANKFUL FOR JILLIAN's 30 Day SHRED!!!!!! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"great 20 minutes","review":"Perfect for anyone with limited time. Intense enough to build up a sweat and with a demonstration of an \\"easier\\" version of all the moves. I love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"skip the intro. customize it. beginners be careful. GOOD SWEATIN'!!","review":"Overall this a good hard workout. The intro, which you can't skip, is annoying on a daily basis. Who wants to see that every day? That part wasn't well thought out by the editor. It seems to be a common complaint. I also wish it were customizable like the Cardio Max DVD. Pay attention to form & your own body cues. Basically, hard breathing means keep on trucking, pain means alter your form (& keep on trucking). I consider myself to be in at least average condition(working out 3-5X/wk)and this DVD was harder than expected, which is pleasantly surprising. I was sore. I've never actually seen Biggest Loser but I now understand why they lose such weight. I have continued to use the DVD but I'm mixing it up with other workouts now because my knees, although I've been careful, are now making noise when use the stairs =:-O. I'm glad I bought this DVD & will continue to use it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good workout.","review":"The workout is tough but gets you \\"shredded\\". Jillian is much more bearable than what I've seen of her on Biggest Loser. She does flirt with her two girls in the background constantly, which is pretty annoying.I am on day 20 and definitely noticing a difference, though without an accompanying diet there is only so much this workout will do for you.I was 6 weeks postpartum when I started and I also have bad knees, so I definitely made use of her adjustments for those with bad joints or who are really out of shape.This jump started me, but being postpartum I haven't put in all I could - I think I will wait another 6 weeks and do it again.I recommend this for someone who has little time and is willing to work as hard as they can since it's only 20 minutes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jillian Michael's best DVD yet!","review":"I'm not a fanatic workout-holic, but I do go through my phases of working out. My problem is that I'm impatient. Like most people, I want to see results quickly so that I get motivated to stick with the workouts; and I also don't want to spend more than 30 min exercising. I have to say... this DVD was a pleasant surprise. The workouts are short and sweet, but you definitely feel 'em and see the results pretty fast (as long as you stick with the program). 30 Day Shred is as good as, if not better than, the Biggest Loser workout dvds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Amazing.","review":"Tomorrow will be day seven for me and I've already noticed changes in my body. I was extremely sore for the first few days, finding it hard just to walk down a few stairs. But it's been so worth it! I already had strong legs from running a couple miles a few times a week, but now my legs are pretty diesel. The fat around my upper thighs is slowly thinning out, as is the fat around my midsection. I fit into a size four jean today! This is simply an amazing work out. If you can push it through the first few days of intensely sore muscles, you will definitely see results."},{"rating":"2","title":"Challenging but Doable!","review":"This dvd is great for all levels, I think. It pushes you to work hard but does not kill you (I did Insanity last fall and that one KILLS!). Even on the tougher aspects of this workout, you can always say to yourself, hey, there's only 20 minutes total...I can do this for 20 minutes! : ) I think it is a great workout...It will definitely get results if your diet is also in check. : )"},{"rating":"2","title":"Difficult, but good","review":"Great workout DVD - not easy to do. I couldn't do the whole thing at first, but worked up to it. Brought it with me to use on a business trip. It was great to have a convenient workout to do in the motel room."},{"rating":"2","title":"30 Day Shred Without the Dread!","review":"I bought Jillian Michaels' 30 Day Shred a few years ago, and I still use it to this day. Maybe not consecutively, as it is probably supposed to be used for, but it still works. When I first bought it, I wasn't avid on exercising, since then I am much more fit but I still pop it in the DVD on those days when I don't have much time for a good workout.The content within the DVD is great, I love Jillian - she's the best drill sergeant you can ask for. The workout are relatively simple to follow but pack a punch if done correctly and efficiently.Overall a good purchase for those beginning to workout or those in need of a good and brisk workout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rough... in a good way!","review":"The work out if about 25-30 minutes and it kicks your butt!! By the end you are sweating, panting and your endorphins have kicked in and you feel great! Great buy, especially if you cant afford or don't have time to go to a gym."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good cardio, bad for knees","review":"When I bought this video, I wasn't really sure what I was getting myself into. I wanted weight training and core work to compliment my cardio workouts (swimming and running daily). I got this video because it had highest rating on Amazon. I was very disappointed.I started at Level 1 as recommended and found that it was not for me. I promptly switched to level 3.Pros: Short. Good cardio and you will work up a sweat. Some arm work, but not likely to build many muscles.Cons: Not good leg or abs workout. There is a fair amount of jumping, which is NOT recommended for people who have bad knees, especially if you have a few extra pounds. The warmup and cool-down are also a bit too short.Overall I would not recommend this video for beginners or for experienced athletes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jillian Michaels - 30 Day Shred","review":"I really like Jillian training techniques, she is straight forward and let you know that modifying exercise (from hard to easier) is not an option, if 300 lbs people on Biggest Looser can do it, anybody can. She has the know-how and gets the job done, loosing fat and strengthening bodies.I wish that someone would come up with a DVD that has different workouts for the whole week (every day), so it keeps it interesting, maybe with the blue ray technology it will be possible, the disk has more space.I recommend this DVD to all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great work out video","review":"I bought the 30 day shred based on the reviews even though I don't watch the tv show. I have done the workout 5 times now. I am still at level 1 !! I was already my ideal body weight but want to tone up and improve cardio, This video is hard work! I like that I feel like I actually did something after it's finished. I just about die towards the end with the side squats and arm lifts and I'm only using 3 lb weights!!! The only reason for only 4 stars is that you can't skip forward to the main work out on the dvd as others have mentioned. It's annoying, but I still highly recommend the workout.Update: I just moved to level 2 and can barely make it through! I think this may take more than thirty days for me to get to level 3! People are right that Jillian Michaels is pretty motivating though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very challenging and effective workout","review":"I purchased this workout a few months ago, based on many positive reviews. Wow, I could not believe how challenging this workout was when I first started using it. I could not even get through the entire workout for level 1 without stopping several times; and I am not a completely sedentary person. That being said, the workout is amazing and you will definitely see results. Jillian is a no nonsense trainer and I like that about this video. I also like how she shows you the correct and incorrect ways to do the moves, as this helps to prevent injury. I'm on week 3 and level 2. Slower than I'm supposed to go, but like I said it IS a challenge."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Since I am a working mom, my living room is my gym and I own a lot of workout DVD's. This one is my favorite one because I feel I can get a great, full-body workout in a very short amount of time.There are 3 different workouts on this DVD, all about 25 min. each. They progress from \\"easy\\" to \\"difficult.\\" If you have never worked out with Jillian before, I suggest you watch each workout before actually doing it. She does not provide much instruction, so make sure you are comfortable with each move before doing it. She does provide a model to follow for easier and more difficult versions of each exercise.I have owned this DVD for over a year and it helped me to get back in shape after my first baby and I'm using it now after having my second baby. I highly recommend this DVD for anyone who wants a great workout and for someone looking to get into better shape."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good overall","review":"Overall, this video does its job. I felt like I had a workout. Beginners shouldn't shy away from this video. Yes the first couple times it is really difficult, but doable. More advanced people,I think this could still work for you too.Personally, I don't do well with doing the same thing over and over, so doing the same video for 30 days isn't for me. For me, I switch up videos, doing this video four times a week."},{"rating":"2","title":"great workout in a short time","review":"I am 41 and I could make it thru level 1.

I lost the 15 pounds that used to be my goal when I first started.Now I'm getting ready to move on to Trouble Zones DVD.I heard the is much harder then the 30 days shred but is wonderful.So go for it. It's better than pay bally Gym :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"ok, but not easy to concentrate because of the nonstop talk","review":"gosh, the woman can not shut up for a sec. it is so hard to concentrate on the exercise, i got a terrible headache. the music in the background was so boring. to be honest, all exercising dvd's out there work for me, not sure why her dvd has got this high rating. it's probably because she was in biggest loser and that itself can be motivation for a lot of people but personally i was not that impressed. i have tried turbo jam before (beach body)wonderful work out + the music is great and the trainer talks but enough to explain the exercise and to give you a push and motivate. Jillian was just too much talk for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good short workout","review":"I was looking for a good workout I could do at home.

Variety of exercises is motivating an having persons with beginner skills and advance skills on screen at same time helps with adjusting to personal levels of involvement.Only disappointment with DVD is being unable to fast forward beyond disclaimers and introductory information.

The exercises are great but obviously there aren't all that many.My biggest irritation is that there is no way to skip the intro and the Biggest Loser promo before getting to the workout unless you leave the DVD in and it starts from the same place and you can just go back a bit. It is so annoying when you have a short window to workout and you can't skip those few minutes of unnecessary video.Other than that, they're great exercises and sufficient variety to pop in to keep your workout routine fresh and the concept of weights/cardio/abs is great."},{"rating":"2","title":"what a workout","review":"This workout dvd with Jillian Michaels is a definite killer. My entire body was sore for weeks. You will definitely shred inches."},{"rating":"2","title":"This workout will make you sweat!","review":"This video is for someone who already has a fitness level and is seeking to up it. The exercises are challenging and they change often during the workout so there is no time for boredom. I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Workout is amazing - DVD is annoying.","review":"Jillian does a great job of motivating you through her fat scorching workout, and offers alternative movements for most levels of fitness. My wife has enjoyed everything about this workout, and has mixed the DVD with Jillian's book, \\"Making The Cut\\" and has been seeing results.Our only BIG complaint is the authoring of the DVD. The ads at the beginning are easy to fast forward/skip through, but then, the Jillian \\"first time watching this DVD\\" introduction cannot be skipped. It is over five minutes long, and in a rush to squeeze in a workout in the morning before heading off to work, you have to remember to start the DVD long before you are ready to work out. I know it sounds minor, but suffer through the welcome intro a few times when you are in a rush and just want to get to your workout, and you may begin to realize how annoying it is.Love Jillian and the workout, but PLEASE author the DVD to be easier to use with the next one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Hardcore for only 20 minutes","review":"I bought this DVD because even though I work out every day for a little over an hour, it was more like zoning-out. That having been said, even for a more Intermediate-Advanced exerciser like myself, it is VERY high impact. If you're nursing some injuries, even old ones, this may not be for you. I know that after jumping up-and-down for 20 minutes straight my ancient hip injury started to bother me again. Truthfully, I will probably only do this workout when I don't have time for a trip to the gym. But I find her encouraging remarks and approach to exercise useful and will apply it to my regular workout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best 20 minutes you can spend!","review":"If you're like me, it is hard to get motivated after a long day.

You truly get a quality workout in 20 minutes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeping Motivated","review":"I have found this format of 20 minutes and Jillian's encouragement keep me from making excuses to not work out every day. The exercises are easy to follow yet challenging."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deceptively easy looking","review":"I got this video a few days ago since my mom has been raving about it. After watching the first workout, I thought this looked easy - especially because I am in pretty good space and work out 4 to 6 times a week.

Jillian rocks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Work Out With Jillian Michaels!","review":"Are you unable to afford the gym but desire a high-quality workout program? Try Jillian Michaels' 30-Day Shred. She's a tough trainer, but the exercises are simple to do and definitely effective. The advice and three workout programs provided on this DVD are worth more than the little bit of money you will be paying for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a workout!","review":"I have been using this DVD for about a month now. I am absolutely amazed. I have gained so much muscle I can't believe it. My abs are so much stronger and defined now. I have advanced to level two and will probably stay there a while. Level two is rough but the feeling afterwards outweighs all the hard work during the workout. The music is a little too rocky for me but I try to block it out because it is such a great workout. I wish she didn't use the language that she uses sometimes. I know she is a tough trainer but the language doesn't have to be. Overall I am well pleased with the results. Amazing that you can get such results in just a 20-minute workout! Thanks Jillian!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Do some other cardio first","review":"This is a really well-rounded workout. And if you follow the instructions to a tee (i.e. don't wuss out and take breaks), you'll get a good workout. However, as someone who likes a lot of cardio, I would suggest doing a little bit walking beforehand.I do feel like I save time by working 2 muscle groups at the same time. I have been exercising for years and am still stuck at level one. Man, those side lunges and front raises kill me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lives up to the hype!","review":"I have to say that I was skeptical at first but now I am a true believer!

I have been using this just about three times a week, cause it kicks butt! I pride myself on being a long distance walker, but it is important to keep up the strenght training as well. With diet and exercise I have dropped 11 pounds so far, am feeling stonger and my endurance is way high! I would recommend this to anyone who wants a gooooood, strong, FAST workout. Love that it's only 20 minutes and you're dead, I mean done! Hah!"},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome quick workout!","review":"I am in moderately good shape and work out or run a few miles 3x/week. I wanted a quick, at-home alternative to working out with a trainer. I am on level 2 of this workout and find it challenging. I like the 3-2-1 setup, so you know where the workout is going and how far you have come. I have only been doing the video for a week, so I have yet to see real results. I plan on doing this video twice a week with one day of running 3 miles."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great workout but...","review":"This is a great butt-kicking workout but you had better like Jillian's voice because you will have to listen to her introduction each and every day because you can't MENU out of it! I find this so irritating that I'll never buy another one of her DVDs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tough workout!","review":"This is a tough workout but it's over so quick-that's the joy of it! In starting off with the program, I grunted and struggled to get through it but then it's over and doesn't seem so bad. I plan to use it again after my son is born as part of my work out to get back in shape post baby. I did not use the program as planned, but rather used it a couple times a week to suppliment my treadmill/weight routiens or for those days when I needed a good quick work out-I certainly felt it the next day too!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thumbs Up","review":"I got this DVD after really enjoying Jillian's Yoga Meltdown DVD and enjoy this work out as well.I am a big aerobics person and am in fairly good condition. I could do level one and two with ease, but level three held a bit of a challenge. I still do workouts one and two but make my own modification to make them more difficult.My one complaint about the DVD is it has a lot of video that the DVD does NOT let you skip. It starts to get very frustrating after a few times.Other than that it's a great addition to my exercise collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this DVD!","review":"I have several DVD's and usually after a couple of times, they collect dust. However, I have been quite faithful with this DVD and I'm sure that I'll use it on a weekly basis. The one thing that I don't like is that Jillian Michaels talks too much prior to the tape and I'd like to be able to just start without hearing comments each time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Workout","review":"Great Workout! I am a new mom with a baby who takes very short naps so I don't have a whole lot of time to workout. This video is awesome because I get a good, sweaty workout in while she takes one of her 30 minute naps. I love the workouts because they are constantly changing things up so I don't get bored with doing the same old move. I have many workout videos but this one is my favorite and the one I recommend the most."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kicks your butt!!","review":"I just started using this DVD a week ago and...WOW! You work up a true sweat! I'm already staring to see changes in my body. I bought this because regular diet and walking havent helped with those few last pounds and I really wanted to get toned. My abs are starting to take shape just after a week!! Try it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great strength builder","review":"I picked up this DVD to help me with my goal: getting stronger. Before I tried this workout, I wasn't able to do even a single non-modified push up, now I can do regular push ups, I've never been able to do those EVER! I love this DVD, it's a great quick workout, it's effective, and it's affordable. Level 2 has come to be my favorite because it makes my back feel amazing. The 30 Day Shred is a challenging workout, but it's totally worth the sweat and soreness!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good workout but I expected more...","review":"This was a really good, short workout. I was sweating and it had my heart pumping. My only complaint is that I feel this workout is too short, so I will probably do it twice or do two levels back to back. Also, I am a big fan and user of P90X which has very intense workouts, so this may be the reason why I felt this one was short and less intense than expected after reading the reviews. Overall, I would recommend it because it's nice to have different workout videos to change things up so you don't get bored."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good workout, Too long of an intro!","review":"I like the workouts if you vary them, doing level 1, level 2, then level 3 and repeat. The intro into the workout is crazy though! You have to go through the entire thing every time before you select a workout and it's ridiculously long. I started turning off my whole dvd player at the cooldown so that when I start it back up I can just select another workout. You should be able to fast forward through the intro. Really, it's a 20 minute program and otherwise it takes 5 minutes just to set it up."},{"rating":"2","title":"30 Day Shred","review":"This is truly a great start to a Healthier you. Jillian is Hard Core. No pain, No gain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Workout","review":"I work out around 4-6 times a week. I run, do aerobics, just got done with a 4 week boot camp. I bought this dvd to go along with my running routine. This is a pretty good work out. I have only done this video once because I also bought another dvd work out set too. I jumped right into level 3 and haven't tried the other levels yet. This was a great workout and I really enjoyed it. I could see where after a few uses, this would get boring doing the same video over and over again. The plus to this is that you do get a change when you start at level 1 and work your way up. I would recommend this to dvd to others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Workout","review":"This Video is Awesome, i am currently on level one still but it has been a Tough and Great workout. I am dripping in sweat all throughout the workout and you can feel your body changing day by day. i am on day 7 now and body is ready for level 2."},{"rating":"2","title":"annoying intro","review":"This workout is amazing. But the introduction with Jillian talking about herself and explaining the workout gets old after the 10th time. I wish there was a way to skip that and go straight to the workout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Great Workout","review":"Each level is only 20 minutes or so, but its pretty fast paced so, I'm usually pretty tired by the end. In fact, I have only done the first level so far!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good variety","review":"This is a good workout and can be a nice boost! I'm a walk at home fan and bought this dvd as a challenge from a friend that didn't think my Leslie Sansone workouts could be challenging enough. You do more squats here and lunges but I was able to keep up and didn't feel like I was dying like my friend swore I would be. Frankly, I like my other workouts better but throw this one in to do more targeted workouts from time to time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great workout!","review":"The DVD, some hand weights, and a towel (if you have carpet), and you're ready. There's a modified workout for those just starting, and a \\"kick-your-butt\\" workout for those who feel more confident. Recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Workout Re-Energizer","review":"I have to admit that I initially was not a huge fan of Jillian Michaels. I am very self-motivated and do not enjoy, nor do I need, someone yelling at me to get results. However, this DVD is fantastic for getting you back into the swing of working out. I will occasionally take breaks from my regular routine and whenever I'm ready to seriously start working out again, I pop in this DVD. It's only 20-25 minutes long, works your whole body, gets your heart pumping and you definitely feel it the following day. I feel as if you do need to supplement it with 30 minutes of cardio and you shouldn't stay too long on the first level. Since purchasing this DVD I've purchased a number of other JM DVDs and there is no question that she definitely gives you a good workout and knows what she's talking about. If, like me, you don't like the constant 'motivating' that Jillian provides, you can always press the mute button once you get the workouts down. Highly recommend this DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Done!","review":"I started Level 1 this week. I like the simple, clean staging, where it's easy to see what the participants are doing, and it's not a crowded room like I've seen in other videos. Instructions for both the easier and the more-advanced version of the movements are very clearly demonstrated. And Level 1 is definitely a workout! I'm not so much interested in the TV persona, or how Jillian looks on the DVD cover, as some have commented here. I'm just pleased to find something that I can do in the limited free time that I have. I've performed many of these same moves before in other live classes, and Jillian's instructions are solid. I have a long way to go, but it's already making a difference in my overall strength and endurance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Killer quick workouts","review":"Great workouts for at home, especially when you don't have a lot of time. I saw results in the first 10 days!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DESTROYED MY KNEES!!!!!!","review":"I have always been in great shape (I ran half marathons, swam 3-4/week, went to the gym regularly etc) never having any injuries. I decided to add this to my routine a few months before my wedding. BIG MISTAKE!!!! Right away I knew that some of the exercises weren't healthy for my knees as they were overextending (the side/front lunge for starters) I should have stopped after the first time but tried it once more thinking I should maybe slow it down. Turns out I tore both knee ligament. I showed the DVD to my physiotherapist who scolded me when I obviously knew better. I love Jillian but she runs through the moves WAY to fast (while holding weights) and it becomes just too dangerous. Plus everyone knows you shoudn't be working the same muscles every day - they need time to recover."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST workout when you cant make the gym!","review":"I love this workout, you can TOTALLY miss a gym day and put in FULL EFFORT and feel amazing results. I am only on level 1 and definately will continue this DVD until I have reached/topped all the levels. I use this every other day when I am not in spinning class and is a very intense cardio/muscle/ab workout in a condensed timeframe. Is very doable for working moms who have timestraints. If you are not sweating and feeling the workout, either you are not trying, or you need to seriously increase your handweights. I use 4# & 6# and they are MORE than adequate!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"This workout is outstanding. Jillian gets straight to the point with working out. It proves that you don't need to workout for hours a day to get results. Love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"I don't know how to explain this video but all I know is that it's great. I had gained weight awhile before doin this video and after doin some of this video I haven't lost the weight yet but I do notice I'm stronger. I haven't done it as much as I should... But from the little I've done it I've noticed my endurance for cardio has increased tremendously.so even though I'm bigger I can run better than when I was small!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Baby weight bye bye","review":"I am a huge Jillian Michaels fan and was looking for an at-home workout dvd to use to get rid of that baby weight. The DVD is great because it offers different workout levels, there isn't a lot of equipment required, and a big thing for me was it didn't require a lot of space. Jillian is a great motivator during the workouts too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Changes I would make","review":"I hate that you have to go through the entire intro every time just to get to the exercise. I want to be able to put it in and start my workout.I hate that there is no diet guide with the workout. There should be something that tells us what we should be eating during the 30 days shread"},{"rating":"1","title":"A lil disappointed","review":"I had high hopes for this DVD. Level 1 was intense kick butt. Level 2 was a lil lame. I hardly broke a sweat and i went to level 2 the next day. It was way 2.. I don't know but just not what I thought. I will mix level 1 on this DVD with the Banish Fat Boost Metabolism DVD.Circuit training is a new thing for me so maybe that is why I was a little disappointed. Imma keep @ it till I lose those few stubborn lbs.Delivery was fast. I had just barely logged off the computer for the nite when I had the DVD in my mailbox(jus kiddin)."},{"rating":"1","title":"STRESS FRACTURE - BUYER BEWARE!!","review":"On the 29th day of doing the 30 day shred, my two ankles hurt for two weeks straight - then my right foot hurt. It is 3 months after I stopped and it turns out I still have a stress fracture in my right foot. No exercise is worth being in pain for over 3 months."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"I haven't bought a workout tape in over 15 years. Always thought they were lame. Needed one because I cancelled my overpriced gym membership in NYC.Always thought I was in fantastic shape. However, I started on level three and ended up on level two and one. Will need smaller hand weights because I don't want to stay on level one:-).This DVD is amazing! The choice of levels is fantastic. It is very modern and effective. I am astounded and supremely pleased with this DVD. Jillian Michaels is obviously a pioneer for the future of workout DVD's."},{"rating":"1","title":"not difficult at all compared to insanity","review":"I was looking for something to change up after completeing insanity bc I still have quite a bit to lose. Not this, I didn't even break a sweat in the 1st workout, but second coulda been a warmup. 3rd was decent-ish"},{"rating":"2","title":"okay","review":"it was okay I have did better workouts i get uninterested very easily and she doesn't make me want to even do her workout I rather have someone that motivates me and pushes me more. but I am still doing this workout because I bought it already it's been about 2 weeks and I do feel better but it just gets boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bootcamp Workout","review":"If you like to workout standing up, and cool down with floor excercises do not get this DVD. If you do not like Bootcamp style workouts, do not get this DVD.I really wanted to have great abs and seeing that the reviews for this DVD were so high I thought I'd give her a try. She makes you do JumpinJacks, then lay on the floor for a sit up, then jumpinjacks again, then lay on the floor. My head was hurting really bad from laying down and jumping up. I was very dizzy and I thought I would pass out. I could do the excercises, it was the laying down and getting up that made me nauseous.It's not very fun and she pretty much does the same excercise sets every 3 minutes with a slight change. I do not recommend this for people who like their workouts structured like mine: standing up, and cool down with floor excercises. If you want to have fun while getting your body in shape, try turbojam or some type of dance workout instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Workout","review":"The workout is fantastic with this dvd! I only gave it 4 stars because I find Jillian Michaels to be very annoying. Of course, with any workout dvd, you watch it over and over and that alone gets annoying. But at some points, Jillian just seems so fake. I mostly use workout dvds in the winter months, so I haven't used this one in a while. However, next time, I will be watching it on mute :) Otherwise, it is great and a good price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great workout with an annoying intro","review":"For a few short workouts, these are amazing! Each workout is intense and provides great muscle burn while making you drip sweat from every pore.The ONLY downside to this DVD is that you can't skip through Jillians intro. By day 3 I had enough of it and tried to skip through it only to discover that I was stuck listening to it every single day... Enough already!I also wish that there were two workouts for each level so you could switch them up from day to day... doing the same exact workout routine every day for 2-3 weeks, while completely challanging, is just a little boring..."},{"rating":"2","title":"This dvd is great","review":"I just finish my first 30 day..lost 10lbs.....it hard at first, but it gets better hang in there the huffing and puffing will pay off......and trust me you will be huffing and puffing, but it's worth it .........."},{"rating":"2","title":"This workout video rocks!","review":"I LOVE this workout video!! I bought it thinking yea right, how hard can a 20 min workout video be? Well I'm in pretty good shape but hadn't been faithfully working out in the last few months and she totally kicked my butt!! I look forward to it everyday now. I just preordered the new Ripped in 30 and the 6 week 6 pack videos. I can't wait to get them. I don't really have time for an hour workout and this really combines all you need into a shorter time. I'm on Day 5 of Level 3 right now and it is definitely hard, a lot of the work is done in plank position but really works your whole body! I would highly recommend adding this one to your workout collection!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Busts your hump!","review":"I started this DVD a few weeks ago. I am a former military member and I don't remember basic training being this hard. You will probably feel sick and want to die the first time you do level one because I know I did. You do get used to it after the second or third time. I kept myself from weighing in every day and cut it down to once a week. I also measured parts of my body where I want to slim down. I didn't lose weight right away but I did remeasure myself after a week and I lost from 1/2 to 3/4\\" in most areas. I am no longer getting asked \\"Are you pregnant\\" anymore and I am more toned. The trick is to drink water and stay away from sugary drinks. Also, I went to WebMD and used the meal planner and created my daily meals so I can stay within my calorie limits. You have to fight for that body! Also, doing the workout with music only helps--when I hear voices talking to me it breaks my concentration. It is an awesome workout, especially for the price!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too hard for beginners!","review":"This is definitley a strenuous workout, but even the level 1 beginner routine is too intense for someone not already in shape. I hurt my knee almost immediately and then my back. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone with weak joints."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happily satisfied!","review":"I was recommended this video by one of my girlfriends and was a little skeptical at first but thought I would give it a try. I am not a huge work out person and had not worked out in a long long time prior to trying this video, so I was of course a little bit nervous. But after doing just the first week, I was hooked. It is an amazing workout and is only 20 minutes a day which is perfect for my lifestyle! It has definitely made me want to work out more and has encouraged me to want to get healthier!"},{"rating":"2","title":"OMG....FAN-TASTIC....A MUST BUY","review":"So I just bought this dvd 2 days ago and I have been using it for both days and even though I am just beginning I can tell that it is working for me. Now, I'm super out of shape and unfortunately as a result I am overweight as well. I love what she does on the biggest loser which is why I decided to try out this tape. Don't get me wrong....it is SUPER hard, but it is totally worth it. There are no breaks at all in the tape which at first seems crazy, but when I finished my first workout I realized that not having breaks made it go by really fast. The entire workout including the warmup/cooldown is about half an hour but I felt like only ten minutes had passed. I reccomend this to everyone :)."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW! What a workout","review":"Jillian is tough as usual, in this interval workout. 3 minutes of tough 4 limb strength moves, 2 minutes of heart thumping cardio, and 1 minute of tough abs....times 3! 3 different workouts, over 20 minutes each, with modifications for your level. HIGHLY suggest getting this workout!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Your muscles will burn...","review":"I work out regularly (run outside, go to gym), but it's getting too cold to run, and I'm getting too busy to drive to the gym and back.

I'm sure I'll be feeling this tomorrow, and that's the true sign of a good workout if you ask me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow and ouch","review":"I have done this for 4 days and I am already starting to see toning, but man do you feel this the first day i did it i just could not do it the next day every muscle in my body hurt but since then I have done 3 days in a row I am still sore but i make myself go on. I used to do the Firm everyday before having my last son was born and I thought that was a kick butt workout but man oh man you really feel the burn with Jillian"},{"rating":"1","title":"scratched DVD","review":"The 30 day shred program itself seemed good, but I could only get through part 1 as the DVD was scratched and stopped and skipped constantly.

I'm still on level 1, and when I'm ready I'll go to level 2 when I need a little more. Plus, it's only 20 min/day.

I went ahead and took the plunge!!! I will have to admit that it is harder than you would think for a routine that's only 20 minutes long. So I think I might be more out of shape than I thought, although my husband says that I'm \\"under worked\\". lol After the third day I was able to only have to catch my breath at two different stages during the circuit (asthma), and found other areas much easier to deal with... even able to do the advanced move in some areas!!! I highly recommend this DVD for anyone looking to make a change..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good workout for time-crunched","review":"I purchased this DVD along with a couple of others about a month ago. I wanted this DVD to use on those days when I oversleep or am time-crunched. I didn't want any excuses for missing a workout. This DVD is great because Jillian keeps your heart rate up the entire time which makes it pretty challenging. She has two people working out with her, each giving a beginner and an advanced version of the exercise.I was sweating more after doing this DVD for 20 minutes than I was the first time I did the Beginners Frontside DVD (which is 45 minutes), but I found that I wasn't as sore the next day as I was with the other DVD.While I really enjoyed this workout and will continue to do it when I'm short on time or on Sundays (my rest day), I don't know if 20 minutes of working out is going to make a huge difference without doing other things and that's why I gave it four stars rather than five."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I thought I would get bored doing the same workout every day, but each level is so quick and the exercises vary so quickly that I never get sick of it! This work out is both difficult for the advanced exercisers and easy for the newcomers. I noticed a difference in my appearance and my endurance within my first four days! I would definitely recommend this video to anyone looking to improve their overall fitness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware","review":"These light bulbs (as well as a number of others) are a total rip-off. You have to pay attention to what voltage is used to calculate (and state) the wattage and lumen output. The scam that's going on of late is to use 130 volts instead of 120 volts. Bottom line ... you are going to end up with a much dimmer light output than the wattage you're used to at 120 volts when you get a 130 volt rated bulb."},{"rating":"1","title":"Turn off the sound","review":"This video is soley for those who enjoy looking at the very handsome Colin Firth. The story is unlikely, confusing andsoon beomes very tiresome. There was not a spark of chemistry between the often undressed leads. If you love Colin Firth asI do, I suggest you turn off the sound and just enjoy the images of this beautiful man."},{"rating":"1","title":"Playmaker","review":"Well, this is not Colin's best. It is dangerously close to a thrown-together Hollywood hills soft core film. It is rare to see him play nasty. (He plays two characters actually, so his nastiness turns out not to be his real self.) There's some mystery, some twists and turns, some skin. The other actors are wooden, plot is thin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not thrilled.","review":"The premise was very interesting -- a woman put together out of the bodies of others -- but where Antieau takes this idea makes little connection with the idea itself. She quickly turns the story into a piece of feminist and New Age propaganda, harking back to an age of serenity when all women and men (clearly in that order) lived in peace and harmony with Mother Goddess Earth. There is no real plot, with what conflict there is (with the dark rapist/incestuous Father Lee) being all dull and predictable and wrapped up in a neat, tiny package at the end.Antieau's word-smithing style also irritated me. She writes in short, choppy sentences, which are regularly not even full sentences. It's like reading Hemingway but with his powerful vision condemned to a utopian New Ageism. On the other hand her choice of words can often evoke powerful imagery, but I found this redeeming feature to be drowned by the rest of the book's lackluster performance.Not recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Powerful Self-Indulgence","review":"I picked up the book because the author's name was familiar. The book is powerful; both the use of language and the story itself reminded me of The Female Man by Joanna Russ. Had this book been written in the early 70's, it likely would have received the same notoriety and generated the same debates regarding the nature of science fiction. The interleaving of the previous incarnations with the current \\"reality\\" is sometimes too abrupt. The only true criticism I have is that it needs a better editor. I found the writing sometimes self-indulgent, and that indulgence interfered with the storytelling. Again, the same criticism I have of Joanna Russ's work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Book!","review":"I read this book in a day, playing sick so that I wouldn't be disturbed! It really changed my outlook on life. I would recommend this book to ANYONE and often times do. It is very imaginative and really did something good for my soul. It gave me a new hope and respect for true love and fate. If you haven't read it yet, read it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"heart wrenching and thought provoking","review":"I first read this book years ago in a paper version. It's one of those books that must be reread every so often. Every time I read it I discover something new to think about. This book is moving and thought provoking. It chronicles Keelie's journey from waking up as a literal Frankenstein monster put together from parts of other women to her awakening self as woman and her role for all women. This is a book you will want to share with your best friends. It is devastating and ultimately empowering."},{"rating":"2","title":"Legally Blonde Soundtrack","review":"I like the songs on it.

Only half of a chapter contained short biographies of the different Cleopatra's in the Ptolemy dynasty.

A little disappointing beceause I expected instructions; that being said, I like the idea, meaning you can really practice anywhere, and ok, you're not going to suddenly stop walking in the streets and get into utkatasana, but you can practice the breating exercises, letting go etc. And you can practice an early sunday morning in a parck ;) I had fun trying to follow her in the first two small practices, and I'm going to try the others in the next few days...

This one is a little out there. If you are super experienced and want to be awesome at yoga this is a good dvd. If you're just looking to stretch, not a good choice. Pretty difficult moves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yoga for beginners?","review":"Absolutely NOT for beginners! I was excited when my book and dvd arrived. Those feelings were dashed right away. Tara says this is good for beginners. The workouts in this dvd were so fast and advanced that it was actually unmotivating. Half the time her hair is hanging in her face to it's hard to see/hear exactly what's going on. She breezes through poses so quickly there's no way I could keep up. My boyfriend couldn't keep up either and he has far more yoga experience than I do. The pulsing color changes made us dizzy and gave me a headache. This dvd is back in its case and at the bottom of the stack. Not sure I'll ever view it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointment","review":"I am a yoga teacher and I own many yoga dvds.Usually I can predict if it will be a winner.Well this time I was very wrong.I dont know why anyone gave it five stars. Firstly it is so distracing with the noise and the movement and most importantly are you supposed to follow along? There is no instruction at all! This is a dvd of Tara Stiles showing off her yoga poses! Very decieiving unless it should have been titled Tara Stiles doing her yoga for herself. Maybe she should watch shiva Rea or some of the other qualified teacher to see how you teach yoga on a dvd rather than just showing off the poses..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too advanced and confusing for high beginner - intermediate Yoga Student.","review":"After following Tara on Facebook on Youtube I was excited for this DVD. I am high beginner to intermediate and this is too confusing and difficult to follow along with. The setting is distracting, you can't understand her, there's really no instruction. Did I miss something?! I'm sure she is a great yoga instructor (she has a huge following!) but this DVD was perhaps a concept that needs more work. I will still try out her Jane Fonda Yoga Video and hope that's better suited for me! But my honest recommendation is: If you are a beginner to intermediate student wanting a CD that you can really learn from you should pass on this DVD. If you are a Tara Fan it could be a nice addition to your collection but I don't see it getting much use."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Hype than Value","review":"I love yoga, and have been practicing it regularly well for over 2 years. I feel super comfortable with the poses and enjoy classes with a variety of teachers. So when I got this DVD, I thought only great things would come of it. Unfortunately not. While Tara is awesome and truly knows her yoga, the DVD is far from an instructional tool. It can serve great as yoga entertainment, as yoga art indeed, but not as a DVD to help you with your yoga practice or to even be able to easily follow along or would even want to."},{"rating":"1","title":"a disappointed fan.","review":"I am an avid tara stiles follower. I love her videos on youtube, so i bought this dvd. The one hour of yoga instruction is very good, i think. The huge disappointment followed when i realized all of the NYC stuff is actually just her showing off for about 5 hours of footage that is not beneficial at all to the person who paid money to own this DVD. Yeah, of course you look great Tara Stiles, but that is not helping anyone here. We can not follow along your routines, there is no instruction. I searched for some kind of instruction audio feature, there is none. Just tons and tons of minutes of useless selfish yoga in NYC. unfortunate. I would like my money back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good workout for intermediate to advanced","review":"The hour long, in-studio session on this DVD is excellent -demanding but without crazy, circus-type stunts. It is comparable to the Sadie Nardini DVDs I've tried. The only drawback in my opinion is the monotone, sometimes mumbling instruction that at times gets drowned out by the music (perhaps recording the instruction separately would've helped). I found the additional sessions filmed throughout the city peculiar. They lack instruction and aren't filmed in a way that makes following along very easy. They are artfully edited and show off Tara's skill but these qualities are likely of secondary concern to most shopping for yoga DVDs. These are minor quibbles though and the hour long session alone makes this a worthy investment for anyone looking for a challenging yoga DVD that will leave you sweating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too old to be informative","review":"If you are only looking for an example of how historians used to write or how such writings compare to present day, then this book may well fullfill your needs.If, on the other hand, you are hoping to learn something on the history of London that isn't slanted to old fashioned thinking, ideals with outdated and sometimes false conclusions as to what \\"might have happened\\", then leave this book well alone.I found it sloppy in its chronological presentation, biased towards old fashioned ideals and eventually boring and un-informative."},{"rating":"2","title":"ctmal","review":"I couldn't put this book down.

It is a great source of the history of California in the 19th to 20th century and it has a lot of detail about migrants.

I think the book flows nicely but there were a few loose ends that I think could have been wrapped up more thoroughly."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you want to go to sleep.............","review":"I bought this CD based on a review sticker on the packaging. This was a huge mistake. NME said that it was the chill out album of the year. Ok, if you like the kind of chill music that you can fall asleep to then yes I agree! Please do not buy this album expecting an Ibiza, Cafe del Mar, or Serve Chilled series sound. The main review at the top of the page is right on - this is more of a global trance sounding CD, not much else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Prime Wills","review":"This package is a must! While some feel that these recordings are a step down from the Columbia years of the 30s and early 40s, I feel like the MGM years are actually the realization of everything that came before. It's remarkable how much spirit there was in these recordings, considering Bob's popularity was waning. You'd never know it! Also, while Tommy Duncan was Bob's best loved and known vocalist, I think everyone who fills in for him after 1948 when he left is just as good. It makes it interesting to hear the different vocal styles and adds variety to the classic Wills sound. Get this package. It's probably the best primer for the money if you've never heard Bob, and a great place to go if you already have the Columbia recordings. Enjoy. There'll never be another one like Bob Wills!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful performances by Itzhak Perlman","review":"One of the best violinist of our times.

This is a particularly good book, if you are interested in Eclipse plugin development and JUnit testing. The tutorial is pretty comprehensive and the book example evolves in a natural way. The only downside is that this book is targeted at Eclipse 2.1 rather than 3.0 (which is no wonder given that it predates 3.0 by more than six months). This doesn't really detract from the book because most of the examples are fairly generic and can be made to run in Eclipse 3.0 with minimal effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally shocked anyone likes this type of writing","review":"Very dated!

I do not need to bother looking for things that might be wrong or different in the performance. I can focus on the works. In this one, Symphony 7 comes out particularly well. I have the patience to wait for the last half, which for me is the more rewarding part. Many recordings of Symphony 7 fail.The two symphony sets are completed by the theater music and tone poems package:See Berglund, Sibelius: Pelleas et Melisande; Luonnotar; Kuolema; En Saga, EMI, 2CD.I don't have a review of that yet.

The detail of the book is also exceptional. He tells the reader why and how Wellington achieved his successes not just when."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incomplete and inconvenient","review":"This book, although had good intentions is a very inefficient and incomplete field guide. It only has pictures of some of the birds, and usually only one plumage, which makes it impossible as a reliable field guide for fall shorebirds and warblers, and juvenile birds. The pictures of the birds are also seperate from the descriptions and range maps. In addition the pictures are organized by color rather that family. So, if you know you are looking at a warbler you can't go to the warbler section you must find the section of the pictures that has e.g. birds with yellow plumage. Pictures of birds in flight are all but absent in this guide, so if you don't know your hawks, etc. you won't be any better off with this book. I would recommend a more complete and easy to use guide like the National Geographic field guide."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bird watchers requirement","review":"Love the colored pictures. . . . beautiful!

This is one of those I take (have since it's publication). While I do not feel it is as good as Peterson's guides (or even those of Sibley for that matter), I do find this work to be very useful as a supplemental guide. It does have information not found in a couple of the other guides and at times the actual photograph, rather than a drawing, help identify. I cannot say that I would be comfortable with only this as a guide, but I have found it useful. The photographs are quite good actually, and a joy to examine. For quick identification though, after a brief glimps of a given bird, I really need a bit more. Overall recommend this one highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"great field guide","review":"I love these books.

The LARGEST picture size is 4X6, which is the orange tree in the product picture, and they go down from there.Good stuff - Well made, nice looking, and something different.2 pictures fit in each plastic frame back to back, so it's a new adventure every time you turn it. This would be great on some kind of motorized turntable. Otherwise turn it once a week or something and you'll have different views all of the time.

The glove is rather thin in general, I am not sure why the seam is so thick at the tip of the fingers, but it ruins the ability to push buttons easily with glove one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tightest pair of XL Gloves I have ever Worn","review":"These are good winter work gloves but they are a bit tight for their size.

I ordered the small size based on the product page description, but I could not slip me hand completely in. A returned and ordered medium this time, thanks to Amazon.After trying very hard on medium size, I was still not able to move my fingers and could not band my palm at all. I have returned back this size too. I wish I could have use it, though like the quality of material used."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good product","review":"I'm working overseas in support of our troops and I purchased these gloves because I've heard that the weather gets pretty cold here. Well, When I first got the gloves it wasn't cold at all. Mind you, I'm not using them everyday. I believe I have had the gloves now for 3 months and the stitching has come apart from the fingers exposing the guts. They did not keep my hands warm prior to them falling apart and definitely not now! If I were you, I wouldn't even waste my time on these gloves. SO much for going by the reviews of purchasers. I'm planning on writing the company in an attempt to get my money back or a replacement if I can. It's hard enough being away from your loved ones. But when you spend your hard earned money for peace of mind and it fails, that sucks. Now I'm going to have to wait at least another 14 days to receive replacements in 21 degree weather..... DO NOT PURCHASE....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Read.","review":"I gave it 2 stars because they are waterproof.As far as being warm, forget it. I needed a pair of warm, waterproof gloves for snow blowing in the northeast. We just got 10\\" on snow, it was only 22 degrees and a bit windy, my snow blower is equipped with hand warming grips so my palms stayed warm. After only 1 hour outside my finger tips were so cold I couldn't feel them. I had to go back to my Thinsulate gloves, I was able to stayed snow blowing for at least 2 hrs however my hands did get wet.They also run small, if you take a XL glove they buy the XXL, it may or may not help keep the fingers warmer with more room to hold or create heat.I am going to try Thinsulate mittens and possibly ones that I can put warmers inside if they make them. If I fine a pair that works well I will add them to this review."},{"rating":"1","title":"Janet B","review":"I am not happy with this product at all. They claim to be waterproof and they are not at all. The gloves get wet on the inside and then the inside lining sticks to your fingers so when you pull your hand out of the glove the lining comes out. When you try to put them back on it is difficult to get the lining back in the right finger spots. I would not buy these again."},{"rating":"1","title":"I returned them","review":"I ordered these gloves to use for work (I work as a rural mail carrier for USPS). I found them to be unsuitable for my purposes. They did seem to be waterproof, but they made my hands sweat like crazy. I had to leave my hand outside the vehicle just to keep from sweating so much. The gloves did not give me as much dexterity and were not as flexible as I expected. My search for a suitable glove continues."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not too good for hunting","review":"I splurged and bought these, nearly $30 gloves thinking that they would keep my hands warm and be nibble enough to handle a rifle on my very first hunting trip in northern Arizona...well, lets put it this way, I wore those little cheap, stretchy - one size fits all gloves and they were way warmer. I even tried pre-heating them by placing them on the defroster in the jeep but to no avail. Sorry, but I think I keep them only because I feel guilty returning them because they have elk blood on them but they don't work at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent gloves","review":"First impression is that they're light, they don't feel heavy at all and they're pretty comfortable. There were some small issues with the sewing on the pair I received, but I hope the thread won't unravel or something. The wrist lock is pretty good, it does it's job, also I must say they are just warm enough for me, no need for them to be warmer. They feel real comfy so I'm happy with the purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"The Ultimate Winter Glove\\"","review":"If you need to your hands to stay warm and dry in the winter, these gloves are what you need! I work both inside and outside all year, so I can be in temperatures of 50 degrees or less for several hours a day; not to mention those days when it snows or the temperatures are sub-zero. Also, I have a house which faces north and requires me to remove the ice and snow from my gutters and roof by hand in heavy snow storms. After working outside for about 31/2 hours at our last big snow, my gloves were wet, but my hands were dry and warm. These gloves are both an extremely great value at the price Amazon offers, but are also include a velcro strap that seals them up at your wrist and are very comfortable! I would recommend to order a size larger than you normally wear, i.e. if you wear a large, order the XL size, I grew up in the mountains, and now live in the flatlands, but it still gets really cold and I wish I'd had these gloves long ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oddly proportioned","review":"I tried three different sizes of these gloves, L, XL and XXL. I couldn't even get the large on, and they were even too tight even for my girlfriend's fairly small hands. The XL were still too tight around my palms even though the fingers were very long. The XXL finally fit around my palms and were OK for my finger's girth but were so long that I could barely use them. I'm not sure what proportions a person needs to have to fit these gloves. They seem to be meant for someone with small palms, and skinny, very long fingers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what advertised","review":"These gloves are NOT winter gloves. My \\"Job Lot\\" gloves costing $5.00 gives better warmth. They may in fact be waterproof, but I cannot say. Also the sizes run small so if you decide to try them, go to next larger size."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 problems..","review":"These gloves do what they advertise, they are weatherproof and quite durable.. except, If you plan on putting them on & taking them off often.. you may, like i did.. have a hard time with the inner fabric (lining), apparently.. its just a thinner glove within the exterior glove.. it isn't attached to anything and just moves free, it tends to get turned inside out when you take your hand out and on a cold rainy day, trying to fight to get your fingers to fit back in is ridiculously hard, i wound up giving up and getting a less weatherproof glove to finish the job. also, cause of the inner lining not being attached to the finger tips, it leaves about half an inch of exterior glove hanging over your actual finger.. not a big problem but, feels very weird."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly what I needed","review":"These gloves work as described - waterproof and very flexible/comfortable. I ordered medium at first based on sizing recommendations, but I should have known better. I am a woman with long fingers and the medium size had too short of fingers for me.

The 8 D cell battery is a good choice IMHO if you don't want a rechargeable battery. D cells are available most anywhere and give a long use time.

Unfortunately, it ends with his recording of \\"Sealed with a Kiss\\", which doesn't begin to compare with Brian Hyland's excellent recording of the same song. More unfortunate than the inclusion of \\"Sealed with a Kiss\\" is the exclusion of Bobby Vinton's last major hit, \\"Melody of Love\\". If that had been included on this disc, this would be a truly excellent compilation. As it is, it's very good, but not all it could have been."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor","review":"There are two things I absolutely love about Bobby Vinton's music. First, listening, you realize you never have to go to the doctor to ask for qualudes againSecond and far more important, Vinton's music gave John Paul George and Ringo something to wipe the floor with. If younger people don't understand why \\"She Loves You\\" sounded so fresh and brilliant in 1964, take a listen to some of these tracks. The fab four really were hard rock, and Vinton's songs puts this in stark releif.I can understand why people sixty and older liked this music; it was another world, a very nieve one, so the appeal of this makes sense.But if you grew up on rock after the Beatles, or even if you listen to Elvis and Chuck Berry, this stuff just dies a slow death in mid play, and makes you want to do the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD, I had a cassette years ago and missed it alot","review":"This is a great example of real sentimental harmonious and nostalgic music.

I found the story to be frustrating, and at times I was very annoyed with \\"Tasha.\\" She seemed very immature at 30."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't tolerate","review":"I love Jane Green, but couldn't get much beyond the first chapter of this one.

The main character, Tasha was the most annoying I have come across in some time. She wasn't even a likeable person. She was whiny, self indulgent, judgemental and materialistic.

It just keeps getting better."},{"rating":"1","title":"And I thought that nothing could be worse than Swapping Lives","review":"I'm generally a fan of Jane Green's work and after suffering through Swapping Lives I figured that she must have had an off day (year) or been under pressure to crank something out and just threw some words on a page.I was sure that nothing she wrote could be as bad as Swapping Lives but she actually managed to come up with something worse.Has there ever been a character this selfish and this unlikable? I hung on hoping that she would get what she deserved, either hit by a bus or at the very least dumped and doomed to live alone with her cats but the ending was just as lame and pointless as the rest of the story.The other characters in the book weren't much better, either just as selfish and slutty or so stupid that you found yourself fuming.Save your money and buy something (anything) else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self-indulgent twaddle","review":"I totally agree with the reviews by Sebastian and Berthap. I have read other, much earlier Jane Green novels before and quite enjoyed them for what they are (enjoyable \\"chick lit\\" about love and friendship etc). This one was dreadful though. I had expected it to change perspectives between the different characters but it is all told from the point of view of one very unlikeable vain, superficial character. She is the type of woman I would want to shake (or avoid like the plague) if I met her in real life. I also thought the writing was very lazy, ie, repetitive, contradictory, full of cliches etc etc. I think that after this and Jemima J (which I didn't mind but certainly didn't like as much as other Jane Green books)I will be staying well clear of this writer.My recommendation for potential buyers - don't buy this book, check out writers Sheila O'Flanagan or Elizabeth Noble instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maybe not her best, but it was still fun!","review":"I'm surprised that more people didn't like this book. Yes, Tasha had some problems, but that was the point of the book.

This book was boring and really long winded. I felt a traped at a party with a shallow and snobby person who can't stop rambling on about themselves. Tasha was very annoying vain and wipmy. You've thought she was 16 not 30 from the way she acted. Straight Talking is very close to Mr.Maybe. I.E. Thirty-something Tasha keeps falling for the worng men. She is very pretty well spoken and posh posh posh. In therapy she tells of her troubled childhood and why she is the basketcase she is today. The plot and ending were so obvious you knew what was going to happen before it even started. If you looking for a good Jane Green read stick to Bookends or Jemima J, but pass this one up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed.","review":"I read this book just about 2 weeks ago and I seriously cannot tell you what it was about...it is that memorable. It was a bit painful to get through but I finished it. It was just ok, nothing special, nothing spectacular. I preferred \\"The Other Woman\\" to this book.

Interesting, I thought - there has to be a reason she sells so well. So I bought this, her first novel.The words \\"Navel gazing\\", \\"trite\\", \\"boring\\", and \\"retread\\" come to mind. The \\"talk\\" is so idiotic, so simple, that I would never want to befriend these people. And isn't that what you want from chick lit?

This book was terrible. I hated the main character--truly hated her, and it wasn't the \\"it's fun to hate her\\" kind of distaste. Her friends were all disasters. Was anyone happy in their personal lives at all in this book? She was so shallow, sleeping with all the wrong men. Even the attempt to sleep with one man, where the chemistry was so intense, but it turned out to be a disappointment? That was unbelieveable.***SPOILER ALERT** I also found the idea that she was not in love with her best friend and had no attraction to him....and then all of a sudden she's in love and attracted to him? Uh, no. Not possible. Yes, it's possible for chemistry to grow, but not when you clearly did not love him or were not attracted to him and then you do a 180. Sorry Jane Green, you readers don't buy it.Do yourselves a favor and read Beach House or Mr. Maybe. Far more fun reads."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not high on my list...","review":"I patiently waited for this book to be released, because if you've read other Jane Green books then you know she's worth waiting for...But- I must say I was disappointed. I felt like I was constantly waiting for something exciting or unexpected to happen to the characters. I found the series of events highly predictable and almost imaginationless...I think most lacking was a true climax to the story. I don't think this is Jane Green's best work, but if it is the first book of hers you've read don't let it stop you from reading more- I promise the rest are better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bridget Jones Gone Obsessed","review":"Straight Talking was a wonderfully written novel about a woman's quest for love and passion.

She is probably my very favorite author in the whole world. I have had this book for years (it was published in the UK ages ago) and I think that people are going into this book thinking it's new and will be up to her current standards. That is not the case. This is her very first book and only shows moments of her talent and brilliance. Later books really express how much she had grown and how very talented she really is.That being said --- this book is still really good and right up there with other \\"Chick Lit\\" books on the market today. It holds it's own against those currently being published - but might pale in comparison to her previous offers. If you go into this as any other chick book - you'll be fine. Just don't think this is a NEW Jane Green book. You might be disappointed.Cheers!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not her best work","review":"I am not a fan of the drivel known as \\"chick lit\\", but I often give Jane Green a pass because she is amusing at times.This book is not amusing.

I hate opening a book and know before the first chapter is out just what a glamourous and shallow life the protagonist leads and how great her clothes are and how good looking she is.I couldnt sympathize with the decisions she made.

They're playing for a small audience so you can hear the individual claps and even children in the audience. This album is all acoustic with and only one song has singing in it. I am a big fan of In Extremo and I always wanted to hear them play acoustic music which is why I bought this cd. I was a bit disappointed because they use the bagpipes way too much so the songs start to blend together. I was expecting them to use more types of medievel instruments than the few they did use especially the bagpipes. Since there is no singing the singer explains, in german, the songs to the audience which slows the album down. On one track they play Queen's we will rock you on the bagpipes which I thought was funny.

Reading it was like a mini-retreat and, of course, being so busy running a business, it took me too long to realize what a priority it was to just sit still and absorb the words of Dr. Pattakos. When I did I found profound meaning in the message. I intend to read this again and again, especially during those times when my life seems to control me, especially in ways that are troubling to my human spirit.

Alex's comment about seeing my work as a mission in one of the books \\"Meaning Questions,\\" is a great example about how the author uses brief descriptions of \\"Meaning Moments,\\" and exercises called \\"Meaning Questions,\\" to involve the reader in the application fo the books teaching.This is a well thought out book with practical benefits that I would recommend highly to all.Michael Skaggs, Cedar Crest, New Mexico"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money.","review":"I was so disappointed in this book.

And, I must say that this book is quite well written and easy to understand(it is actually handwritten and not typed). It teaches the reader to be more concerned with what he/she is observing than what they are putting down on paper. The author uses many examples to illustrate his points he is tring to get accross. However, this book will not be of any aid to those who are searching for actual techniques and drills (such as step by step excersizes). The lessons taught are somewhat similar in substance to those taught by Dr. Betty Edward's Book \\"Drawing on the right Side of the Brain\\". I would recommend this title to those who are interested in drawing for the shear enjoyment of it. So, in that respect I give it 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"No gain.....","review":"Very stranger approach.

On the more practical end, while there is certainly nothing new about a simple knit hoodie (even with nice waist shaping), knitting it in the fiber suggested in the book makes both the knitting and the wearing a treat. To me, it is the kind of knitting experience you get when you go to your favorite yarn store, see something really cute that you never would have thought of on your own, and walk away with a really happy purchase and really happy knitting vibes."},{"rating":"2","title":"California Style Cozy & Elegant Knitting Projects","review":"I really like this book. Susan Mischer is a very nice woman, unlike some of the knitting store owners here in Los Angeles. What is up with expensive yarn and attitude?

The patterns are on the simpler side (I'm an intermediate knitter), but they are very cute & wearable, i.e. hoodies, polo shirt, dresses, accessories.

These books provided the depth I needed.These books could not be more useful - if there is one thing I could say Goldworthy has opened my eyes to, it is that the Gospel is central in all things. We see everything from Christ. He is the supreme revelation of God himself. All the prophets testify of Him, and he is the one who has fulfilled the prophetic hope.These books are easy to read, non technical yet surprisingly detailed books on biblical theology.

In the introduction the editors write that for some travel is \\"a salve for weary body and soul.\\" This phrase could aptly be applied to the book as well. It soothed the worries of my day and refreshed my perspective on the good things in my life. The stories evoke a sense of adventure, the pleasure of an unexpected kindness, the opening of new worlds, and the discovery of one's self along the way. There are one or two stories that I almost skipped, since they represented a lifestyle that seemed awkward to me - but that is often what travel entails, and the discomfort offers sparks of excitement to the journey.

They sounded like fantasies of Dilbert's travels, NO, not even that exciting. Some even sounded made-up, yes, contrived for the book.

The table of contents is well organized, but when you start reading the chapters they are badly organized internally. It is hard to know what the author tried to tell you after reading a chapter.

Not that they're not good songs, but they are barely a taste of what you hear in the film and it definitely leaves out a major portion.

Sorry for the bad review. $32 with shipping and handling--well, if it wasn't such a hassle to go through the motions of asking to return the product for a full refund coming my way, I would do that. I'll just have to listen to my Hank Williams albums instead. Now for a fan of movie music, music from the late 50s and early 60s, try on \\"American Graffiti\\" for size.

Frakes had a good idea here and with a little more dedication to the project it could have turned out very well. I found the grammar to be clumsy in many places, not refering to dialog which can be attributed to the character's patterns of speech. The short chapters were extremely annoying to me. At one point near the end of the book, characters were issued AK-47s and two pages later, within the same mini-chapter, were firing M-16s. The only reason I can imagine that this book made it to print is that the publisher hoped it would succeed on Frakes' fame as an actor and director of Star Trek TV shows and theatrical movies. It certainly couldn't do so on merit. I like Frakes, but this work is too amateurish and not ready for prime time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kind of generic, but a fun read","review":"Entertaining novel about aliens plotting to take over Earth.

This stuff is amazing. At my work, we often have to remove 2\\" plus bolts that have been rusting in place for the past 30-60 years. Kroil is one of the few things that actually helps. If we still can't get those bolts off with kroil, we usually have to heat the holes up till red hot to get them out. And if that doesn't work, they get cut off. There really is no comparison with kroil and other oils. Kroil leaves no residue that will end up gumming up after a few months like WD-40 does. I started using kroil for household uses, and it does great for tools, windows, and sewing machines as well. Basically, if you have anything mechanical, a can of kroil is one of the best investments you can buy to keep them running optimally. 3-in-1 oil on crack... that's kroil."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Penetrating Oil on the market","review":"I purchased this oil after reading about it on a firearm cleaning site.

Ran a clean swab through. Then run some extreme copper solvent. I also recently used it on some frozen rusted bolts on the exhaust pipe of a tractor. Sprayed it on, let it sit overnight.

There are several minor (but annoying) errors, such as missing words, conflicting dates, and contradictory facts (e.g., the age of a character is given as \\"one year seven months,\\" and later in the SAME LETTER, as \\"two years seven months.\\" This is nit-picking, I suppose. All in all, I loved the books, and wish there would be a third."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent continuation","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed the original Letters from Pemberley about Darcy and Elizabeth's first year of marriage and eagerly read through this continuation of that story. Overall I enjoyed the book very much, although I do have a few bits of criticism. First would be that this book was not as detailed (the first book only covered a year while this the second book covered five years yet was not significantly longer than the first). That and the last year in the book having so much drama - while yes, Elizabeth and Darcy would have experienced their share of disappointments and sorrows in life (no life, if attempting to be realistic, is completely free from sorrow). The last year seemed a bit soap opera like, but with a sit-com (we fix all life's problems in 30 minutes) ending. Make no mistake though, I did like the book and should Ms. Dawkins decide to continue the series I will definitely read the next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying","review":"A book has to be very, very bad for me to put it down without finishing it. And this one was. I know the author is not Jane Austen, but this book was completely missing the Austen feel for me. Elizabeth's intelligence and clever wit is missing and in fact I thought she came across as a bit smug. I found the writing tedious and the characters annoying. The final straw for me was that characters from other Austen books were sprinkled in as acquaintances that crossed paths with the Pride and Prejudice characters. I left this book at a beach house we were visiting and never looked back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well written and enjoyable!","review":"This was a very fast read but to anyone that loves Darcy and Elizabeth this is a must own! As in the first book, the letters are compelling and so well written that you can certainly follow what has happened through out the years -- and not wonder about possible gaps. Enjoyable from the first letter to the last!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Far Fetched - (Spoilers)","review":"I liked the first one so I bought. I'm still not clear on how Darcy stays alive after being in a coma for about a month in the 1800's. Did they have IV drips back then?If you can put up with it being totally unrealistic, it's not bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beck as a team player, great quality, well balanced","review":"This is Beck with structure. The all around quality of the supporting musicians is terrific. The piano work is excellant and is blended well with the playing of Jeff. The style of this disc is distictively different from all of the other Jeff Beck works. This deserves a close listen, it's not just hot licks, there's alot of good listening in this one. This CD is severely under rated by people who are not paying close attention to one of Jeff's best works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as I remembered it.","review":"In my teens I had this album and dug it a lot. This early Cd release sounds very harsh. Almost unlistenable. Although, there are a couple of good instrumentals that hint at the direction Blow By Blow took ... overall this is a weak record. Perhaps,if I had been able to find an affordable and respectably re-mastered version it would have been worth keeping."},{"rating":"1","title":"jeff does dylan?","review":"This is one of Jeff's duller albums even though Jeff plays great, has a terrific band with Max Middleton on electric piano and Cozy Powell on drums and Rod Stewart-soundalike Bob Tench on vocals. The problem is the songs. Jeff hasn't quite got his technique for instrumentals perfected (that will arrive with Blow by Blow), so the ones here sound tentative and odd. Other songs seem like throwaways--including the guitar god's cover of a very minor Dylan song. Strangely, two of Jeff's best ever songs are here: the bizarrely titled Ice Cream Cakes (the lyrics are never the point on a Jeff record) that features spine-tingling interplay between Jeff and keyboardist Max, and the over-the-top almost Hendrexian Going Down, with some of the most mindblowing feedback drones ever waxed. The album's almost worth it for just those two songs, but then again they make you realize how much better the whole project could have been."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Beck","review":"This album is beautifully crafted. Bob Tench's voice is soulful, and Jeff's playing is magnificent. The songs on this album are better then Rough and Ready, and the band as a whole has a very interesting chemistry. Of all the Jeff Beck Group albums, this one comes out on top."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie, cool soundtrack","review":"I enjoy the CD set very much. Santana's performance of \\"In a Silent Way\\" by Miles Davis is worth the price of admission right there. This version goes into my all time favorite tracks list - the young Neil Schon is spactacular. Honorable mentions go to Elvin Bishop, the later day Quicksilver, and critically important, Bill himself. My question is, where is the DVD? I saw it on cable televsion several years ago and before that about twenty years ago in a theater. There is likely some legal BS with the estate preventing the release. Please get past it and make this available - that is the real time piece."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard as a Rock","review":"If you threw a quilt on the ground it would be just as soft.

Anyone seeking to understand the relationship between the United States and China needs to read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Panoramic View of an Historic Visit","review":"This is an excellent book that should appeal to very wide audience of readers interested in foreign policy or American history in general. Macmillan does an excellent job of zooming in and out of the main story line to give the reader all the background information necessary to truly appreciate Nixon's visit, while still providing minute details of the time Nixon spent in China. The diplomatic tension comes through strikingly in the writing and at times there are serious doubts about whether the trip will be a success. Nixon and Mao's complex characters are well-handled but they are not the sole focus of the book. Kissinger and Chou En-lai play central roles and their own peculiarities are enjoyably revealed. This book is an especially good read because so much has changed between our countries since 1972, and Macmillan does a great job of turning back the clock and to paint an excellent portrait of Maoist China."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nixon and Mao","review":"The book arrive in the condition advertised.

The author has no concept of proper writing skills or how to word this book. Who the heck cares about this event that happened well over 40 years ago?! Margaret talks in circles, frequently gets off subject, goes on and on about something, and then goes backwards. I am ashamed that I have to read this piece of bad literature!"},{"rating":"2","title":"it is definitive and complete, but not that important","review":"I really like these songs, but they seem a little contrived and not \\"important\\" (best description I think) because they are just so focused on being soulful that they kind of miss the mark. I have found that a lot of popular music seems to do this, and Marvin Gaye is leagues ahead of those people, but honestly I was a little dissappointed after I was done listening. Al Green's music seems much better to me, I got both cd's at the same time. I would still recommend this cd, if you have heard songs like \\"lets get it on\\" or whatever and you REALLY like them. contrived sappy singing and little bitty complaints just don't do it for me in music, and I felt that many songs were like this on the set. I still enjoy it, but not that much. Al Green's greatest hits is a much better choice for a new fan expanding into the genre. Also Otis Redding."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enough of what you need","review":"Hey, I'm not a huge Marvin Gaye fan... I mean, I'm not going out of my way to find the rarest, most obscure early Motown cuts or anything like that. I'm the kind of Marvin-Gaye-fair-weather-friend that happens to really dig Marvin's straight forward hey-baby-give-me-some-loving vibe. Yep, \\"Let's Get It On\\" is what I really want to hear.So, given those factors, this compilation fills all those needs and wants admirably. It even provides some early Marvin stuff I had never heard before but quite enjoy. The track order flows smoothly and pleasantly to set that mellow Marvin Gaye mood I'm looking for. What more do you want?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great starter CD set for the beginner collector!","review":"I must have EVERY possible recording from this gifted artist! This CD set showcases all of his hits and Motown is always gracious enough to include some that were in the vault (is that to make us spend the money?) Nevertheless, the packaging is excellent. I gave it 4 stars because 99% of the recordings I already have and as stated before, the packaging is excellent, but 5 stars for the serious beginner collector."},{"rating":"1","title":"Larceny by the Author!!!!","review":"Too bad Mr Ham didn't research his book. 1) Pete Gray played in 1945 before Bill Veeck owned the Browns. 2) Steeler fans, he gives credit for the \\"Immaculate Reception\\" to the Raiders and doesn't even mention the Steelers 3) The Roger Maris Asterisk - Mr. Ham there never was an asterisk! 4) Your Softball treatment of the lying Pete Rose is wrong. All this and I only read 1/3 of the book before I became disgusted with all the errors. Don't waste your money. I am not impressed with the authors not verifying all the facts.

I absolutely would not recommend this product to anyone for any reason."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the money","review":"I purchased my pair of Youngstown gloves for use at my job, as a grounds keeper. The majority of my work is landscaping maintenance and care of plants. Obviously, this involves much of my time hand watering and maintaining the irrigation system. Now, Florida winters are not all that extreme, but when your hands are wet, they sure feel extreme. These gloves have kept my hands warm and dry, and lived up to my expectations in this regard. I've found them to be durable as well, as that I'm busy digging, raking, and using my hands doing labor throughout the day. The only reason I've given them four stars rather than five is from my experience using them while riding my bicycle. I wish they were warmer...but, you can't have everything-buy them anyway, for the aforementioned reasons."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked for one day.","review":"Ordered these to work in freezing and wet conditions, scrubbing out water and feed bowl for wild animals at a wildlife refuge this winter. The lining of the right glove broke free from the glove on the second use. The \\"thermal\\" lining failed on the third use. My hands were frozen and felt a bit damp so the waterproofiness may have failed too.Very disappointed. This is a decent bit of money to spend on gloves that fail so quickly.I'm sure the gloves would perform better in milder conditions.

The video does not idolize them and does a good job of staying neutral, admitting that many find them to be a pest despite their high intelligence. Doesn't have enough information to make it worth watching over and over IMHO, but worth seeing simply because its the only video i have found about crows."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"Most people consider crows to be nuisances or just another dumb bird, however this documentary proves them wrong. Crows are highly intelligent omnivores who care for their young far longer than most people realize and who have highly developed brains which allow them to solve complex problems and interract with the world around almost like a monkey can. They also speak 2 crow languages and are capable of solving problems using tools.This documentary was highly informative and really helped me understand that crows are highly intelligent animals worthy of being observed and preserved. I would recommend this film to those interested in the life of crows. 5 stars! Very intriguing."},{"rating":"2","title":"I will buy his next book but...","review":"I wanted to love this as much as I loved \\"The Piano Tuner\\"...but it just didn't grab me. I spent much of the time trying to figure out if we were in the present day or in the future when global warming has REALLY kicked in. (I kept getting a feeling like I was reading \\"Friend of the Earth\\" meets \\"The Running Man\\".)I also thought maybe more would be made of the \\"sixth sense\\" of the main character. All of this second guessing means that I didn't appreciate the careful drawing of Isabel and her relationship with her brother. I liked it - but not in a way that will stay with me the way Mason's first book did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Started slow, but then picked up...","review":"This book started a little slow for me. I was almost to the point were I thought about giving up (something I hate to do) when the story and pace picked up and I found myself getting totally engrossed.There is a \\"cut to the chase\\" quality about the writing that I really enjoyed. There is no unnecessary dialog and description, just enough to put you in the moment. I particularly liked the fact that there is no clearly defined time and place in which this story is happening (although the President Kennedy reference leads the reader to believe it's the early 1960's.) This story could be taking place anywhere - a South American country, the Dominican Republic or a southern US state.I liked the character of Isabel a great deal. You can really feel her desperation and loneliness. She'll stay with me for a long time. A four star recommendation only because of the slow start."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never could get into it","review":"I absolutely loved The Piano Tuner, so couldn't wait to get my hands on A Far Country. I read the first third of the book and just could not get into it. The first third could have been condensed into a page as far as I was concerned. I finally skipped to the last few pages where she's finally reunited with her brother. It was a horribly boring, tedious book.

Lovecraft is a superlative writer...a man touched by genius. People like Stephen King, Dean Koontz, and the hapless Anne Rice are kindergarten compared to him. This compendium of tales demonstrates why, if Poe is Beethoven, Lovecraft is Schubert. Some of the stories are better-not-dangle-my-foot-from-the-bed classics. All are superbly written, with a baroque style that seems perfectly appropriate, and that heightens the tension.

P. Lovecraft is recognized as one of the greatest horror writers of the bygone age. This neatly bound book not only contains his best short stories, but is also an aesthetic item in itself. The smooth, crisply printed sleeve, combined with its thick, sturdy cover give the impression that this book BELONGS amongst the classics of literature. Note that this book is a medium sized codex, with medium sized print (for those of you who might have to worry about shelf space or have trouble reading).Be warned, though, this volume does NOT contain ALL of his short stories.That is perhaps the only reason I cannot give this book five stars in recommendation."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of all time","review":"The best horror writer, that is - I have no doubt about that. There is no one like Lovecraft who can lift the veil of our comfortable familiar universe and hint at what horrors may lurk beneath. Not only does he conjure entirely believable horrors - made believeable by the scientific detail and earnest tone of his prose - the writing itself is beautiful, poetic and artful, an aspect of Lovecraft's work not commented on often enough, in my opinion. He remains the master of the genre; no one has quite reached the peaks of macabre terror like H.P., and that he remained largely unknown until after death seems a cruel joke. The man was a genius, and this collection is all the proof you'll need."},{"rating":"2","title":"The goat with a thousand kudos","review":"Lovecraft was the father of modern horror (not Poe) and in this collection you'll see why. Peter Straub did a wonderful job of editing this book, and the Library of America should be commended for bringing to light one of America's true masters of the macabre. \\"The dreams in the witch house\\" is arguably Lovecraft's best writing; and thankfully it wasn't excluded. Original, imaginative (to say the least), and full of chills, this collection is a must for all fans of the genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very attractive collection of stories.","review":"I've only recently started reading H.P. Lovecraft with the purchase of two books from Amazon. And while I've only sampled a few of his stories so far, this particular book is very nice to have on my shelf regardless of how big a fan I become.Under the black, dust cover it is a very plain, classical looking book that suits the atmosphere of Lovecraft's writings very well.The only thing that would make it seem like even more of a tome would be if it were about four times larger.But if you can picture yourself in a housecoat, sitting in a musty old wing back chair, smoking a cigar or a pipe and sipping a goblet of wine or brandy, while letting yourself get lost in a fine book, this is the one for you.It's just that classy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovin' Lovecraft","review":"Great stories, cheap, neat little bookmark thing...The problem?Minor as it may be, the pages and binding are awfully thin to the point that the bible pages seem as thick as a pop-up book and you end up spending most of the time that would be spend reading on making sure you don't rip the pages as you turn them.

The one thing I do like is the front cover - a really cute design and a place to put a picture of the mom-to-be or the baby. Otherwise, it is very underwhelming. The pages are relatively small (you could fit one 4x6 picture on a page) and so there isn't a lot of room for pasting bits of the napkins, ribbons, etc. Also, the invitation I used would definately not fit on the page dedicated to the invitation. There are pages for all the basic information (the scene, menu, guest list, baby gifts, crystal ball- prediction for baby, advice pages, wisdom from the grandparents, shower fun and games, shower keepsakes, and photos), but it was totally uninspiring.I got another shower album from Hallmark (the one with the sun on the front) and liked it a lot better - it even had a page dedicated to the wrapping paper from baby's presents (which this one didn't!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"So cute!","review":"This book is so cute and exactly what I was looking for.

I called Bosch to report the fraud, that someone was reworking their fuel pumps and counterfitting their brand. They guy told me that they use OEM components from other vendors in Bosch products.

Either chew two or three pieces simultaneously, or just buy a pack of Bubblicious at the grocery store before your flight instead.As far as the ginger, yes, the gum is better than airplane ginger ale that uses fake ginger flavoring. However, the gum shell is kind of hard and the ginger flavor just seems a little bit off. Not sure if there's enough ginger to affect your tummy.Fyi--this is actually the identical product as the Sea-band anti-nausea gum that's sold under a couple different names via Amazon (same packaging and everything).It was worth a shot.

Edging the first two rooms went well.However, by the third room, I began having difficult keeping the brush from sliding inward with even the smallest amount of pressure placed on the product. Switching brushes did not help; it appeared the channel and \\"locking\\" mechanism were not strong enough to hold the brush in place. With the brush too high in the unit, there was limited contact with the paint and thus no edging took place.Eventually out of frustration I simply switched back to the old method of painters tape and edging with a paint brush.Since then I have used this edger in a small bathroom but as a roller (not an edger) so it has provided some use as a fairly expensive small roller.Gail"},{"rating":"1","title":"Please Don't Buy This Item!","review":"I ordered 3 boxes of the Mio 3-D Wallpaper back in February.

That's why I shop here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the same quality and built as before - beware","review":"I ordered this filter 2 years ago and purchased another one now for my friend. It was absolutely not the same product as before. The plastic was poorly made and it was not the durable ABS plastic as before, seems like the producer tried to cut cost and switched their supplier.The filter included has washers that has strong chemical smells which caused water to smell(as one reviewer had already mentioned). In addition, the internal dimension of the filter is made longer than a standard filter, this made it impossible to use an after market filter - if you attempted to use a standard 9.75 inch filter like I did, you will find water leaking through the top and bottom seal since the filter housing is not long enough to seal the filter properly.Unfortunately, this is no longer a product that I would recommend to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"CHEAP PRODUCT...Bad and Painful Experience","review":"Poor water taste..I hate even drinking water using this water filter..

The water here is ok but has a bad aftertaste. This filter looks solidly built, extremely easy to hook up although the instruction could be better, like showing how to install the filter which is actually very easy. The filter is 0.5 micro, better than the description, and much bigger than the typical filter inside the fridge.I compared the taste of tap water, frige filtered water (a SamSung), and water from this filter (from a tap). This filter wins handsdown! It even has a faint sweet aftertaste to it. The frige filtered water comes second, which is noticably worse tasteting than water from this filter. The tap water in comparison is undrinkable without ice.For the same amount of money for a fridge filter I get this wonderful system with two high quality 0.5 micro filters. Can't be beat!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely worth it.","review":"I had a product very similar to this from Sears about 15 yrs ago. This one works great, I like it very much.

I think they have a manufacturing issue with that.The quality is as good or better than the sears one I had before.What came to me is exactly the one pictured.All in all I would buy this again and will recommend it to friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard to beat for the $$","review":"I just moved from WA state to San Jose, CA and was disgusted by the taste and smell of the city water here. It may meet regs for safety, but who cares if nobody can stand to drink it? In desperation, I went to buy a small faucet Brita unit and it barely touched the stink and taste, so I knew I needed something with more carbon contact time and capacity. All the hardware stores wanted to sell the big undersink units and I'm not about to install that in a rental, so a countertop was what I needed. None of the stores I went to had them, so Amazon to the rescue.This BestFilters unit is the cure for BAD water and the flow rate is really good. Supposed to last for 2500 gallons but I dont believe it. Maybe with normal water, but this San Jose stuff should trash it in half that time. Even so, still a good deal compared to the small toy filters for the faucet. This one installs in minutes and bam!, instant bottled water taste/quality.

In truth, this one was never a favorite of mine, and now the meandering, pointless jamming, slipshod playing, and all-around poor quality of the recording render it a relic.Perhaps the musicians enjoyed cranking out some tunes inside a dormant volcano while enjoying some of nature's finest highs, but the novelty does not translate to a pleasant experience for the listener in any setting.

Songs don't really resolve, they just end when everyone gets tired of playing.There are much better versions of \\"Evil Ways\\" out there; this one is OK, but seems rushed and I'm not that fond of Miles' howling throughout.I truly don't get the 5-star reviews of this. I've never been that stoned, including when I bought this new. If \\"Hey man, lets get together and jam.\\" is your thing, then maybe you'll dig this.

No wonder Jimi ditched Miles. Santana's later concerts were of far greater quality. Take for example his 24min jam with Clapton on \\"Eyesight to the Blind\\" or even his \\"Scareed Fire\\" album. Useless hype for a mediocre performance. Maybe worth listening to for historical purposes but definitely not worth buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not happening","review":"What is this? I wouldn't call this a Santana album. It lacks that spritual fire that penetrates the mind and heart and takes you higher and higher and deeper and deeper.

That \\"put your hands together\\"; \\"every body say yeah\\"; \\"every body stand up\\" doesn't do it for me. All that audience participation is corny and a coverup for a very poor performance.

The first half of the album is as exciting music as you could find at the time. The second half is a long, wandering piece entitled \\"Freeform Funkathyde,\\" and the piece is about as good, and as dated, as its title. It's boring, heavy, and it doesn't go anywhere.

During the late 80s the whole big hair thing and ballad thing was the new and everyone loved it. Whitesnake compared too great bands of that era(metallica or guns n roses), is nothing compared too them. Sure they wrote Here I Go Again but all that is is just another power ballad that was so over used that era. Every single song Whitesnake pretty much has ever writtien is a freaking ballad i mean sure one or two songs but the whole album? come on. Way too much synth and ballads too be called a metal album. It just doesent work Here i Go Again isnt even that good and Is THis Love is the worse song of all time. Dont buy horrible band horrible album would give zero starts.

Its hilarious that when you hear a line, you can predict the next one. I dont think Coverdale means anything he sings...he just picked the words cuz it sounds good...to him anyway.In the Still of the Night is no better. The music sounds as if they intended it to be some brooding rock anthem. Its like they were trying to create some type of mystery and suspense building towards some rock zenith ...but when you hear the lyrics....all they are saying is \\"Im horny...gimme some\\".

I am sure it will be top notch. But the fact that the Extra DVD features only videoclips and live renditions already included on a previously released DVD which, in turn, belongs to a recent tour and not the actual \\"1987\\" tour, is a bit of a disappointment. In this kind of reissues you would expect something from the same era of the album, just like what Def Leppard did in the Deluxe Edition of \\"Pyromania\\", and the extra CD with the entire live show of 1983 in LA off the \\"Pyromania\\" tour."},{"rating":"1","title":"80s nostalgia that should remain buried","review":"Whitesnake were always an anomaly amongst rock(?) bands. Most of the original WS were from 70s classic rock and heavy blues bands, and their early albums reflected this, but then the 80s hit and metal became trendy and fashionable, and WS reformed themselves to be the ultimate hair metal band. The band became a farce, with the only constant being David Coverdale, who then still had one of the best rock voices around, and a rotating band of musicians, all of whom were good, but combined made WS possibly the ugliest (and the oldest) hair metal bands around, which did nothing for their popularity.This is an OK album at the start of their downfall. If you really like mediocre 80s hair metal ballads this is for you, if you like blues-rock music pick their earlier albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"A hard rockin' classic!","review":"If you love rock music you should buy this album.The songs on it are musically superb and John Sykes really shines on this album. Some of the songs are a little bit cheesy at times but not to the extent that would spoil the album. 'Children of the night', 'Heat of the night' and 'bad boys' are all great rock songs. Although I'm very fussy when it comes to ballads (I always either really like them or totally ignore them) I think that 'Cryin' in the rain' is one of the best ballads ever written, having said that I don't like 'is this love' at all.This album is a favourite of mine and I would reccomend it to anyone.Oh yeah, while I've possibly got the attention of a few Whitesnake fans.

He wants a woman who will do it the way he wants it done, every time (which is plain and simple - no porno stuff here). Over the course of time their relationship changes from commerce to love, and they must deal not only with their feelings for each other, but society's feelings about a lord and a whore who marry.

It was really cute to read about him trying to figure out how he felt and trying to tell the woman he loves that he is in love with her and wants to marry her.

I am sorry but this seems weak. I also think she could have found a better job even without adequit references. Secondly, The hero does not want the heorine to get any enjoyment out of making love. He just wants her to lay there and not move. What really made me mad was that after they do finally have a few weeks of truly making love and she is recieving actual pleasure he goes back to making love the old way without feeling and makes her lay still without giving her any release.

I understand that the hero has issues to work through but I found myself not really pulling for him. The young lady is totally lacking, flat , boring and never speaks her mind. Don't waste your money. Mary Balogh is better than this, try another title."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hero is SO dim","review":"This is by far my least favorite of the Mary Balogh's books. I'm glad that it is a reprint of an older edition or I'd be wondering if she's losing her touch. The hero is truly dim, and the words he say to the heroine are always hurtful and appallingly repetitve, \\"You are a good girl... You have pleased me...\\" over and over again. The problem I have with the book is not simply that the hero is weak, but that there is nothing convincing me whatsoever of why the heroine would fall in love with him. He has almost no redeeming quality. He is not bright, nor handsome, nor good in bed. And when the heroine decides to leave him, it is not really clear why she did not tell him the real reason behind her leaving. I expect more of Mary Balogh's books, more from a heroine who could have so much more but settled for so much less. The whole story of her turning to prostitution is sordid and not a good excuse at all. So unlike all the other MB books, I don't think I'll be rereading this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Seem to Have Aged Well","review":"I decided this give this book a shot since Mary Balogh's earlier works are far superior to her latest entries.I suppose in its day this book was quite daring, utilizing a fallen gentle lady and a beta male. But it no long has the advantage of novelty and must be judged on its on merits - which are sorely lacking in one area. One can quibble that Balogh's characterizations in this book violate Regency canon but that is not my issue - one can make a tale about a trained monkey fascinating if one has the talent. Where Balogh failed is where she normally is strong, in her writing skill. This book was incredibly clumsy and heavy handed in style, particularly in its repetitious use of phrases. There are authors who can get away with this literary glossolalia but it takes a deft hand.Balogh wrote this as if she figuratively was weighted down with an iron glove."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck!","review":"this is the first Mary Balogh book i picked up, it will be the last! i could not even read through the whole thing.i was so mad... what a crapola hero and beyond submissive female. just lay there and don't move for sex? beyond selfish. he needed a prissish wife then, not a mistress...yuck!i could not take this."},{"rating":"2","title":"so far so good","review":"I've had this boot for about a week now with several trips to rivers with variable streambeds. I'm using the aquastealth sole for wading. They are fairly grippy on smooth and slime covered rocks and do well walking over rough terrain. I would not suggest doing too much hiking on the wading soles as the rubber is intentionally softer for improved wet grip, use the hiking sole for that. Using the aquastealth or kling on sole for hiking will wear them out to fast. The aquastealth grip is not as good as with felt for the really slick stuff but not much will be. The real trick to the grippy rubber soles will be to see how long they hold up to regular wading use and if they continue to grip well as they wear. When they do wear out I anticipate getting the kling-on rubber sole with studs.Al in all I would I would give these a solid 4 or 4.5 out of 5.

You could tell that the author, Joseph Menn, put a lot of work into this with many quotes, facts, and background information on each of the people he introduces. The story that Menn tells is fully detailed and I felt as if I was part of the napster crew myself. The story never has any boring momements and he illustrates the personal relationships between the workers fantastically. I always wanted to know what happened at the napster company and now i know. I recommend this book to anyone who needs a break from fiction and would like to know the story of a kid's idea that changed the entertainment world forver. This book is nothing short of an A+"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well written and dead on the mark!","review":"As someone who actually worked at Napster during the time period of this book, let me tell you that the book is well written and dead on the mark. It uncovers exactly what no one knows -- John Fanning's pathological screwing of anyone (including his own family) to get what he wants, the common but rarely acknowledged minefield of business politics and relationships that coalesce around mega-hit startups (and the insanity that follows it), and of course one wild and crazy ride.If you're a pedantic, ostentatious second-generation Napster ex-employee with obvious resentments about missing the boat, then this book is not for you. If you're everyone else, though, then buy buy buy!, because this book is a hell of an interesting read, and exposes a fairly common world that 99% of the non-Silicon Valley population doesn't even know exists."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thick","review":"Lots of content covering the Napster rise and ... transition.

Despite a remarkable rise to prominence and infamous downfall, Napster never made any significant monetary impact; however, the company and its founder shaped the industry of online music and peer-to-peer file sharing and left a significant impact.Menn presents a thorough account of Napster's lifespan from Fanning's early work on development, the financial backing by Fanning's somewhat suspect Uncle, obtaining venture capital funding, and the eventual rulings leading to the demise of the company. If you have an interest in the companies that started the internet age and the mindsets and actions that were behind building them, this book will be of interest as Menn does a first-class job presenting Fanning's story and Napster's lasting relevance in the digital age."},{"rating":"1","title":"A terribly slow rehash of previously published material","review":"Just finished Menn's \\"All The Rave,\\" a.k.a. the Napster chronicles....for what it's worth, i found very little new material here - most of the scoop is previously published....& to my dismay, nothing is reported on Shawn Fanning's new venture, Snocap. An interesting twist for Shawn with Snocap, several journals are reporting that Fanning's new company seeks to end illegal file-swapping with an avalanche of controls...interesting twist, wouldn't you say for the guy who created fild-sharing to begin with...again nothing of this is reported in Menn's book which feels heavily dated by now.At any rate, the book read kinda slow....though the thing i do appreciate the most is the book's cover art - kitty in black."},{"rating":"1","title":"Joe Menn: the Jerry Springer of tech media?","review":".... This book illustrates only a few of the useful lessons that Napster offers, such as the pitfalls that inexperienced entrepreneurs can fall into when founding their core team of employees, board, and investors.

I would only recommend this book to insiders wishing to relive their 15 minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like Napster, it should have been great but it failed","review":"I'd looked forward to reading this book but whilst it was fun in parts, the inaccuracies and wild assumptions coupled with only a superficial grasp of the real events which led to Napster's demise meant it fell drastically short of it's goal. There are some serious journalistic errors with regard to key players which show lack of research and too much reliance on hearsay and supposition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievably inaccurate, sloppy reporting","review":"As someone who actually worked at Napster, I think I am in a position to say that this book is way off. I won't take issue with Menn's choice of whom to champion and whom to vilify in the Napster crew; however the reams of factual errors betray his inability to reach a wide number of inside sources and his complete ignorance of the music industry. Let's just say that he refers to a very senior female head of a record label as \\"he\\", and has his dates and players completely wrong with regards to the Bertelsmann investment in Napster - a very important chapter in the company's history. Menn also fails to examine in detail the actual demise and eventual bankruptcy of the company, preferring instead to dwell on the \\"wacky hijinks\\" of a bunch of young programmers.

And the characters had no, if any, redeeming characteristics. I really didn't care what happened to them, and that is the worst thing that can happen to a reader. I honestly can't believe it was published, as it it basically unfit for viewing."},{"rating":"1","title":"JK Rowling meets Jackie Collins?","review":"As a parent, I am a bit mystified by this book. On the one hand it seems to be aimed at teenage girls - the marketing, the themes of intense friendships and the general plotting/literary style. On the other hand, the unimaginatively crude language and adult themes make me really question as to whether an adolescent girl is realy going to appreciate the repetitive descriptions of semen oozing, oral sex and drug abuse. Maybe it's me who is out of touch with the chick sub-culture but I found the characters unsympathetic and the final outcome dull. Give me Anne Rice's Sleeping Beauty anytime."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ultimately disappointing","review":"I picked up this book because the blurb on the back compared the author to Donna Tartt, one of my favorite writers.

It was too much of a soap opera for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy.","review":"I'm usually one who enjoys a book that centers on a deep meaningful subject, but this one missed the mark. I have never been so disappointed in an ending in my entire life. And I don't mean the actual story ending (which lacked anything special as well) but the last pages of supposed empowering quotes. No book tells someone to make cut until it bleeds and don't stop until it hurts whether literal or figurative.I actually finished this book in the hopes that all the chapters would eventually mold into one powerful story centered around the bonds of friendship. Don't get me wrong, I can handle difficult subject manner, but only when it is written well and with meaning.

There were things I wanted to keep reading to find out what happened and all, but it was so painful for me to read that I just finally gave up on it. It was definitely too depressing and scared me into not wanting to send my daughter to high school. The characters, Rennie, Cherry and Amy, are wild. One has sex with any man who moves, they abuse drugs, drink, swear, smoke, they cut themselves...it's insane. Their parents were just as screwed up as they were and, while concerned that their daughters were going off course, no one seemed to care that they (the parents) might have something to do with it. The most upsetting part was that no one did anything about it (at least not in the first half I read).

The characters' habits of heavy drinking, random violence, smoking cigarettes and marijuana, promiscuous sex and cutting are presented in a way that makes you want to emulate them.There doesn't seem to be a problem the bitch posse encounters that can't be soothed with one of the above bad habits, not to mention snorting cocaine.I believe the author tries to redeem her characters at the end, but it's much too little, much too late for this reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible.","review":"I don't have anything against chick lit in the first place, but was intrigued by this book because it is sold as something that is NOT chick lit. What I thought would be a refreshing book about friendship and struggle from a female perspective was just a string of sex, drug and alcohol scenes strung together under the guise of storytelling. The women in this book are self-loathing with no redeeming qualities. But the biggest fault here is Martha O'Connor's for not offering up an ending that at least lets you forgive the three girls for being such idiots.This book is all lead-up and let-down. I don't want to spoil the ending for anyone in case you decide to ignore my warning -- just stay away from the book.

This would make cool party music. I like these mp3's so much, I may have to break down and shell out hard-earned cash for the entire CD.Luckily, Amazon will let you download four full songs from this CD, so you can get an idea of if you'd like it or not before you buy.

I purchased both, tempted by the low price. Once I reached the Second Symphony, I knew I would be disappointed and not satisfied until I had purchased otherwise. The Second Symphony is one of the glorious creations of the twentieth century and Bergund's interpretation simply does not do credit to it; the great fourth movement left me cold. So for me, having the whole set of symphonies is now that much less exciting. The standard for the Second Symphony has been set by Barbirolli, first and foremost with the Halle Orchestra and secondly with the Royal Philharmonia. I have the Halle in LP but it appears not to be available on CD.

I exchanged it for another one, same thing. Amazon exchanged it again (they do have good customer service) and now, on my third different Shoqbox it will NOT power on. So it's useless. Not sure if this is just Amazon stock or what, but I have now been through 3 of these and not 1 would turn on.

Don't buy it!","review":"I'll keep it short. (The review is for the 256MB version). One word - Annoying. The fact that Philips FORCED you to use the musicmatch software to load songs is very very annoying. Difficult to use. And as another reviewed said, it doesn't resume. Once stopped, it goes back to the first song. That't annoying too. You'll be better off with just buying a cheap MP3 player and a separate powered mini speaker. Doesn't look as nice but at least it works fine!

I called Phillips five times for the same problem over a four week period. Finally the representative said they would give me a refurbished player. Of course, I am upset because I have never used the item and I don't believe I should have to received a refurished one. If you are thinking about purchasing this item, please think twice. If you have a problem, Phillips WILL NOT help you. I read the negative feedback and I didn't believe them. If you have bought one and it is working, you are very lucky.

The firmware and software combo is horrible. You cannot simply drag and drop songs to the device. You MUST use their Philips branded version of MusicMatch Jukebox to transfer songs and it DOES NOT work. Two phone calls to Philips didn't help either. They were polite and all but otherwise useless.

He's a very intellectual person who also spoke several indian languages, including Sanskrit. Contrary to the usual spiritual seeker, he tried to understand and criticaly analyze everything he encountered in in India or Hinduism. Naturally he made some enimies, but also friends.The book is very valuable for giving one insider information from the monk's life, without any of the usual covering of not so good things. So one learns about the Ramakrishna order as well as about the sannyasi's life and about the Indian philosophical education. The information provided here is now forty to fifty years old, and some of it may be of rather historical value, but of value never the less."},{"rating":"2","title":"Imagine this life","review":"Scholarly, shy Leopold Fisher is drafted into the Army of the Third Reich. Because of his Sanskrit studies, he's attached to a regiment of Indian soldiers-followers of Chandra Bose. He's captured by the allies when his regiment surrenders and is almost repatriated with the Indians. Instead, he waits in a POW camp and makes his own way to India in 1946.He adopts the path of a sannyasid and tries to 'become' Hindu. The process doesn't discourage his enthusiasm, but causes him to hold it at a certain emotional arm's length.His account of his time in India is not particularly romantic and is in fact a bit wry. It has angered some devout Hindus who accuse him of airing dirty laundry, but it is also highly respected by others who appreciate what Fisher-now Agehananda Bharati-had to offer their tradition.Bharati ended his days as a professor of anthropology at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Material, Terrible Treatment","review":"Few stories are more remarkable than that of the Cambrian explosion, and few things are more unlikely than a paleontologist with a philosophical-political axe to grind. Here, somehow, we have both. Poor Dr. Walcott gets kicked while down, being dead, old, white and otherwise unable to defend himself, because this gives Gould the chance to graft his unremarkable ideas onto the story of the deciphering of the Burgess Shale. Aggravating matters is Gould's mannered writing style; part pseudo-literary, part popular and perky, it's like reading something William Morris wrote for TV Guide.Anyone who has any respect for the history of science, with all its wrong turns and dead ends, and for the integrity of paleontology as a apolitical discipline -- and anyone who cares about good science writing -- will trade this book in on a book by Simon Conway Morris, who writes clearly and intelligently on this fascinating topic."},{"rating":"2","title":"530 million years ago...","review":"530 million years ago something happened that would change the way scientists would look at evolution and it would take the humor, knowledge and artistic skill of Stephen Jay Gould to explain WHY it changed the way they look at evolution and WHY we should all care.Mr. Gould takes evolution and shows how it worked in the ancient sea and why it seemed to change how it works now. Mr. Gould is an honest writer, brave enough to say that what he says might be proven wrong later on, but is willing to dive right in anyway. He is willing to get his hands messy while trying to work out the paleontological puzzle of the Burgess Shale and he takes us along, we go together during every step, we watch scientists overcome every barrier and we are able to judge the results that we saw built right before our eyes, piece by piece.Great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome implications of evolution","review":"Wonderful Life is a perfect book if you are interested at all in the story of evolution on this planet. This is science and compelling storytelling rolled into one. It is a fascinating look at the Burgess Shale fossils (discovered in Canada at the turn of this century) and how they were misclassified and then stored for nearly 80 years in the Smithsonian Institution. What really fires the reader's imagination in this book is the contemporary study of these fossils and how it shattered our view of life progressing steadily on to more complex organisms in a predictive manner. Evolution of lifeforms, instead, is a much more chancy situation that is not at all predictable. There is every chance that, if the tape of life were rewound and started again, humans would not evolve. Our being here is due to environmental conditions and opportunities that most surely would not happen again in history. Stephen Gould is a superb writer and this is one of his very best books"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Life, Wonderful Book, Wonderful Edition","review":"Quality book. Pleasant dialogue with seller, initiated by seller, prior to shipment - reassuring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unnecessary verbosity.","review":"At the risk of sounding very shallow, as I read this latest offering by Gould, all I could keep thinking was, \\"Does this author have an editor\\"? And if so, why didn't she or he cut the extra verbage and some of the self-aggrandizement. I am well educated and keenly interested in the topic, but reading this tome was like slogging through molasses mixed with sand. I felt that the salient points could have been made in half of the words. In fact, after a while, I was reading only every other paragraph and not feeling like I was missing what Gould was attempting to convey. I wish that David Quammen or Carl Safina would publish a book on this subject. Their scientific writings are well researched, thorough and concise. I wouldn't spend the money on another of Gould's works, ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gould's genius","review":"This is the first book that I read of Steven Jay Gould. I recieved it as a child and never did much more than skim over a few pages. However, I later read through the whole thing and found that Gould describes things in an amazing way. He explains how unpredictable circumstances have had a lot to do with evolution. It hasn't always been a survival of the fittest. It has sometimes been a survival of the most lucky. This book introduces a lot of the fauna of the Burgess Shale, which is pretty wild. A lot more has been learned about these creatures since this book was written, and many of them have been classified. This book allows us a glimpse of the ancient past of life on earth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful read, albeit wrong on some points","review":"Good books present material in story form, and WONDERFUL LIFE delivers on that. Gould is known in the UK as the biologist that made \\"group selection\\" famous in the US, much like E.O. Wilson. Unfortunately, folks in the UK view--correctly--that selection targets the individual, not the group, unless of course, the group is thought of as an individual, e.g., ants, termites, etc. Read WONDERFUL LIFE for its exposition of the Burgess Shale, replete with examples--I love Hallucigenia!--and let the other stuff fly right over your head.

It isn't. The score is jam packed with standards, but the book... the book is a mess! Filled with unfunny jokes, sub-plots that go nowhere and bits of business that I doubt were even entertaining in 1937. Despite a slew of good reviews BABES had trouble attracting audiences until suddenly in teh summer it was the ONLY musical running on Broadway, and that helped it achieve a healthy run of 289 performances. But the show will never be revived except in concert.Evans Haile is the real star hear, conducting the original orchestrations which swing in the best late 1930s tradition. The extended Ballet \\"Peter's Dream\\" is a bit repetitive but the rest of teh CD is pure gold. Really, this is the best way to enjoy BABES IN ARMS.CORRECTION: The listing says \\"1989 Broadway Revival Cast\\" - it wasn't a revival: just a concert version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not everything in the Depression was aweful","review":"This record takes me back to a time that was generally terrible, but the quality of the music in this show was very good indeed.

The songs, \\"Way out West\\" and \\"The Lady is a Tramp\\" are clever, witty, and truly define Lorenz Hart's style. I loved Kara Eickolt's version of \\"My Funny Valentine\\" (she sang it at my school) in which she sang a more demure, more \\"feminine\\" song. It was much more beautiful than the woman on the CD's tomboyish version. All in all, get this CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Mott The Hoople with some help from David Bowie","review":"If you like Mott The Hoople's other albums or classic Bad Company, you have to pick up this CD. David Bowie saved this band from calling it quits by giving them \\"All The Young Dudes\\" (their breakthrough hit) and by producing this album with a great guitar sound. Mick Ralphs unleashes a couple of riffs and songs that would later surface in Bad Company. The band is on top of its game throughout - even the cover of Lou Reed's \\"Sweet Jane\\" sounds strong. Some of the lyrics drop into glam-rock territory, but Mott The Hoople sounds like they're ready to take on the world with this classic album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Their Best","review":"I've listened to every MTH album and this one is their best by a wide margin.

Nor does it have the soulful resiliance of Mott, and the sound here is botched, to boot. Bowie gave the album a strange mix, but the big problem is that Ian Hunter has gotten a swelled head this time around: \\"I don't want to know you!\\"Hopefully Mott turned the tables on Hunter the next time around (he turned the tables on himself) and came up with the classic \\"Hymn for the Dudes\\" and \\"The Ballad of Mott the Hoople\\" This album is probably one of the first four albums by Mott the Hoople to get, along with Brain Capers, Mott, and The Hoople.

This is not to say I regret having purchased this book, however, it is not so much a guide through the O.T. as one might be looking for. It is not an extensive viewing of the O.T. but rather a glimpse at each part of the O.T. Therefore, I suggest this for those that wish a light reading of what the O.T. comprises. Yet, for the reader that is looking for depth I would go elsewhere. Simply put, this book seems to have been written just to let you know the story lines within the O.T. and to give limited commentary as to what is conveyed. This would be a good book for young teens and those who are beginning to study God's word. The epilogue is a well written essay tying Christ to the Old Testament."},{"rating":"1","title":"Academic professionalism","review":"At first sight the book seems so insightful - and it clearly stems from a sincere wish to understand other cultures and others holding different views than one's own within one's own culture. But then comes page 20. Gutmann writes that the task is to rescue us from a world of entrenched battlefields and point the way to \\"mutually respectful communities of substantial, sometimes even fundamental, INTELLECTUAL disagreement\\" (my emphasis). What such a viewpoint does is to limit the discussion to rational discourse. One can agree on a base-line of open discussion with those you may be in diasagreement with but only when the 'crazies' have been left outside, those who preach hatred, or even those who choose to opt out. This is all what Richard Rorty called 'wet liberalism'. Terribly disappointing.

It tells you everything you need to know to get started, however there is much more involved than just reading and understanding. There is much material to grasp and absorb, too much to take in during one reading. During my first series of races after I finished the book I still came in last place, not because the book was inadequate, but because the learning curve for racing requires much practice. Buying and reading this book is a worthwhile investment if you are serious about racing. Just be prepared to learn a little at a time and practice a lot. And better yet, take someone with you who is good at racing who can teach you as you sail. One of our sailing club's other members went from near last place to second place this past weekend after having a very experienced sailor as his crew. Sailboat racing is very challenging, but then how much fun would it be if it was easy?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sailboat racing book","review":"If you already know the basics of sailing and want to learn how to become a sailboat racer or crew for a race, THIS IS THE BOOK FOR YOU !!!!!The authors not only describe in very clear text, but they also provide great drawings to hammer home their points.

The characters were real and believable and Kristen Stewart gave a compelling performance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Touching Film","review":"This film depicts the bitter-sweet story of a young woman's desire to be like all girls her age. Since she has physical limitations it is a challenge, but one she is willing to attempt. People may criticize Kristen Stewart's acting, but I think she did a beautiful portrayal of her character in this film. This may not be everyone's cup of tea, but I think it was worth seeing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip it","review":"Just was not good, and I like the twilight movies. Storyline was just awful. Really wishing I had purchased a different title."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cake Eaters","review":"Although the subject matter of this movie is very sensitive and deligate, Kristen Stewart does an excellent job. It could not be easy to play this part but it shows \\"the not so much fun\\" of life and how some of the unfortunate people still crave the human desires of all of us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alright","review":"The two leads are excellent at portraying their characters, but over time I found myself disengaged from the film. There is a young girl wanting freedom, an overbearing mother, a cool grandma, a young man looking for something...and they all do their part to bring the film to its conclusion. It's a nice movie but I was not as excited about it after I watched it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stinker!!!!","review":"This film was S L O W and pointless. It was actually painful to watch Kristen Stewart try and act the role. Her solution? Jutting frozen jaw and pigeon-toed gate.Simply awful and boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Claptrap? Close but not quite...,","review":"The Cake Eaters is another Lifetime movie of the week in a genre I like to call \\"I Cry and Cry and then I Die\\".I don't think this film was deliberately trying to be this trite and maudlin, its just the nature of the beast. The film has the requisite whining, moaning and crying to satisfy lovers of this type of film. And it was directed by the star of many of said Lifetime movies. Plus you have \\"The Illness\\" - I call it \\"Movie-itis\\"; usually one character in this type of movie has it. It generates more whining and moaning.Watching this movie is like being stuck in a room with a bunch of unhappy housecats, and one of them is sick. You feel bad for wanting to leave the room, but you HAVE to get the HeXX out of there and quick.Want something less hokey, less of a joke? Watch the film \\"Passengers\\" - its more honest than this tripe."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE MOVIE!!!","review":"I thought that this movie was going to be good based on the review everybody had left here, but holy crap! I was seriously mistaken! Im not sure if it was awful due to the poor filming, Kristen Stuart, or just the movie as a whole. I hated it. I regret buying it. It had SOOOO much potential to be a great movie, but it failed miserably.So, do unlike I did. If you think you want to buy it... Watch the freakin trailer on youtube first! I accidentally forgot to. And now Im going to have to either through this movie away or sell it for 1/8th the price I paid for it at a garage sell.Thanks for reading my review and I hope it was more helpful than all the other ones that were clearly written by people that had never seen the movie.Ps: I bought it \\"new\\" and there wasnt even any shrink wrap on it and there was a yard sale sticker on it. So to top it off I payed for a new movie (at the time costing $8) and it was used...Badly!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great christmas countdown!","review":"My 4yr old daughter absolutely loves The Nightmare Before Christmas so I bought us this countdown.

All of the Sybex MCSE book that I have read have been great. This book is missing a LOT of information. For example, there are several questions in the back of each chapter that ask questions that were not discussed, or have answers with data that is nowhere to be found.The content is terribly disorganized with two sections on DHCP, for example, repeating themselves. Just about every topic provides incomplete information. Errors, typographical and question answers, are everywhere! Two words in a row, misspellings, mislabeled end of chapter answers.

The hose is exactly what I was looking for."},{"rating":"1","title":"author is not sincere!","review":"Sarah Palin's speechwriter, Matthew Scully, is a perfect example of a lying, conscienceless writer who will do anything for money. Besides being a speechwriter for Bush and Palin, he is ALSO the author of THIS book, described by The New York Times as a \\"horrible, wonderful, important book,\\" in large measure \\"because the author, an avowed conservative Republican and former speechwriter for George W. Bush, is an unexpected defender of the animals against the depredations of profit driven corporations, swaggering, gun-loving hunters, proponents of renewed 'harvesting' of whales and elephants and others who insist that all of nature is humanity's romper room, to play with, rearrange, and plunder at will.\\" ..... So here is Scully putting his words in the mouth of a lying, merciless enemy of all animals and environmental causes. Too sickening for words."},{"rating":"1","title":"Matthew Scully = disingenuous and hypocritical author","review":"Boycott this book and the author. He is a confused and hypocritical man who is a speechwriter for Gov. Sarah Palin, the woman who supports aerial hunting of wolves and bears, as well as pulling wolf pups from their dens and shooting them. Matthew Scully does NOT care about the suffering of animals."},{"rating":"1","title":"What??","review":"The contents of this book was disappointing. Instead of holding my attention with new ideas and helpful methods, it instead attacked various entities for their animal abuse measures. It was very rambling, wordy, and did not keep me focused. I do not recommend you buy this product, however, I will sell you mine at a good price if you want it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not helpful to the animals and written by a perpetuator of war","review":"This book does nothing but make excuses for treating animals as slaves and putting forth the Christian perspective. When the book came out, I was invited to a private party to meet the author whom I immediately thought was not at all an animal supporter and not at all someone whom I could ever respect. Over the years, he has gone on to prove this as a Bush/Cheney lackey, who has pushed the phoney war agenda, makes excuses for treating animals kindly, and who has now crafted the speech of Sarah Palin, the most anti-animal candidate ever running for office in my opinion. It is really a shame that Gene Baur, Wayne Pacelle, and Karen Dawn have been supporters of this man."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would have been a good magazine article","review":"My dogsitter insisted I read this book, exclaiming over Matthew Scully's elogquent writing and the fact that he wrote Sarah Palin's very inspiring acceptance speech at the Republican convention. His material here would have made an interesting speech or in depth article. Yes, his writing is eloquent. Yes, it's an interesting subject. But it takes a right wing Christian turn at every opportunity. It's not spiritual, it's political. It's difficult to read for more than a few pages because you feel yourself being stuffed with this Christian, animal rights viewpoint. Sometimes I choose to read politically slanted biographies or histories, but I know before I start which viewpoint I'll be getting. His book is good and maybe he will get a lot of converts to his way of thinking. I found myself wondering if he had any pets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scully Hypocrite","review":"I find Scully to be a hypocrite, liar and greed monger. He wrote Sarah Palin's sneering, nasty speech, stretching truths about who she is and outrighting lying and chiding our presidential nominees. His hate speech full of divisive and attack lines will be remembered and talked about in the short term, but in the long term, the results of his manipulated words and outcome on society will be on his conscience alone. How could he write such a negative hate speech for a women who shoots animals from a helicopter and can \\"field-dress\\" a moose. As if that is such an accomplishment. \\"Dominion\\" and all it's crediblility is lost and wasted on a moment that may forever change the political landscape and not for the better. Just as Americans were turning the tide and engaging in politics and discussing issues and paying attention, Single minded Scully wrote those devisive words of hate, recoiling all the gains of a nation. I don't know how he will sleep at night."},{"rating":"1","title":"compartmentalizing","review":"I'm am a die hard vegan and animal rights activist, and much of what Scully has to say is right on target. However, I can't fully respect the words of a man who so loyaly serves evil bureaucrats like Bush jr and Cheney. Clearly he is very mixed up in his beliefs, or is compartmentalizing the issues in his book, and the rest of his life. Animal rights, racisim, a free market system, poverty, all these issues are conneceted, clearly he doesnt believe so. It's about turing life into a product, a commodity; wether it be human, animal or the earth herself. This man is trying to confuse people who really care. Get truly informed about EVERYTHING and then you'll see why this book is nothing more than compassionate conservatism."},{"rating":"1","title":"The problem is domination","review":"The sexist title of this book \\"The Power of Man...\\" should be reason alone to avoid this conservative book. Since Scully has labored as Bush's speech writer, he's far from an enlightened boat-rocker. The best advice is to stop eating animals, and to avoid wasting time bolstering Scully's view that animals are in need of management. Humans should manage their own numbers, for starters. -- Priscilla Feral, President, Friends of Animals, Inc."},{"rating":"2","title":"A most excellent book for all points of view","review":"No matter what your political point of view, this book on animal abuse is for you. Matthew Scully has written the best book on animal welfare in a generation. Not preachy or heavy-handed, Scully has penned a book that is accessible to the average person who does not give a damn about animals. Read this book and you will weep for all mankind.

I am kept interested in the subject with every word, and every insight by the author. I would recommend this book to any one interested in knowing more and to anyone who already knows about the plight of the animals that have been placed in our hands.

I just thought I would share for those of your who don't really like reading that sort of thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"What is Good/Not good ?Need We Ask Any One To Tell Us","review":"The argument that mercy is an intangible is cowardly. Mercy is a part of our genetic history, though mostly reciprocol in nature. One can seek to muffle the stirrings of our emotional core, finding safety in self serving, relativism or seek truth in our common sociobiology (YES, OUR GENETIC, EMOTIONAL, MAKEUP).Mr. Scully, conservative speech writer, is the perfect one to remind us of the inspirational metaphores within the bible. Do we need an argument on the relative nature of mercy to tell us that splitting the sternum of a living primate in order to see its lungs heave is wrong. If that act is wrong then is sinking an electrode into a dogs opened scull any less wrong.Thank You Mr. Scully"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for your animal rights library","review":"Dominion is a powerful book about animal rights. But this isn't some PETA-soaked, pinko-communist manifesto on how animals are better than humans. This is the conservative argument against exploiting our animal friends.The author is a former speechwriter for George Bush and a very eloquent writer who explains that man's compact with God leaves him responsible for how animals are treated. It's a much different argument than many animal rights organizers and that's why this book is a breath of fresh air.This is not a book on philosophy, though. The author brings you in through detailed descriptions of various horrible acts from caged hunting to food processing.Bottom Line:If you're an animal rights freak -- get this book. It'll give you more arguments to make your case.If you have a conservative family member, get this book. Maybe you'll change their mind.If you really don't give a hoot about animals, then probably shouldn't get this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scully = Hypocrite","review":"I just discovered that Matthew Scully is the speech writer for Sarah Palin, who you would assume to be the antithesis of all he believes in.Apparently Dominion is nothing but empty words. And Scully, who claimed to support the rights of other living creatures on this planet, is nothing more than another unprincipled money-grabbing shill. What else could explain the willingness to embrace, and worse--promote, the very people who glorify wanton killing of animals.Scully should take a long look in the mirror. He has betrayed the people who have promoted his book and his supposed philosophy. And worse, he has betrayed the creatures that he claimed to respect. The word 'Hypocrite' is not strong enough. Now that this Judas has made his 30 pieces of gold, he should forever be pictured with Sarah Palin and her dead trophies. He deserves no more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dominion is Full of Contradictions","review":"Scully makes two strong, yet completely contraditory arguments:1. Modern industrial animal farming is immoral. Regulations should be enacted/enforced to allow animals more free-range and natural lives. The detached consumer enables this awful practice to continue.2. Hunting - especially ranch-style hunting -is immoral and should be outlawed. This has been done already in some states.In the first case Scully says free-range animals are the solution. In the second case -where he gets precisely what he wants- an involved consumer of an animal in a relatively naturaly environment...he thinks should be outlawed.That Mr. Scully writes for Bush2 is no surprise. No stronger argument against animal rights has ever been written.Todd"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not your typical \\"animal rights\\" screed","review":"Like a lot of conservatives, I have tended to dismiss most \\"animal rights\\" people as fanatics or extremists, because too often they want to put animals on the same level as human beings. Mr. Scully's book is different from 99% of the other animal rights books at Amazon because he is not coming from that perspective AT ALL, and in fact spends some time discussing the problems with that kind of thinking. What he IS saying - and it makes a lot of sense - is that it is precisely because human beings ARE superior to animals that we owe them compassion and respect - and he gives graphic examples of how we are failing in that regard (factory farms, unnecessary hunting, etc.). If you believe that God's mercy extends even to the humblest of His creatures, this is a book you MUST read."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books (about anything) I have ever read.","review":"This is it. If you've finally admitted to yourself that something is simply not right with a world in which you and your kids can coexist with factory farming and the abuse of whales and other animals that Scully covers, then this is the book to begin with. It is absolutely fascinating, a good read, and it will put meat on the bones of that gnawing feeling you've been having lately.

I hightly recommend this two-player game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun game, box is not great","review":"Stratego is a pretty classic game, and this edition brings a more elaborate package than a typical cardboard Hasbro game box. The sliding lid of the wooden box only goes on one way and does not consistently slide all the way unless everything inside is very tightly packed in.Gameplay is simple enough and boils down to hiding your flag and comparing numbers as you encounter enemy pieces.

John Musto is personally my favorite New American Composer. \\"Recuerdo\\" is an excellent example of his amazing music. His music has so many different influences (Blues, Jazz, Ragtime, and Classical) all blended together to make one rich sound, William Sharp sings them with such sensitivity and grace. Paul Bowles' \\"Blue Mountian Ballads\\" are a perfect example of his great choice of text (Tennesse Williams)and his perfect setting of deep southern Music that the text requires. I just get so excited when I hear an album like this, celebrating the American Art Song and it's great and promising future with Young Composers like John Musto and Eric Klein. William Sharp and Stephen Blier are a dynamic duo and pick great repertoire that shows this off exsquisitely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Double 5-star album!","review":"Out of all of the Liza Minnelli recordings I have, this on is probably my favorite.

It only lasted a week and a half before I replaced it with a Venus. I was out the money spent on the razor and the refills I bought at the same time, but it was not worth dealing with its poor quality shaves until I used them up. MAYBE this razor would work for someone with light, fine hair, but it definitely does not work for dark, thick hair. What a joke of a razor!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed!","review":"I bought this razor because it was reasonably priced and it said it was mildew resistant. When I opened it, I couldn't believe there were wires covering the blades! I thought it was a mistake and wondered how I could possibly get a close shave with those wires in the way. Well, I cannot get a close shave with this razor and I will now go out and buy the Venus Divine and give that a try. This razor would've been great if it weren't for the unnecessary wires covering the blades, because it even came with a cute holder for the shower. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I bought this because it was a reasonable price and the other razor I had before was Schick, and I loved it. This one is a different story. I had to shave over my skin as many as three times just to get rid of the stubble. I tried a few differnt ways to see if it was just how I was holding it. I have sensitive skin so it left me with dry, irritated, bumpy skin. I am very disappointed with this.

Now the ones who like flavor can have flavor. I will definitely always have the flavored Senseo Pods in stock in our home so that we have them to offer guests.

The scientists -because it is difficult to explain how esp works. The religious -because if humans were to develop their esp abilities -then we would all be prophets.This book is filled with interesting anecdotes, experiments, ideas, and people who figure prominently in the field of esp practice and esp research. If you are interested in the topics of psychic healing, subliminal messages, meditation, premonition, intuition, dreams, remote viewing, dowsing, and why Sigmund Freud was not fond of music (and more!)- this is the book for you. Read with an open mind. There is a notes section and an index."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Mind Teaser","review":"A major fan of psychological thrillers, I found this book to be among the top in this genre. The female protagonist, Liza MacDonough, is compelling, strong, and believable. Although understandably frightened by a string of fatal \\"accidents\\" to people close to her, she remains proactive in trying to research her clients' complaints of conspiracy. Donna Anders excels at making every character we meet, a possible anatagonist, so that we, along with Liza, don't know whom to trust. For analytical readers who love to problem solve, this story will delight you. The suspense keeps you caught in its grip right up through the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too wordy and not enough action","review":"Liza is a counselor for a aerospace company. Due to the large layoffs, she is helping displaced employees. There's a conspircy in her company. Too many layoffs and too much work. As she's trying to figure out what's going on. Her house is broken into. She is being followed and she can't trust anyone. Ok, sounds like a good enough story. But, Liza takes everything too lightly. Her reactions are true to human nature.

Just weak everywhere else."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a stinker!!","review":"I read a lot and this one was horrible. The writing was very amateurish - the plot was predictible and the characters were annoying.

I can visualize Connie Selleca wondering around in a daze, with Dave behind her yelling \\"Brown Eyes.\\" By a few pages, I had begun to become irritated with the heroine. At the middle, I was hoping that the murderer would kill off \\"Brown Eyes\\" and the rest of the predictable, flat cast of characters. Unfortunately, I'm the type who has to see a book or movie through to the end. So, I felt compelled to complete this drival. In this day and age, you expect writers to create female characters that are smart and edgy. If these are some of your expectations for a novel, don't pick this title off the shelves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a useful reference for the birds of Egypt","review":"While a convenient size for the tourist, this guide just presented too little information for the serious birder.

I looked in America for a book on Dickinson because he is almost unheard of in England, and I was excited to find a title that sounded very promising. When the \\"book\\" came through the mail, however, it was such a disappointment as the intro explained that this was a publication to go with a series of exhibitions of Dickinson's work in America some time ago. As a result the little commentary there was too specific to be interesting to anyone who had not seen the exhibition, and was essentially was un-illuminating. The most important part of the book, ie. the images, were poorly reproduced in black and white, with the exception of a couple. Anyone who knows Dickinson will know that his work is painted in muted colours, rendering a black and white repro almost unreadable.

If I hadn't read Bel Canto before this one, I'd have awarded 5 stars.Divided into 3 parts, the book spans the lives of its three main characters: Rose, a woman with 'issues' who has trouble attaching to people but tries to do her job in life as well as she's able. Son, Rose's 2nd husband, is a giant of a man who is damaged by a tragedy and finds a place for himself as handyman in a 60's home for unwed mothers. And Cecelia, named after a tattoo on Son's arm of his first love, damaged by her weird upbringing but a complete person nonetheless, thanks to the mothering of the 'saint' in the story,, a clairvoyant nun who mothers them all.I loved this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read","review":"All I can say is that I enjoyed it. It was one of our book club selections and I liked the whole take on the home for unwed moms."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I could give it a zero, I would.","review":"I could write many lines about how much I disliked this novel, but I would be taking up too much of your time. I really did not care for the writing style. It seemed way too slow for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not near as good as Bel Canto","review":"This book just wasn't all that good. It was long and slow and pretty simple. I didn't find the writing particularly inspiring either. After Bel Canto, I am disappointed, since that was such an exciting and beautiful book. I finished this whole book but I never really liked it that much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely unlikeable main character","review":"This book is awful! Rose is completely selfish and self absorbed. She does whatever she wants with no regard to anyone's feelings and ends up running away from all her problems. Other than an unlikeable main character, there really is no plot and the ending is flat. Save your money and time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engaging Story","review":"This was an engaging story, filled with strong characters and a well-developed plot. Wanting to know how the story would end and not being able to imagine an appropriate ending, I read the book within 2 days."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another winner","review":"This book was a good read and rates as high as her other books I've read: The Magician's Assistant and BelCanto. Patchett's style is unlike any other author I've read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every rose has its thorn","review":"This marked my first foray into Patchett, and I feel fortunate that someone insisted I read it. For one, Patchett's style allows the reader to view this family life from three very different perspectives, which--as an afterthought--may enable us to personally wonder how our own patchworked families operate. Is everything as it seems to be? What do we hold out from one another? Do we really know or want to know all of the details of our spouses or parents? As an aside, the novel shows how unwed mothers may have felt during a time when they were shunned, forced to live secluded lives of \\"visiting\\" out-of-town relatives for six to eight months. I felt a sense of empathy for each character, including Rose who could never enjoy her life. Overall, this web is a gem."},{"rating":"2","title":"I stuck in my thumb...","review":"I unloaded this novel on my kindle because of the price $2.99 and strong recommendations for two of her other works STATE OF WONDER $12.99 and BEL CANTO $9.99. Sometimes one gets lucky in the bargain basement. This is a heart rending tale of a disturbed pregnant woman who leaves her husband and mother in CA to have a baby in a home for pregnant girls in KY. Ms. Patchet tells her tale with three narrators and all are engrossing, especially the daughter, who pulls at your heart. The minor characters all shine and one can see the ending coming but still... is shattered when it does."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty good story but hated the ending","review":"I was enjoying this book and how it was written but the ending ruined the whole thing for me.

It starts out as mildly intriguing, and some of the scenes with the unwed mothers in the first section are evocative, but the lovably twinkly and clairvoyant old nun is just too saccharine to bear, and the narrator of the middle section, salt-of-the-earth gardener Son, is not only too good to be true, he's also deathly boring--a dull-witted drone. I've read Bel Canto and The Patron Saint of Liars only confirms my belief that Ann Patchett's novels are overrated."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would like a different ending...","review":"I didnt think the book was bad until the further I got. I could understand why Rose decided to leave California. I was glad that she decided to keep the baby. Even when she married Son I thought for sure that she would finally grow to love someone, including her daughter. The fact that she remained so flat and uncaring really bothered me. I would have loved to see Thomas show up with no warning and finally see all the truth come out and see some resolution for all the caracters that Rose touched. I almost felt that Patchett lost her steam, and found it easier to let Rose disappear and end the book than to deal with what was really happening. At the very least, I would have liked an explanation from Rose at the end as to why once a again she couldnt stay and deal. As far as being a Saint, I didnt see any redeeming quality about Rose for that kind of title. It was frustrating and disappointing. Its the kind of book that leaves a bad taste in your mouth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Henriksen, Tomerson true good sports in making \\"Spitfire\\"","review":"This movie is so bad it's hilarious! Every new scene will leave you hysterical. Lance Henriksen (Aliens) plays a James Bond knock-off and Tim Tomerson (Trancers) a drunk sports reporter who are both somehow involved with a gymnist. How they keep it together has to be the fact they are getting paid to. And I'm not so sure of that from watching their faces. I know I see them smiling when they can't help themselves. They are the saving grace of this \\"no way\\" movie. Another plus is a scene where Robert Patrick (X-Files) is a gum-chewing agency man with a gun pulled on Mr. Henriksen's spy guy character. He has no lines but he is definitely grinning. If you can see this movie free, good.

Since Dover specializes in reprints, it's forced to use what's in the public domain. The results are consequently uneven. If you're looking for Brahms' orchestral music, or Wagner's late operas (after Lohengrin), Dover's scores are bargains, because the scores printed are reliable. On the other hand, there are Dover scores that one should avoid like the plague, & the reprint of Mahler's Seventh Symphony is one of them. This score was originally printed with 300+ errors, & this is the edition that Dover publishes. In fact, all the errors weren't removed from the score until the critical edition ~ this is true even of the Eulenburg scores, which falsely claimed at every reprint, that the errors had been removed. So if you really want the orchestral score of the Seventh, the only version that's musically defensible is the critical edition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Motorola SLVR L7 OEM","review":"Received the item in 14 days.

The authors are Pharmacists. They list side effects of herbs that would happen to maybe 1 in a billion people. They state that dandelion can cause, \\"Skin irritation... blockage of the digestive or biliary tract, gallbladder inflammation, gallstones\\" but on the SAME page say that it is used for \\"digestive complaints, gallbladder problems, to stimulate bile production\\". Now, why would you use a plant that helps with gallbladder problems if it causes them?? (by the way, it does not, I have much experience with this plant and have never had any side effects, nor has anyone I have spoke with). This book will do nothing but make you paranoid of about using herbs. If you want a good book, get \\"The New Age Herbalist\\" or anything by Rosemary Gladstar, Dr. James A. Duke or James Green.

Time alone will ensure that it will be ushered into the Pantheon of Great Recordings of the 20th century ... its inherent strength lies in its unified 'feel' for a new and exciting type of jazz-rock fusion, way ahead of its time - not in my opinion a weakness or a dilution, but a strength - purely instrumental tracks in the early 1970s were not that common, and Carlos Santana broke new gound with 'Caravanserai' in this regard ... 'Song of The Wind' retains all the the virtuoso brilliance and artistic integrity that one expect to find in any good recording of the Beethoven violin concerto for example ... this album deserves to be up there, amongst the Great Masters ... not 100 per cent perfect - but damn close...JDL"},{"rating":"2","title":"Santana's Best Album","review":"This is Santana's best album, which is saying alot. It is a rich, complex and textured work. It builds upon Santana's instrumental work from the first three albums, along the lines of Incident at Neshabur and Toussaint L'Overture. There are also some very good songs on the album but no pop tunes. Fans of the more traditional Santana hits may not appreciate this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have for latin-jazz fans.","review":"From surrealist psychedelia to smooth R&B to balls to the wall free jazz explosions, Carlos and company take you on a musical journey you'll never forget. The serenity of opening tracks \\"Eternal Caravan of Reincarnation\\" and \\"Waves Within\\" gradually progress, as the album plays, into the sheer jazz chaos of closing tracks \\"La Fuente Del Ritmo\\" and \\"Every Step Of The Way.\\" This album, though maybe not for the casual pop rock listener, is a definite must have for any fan of Santana or of jazz in general"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Santana Band's best ever.","review":"The first three Santana albums have a lot of great moments, but the entirety of CARAVANSERAI works wonderfully as an album, not just as the sum of its' parts. It has ebbs and flows, from very soft to bowl-you- over loud, and the band is in sync with one another in a way later editions of Santana have rarely been (not a mean feat, considering how bad internal relations were within the group at the time this album was made). Santana and Schon do indeed compliment each other seamlessly, and \\"Chepito,\\" Mingo Lewis and Mike Shrieve drum up a storm throughout. Easily the best album with which Carlos Santana was ever involved."},{"rating":"2","title":"santana reinvented on this proto fusion opus","review":"this album has more of a miles davis influenced fusion sound than its predescessors. i believe that rolie and schon were still onboard on this one although rolie's vocals are more prominent i think on the first three santana releases. great guitar, keyboards, and the ever present latin percussion work,a vital ingredient in the santana-sound. a great listen when in chill-out mode."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great music, psychedelic jazz leanings","review":"This was the beginning of Santana's flirtation with jazz. The original Santana band, with Greg Rolie on keyboards and Neil Schon on guitar, moving toward a John Coltrane-inspired style of jazz, mixed with blues-drenched rock, sitting atop Latin rhythms.

A testament to the healing power of music achieved."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Supernatural or Abraxas","review":"There are so many other reviews here that say exactly what I want to say about this music so I will not add much. I think it is much better than Santana's most popular and excellent albums, \\"Supernatural\\" and \\"Abraxas\\". There are no hit songs here, just the original Santana band hitting their musical peak in an inspired work of intense power and beauty. My favorite tracks are \\"Stone Flower\\" (#8) and \\"La Fuente Del Ritmo (#9), both of strong Brasilian flavor, and \\"Waves Within\\" (#2) - I dare you to figure out the meter this one is in. I don't care much for Track #5 and 6, but everything else is close to perfection."},{"rating":"2","title":"The end of the begining","review":"It's not jazz, but it's still great music.I wouldn't dare compare this music to Kind of Blue,Filles de Kilimanjaro, or A Love Supreme,it falls closer to Electric Ladyland, where sound becomes color and image.Anyone who has listened to this work would never imagine this being played on smooth jazz radio, the playing is simply is too charged on Waves within and Every step of the way, or just strange on Future primative and Eternal caravan of reincarnation.Even Carlos' playing technique is revitalized, going from one note sustain, to fast foward swooping flurries of notes.While at times it references jazz, Every step of the way reminds me of Solea on Miles, Scetches of Spain,the music doesn't adhere to any one music genre.Finally, music is about opening doors, not closing them and your imagination is the open door to creativity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Santanas Most Underated Work","review":"This is one of my personal favorite Santana albums of all time.

I guess in the end I fall into the category of readers who likes a cohesive plot. Just because you are trying to be existential does not mean you can just string a bunch of events together without any thought to the book as a whole. You don't have to answer every mystery for me, but the book started out with such an interesting premise and so many promising mysteries to be solved that I was disappointed when none -- not one -- was revealed. I enjoyed the beginning third or so of the book, but once the narrator started re-enacting a series of meaningless (or were they? I guess we'll NEVER KNOW) events, it became so tedious a read I began to feel that I, like the narrator, was going insane. Possibly that was the author's point. Well done if so, but it didn't make for a very enjoyable read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I, like many other reviewers, bought this book after reading favorable reviews in major publications.It was one of the worst books I have read.

We never find out what's wrong with this guy - is it brain damage from his trauamtic injury or is he just a self-absorbed creep who now has the money to indulge himself?

Jack Bruce and his lyricist Pete Brown(whose efforts by this time had become much more obscure than in his Cream days) are more prevalent on side 2.

Very few books have reached this level and the author has impressive credentials. After researching them online I discovered that most of the 35 different yarns are knitting worsted or dk which is good because I don't have them nor can buy them. Every design is explained first by math and nature although it didn't help me much. Pictures are ok but more would have been even better. No complaints on book layout, printing or schematics, although type could have been darker. Yarns are not labeled in the new number system or the old which is a problem as two are already discontinued. Make no mistake, this is a difficult book but it is also a milestone on the knitting map. Yes, it is a pattern book but more than that, it is a new way to see knitting and for those few who can understand it should lead to a new world of knitting designs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book listed as new but book had stain","review":"I just wanted the buyer to know that they listed the item as NEW but on one of the pages there is a stain and it a fungus stain.

The book has a lot of really great patterns, and is much more colorful and varied on the inside. The book is divided into sections that take their inspiration from things from nature, and not just your ususal, earth, water, fire, routine. The book includes some great designs, and the photographs are really beautiful.

I also bought this book unseen, but with Norah's previous designs in mind. I would send it back but it would cost me almost as much as I paid for the book in postage. Let Dr. John C. Scotland knit and wear these designs. Almost if not all knitted designs are comprised with elememnts of math. Many designers are inspired by nature and I am inspired by the designers. Two very respected designers come immediately to mind, Meg Swansen and Alice Starmore. This book is the greatest disappointment in my huge knitting book library.

Ms. Roth, whining about not being as famous as you'd like is BORING and it should be left to your diary in the future.

He's basically your loser character in the start but you learn to like him as well as the three women oogling over him. Overall, if you haven't seen the previous dvds, you wouldn't enjoy just watching the ending to an anime. I recommend seeing them all but that's just my opinion. Take it for what you will, this anime is definitely worth owning, from dvd 1 to dvd 7.

Criswell with the addition of the views of John McArthur.It is narrow and sectarian. Perhaps this most alarming thing is Dr. Vines statement that one cannot get doctrine from the book of Acts. Dr. Vines also uses the false story that Toronto University Language school has discredited the gift of tongues. I called the university and they deny any such study. This book is sermonic not schorlarly-it is the cessationist view at its worst. Vines claim to speak for Southern baptists is arrogant-His admission that right or wrong his baptist heritage ranks above scripture is interesting in light of baptist high regard for scripture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusion","review":"I found this book to be VERY confusing. At the onset, Dr. Vines admonishes us to accept \\"All\\" the scripture as completely true and reliable and then later on in subsequent chapters, he tells us we can't get our doctrine from the Book of Acts. He calls this a \\"rule\\" and gives absolutely NO biblical substantiation for this \\"rule.\\"I found this to be only one example of the contradictory and confusing nature of this book. I cannot recommend this book as a reliable, biblical source for the person sincerely seeking God's Word for information on spiritual gifts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing journey on several levels","review":"This was the best work of fiction I have read in a long time. McCarthy's bare bones prose seems to cut through the billowy fluff of overused adverbs and strike right at the heart of his target emotions. A stinging commentary on modern man's plight for purpose. Full of both hope and despair. Although I have been a big fan ever since \\"No Country for Old Men,\\" \\"The Road\\" puts McCarthy on my list of all time greats."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gray and heartbreaking","review":"The novel is about the despair and hope againgst knowing better of a father that wants to save his child in a world that has lost life and above all, it's civilization. There's hardly any indication of what caused this situation (probably a nuclear war) but that's not important. The description of the scenery is breathtaking. The world is all gray and covered in mist, with ashes being swept around by a cold wind. What remains of life are the stubs of burnt trees; what is left of civilization are the houses that they have to plunder in order to find food. Of course other survivers have plundered the same houses before them. The agony and despair of the father as their physical condition wears down are heartbreaking.In its grayness, a great book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bestseller in the most boring book category","review":"I got hold of this book because of Oprah's recommendation. I was bored to death therefore I quit reading it. I had to re-check Oprah's website if this was indeed one of the books she recommended because I thought maybe I made a mistake. Oh yes indeed. I do not understand why she found this book worthy to read. I have to agree with one of the reviewers that a book awarded by the Pulitzer Award is not a guaranteed good read. This is the 2nd book I read which won a Pulitzer Prize which I didn't find worthy of my time. If there was a list to come up with the most boring books ever read, I would nominate this on top of the list."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Road","review":"This book really make you think about the way of the world. Totally different perspective than Stephen King's \\"The Stand\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Repetitious","review":"I bought this book based on other's reviews and because it was a Pulitzer Prize winning book. The premise sounded good, but in actuality it wasn't. The storyline of a father and young son traveling across a post apocalyptic America to \\"the coast\\" sounded intriquing and I was expecting more than what the author provided. It was basically the same thing over and over and over.... . It was cold, it was dark, the trees were black, gray ash covered everthing, we were hungry, the old blankets stank, run into some bad people, then repeat again, then repeat again, you get my point. I honestly do not see what made this book a \\"Prize\\" winner. Thumb through the pages and read one or two, then thumb to another part of the book and read another page or two, you'll see what I mean. Save yourself some time and money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment","review":"I found this book to be redundant and lacking in substance. As other reviewers have pointed out, McCarthy's sparse prose succeeded in giving the reader plenty of freedom with which to imagine the post-apocalyptic world. But coming from the same author who penned the Border Trilogy and No Country For Old Men, I view this book as a huge dissapointment hardly worthy of the few hours it took to read (it goes very, very quickly because McCarthy indents quite liberally every couple of lines-- another reason why this book is hardly worth buying). To say the least, I expect much more out of one of my favorite contemporary fiction writers."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Road- audio book","review":"originally, I purchased this book in audio form because I mistakenly believed I'd be able to load it onto my digital card in my phone for leisure listening. That didn't work. the CDs overlapped each other; there was no differentiating between any. The narrator did a good job except for the boy's voice. He made the boy sound like a major wimp, which irritated me as I listened. Lesson learned- audio books aren't for uploading yet. Perhaps this is how we'll all end up buying kindles and like products. Other lesson learned, there's no narrator as good as one's own imagination. I will buy the book from now on.I was enthralled with the story despite it's depressive nature. I look forward to eventually seeing it on screen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overcooked and not very tasty...","review":"This book is science fiction so I shouldn't be too hard on it but the premise is weak. I love a good post-apocalyptic story but this wasn't very satisfying. The world has been dead for at least 4 or 5 years but yet there are still people wandering around it occasionally eating each other. A nameless father and son team survives day to day by somehow finding food in places where they are always found by others (so why didn't the others find the food first?). The man tries to convince himself that they are the good guys, but in the end, while not cold blooded murders, they are strictly out for themselves. The extremes are too obvious, the setting too unrealistic and unexplained, and finally the ending too inconsistent with everything else in the book.Luckily this book is a very quick read and I'm glad I didn't spend the money to rush out and see the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Road","review":"I really liked this book. At first I wasn't sure what I was getting myself into, but I was hooked from the first few pages through to the end. You really kind of put yourself in the Father's shoes, and for those of us who have kids, it's easy to connect with him. It's a horrible future and humanity has gone crazy. So, to go on this journey with a boy and his father who still have compassion, it's an amazing thing. I sent this book to a friend of mine and was dissapointed that he didn't like the book as much as I did. I still recommend it, but I understand not everyone will like it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Probably my favorite book of all time","review":"I read this book when my daughter was about 6 months old and it moved me in a way that few books have.

Listen to Rupert Degas's reading of Cormac McCarthy's The Road. McCarthy won a Pulitzer Prize with this novel describing the passage of father and son down an endless road in a wiped-out environment, scavenging for food to survive where they can. I read the novel first so I knew the story, but couldn't tear myself away from this audio. Degas (in totally different voice to his readings of another contemporary \`great', the novels of Haruki Murakami) doesn't get emotionally embroiled...just reads it like it is. As listeners, we can only observe, frightened, hopeful, concerned, occasionally tearful, as father/son stagger on to an ending you know is coming in one way or another. McCarthy's language, spare and powerful, hits home like poetry. Required listening for politicians playing nuclear power games."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just got the book today","review":"I was in the first screening audience for the movie made from this book last night in NYC.Let me say the movie was riveting, the whole audience was at the edge of their seats the whole movie.

It was a horrifying, picture of a dying earth and the last people who are still barely clinging on.

I was surprised that a book written in this uncompromising way did have hope and something relenting in it's ending, I expected the worst and I thought an ending more in mode with the rest of the book, would have made it a better book, for me anyway.

I'm a huge *fan* of apocalyptic and post apocalyptic literature (but PLEASE, NO ZOMBIES, THANK YOU VERY MUCH). No idea why this subject fascinates me as it does (and I know I'm not alone!), might be one result of the Cold War Baby Syndrome (and yes, we really were waiting for \\"the big one\\"). Having written my own short stories (for many years) and even a novel, I know that the characters and scenario stay with you during the entire writing process and beyond. I can't imagine how McCarthy lived, day and night, with this rattling around in his head, but WOW I'm glad he did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull, Old, Pointless","review":"This book could have probably been written by a 15 year old. It is linear and lacks depth. The theme has been in every low budget horror movie. I felt like McCarthy stole the four hours that it took me to read this and I was offended one particular image that he created. It was unnecessary and led me to conclude that Cormac is a sick man. His book is 250 pages of disgust that leads only the most shallow thoughts. Oprah is wrong on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Am I missing something?","review":"This is hyped as a masterpiece yet I don't see why. Is it the writing style? There is no plot, no climax. Only character development (and rather surface at best) as we enter the lives of a father and son on the road after an apocolyptic event (which is never explained), follow them for a few months, then end as the father dies and the son goes to live with the only \\"good people\\" they encounter.Pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I heard from a friend whose opinion I respected that this book and others by Cormac McCarthy were a good read. I was very disappointed in The Road. It was a depressing, rambling account of the apocalypse. It was lacking in punctuation and dialogue worth reading. Now I'm trudging though his Trilogy, not as depressing but still a chore to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brilliant with the right mix of Prozac","review":"Come on.

There is no beginning, since we never even know what destroyed the world. There is no end since there is nothing at the end of the journey. It probably made a \\"good\\" movie, which I don't intend to see, since the scenes would be perfect for lots of gruesome special effects and loud noises when something unexpected happens. It seems to be raining or snowing all the time, but the sun never shines through the smoke and ash, so I wonder how water gets evaporated to form the clouds. I would recommend One Second After or Alas, Babylon or Lights Out online at FrugalSquirrel"},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment","review":"Friends told me this book was great, couldn't wait to enjoy it myself...... well, it didn't happen. The Road goes nowhere. Every day is gray and bleak, father and son moving on the road after earth has been destroyed, they search for food, hide from the bad guys and keep moving. That's it, from start to finish. Maybe not the worst book I've ever read but it's in the bottom 20."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrific descriptions haunt me","review":"This book is very well written, you can fly through it. The problem is that you may not want to. I am not a shrinking violet, but I had to put this book down half way through. I continue to be haunted by barbaric images, so coldly and callously delivered to the reader. I made it about 20 pages past the first cellar scene. The post-apocalyptic world may indeed be exactly as he describes, and like another reviewer I hope I would be among the lucky dead if that happens. But keeping these negative images in my head makes me feel as if I am contributing to this eventual outcome. McCarthy celebrates the most vile and inhumane traits of people. No thanks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful, terrifying, gripping","review":"The simple description is that a man is traveling down towards the ocean with his young son in a post-apocalyptic land. The land and sea are dead . . . all plant and animal life. A few humans remain.Cormac McCarthy tells the tale as it has never been told before. Human love in it's purist form. Human depravity also in it's purist expression. Despair. Haunting memories. A father and son loving and giving to each other in a hopeless situation. Where is God at? Does he reveal himself, or did he even exist? Where will the next meal come from? The allure of death. So many elements and so well constructed and told.I was floored by this piece of work. Cormac McCarthy wrote a masterpiece.If we are still here in 50 years, this novel will be standard fare in reading and literature classes. And sociological studies.READ THIS BOOK."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Road - A Must Read","review":"As the father of two young children I found this book timeless, heart wrenching and tragically beautiful. McCarthy's prose is stripped down of all pretense. He manages to convey the horror of a post-apocalyptic world in a way that is singularly powerful. The bond between the father and son, the son's innocence and the primal urges that keep them both alive are riveting. I could not put this book down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tears, again...","review":"A couple of summers ago I decided to read all of the Pulitzer Prize winning books for fiction. I've read many of them now and I must say, this is only the second that has brought me to tears. (The first was Lonesome Dove - my very favorite and worth reading, even for those who doubt they'd like a \\"Western\\").McCarthy definitely makes the reader empathize with the characters, just as McMurty does. Being a mother of a young son, I think I was especially touched at the end. Even with this son (and a younger daughter) running around the house, I still finished the book in a day. I found myself just wanting to get to the end to see if there would be a glimmer of hope. I guess there was, but it was hard to look past the despair of the first 254 pages once I got to it. This book frightened me, but I can see why it won the prize. Very well written."},{"rating":"2","title":"A quick road","review":"This book won the Pulitzer Prize. Oprah liked it. And now I read it. That means I'm smart!Actually, an easy read. I tend to enjoy a fine piece of post-apocalyptic fiction (like The Stand, The Cell, and On the Beach), but this book creeps more into the fine literature category. A nice transition me thinks. Most importantly, a touching father-son story that points out the difficulties a dad must confront in order to protect his son. The world would be a better place if more parents put their children first, but the world is also a much better place in the pre-apocalyptic stage. At least I hope so. Otherwise when we get over to the post phase we're all going to be kicking ourselves for not making the jump sooner. Well, those of us who survive anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating","review":"Not a lot happens in this book but the prose is captivating. The detached simplicity makes you care all the more for the man and the boy. It tugs at your heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Add Me to the List of Admirers of This Book","review":"I haven't particularly cared for McCarthy's books but this is a great exception. Like any good \\"road\\" story, this one leads somewhere and the suspense that builds up during the journey about where and how this journey will end is as palpabable as anything else you may read. It's uncanny how McCarthy can take just a man, a boy and a hopelessly bleak setting and fashion a book of compelling, heart-wrenching intensity. Whereas before, where McCarthy's spare writing style turned me off, in this book, it adds infinitely to the greatness of the book. I've always enjoyed apocolyptic novels and this is one of the best, exceeded only, in my mind, by George Stewart's enduring cult-classic \\"Earth Abides.\\" \\"The Road\\" will be -- and should be -- one of the great books of our times."},{"rating":"2","title":"crushing","review":"The man can write.

I was very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Probably worst book I ever read","review":"Repetitive child-like dialog without an exact explanation of what put this father and son in a position to roam endlessly to a place called \\"the south\\" without any reasonable purpose to read it to the end, which was as disappointing as the beginning and middle of one of the worst books I've ever suffered through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the Kool Aid?","review":"Major disappointment!! This should be called \\"The Load\\". Here is the first one hundred pages: It's dark, cold, bleak. A man and his son look for a place to build a fire. This is one the most overrated books in America. The man did what any decent father would do. Nothing extraordinary. Bleaker and darker scenarios have been described in any midrate horror novel.I didn't get it. Then again, I don't get The Black Eyed Peas or other crass commercialism. The use of prose is annoying. Do you have to be a christian or something to understand the \\"powerful\\" and \\"lapidary\\" metaphor? Here's the end: There used to be trout in the rivers. The world was once great. It is a long way to go to find out that you need hope to survive. I would have given this a negative star if possible. Don't drink the Kool Aid (or maybe you need to)."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the Worst Books I've Ever Read","review":"What is all the hype about? This book is absolutely boring and depressing.

Bleak will be well described for you from every angle. But doggone it when the occasion arrises for some plot to develop it doesn't. Couldn't they have had some interaction with any number of persons they came across. The espied little boy? The torture chamber operators? I would love to tell you what a great literary achivement The Road is, and it may well be, but to me it was little more than uneventful. Being a baby boomer this is not an unfamiliar story line. We've been exposed to any number of end of the world type tales, books, movies etc. I was looking forward to a fresh perspective and that just didn't surface. Some of my fellow amateur critics have suggested Mccarthy's works to be Hemmingwayesque. Perhaps. Not a lot going on with the 'lost generation' either. I gave it three stars for it's potential as a short story. Not the 'one star' that the scale shows."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Book, Ridiculous Pricing (Random House, again ...)","review":"Terrific book, but Random House has priced all of their ebooks so far out of reach that I will wait until their prices return to some semblance of sanity before I ever purchase another book of theirs! Absolutely ridiculous!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the best book that I have read in some time.","review":"McCarthy has a knack for providing remarkably vivid imagery of the bleakest existence that one could imagine. A father and son's borderline hopeless journey through more than one type of darkness is beyond gripping. If not for the love shared between these survivors, a remarkable knowledge of woodcraft (and more than a little luck in a luckless world) all would be lost.The horrors of sickness, starvation and depravity add up and their few moments of happiness dwindle into the dust that permeates the blackened world in which they travel. Yet the pair struggles to \\"carry the light\\" to the coast.The Road is cautionary, compelling, and gut-wrenching, but not without hope.This tale will haunt you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book I ever read","review":"Judging from all the reviews you will either love this book or hate it. I'm not sure why I even finished the book, terrible (unusual) writing style and very depressing, but it will certainly generate some type of emotion. I kept reading, hoping to get some answers, instead I finished feeling like I wasted my time. If you are looking for something feel-good or lighthearted, keep on looking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting but dark","review":"Interesting writing - just not what I expected - had never read this author before.

This is a \\"The Road Warrior\\" rip-off which is not one tenth as entertaining as the movie was. And it won the Pulitzer? Who is giving out those awards? Very dull book.By the way, I didn't fail to put in quotation marks in my excerpt from the book. The author apparently doesn't use them. In fact, half of the rules of punctuation are ignored in this book. Very artsy, isn't he? Very modern. He dont need no stinkin punctuation!Easily, the most over hyped, overrated book of the decade.

I was bored out of my mind within just a few pages but finished the book to see if anything good would happen. The writing is simple with short, clipped sentences that wouldn't get a passing grade in a junior high school class. The story never really goes anywhere and the characters are never developed well. The whole story is post nuclear holocaust and basically about a guy and his son who travel along a road toward the coast (why??) and nearly starve, find some food, nearly starve, find some food, nearly starve, find some food, and then the father dies in the end. WTF?? I can't believe I wasted time reading this."},{"rating":"2","title":"suicide or survive?","review":"Reading about being one of the last people alive in a dying world begs the question asked early in the book: survive or suicide? The book doesn't answer the question for you, but you'll know where you stand by the end. This post-apocalyptic book is unique that it doesn't focus on what caused the catastrophe (never mentioned) or on how to rebuild the society as a Stephen King book would. McCarthy offers no hope. It is clear that we have entered the story years after the cataclysmic event and that the world is ending and the few remaining humans are left hanging on. The book is about a father raising a son in a dying world for no reason other than that they are still alive \\"for now\\". The father tries to protect his son from some of the worst horrors and imparts him with the knowledge that there are limits to how far they are willing to go to survive. You will not sleep for days when you read this. It is not for the light of heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"I finally got around to reading this one...","review":"and I am sorry I waited so long.

McCarthy has stolen my heart, and I'll definitely be reading more of his work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Say What?","review":"It took me a good 50 pages to figure out this story was not about two homeless people. This book is unequivocally bad, for reasons that have been well explained by other reviewers. It would be futile to once again point out the lack of punctuation and lifeless dialogue that make The Road an atrocious read, and I would find other things to criticize but those are the only features I really remember. It is a very bad sign indeed when all of the 1 star reviews of the book start to resemble the repetitive and monotonous work itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lack of punctuation makes you illiterate, not genius","review":"Why oh why have so many people praised this book?

One was one too many."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"I was looking forward to reading this based on all the reviews. I've never been so disappointed in my life. It wasn't haunting, or stunning heartbreaking beauty, it was boring. There was no suspense, no drama only dreariness. I didn't see any of the environmental themes or love themes other reviewers saw; I saw only an interesting idea for a novel and a lackluster and juvenile attempt to flesh out the idea. I wanted to like this but didn't. Read Alas Babylon or One Second After if you want to read a good book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Book","review":"I read this book as I like books that challenge my comfort level with life. This has to be the worst book I have ever read. It not only is depressing, which I can handle but it doesn't end. What I mean is the journey the boy and his father embark on is the same day after day. There is little to no variation in the situations they find themselves in and the end isn't an end at all. While I am ok with endings and books that offer little hope I prefer books that do end. This book leaves you hanging and wondering why you read it. If you buy it and read it good luck as it will leave you wishing you hadn't read it at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book, but not a sci-fi great","review":"I would recommend this as a read, and perhaps a moral lesson.

This book is almost debilitating in its sweet and tender execution. I feared the next page while the man and the boy had not the luxury of \\"not looking.\\" To be witness to such devastation and to hold on to \\"the fire\\" is a gift beyond measure. It is more than father-to-son and son-to-father; it is a story of trancedent love that exists in life and beyond. This is poetry and fable and Scripture--I have not the faintest notion where one ends and another begins in this book. Which is just how it should be. There is hope in love. Please read The Road."},{"rating":"2","title":"Philosophy","review":"I was really surprised by this book. It was a journey into philosophy more than a post-apocalyptic survival guide. I expected it to be more sci-fi, boy was I wrong. This book dives into the relationships of man, the destruction of man, and the \\"fire\\" that all of us carry. The fire could stand for many things: Love, Soul, God, Goodness, Hope... it's whatever means most to you. Cormac invents his own style of grammar and dialogue that eventually grew on me. It was hard to get used to at first, but it somehow ties into the overall theme of the novel. A good read, but it may not be for all people. It takes a lot of thought, time, and self-examination to understand what the author is trying to relay to us. A very interesting novel that proves there may be hope after all is gone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful Story","review":"The Road is such a powerful story focusing on two characters, a man and a boy, trying to survive in a post-apocalyptic world.

It doesnt get ANY better! I have no idea what you guys find redeemable in this book. The language, sentance structure and choice of words make it like slogging through a thick, stinky, smelly swamp. The author gives no backstory, no history, and no future....it would not have been hard to add the rest that was lacking.

We know nothing about the man or the boy, not even their names. We know that the boy is hungry because he tells the man \\"I'm hungry\\" - - we know the man also knows because he tells the boy \\"I know\\". And there you have it, the book in a nutshell.Don't be tempted by the reviews, this book is just bad.

You can read the first page, then skip to the last page and you won't miss a thing. There are some bad guys, but the father and son never interact with them, and the boy must be the most annoying kid in all fiction. He has two lines of dialogue. \\"I'm scared,\\" and \\"I'm really scared.\\" Yeah, yeah, the writing is poetic and all, but the point of fiction is to tell a story and McCarthy completely misses the boat here.

What gripped me was how McCarthy stripped down the prose (hard to read at first, but then it worked with the overall tone of the book) to the same desolate state as the world created. Even though he doesn't use names (except once) and dialogue and descriptions are stripped down to a minimum, its amazing how much you fill out in your mind which makes it a rich experience. Similar to a horror movie that only alludes to the actual crime, sometime the mind fills in much better than full disclosure.

Many of the unusual words he used do not appear in my large dictionary, but other sources verified them as real words. Sometimes, however, I wonder if his editors are so in awe of McCarthy's prose that they are afraid to change anything, so they leave a word like \\"slutlamp\\" when maybe it should have been the more common (and contextually appropriate) \\"slitlamp.\\" When \\"cant\\" is clearly meant to be \\"can't\\" in dialogue, did the editors feel they couldn't correct it?McCarthy strips away everything that is not essential, including exposition, punctuation, character names, and quotation marks.

I found it difficult to read, I found the story boring, and the overall premise confusing. Here is the plot:Walking --> Tired --> Sleep --> Rain --> Walking --> Hungry --> House --> People? --> Walking (repeat)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull","review":"I had to read this for my highschool english class and it was extremely boring. I'm writing an essay on it right now and it makes me realize even more how bad this books is.."},{"rating":"2","title":"McCarthy's \\"The Road\\"","review":"I think the book is excellent. It is very moving and has a profound affect. The reader is led to review and narrow his priorities."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to McCarthy's usual standards","review":"I normally like McCarthy's books but this one doesn't make any sense. Why would every living thing but way too many starving humans be killed by whatever it is that happened? And why does he leave it a mystery what the cause of the mass extinction was?"},{"rating":"1","title":"McCarthy has hit the wall...","review":"A tedious and dreary book. Only star-struck fans of McCarthy could praise this effort. Sentence fragments and the discarding of punctuation can't make this a clever book. If repetition, puerile sappy dialogue, and cliche apocalyptic images interest you, then have a go. Clipped one-line sentences spread out over 241 pages at least make the read go quickly. Skip twenty or thirty pages and it won't matter; you don't need to keep up with (or enjoy) a meaningful pattern of events or thought. Even admiring fans must face the conclusion that this effort is the definition of \\"potboiler.\\" Cormac, don't do this again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bunny in a blender","review":"\\"The Road\\" is a story about a bunny that gets thrown into a blender. There is no explanation for how this comes to pass, just a vivid and horrifyingly believable account of the subsequent event. The bunny is cute and innocent, with all of the good qualities we normally associate with bunnies, although it is never given a name. The terrified bunny tries valiantly to hop away from the blades, but ultimately, it is getting ground to bits. The book ends before the bunny is actually completely dead, but there is no hand waiting to turn off the switch. Maybe there will be a power failure.Some people take away from this story an uplifting message of the goodness of the bunny contrasted with the evil of the menacing blades. Some are inspired by the bunny's determination to escape in spite of the hopelessness of the circumstance. I just see a bunny in a blender."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly overrated author","review":"I bought this on a professor's recommendation because I like apocalyptic fiction. The story and concept has great potential, but fails in execution because of McCarthy's style. Even without reading the text (I understand he doesn't use quotations, among other proper punctuation), his writing style clearly felt simplistic and stilted. There were sections (mostly settings) that I thought well painted, but the dialogue was weak and often unbelievable. The narrator's 'child' voice didn't help much, but was a minor point.tl;dr: The poor dialogue and staccato sentence structure doomed what would otherwise be a very powerful story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Post Apocolyptic Grapes of Wrath","review":"The Road is descriptive. The problem is it describes the same scene over and over again, in such pain staking detail that the impression is burned in your brain. The book reminds me of The Grapes of Wrath, but with less point and more dirt and dust. I highly recommend passing on this one. If your looking for post apocalyptic fiction, I recommend either Alas, Babylon, or Swan Song instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Searching for...Godot?","review":"As many others have noted, we have seen and heard so much of this before -- two people (in this case, a father and son), searching for meaning in a post-apocalyptic world. Not only did the environment(s) remind me of Waiting for Godot, but much of the dialogue did, too, although these two protagonists did seem somewhat more hopeful. Also, there comes a point at which too much is asked of us in the way of \\"suspension of disbelief.\\" In The Road, we're meant to believe that all life on Earth -- including birds, fish and insects -- has been wiped out, but a few hardy humans nevertheless survive. Really? We outlive cockroaches? I guess, like Godot, this story goes down easier if you simply accept the impossible without question.I DID appreciate the occasional lyricism of the author's prose, however. This book would've been much diminished without it."},{"rating":"1","title":"With all of the good books McCarthy has written why this one ?","review":"Meridian, All the Pretty Horses, and No Country for Old Men were Great books. This one was not. Why this was the basis for the Pulitzer is beyond me. I found myself flipping through pages to avoid the monotony of a time consuming, ridiculous trip accross a ravaged land. Some judges may have thought this was another Old Man and the Sea. More likely, The prize was awarded because McCarthy's collective works were deserving of recognition. I would not consider this book as a reflection of the author's better novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"what is the message???","review":"I dont know why so many people liked this book. The author left much to the imagination (names of characters, what happened to the world that left the boy and man in this desperate situation. There is very litte dialogue and while we understood that the father had intense love for his son, the author left it to our imagination to find out if there were any other motives which seem evident (ie guilt?).There wasn't enough dialogue, which hindered the development of the characters.There are only so many paragraphs I could read that described the conditions around them, much of which had nothing to do with the story. I started to say to myself \\"OK...I get it already....the world is desolate\\", now move on and develop the story. I do not know why there are so many popular reviews. I'm fine with a depressing story, if I care about the characters, but in \\"The Road\\" I couldn't care less."},{"rating":"1","title":"One word: Boring","review":"Disclaimer: I only made it through 1/4 of the book. and then I couldn't finish it....so boring. No story, no revelations, nothing. Keep in mind that I am a fan of fine American literature, Steinbeck foremost among them. This is no Steinbeck. I couldn't have been less interested in the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stretching On Forever","review":"Another post-apocalyptic novel. This one is less fact and more fiction. I had a hard time believing the action of the two main characters, who seem to be pretending they are on vacation in a foreign land rather than traversing through a dead society.The road is literally that- a road, an abandoned highway that leads from the city to the coast. After some major nuclear catastrophe, a man and his young son take to the road in attempt to find a better place to survive than the ruined city.There are several very horrific and gory scenes portrayed within this book, including murder, infanticide, and cannibalism. Not recommended for younger audiences."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly depressing","review":"It's hard to know what rating to give this book. Picture a post-nuclear burned earth, with only a few people, and most of them cannibalizing the others. Write about it with poetic beauty, and have it end tragically. The English teacher in me loved the beautiful word choices, but I never did get used to the prolific use of sentence fragments.I'm not sorry I read it, but I couldn't really recommend it, either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book of the year, hands down.","review":"Incredible book. Very depressing, very disturbing, but unbelievably well-written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Holy Cow!","review":"Ususally Oprah doesn't pick a book that I like or wanted to read, but once in a great while she does, as in this case. This book was already on my list of books to read, so I jumped at the chance to have a good excuse to read it. Wow, I am so blown away. This book is so beautifully written that it creates beauty in the bleak theme. the man and boy are skillfully developed and amazingly real. The Road leaves you with many questions; some cannot be answered and with some the answer is painful at best. Read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth the read","review":"This is a very worthy read. Its only about 250 pages, but very vivid. We are brought into the post-apocolyptic world of a man and his young son as they try to make it to the coast across a barren wasteland. Facing a bleak future at best, starvation or death at worst, the stark contrast between the horrifying world they journey through and the love the man feels for his son and the bond between them is very stirring. The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is that I felt a little cheated given the cost of a hardback book. I expected it to be longer. In any case, I do recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"McCarthys artistic prose gives us a chilling account of an apocalypse","review":"Is is essentially a simple book. There is no complicated philosophical narrative or profundity of thought, the key lies in the descriptive prose. It tells of a Father and Son in an apocalypic time period with little or no hope left in the world. Its tells us of their journey along a road to find it. It gives us a believable account of the two opposing sides of human nature and how they react to the extremes of desolation. On the one side cruelty and wretchedness, on the other forbearance and humanity. Marvellously written, an excellent book. If I was to offer one small criticism, its the book's end. Knowing McCarthy's obvious talent I expected it to be stupefying. Unfortunatley ithe inertia ended with a small pop rather than a loud bang"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very depressing, but worth a read.","review":"This book provides good discussion for a book club meeting,and it is a fast read."},{"rating":"2","title":"great story, a touch too dark","review":"this is a fast read. i really liked this book except i would have liked a little more hope, a touch of lighter gray rather than the overwhelming amount of dark gray ash and rain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Come on people! It was a decent book, admit it.","review":"Just because the characters don't have names means it is a bad book. Seriously, would you take the time to name your kid when all that mattered was to survive. It is meant to be artistic. I don't really care about 'Oprah's Book Club'. I just picked this story out because it interested me. I don't care what you haters think. By the way, 267 pages is like a kid book to me. My average novel consist of 500-900 pages. Also, a barren nuclear wasteland wouldn't have much in it or a bunch of things to do. It did get a little slow at points, but if that is all u have to suffer from this book than you must hate a lot of books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Episodic and uninteresting.","review":"I was really looking forward to reading this book.

I found this an amateurish writing. I think if a high school or college student passed this in to a competent English teacher he or she would not receive a good grade. It was repetitive and was totally unrealistic. The dialogue between the child and the man seemed derivative of A. A. Milne, although I consider Milne the much better writer. As to the author having won the Pulitzer Prize, it again reminds me of the meaninglessness of so many once respected prizes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why all the Fuss","review":"Most depressing book I've ever read.. Best parts of the book are when the man and boy find a little food. I don't understand what the critics see in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressive, Most Impressive","review":"Based on impressions gleaned from critical reviews, I approached this book with considerable hesitation. It didn't seem like a couple of nameless characters in yet another post-apocalyptic landscape would sustain a novel. I was very, very wrong. It was a compelling book and a good read. Whether it resulted from McCarthy's art (likely), my sensibilities, or a bit of both, the book communicated the raw and powerful emotions with striking clarity, whether hope, love, anger or desperation. A very impressive book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Road","review":"I read this book in almost one sitting, and if only I did not need to sleep I would have read it all at once. This was a spectacular read, with a poetic and unique style that conjured up emotions and goosebumps for me as I read.I loved the dynamic set forth by the author, and unlike some reviews I read that stated there was no story I beg to differ. There was a story that keep me turning the pages, and the relationship the book was about was remarkable and heart warming. I loved this and look forward to seeing how this is adapted to film."},{"rating":"2","title":"the road","review":"Great book. Definitely a literary classic. The movie is really good too. Close to the book. A great read for Dads."},{"rating":"2","title":"Five stars not even close","review":"This is one of the greatest novels I have ever, and will ever read. Harrowing, beautiful, and completely unforgettable. At times I just had to put the book down and walk away, I was almost too frightened to read what may come next. I don't think any other book has caused me actual PAIN. Like another reviewer, I refused to see the film, no matter how superb it promised to be. As a mother of boys, I just couldn't put myself there again. Astonishing work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Take An Overdose of Sleeping Pills and Save Your Money","review":"An absolutely depressing book. I read the hype and should have taken a long nap.

It was just too gloom & doom. Seems my reviews are different from the crowd but I just didn't enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE","review":"This story has no solid plot at all. There are no details and its hard to feel sorry for the characters since you hardly know anything about them. The story is so choppy, it is hard to focus on the point the author is trying to get across. My recommendation is to not even bother with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hubris","review":"We human animals are so homocentric.

Hope? not for the human species."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing","review":"I have no idea why I ordered this book or if it was mistakenly sent to me .. in any event, it was one of the most depressing books I've ever read - despite the hope it is supposed to instill ... absolutly awful!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Road is long...","review":"...too long convey its story effectively. There are both horrifying and touching parts of the story, but in between are long stretches of nothing interesting, as gray and bleak as the world the author shows the reader. Dad loves his son, so much he will (literally) walk across the country to try and get him to any kind of safety or give him any kind of future. I found the story far too meandering and repetitive at points to convey the story effectively, McCarthy could have accomplished the same in a much shorter narrative and still registered the same points with the readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time and money","review":"This is the one of the worst books that I have ever read. It was a total waste of time and money. In fact, I was so depressed after I finished reading it that I felt I must write this review to notify potential buyers to \\"beware\\". Like other reviewers have previously written, it is like a fourth grader could have written it and it was boring and depressing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blunder Down The Road","review":"A rather depressing tale of woe set in the aftermath of a nuke winter in the lives of a man and his son. We never find out any names to give the man and his son human faces in their blundering way to the coast.

A hard look at what could be an apocalyptic reality. Great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Novel of the Last Decade","review":"This is possibly my favorite book of the last decade. There is something incredibly pure about the writing of Cormac McCarthy. This story is, on the surface, extremely sparse, containing no real driving plot, but rather a stringing together of events. Despite this lack of a traditional story, the sporadic events provide the reader with a rich insight into the human soul. This is a must read for all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not an easy read!","review":"I think this is the most difficult book I've ever read and I'm an avid reader. It was very hard to understand what caused the apocolyptic event. The conversations between father and son were not exciting. I would not recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful Book","review":"I won't spend much time agreeing with the other reviewers, which I do, who gave this one a single star -- though I would give it a zero if I could. A dreadful, dull, endlessly repetitive assertion that, at bottom, the best human kind is capable of is survival without reason (except perhaps to try to enable someone else to survive, an enterprise that turns out to be useless as well) and that the worst is a choking, horrible predisposition for doing individual and organized evil to others who come within their reach. The glints of something else in this book are few and artificial when they appear. Bottom line of the parable: humans are vicious, terrible creatures and doomed to stay that way. That is, why bother living when doing so is utterly senseless? People who think this way are or should be on medication. Want to consider doing away with yourself? Then this is for you. Otherwise, skip it -- or, better, round up copies and burn them to keep reading children from harm."},{"rating":"1","title":"ugh!","review":"very depressing.

The Road was an ok book. I don't think it was good enough to be a best seller, but might be worth the read."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time and money","review":"I bought this book because of the good reviews, I should have known better. It was a painstacking read. Good writing style but a whole lot of nothing in the contents and worse the all lot of nothing happened over and over again, talk about redundance. I kept waiting it would improve so I did go to the end, a waste of time. As soon as I finished the last page I threw the book away as I would never ever recommend it or give it to a friend, that would make for a sorry gift!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Part of my life I will never get back","review":"This was one of the worst books I have ever read. Not only was written poorly, and in a short paragraph format, it was too pretentious. The only reason I finished it was because I was hoping everyone would die."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Emperor has no prose.","review":"I am a Cormac Mccarthy fan and believe the Border Trilogy will be a literary classic for generations to come. This bit of overwritten pretension is more like Waiting for Godot without wit or style. I am a Faulkner fan, too, but would not recommend The Fable to newcomers. The Road is similar, all symbolism without character, never to have found a publisher without the author's fame and unlikely to find many readers in the future. No Country for Old Men was a delight and I believe this book is an anomaly. As the post-nuclear wasteland of The Road points out over and over, mistakes do happen and I look forward to the author's next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"not reccomended.","review":"This book sucked.

Either way, worth a read."},{"rating":"1","title":"A long, agonizing walk towards death","review":"\\"The Road\\" is an exercise in bleakness, punctuated by a bit of luck here and there, but generally, a dead, gray story of a world destroyed.As the two main characters struggle to survive, they get desperate and then get lucky, only to become deperate again, their only hope is that they stay together.One survives, but we never know what happens to that character. He is simply found by some people. The woman talks to him about God, but he talks to his partner in their long tortuous journey, his Dad.All in all, a completely unremarkable read I will soon forget."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Road","review":"Time out, how many people have actually read this book? I teach reading and English in high school. Next year in I will be teaching 5th grade in an elementary school. I am an old dog wtih a Masters as a Reading Specialist, age 57 and have been teaching most of my adult life. This book is the most horrible book I have read. Don't get me wrong the story line is great. Father & son battle to survive the end of the World. But page after page of \\"I'm Ok are you OK\\" and the constant walk to no where with no climax anywhere, ICK!!!. The dialouge is stale and without a doubt is dead form start to finish. My question to all of the other reviewers, is everyone jumping on the bandwagon or what? I may have to start my own book review club with real honest to goodness reviews.

The author does convey emotion well. Unfortunately, the only emotion in the book is flagging hope in the middle of a world of despair.The plot grows thin after a few pages. The man and the boy are starving. They find food. They're starving. They find food. They're starving. And now you get the idea.The ending of the book is as out-of-place as the ending to Ecclesiastes. After a very depressing trudge, \\"God\\" is suddenly the answer.Read a few pages. Feel bad for the main characters? You've now read the novel. There's no need to suffer through the text."},{"rating":"1","title":"Contrived","review":"In some undefined apocalypse, every large plant and animal dies except the protagonist, his son and a few other humans that turn to cannibalism to survive.No fish, no birds, no trees. No cockroaches, flies, mosquitoes, moss or lichen. But food rots, corpses smell and the heroes get sick. Obviously, bacteria and viruses are alive and kicking. Oh, and a few morel mushrooms made it, to feed our heroes once.In any world where a few humans survive for more than a year, you would at least expect some seeds to make it too. You'd expect insects to thrive. Plant growth would resume soon despite the meager sunshine. But the author doesn't let reality impinge on a comfortable construction of a setting where good and evil are so easy to pit against each other.The novel is a sequence of scenes of sadness and despair only possible because of a very contrived yet simplistic setting. Couldn't enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trite and Poorly Constructed","review":"I saw the rave reviews so I purchased this book to keep me occupied during a flight. It's a good thing I had nothing else to read otherwise I would have set this book down after page 30. The hype surrounding this and other Cormac McCarthy novels is such that little will deter the mass market from purchasing the book or seeing the movie, so I will be brief: the messages were trite and the story poorly constructed. Reading the book was living the book, getting through the whole thing was like \\"The Road\\", in this respect the book is a resounding success.The book is long on cheap emotional thrills and shallow philosophical musings and short on substance. It's a Harlequin Romance for the Oprah Club."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Will Stay With You","review":"Other reviewers have generally already said it. This is an unbelievably powerful work from one of America's finest. It is bleak, beautiful, hopeful, dark, and compelling. I would not call this my favorite book, nor even my favorite in the McCarthy library, but the images and and emotions that McCarthy conjures have stayed with me in a way that few other works have. I can't speak highly enough of it.Recommended for anyone who likes a compelling, emotionally draining read, but be warned: there are some truly disturbing moments. If you can get past these, you will be knocked on your duff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book of Hope","review":"I could say that this was a very bleak book, but instead, I will say that it became very apparent after 20 or 30 pages that it is anything but. Even with desolation everywhere, this is a book about hope, and specifically, the God of Hope. Why else would anyone continue on this journey through ash and despair? The author does indeed spell this out for us by the end of the book. One scene in particular where the father speaks made me think of my father and how he always said, \\"Life's a journey. Enjoy the ride!\\" and, \\"I just want for you to be happy. I want my family to be happy.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"It will haunt your dreams","review":"I wish I could tell you this is a pleasant little tale. It's not.

Difficult as it was to get through the first pages, I pressed on and found that the way McCarthy describes the events of the book--slowly, flatly, and devoid of gratuitous language/metaphor--actually very much lends itself to the subject matter. At the core, this book is about survival; about two humans beings against the earth, without a single barrier.McCarthy absolutely masterfully conveys the beauty of this, as well as the sheer horror of it-- One of the best books I've ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected.","review":"I didn't like that you never knew what happened to start the story.

The book is for a class, so the pagination has to be correct. I emailed Amazon/apex_media about the problem, telling them that if the pagination was not the same as the edition I'd originally ordered, I'd not be able to use the edition they sent me. They responded with a refund, which is great, but it would have been helpful to know about the pagination issue. I love Amazon and this disappoints me.

There is a wonderful tenderness in this story of the epic journey south of this unnamed father and son. It reminds me of the story in Cold Mountain. This is beautifully written. I disagree with the reviewers who write about the absence of plot. I found the main characters engaging and quite moving. I couldn't put the book down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Accessible McCarthy","review":"McCarthy is my favorite author. I think many people are not liking this book because they are not familiar with McCarthy's style. This story is a sparingly and beautifully written account of a father's love for his son and his son's love for him. Because this is an incredible tale of good and evil and enormous range of capabilities of the human spirit, it's not going to appeal to those who want to read a happy story. It's a trying account of everything terrible and wonderful that could be."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Road","review":"Of all McCarthy's novels I regard this as the best- they are all very well written in his terse style, but this is the most morally challenging. It is the background of stark dissoluable hopelesness, the brief glimmer of morality is stunning by contrast. The impact of the novel probably depends on where the reader is at in his/her life, but for me this was one of the best novels I have ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"This is not an uplifting story and you realize from very early in the book that things are going from very bad to much worse.However, the storytelling is fabulous and you cannot help rooting for the main characters, all the while knowing there is no good way out of this mess.The narrative style is much different from most books I've ever read, but even so the book read at an extremely fast pace.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"tedious","review":"Reading some of the reviews of this book was far more enjoyable than reading the book. I'm one of those uncultured people that does not get painting a Campbell Soup can. Or John Cage's 4'33\\". And now I can add this book. This was the most tedious book I've ever read. I admit that every once in awhile he turns a phrase or uses a word brilliantly. But that happens at the rate of about once every 50 pages. Just about every time I put the book down, I vowed to quit. But I guess my sadistic side would win and I actually finished it.My recommendation is to give this book a miss. Unless you were impressed by Warhol's soup cans and John Cage's silence, in which case you should run out and buy it immediately."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overated book","review":"I probably had a huge expectation on the book as so many people talk really good things about it but the truth is I found it hard to go over some chapters and I really thing it is generally overated"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Watch the Movie","review":"I got this book because I wanted to read is truly sad story... and it was also dirt cheap. I liked the post-apocalyptic setting. It reminded me of Konami's Silent Hill video game series. I began the book with a lot of enthusiasm, but that feeling soon faded as I turned each page. I found myself dragging along through some parts of the story waiting for something to happen. It was an okay story, but I wouldn't recommend anyone to read it. I also realized the style of writing in the book, and I didn't like it. This is only my own preference though, so others may find it enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must read for any father of a son","review":"This is a must read for any father of a son. Beautifully written. Emotionally stirring. Hemingway-esque. One of the best books I have ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haunting and uplifting","review":"It has been almost two weeks since I finished this novel and I am still haunted by it. I have let my 4 year old son sleep with us on no less than 4 nights since then. I have nightmares and I find myself pricing food rations and canned fruit. As haunting as it is is quietly very uplifting. You have a hardened father who only lives because his son lives. You have the boy who always wants to help. Always innocent. You see the joy of swimming in the freezing ocean. You see the joy of enjoying a coke. A warm bath. After reading this I find myself \\"stopping and smelling the roses\\" more. And making sure my son does too. As haunting as it is, there is still hope."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay? Not Okay.","review":"Ive never written a bookreview before.Never?Never.Okay?Okay.I had to force myself to finish this book, and I can't say I'm glad I did. Like the Seinfeld epidsode where Elaine was forced to watch \\"The English Patient\\" a second time, I kept thinking, \\"Oh, just die, die already!\\"Maybe I'm a prude because I hated the way the author took liberties with the English language, and not, to me, in a positive way. I kept wondering why he chose to write his book in English when he so seemed to hate its rules.Besides that, I couldn't identify with the characters, or their plight. If, as the book claims, the bleak landscape had been this way for years, why are they just now seeking some other venue? Whatever.I really hated this book. For others who feel the same, I recommend \\"The Secret History\\" by Donna Tartt. Now THAT's a novel worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"HATED IT!","review":"I read this book on vacation and hated every page of it. I found it to be extremely boring, dark, and unsatisfying. I appreciate the talent of the author, but this just wasn't my cup of tea."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay.","review":"I read this and couldn't help but think that this was more of a writer's experiment than anything else. I mean, it's okay, but it's merely that--okay. I've read much better.I felt like I was reading Steinbeck--admittedly, not my favorite literary person--and this is the kind of literature where the meaning behind the story is more important to the telling of it, and I found my self not really enjoying this one much at all. It's not that the sadness of it all didn't bother me, far from it. It was that there really wasn't that much substance to it at all.If you want to read a strong post-apocalyptic story, read \\"Alas, Babylon\\" by Pat Frank--there's so much more heart in it than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be sold with anti-depressants","review":"When it was the hot book of the moment, thanks to Oprah, I decided to give it a try.Wow was that a mistake.

But I just may be a uncultured philistine -- dare I want to ENJOY something I read?!Bindlestiff's critique nailed it. (see his summary--much BETTER than the book itself. I nominate HIM for the pulitzer!) It was a boring book about a father and son who keep trying to cover their cold and wet feet during a post apocalyptic era. The protection and love the father had for the boy was admirable and heroic, but still didn't carry the book for me.I also didn't find the lack of punctuation and \\"colorful\\" vocabulary to be literary, entertaining or worthwhile in any way. Both were distracting and felt elitist. No plot, no character development, no nothing. Save your time and money. I guess complaining about it with others who hated it as much as I did WAS satisfying as well....So if you LIKE to hate stuff sometimes, this is the book for you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for scientists","review":"The book is engagingly written and passionate. Hard to put down after you start. Unless you're a scientist. I initially liked the story, but eventually the details got to me.In my mind, the most egregious was how the characters are able to wander around with only face masks for breathing, when the ecosystem is so destroyed that there are no visible signs of plant life or even bacteria. Any disaster that will destroy other lifeforms so thoroughly is going to burn the skies so humans can't survive, either.After that became clear, things went downhill for me, as I let myself be distracted by, for example, the use of a shopping cart to drag supplies along the road years after the road became unmaintained"},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't understand why people like this book so much","review":"I really don't understand the big deal about this book. The entire book is very very boring. The dialog is horrible and the characters are never developed.

I had been hearing about how great it was for months. Well being deployed overseas to Afghanistan one finds the time to catch up on reading. One of my co-workers happened to have a copy of \\"The Road\\" so I took it and began reading. With each chapter you'll be wishing for excitement, danger, and climax. Well you can forget it! What you will get is long drawn out go nowhere plot. About all you will get is, The man loved the boy, they continued to walk, they ate pears, or fruit cocktail one night, they had to keep moving, it was cold, the boy was crying. Yeah, there you have it; I just saved you a few hours wasted on this novel. Being that it was on Oprah's book list should've tipped me off from the beginning. I can only hope they figure out a way to make the movie exciting because the book is a huge disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"IT AINT 'GOING MY WAY.'","review":"I love NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN and revere BLOOD MERIDIAN but THE ROAD stopped me in my tracks.

I should have quit reading it after the first 25 pages but I kept thinking it had to get better. A waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really unsatisfying","review":"It's a book about a guy and his son who are walking somewhere for no reason. For some reason, everything is dead and destroyed, but you never find out why. Everyone is miserable, and they have to fight for survival, but yet they also have to keep walking. I kept reading it, hoping that something would finally get explained... it never happened. The ending was both depressing and doesn't explain anything. Very unsatisfying.The whole concept reminds me of that movie Ron Howard was attached to direct: \\"It's about a killer robot driving instructor who travels back in time for some reason\\" - \\"did I mention his best friend is a talking pie?\\"Maybe I'm not cultured enough to \\"get it\\" -- but The Road was one of the worst books I've ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never been a McCarthy fan, and I'm still not","review":"I struggled through the text, but I did read it from start to finish. Cormac McCarthy is trying to create a self-reflective main character, but the problem is the character never stops blaming himself for every sin in the world. He comes across as shallow, narcissistic, and delusional. If you're looking for good post-apocalyptic fiction skip this one and go forEternity Road,The Postman, orOn the Beach."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Great","review":"This book does not deserve the hype it has been given. In my opinion it was mediocre. I love depressing stories, so that is not my complaint. I didn't find it to be as amazing as so many others did. The style is fine and his unconventional dialog did not bother me. I loved the idea of the book. It just didn't follow through. It's a quick read though so by all means, give it a chance if you are curious."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Road to Depression","review":"Sorry, but I just didn't get it and didn't want to waste my time trying. At first I tried to hang in there but found the story so redundantly monotonous and depressing I just had to start skimming. I actually dreaded picking up the book again and having to re-enter that world but I held out hope there for awhile that there was or would be something in there that made it all worth it. But I just couldn't keep it up. I'm sure literarily-speaking it's very well written and apparently the monotony and depression was actually the point but those themes just aren't my idea of entertainment. \\"No Country for Old Men\\" wasn't exactly a happy story either but at least it was an entertaining story with riveting scenes and great characters. There's nothing \\"entertaining\\" about this story. If you'd rather not spend your leisure time voluntarily inducing literary depression then avoid this number like the plague. For me, life's just too short to dwell on this stuff.But that's just me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected.","review":"This one was a bit disappointing. I found myself more interested in learning of the cause of the apocalyptic event than the plight of the characters. Yes, I get that the disaster is supposed to be secondary to this story. Was the lack of punctuation supposed to be \`edgy'? There were conversations between the \`man and the boy' that spanned an entire page that consisted of two word sentences. The flashback component was a bit too vague to help with the character development. If you are considering this book because you like the author's style, then you will probably not be unhappy. If, however, you are looking for an actual complete post-apocalyptic novel, then check out \`Free Flight', \`Down to a Sunless Sea' and of course \`Alas, Babylon'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"Not worth the read.Is it science fiction? Where is the explanation for the disaster? Humans are the only species to survive? No roaches or rodents, not even a seed?Too unbelievable with no explanation.Ok, so it's not science fiction. Is is a character study between father and son? No, There is minimal dialog and no character development.Is it an examination of a man's thoughts as he forges on toward certain death? Not really, we don't learn much about his thoughts, just witness the blundering on to an unknown goal.I found nothing intriguing about this book. It was simply a narration of a despondent man stumbling forward out of obligation when any sense of life had already flickered out in him. It could have at least discussed the motivations of a man in this state, but didn't. It more or less just stated what was done.At least it was short."},{"rating":"2","title":"No One Knows....","review":"No one knows what the trappings of a post-apocalyptic world will truly be, but the blighted state of humanity imagined in Cormac McCarthy's THE ROAD seems horrifically real. This is not a pleasant book. It is, in fact, quite the opposite - relentlessly depressing. But it's underpinnings of hope, regardless of the seemingly hopeless monochromatic landscape navigated by a father and son, is what makes it worthwhile. I caution you, though, to prepare yourself for an extremely sad story - one that will stay with you long after you finish the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful read and as the father of a 7 yr old boy.....","review":"I found myself teary-eyed after many of the exchanges between father and son.

It has been some time since I read a book that left so much to one's own imagination. I guess that is why it has left such a haunting memory. It is hard to not want more, this book could have been longer, a sequel perhaps? I read it in less than 18 hours, a record for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was tedious","review":"No, I don't buy into the \\"Oprah chose it, so it must be good\\" thought. Neither do I think the Pulitzer prize means much these days. The truth is that this book did not impact me like it apparently did others. The dialogue is so overtly simple that it's painful and the descriptions are so repetitive.(Question: How many times do they say OK? Answer: As many times as he talks about the ash.)His style is so easy to copy that one wonders, \\"what, then, is the big deal?\\" This is like modern art (You know, those splatterings of paint on a canvas that people call \\"art\\" and they read into it any artistic interpretation that comes to mind, when in reality it really is just blots on canvas). This book is like that, to me. If you want to overanalyze it and call it \\"profound\\", that's fine, but the reality is that this is a poorly told story with little or not literary value.I've read \\"The Border Trilogy\\" and wasn't too thrilled with those books either. I guess I'm done with McCarthy.

Just my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"A bleak dystopia","review":"You read and re-read The Sheltering Sky, Brave New World or The Handmaid's Tale. Not this book. You read it once, and that's enough. The bleakest dystopia. And unlike The Stand, we don't even get to know why everything goes to hell in a hand basket. We don't know if mankind did it or was it an earthquake. We know that by the time most of the remaining humans are willing to eat infants that something has gone terribly wrong. But we never find out why. There is no redemption. This is the way the world ends. This is the way the world ends. This is the way the world ends. Not with a bang but a whimper. More men will read this book than women, but that's true of most of Corman McCarthy's books. He pulls us into a world where there are very few words, women are decorative or gone. We understand this author's genius without needing to be reminded of it.

It is bleak, post-catastrophe, the father and the son on the road,hoping to find some place of peace and warmth in the post-apocalyptic gloom. You wonder whatcould be so compelling about a journey with so little hope, but the relationship between thefather and the son is sweet. The father is faithful, and a good protector in a time where noneof the old values hold true anymore. The son is hopeful. It is a frightening book, a time whereeverything has changed. There is no illusion of control over one's destiny - and yet the twogo on. Bleak, but you can't put it down. You care what happens to the pair."},{"rating":"1","title":"Civilization is a Very Thin Veneer","review":"I disliked this book so much thatfor the first time in my life, I threw a book in the trash. The only reason I give it two stars is that the novel shows that society reverts to anarchy if civilization as we know it is destroyed.I don't want to give the ending away so I will state that I don't understand why so many people are raving about it. The man is amoral at best and the ending is so contrived, it's laughable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure and haunting","review":"If you are a father to a son, prepare yourself.

How many times can you read about 2 people getting up in the morning (or not getting up), walking down a road (or not walking down the road), scrounging for food (and always seeming to find it when desparately needed)? I was waiting for the big payoff but it never came. Interesting dialog is non-existant. The few characters they meet are usually dismissed in a few pages or less. Booooring! My first kindle book was a dud."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Road stays with you","review":"It's cool that Oprah likes this story, but if you're already a McCarthy fan you don't need her endorsement. He can find the darkest places in the hearts of humans and take you to them. If you are like me, you will be on the Road with the boy and papa for a while, not just while your reading it. McCarthy drills home the description of the environs and the fear in the characters while leaving enough room for the reader to imagine a host of other horrors.

The relationship between the father and the son was endearing, but the simplicity of the story which most people seemed to enjoy was actually what I enjoyed the least. It felt like I was watching an incredibly slow movie that would end up getting an Oscar.Everyone is entitled to they're own opinion, but for post-apoc fans, I don't think you'll dig this one too much.

Only 167 of us, now 168, hated it enough to give it only one star. I found it so boring, repetitious, grim and hopeless that it was a physical and psychic struggle to stick it out to the end. (An end in which, for no credible reason given what came before, \\"hope\\" actually makes a cameo appearance.) I have read no other Cormac productions, and seen no films made from his novels, but after this endurance contest, I am not inclined to give him another chance. Over the decades, I have read several other novels depicting a post-World War III world, or a post-catastrophic natural disaster environment, and there have been a handful of films on the same themes. All of the other efforts were more enjoyable than this. I cannot understand what Mr. McCarthy was thinking, yet his effort got him a Pulitzer.

It's frusterating because I have yet to read a negative review, so I assume it must just be because I am stupid that I don't like the book.It's the end of the world and a father and son are traveling down a road. That's it? Yes, that's it. Maybe if the father's narrative used proper grammar and actually said things that made sense, it might have had more meaning, but as it is it is just meaningless garbage.Every other page is a description of them building a fire and burning a tin can of food, and almost every paragraph ends like this: What is it, Papa? I don't know.Eventually, I decided not to waste another minute of my life reading it and built a fire with it, keeping myself and my child (each the other worlds entire) warm as we ate from a tin can. What is it, he asked? I didn't know."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I guess I was expecting something different.

After hearing so much praise about how brillant this work is, it still sort of hit me like standing before million dollar abstract painting and just not getting it.

I think I became mentally tired of reading this book because of all the run on sentences.And, did I mention long and dark? I thought the depressing escapades of the father and son would never end. After a while I started to think the \\"mother\\" in the story had the right idea (not to give away anything to the brave souls who will still read this book after my review.) I know I was driven to that point several times while reading this book.A rating of two may be generous on my part, but I couldn't in good conscious give any written literature a one.

The dialog throughout the whole story is nicely done, everything is to the point and doesn't wander too much. It leaves you with questions every time you put it down (which you won't do much).

So what's the point of this book? Why doesn't he stop at page 3? I get the hopelessness.. I get the endelss, grey, nothingness. I get the hopelessness. I get the desparation. I get the hopelessness.

Quick read though so worht the read just b/c it is unique.g"},{"rating":"2","title":"Reflection","review":"What's interesting about this book is McCarthy never explicitly illustrates what his characters are feeling--it must be inferred by the reader. So in a sense, the only depth this book has is what the reader can bring to it. It's as if The Road were a reflection of the readers' intellectual and emotional capacity. Those who have traveled an arduous but enlightened path to this point in their life will view this book through the insights of those experiences. To these people, the book will reflect great meaning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down!","review":"I read this book in two sittings. Not only is it an easy read, it is so engrossing that I just couldn't put it down! Stark, beautiful and poetic."},{"rating":"2","title":"The road.","review":"A lot of people have had some issues with the way this book was written but I thought that was what made it stand apart from others and really added to the feeling of the book. Neither of the main characters have names, quotes are never used, and most scenes are very quick and only a few paragraphs with short sentences. That format really helped convey how bleak, cold, and dying the word had become. Instead of just describing how desolate the world had become McCarthy really conveys this through his writing style and it really helped connect me more with the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Road - A Modern Classic","review":"The Road - A Modern Classic as I like to call it was an excellent read. McCarthygave you a sense of compassion, love, empathy, despair all rolled into one great story. Even though it was depressing at times, the book also was a fable of bounding between a father and son in the most dire of times. I would recommend this to all adult readers. Can't wait to see how the do the book as a movie"},{"rating":"2","title":"Words written that will pound your emotions","review":"Quite simply one of the best books I have ever read. Better words have reviewed this book. But I have an addition: If you are a man with a son and you read this book it, in an emotional sense, will put gray hairs on your head and age you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fool me once...","review":"It's not the subject matter...what little of it there is. It's the outrageous gall of a respected author and his publisher to cash in on reputation. And the starry-eyed critics and devoted fans who accept drek as literature provided the right name is on the cover.Other reviewers have amply quoted or parodied the backbone of this story...dreary banal dialogue between a laconic father and his little boy. We get the doting paternal devotion by page 10. We get the cultural collapse and destruction of civilization by page 20. We get the deadly numbing relentlessness of surviving in post-apocalypse America by page 25. And that's all there is, aside from a couple unneeded and not very subtly planted land mines of human perversion. I doubt I'll ever read another work by McCarthy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long, Depressing, Boring","review":"It seems like each new chapter brings a more grim reality to the father and son wanderers.-- We have seen the future and it is not worth living for. --I also found the writing style a distraction from the purpose of the book. Given the grim subject matter, one might think I would welcome a distraction, but no. I found the lack of apostrophes an only grimmer distraction from the already grim story line.-- We have seen the future and not only is it not worth living for it doesnt use correct punctuation either. --"},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BELIEVE THE HYPE","review":"I rushed to read this book after seeing so many positive reviews, but just do not see what the hype is all about. It is monotonous, tedious, and hasty. I kept reading hoping something would actually happen, but nothing ever does. I must be missing something."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Great idea for story - badly written. Consists of short paragraphs of repetitious, simple and boring dialogue between the father and son. The two characters have no 'personality' other than trying to survive. In the end, the father dies, leaving the son to be immediately rescued by others who surprisingly appear to be friendly, after a journey where they are encountering others intent on stealing and killing/eating them.

My rating (admittedly without having read it), is actually a zero for originality."},{"rating":"2","title":"A view from England","review":"I'm not a Cormac McCarthy mindreader so all of the following may be rubbish, but here's my take on this book:- The whole book is entirely a metaphor. There's nothing literal or factual in it at all. We can't determine whether it's the aftermath of a nuclear or environmental catastrophe because the question is simply immaterial because the literal landscape and the literal journey don't exist. It's a story the author wants you to take as a parable. The landscape is dismal because the landscape and tribulations that can beset your own soul can be dismal. The man is you, and the boy is the fire within you that you have to hold, nurture, and, eventually pass on without any agreement from you. In stoking this fire you are stoking the fire that God himself put in you. It is his unconditional caring for the boy, in his caring for the fire, which makes the father human, and seperates him, and by implication, you, from the beasts whether the beasts have four legs or two."},{"rating":"2","title":"Immersion in Devastation and Devotion","review":"The Road is so powerfully written that you are instantly immersed in a world of total devastation. Nothing familiar and comforting remains . . . except the love between parent and child, growing more intense with each page.Forced to confront the reality of nuclear ruin, you are also forced to ask yourself, \\"Is this the world I want for my own children, my own beloveds?\\"And if you can answer yes after finishing this book, then you may already live on a very different planet.An emotional tour de force, a satisfying but terrifying read. You won't be able to put it down!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gorgeous prose for a dreary journey","review":"This is one of the saddest books I have ever read, yet I could not put it down. McCarthy's language is gorgeously poetic:\\"He pushed away the plastic tarpaulin and raised himself in the stinking robes and blankest and looked toward the east for any light but there was none. In the dream from which he'd wakened he had wandered in a cave where the child led him by the hand. Their light playing over the wet flowstone walls...\\"The book is written in very short sections, which feel like steps along the road, helping you to measure out your endurance as you travel with the man and boy in their grey world.It is a measure of McCarthy's achievement that this seemingly dreary journey is in fact not boring at all. You will leave the book with an indelible image of what it is like to live in a world that has been destroyed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two stars only for the writing.","review":"The story is thin and hard to believe. The bleakness doesn't bother me so much as the lack of any substantiating information, such as how two people could survive at all in such a damaged landscape. It seemed a thin premise on which to hang a story of a father and son in hopeless circumstances. If you can suspend disbelief, it's readable enough, although I don't see much point to it. As character study, it's not in-depth enough. As story, it lacks plot. And as science fiction, it lacks any ideas or philosophy to make it worth reading. It's like an overly drawn-out short story. Vividly done, but pointless."},{"rating":"1","title":"You've got to be kidding!","review":"The Road is nothing more than \\"Waiting for Godot\\" and \\"Robinson Crusoe\\" meets Moses or John the Baptist, depending on how you view the protagonist. The writing was trite, redundant (how many times did the reader really need a detailed description of rain on plastic?), and pedantic.There are thousands of great books out there -- this is a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated and has no story","review":"Personally I don't understand the rave reviews this book is getting. Yes, the world it creates is interesting, but the total lack of story drove me crazy. Basically, \\"the man\\" and \\"the boy\\" walk, look for food, and hide. Repeat over and over and over. There's no character growth, no real plot or suspense, and nothing about these characters to particulary like. We're given almost no history of either what happened to the world or of the main characters. A very dull read if you ask me. If you're looking for something beyond just a mood piece (that mood being depression), I'd advise looking for something else to read. Try the reviewer above, Dennis Lehane. Now HE is brilliant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"If an unknown writer had submitted this no one would have printed it. An unimaginative nightmare. Only read it because some students have to read it for class, and I wanted to be able to talk with them about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"This book has many accolades on the front and back cover. Hmm, guess I missed something in this book. I found it very boring. I kept thinking something would change, something new would happen. No such luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is empty and boring as the Road it travels on","review":"This is a literary version of actual garbage showcased in Museum of Modern Art. You are *suppose* to like it, well, because its ART! Here you are suppose to like it because it's Cormac McCarthy and all the critics went Gaga over it. You are suppose to feel terrible because McCarthy uses the boy as a begger uses his dog to get extra sympathy. OMG, they are resorting to cannibalism! Oh please...This is a cheap imitation of Jose Saramago's Blindless, which was nearly as bad. (What is it with readers desperate to want to feel terrible?).At best it's a bad sci-fi movie that's been done hundreds of times before."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Average Read","review":"Yes, it was fully of stark, horrifying imagery. Yes, it was about love, and being a parent, and trying to protect innocence where it's nearly impossible to do so. But, I found it a boring read, predictable, and only completed it out of an obligation to myself to do so. I did not like the style of prose, and found it very cold. The story stayed with me for a few day, but so do other books, songs, and movies.Very average."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely disturbing!","review":"I found this book to be the most disturbing book that I have read in years. I read the book in one afternoon. I honestly wish that I had not read the book, because it has given me nightmares. The bad people were vile, and I can not begin to express how disturbing I found the scene with the baby being cooked over the fire to be.I continued to read the book figuring that there had to be something at the end to make all of the suffering worth it, and I was stunned at the end. The ending did not redeem this book for me, in fact it had quite a different effect, I threw it into the trash.I know that my review may sound harsh, but as a avid book reader, this book touched me in a way that I wish I had never been touched."},{"rating":"1","title":"The LONG BORING Road","review":"Boring, boring, boring, boring, boring, booorrrring!!!!!! I wish I could gain back the hours of my life that I wasted reading this awful book. Don't believe all the hype. It seems too many people are getting paid off to write good reviews these days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is there something I'm missing???","review":"There are very few books that I skim read and do not instead consider every word and its place in the sentence, but this was one of them. To be fair, I appreciated the dialogue. It seemed exactly the type of dialogue that a worn out man remaining the right side of sanity only by sheer will power, may have with a child. That was all I appreciated. My main problem with this book is the lack of explanation for the ash that the entire story is set in!!! Something happened to turn all crop, forest and animal life to ash but yet the wooden houses by the sides of the road remain. How that made it past the editor I do not know. Maybe the movie added an explanation to that one? This was a complete and utter waste of my time. I am reticent ever to buy something else that Oprah has endorsed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Apocalypse porn","review":"This book is horror / apocalypse porn, plain and simple. This book has you in for: cannibalism, bleakness, roasting babies over a spit (yes, really, YES, REALLY), starvation, people being kept alive in a basement so their limbs can be harvested for meat, recently raped pregnant women being marched along like cattle, and a man and his child struggling down the highway under constant ash / snowfall.If I wanted to watch a Saw: The Whole World is Terrible, I would have. I wanted to read something interesting. Despite the glowing reviews (Did you know that THE FIRE INSIDE US is actually JESUS?! NO ONE HAS EVER DONE THAT BEFORE!) this is horror porn. Is systematically destroys all possible hope for humanity, shows every possible horrifying thing, and then says BUT THIS IS A STORY OF HOPE. It's not. It's repulsive and, more importantly, has no point. Read this only if you like pointless horror."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gives new meaning to the word bleak...","review":"I received this book on fathers day and looked forward to reading it after seeing Oprah's interview with the author. I expected tragic, I expected dark...what I didn't expect was lifeless dialogue, painful repetition, and the annoying grammatical style. This is B action flick material."},{"rating":"2","title":"Effective horror story","review":"I can't remember the last time I read a work of fiction that was difficult to put down. \\"The Road\\" was difficult to put down because I cared about the characters and wanted to know what would happen to the nameless boy and his father. How will they survive? Where will they find food, water and shelter? Will anyone hurt them or steal their cart of possessions? Will they make it to the Gulf? Will they help other people on the same road, or will their ability to show compassion and charity be extinguished? This book was definitely a tear-jerker for me. The only criticism I have is the cannibalism episodes seemed a bit over-the-top. Maybe I am just an optimist?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Really?","review":"I guess I'm somewhat of a pleb, but it's been a while since I've read a book as convoluted and confusing as \\"The Road\\". Let me start by saying the premise is interesting, which is why I read it in the first place. However, the sentence structure is strange (which is OK in some books, doesn't work for me here), the characters are unsympathetic, and half the time I'm fighting to understand where the protagonists are, who they're talking to, and what they're trying to do. I really must be missing something, as my mind was literally blown when I saw the high ratings that this got. So I'm left here, wondering what on Earth I missed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"Thankfully, I only paid a quarter for this excuse for entertainment. If someone had not asked me if I'd read it, I would probably never have even picked the book up to read the blurb on the back. I forced myself to finish it to see if anything happened besides the same overwrought, depressing, mind-boggling going-nowhere non-sequence of events that this book contains."},{"rating":"1","title":"save your money","review":"One of the most depressing books I've ever read.Also one of the most time consuming as I had to stop and look up a word in the dictionary about every third page.This work has no socially redeeming value to it at all except that the author wanted to prove he was smarter than the rest of us.Boring and stupid plot,The \\"Father\\" was an idiot, the son even worse.I find it hard to believe the two of them lived as long as they did after the disaster."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what it's cracked up to be","review":"Evidently Oprah is on a kick to recommend modern re-hashes of old themes. This is the second book this month off her list that I have read (the other being Edgar Sawtelle) and I will most likely steer clear of her picks in the future. This book is another tired regurgitation of the old theme that has been much better stated elsewhere and with more eloquence, of making an existential leap of faith toward meaning in a hostile world where even the word \\"meaning\\" becomes meaningless. Completely driven by dialogue reiterated time after time after time, the story fails to pull off its apparently metaphorical revelations and just dumps the whole tangled mess into a heap at the end. To me it was neither morally enlightening, thought provoking, nor revelational but was just plain boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"A difficult start, but worth it","review":"It's a difficult road to get moving on McCarthy's style. I personally struggle to understand why his sometimes uses the apostrophe in contractions and doesn't at other times. At first, I couldn't figure out why he doesn't use punctuation around dialog. I really didn't get the excessive use of fragments in his description.But then his prose start flowing like poetry. The emotion, as raw as it is, gets its claws into the reader. The story is moving and in the end I found myself really enjoying McCarthy's tale of a father raising his son in imposable conditions. Buy the end, I understood why The Road won the Pulitzer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully written but depressing story","review":"This is the story of a young man and his son walking across the country after the planet has been destroyed by an undisclosed apocolypse. Very well written. As a father of 3 boys I felt upset through a lot of the story. I am sure I over identified with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"McCarthy's best? It's very good but...","review":"I don't think I could improve on T. Braddy's review. I love McCarthy, and this book is powerful and important, but let's not get carried away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Empty Road","review":"I'm just a reader who wants to enjoy a good book. This novel doesn't fit the bill. After reading endless repetitive comments between father and son who are in repetitive situations, I was bored to death. Couldn't connect. Didn't engage. Waited for it to be over....I actually ending up skimming it just to get through it. Depressing novel with an incredibly slight glimmer of hope."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing","review":"So much focus on the dreary weather - over and over and over again. Everything is gray, everything is damp, its gray, its damp...It's not the easiest to read, especially during the conversational areas."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what i expected","review":"I had high expectations but in the end I was disappointed. Without giving it away for those who do buy the book, I felt it centered around the fall of society with little hope for even those who prepare for coming days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Four/Five stars? I think you read a different book...","review":"If you want the same level of philosophical sophistication, but without the terrible monologue/dialogue, and sentimentality, watch the Mad Max movies, particularly the first two. At least they have awesome car chases, and Young Mel Gibson for the ladies.I think my favorite terrible line is where the man watches a snowflake melt on his hand, paraphrasing: \\"like the last bastion of christendom..\\" /vomit"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simplicity","review":"At first I wasn't sure about this and I still wasn't sure after I finished it; but the more I think about it the more I comprehend. In my opinion it is about the simple pleasures of life that can bring us joy, like a cup of coffee, our children or even our freedoms and safety. I have no desire to watch the movie as I'm sure it will be as sad or worse than the book, I cried at the end, but it really makes you think about what is important to you. Is it the new TV or is it sitting down with your family for supper and crawling into a warm bed at night. It solidified in my mind that relationships and basic necessities are all we need to be happy."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Road to Nowhere","review":"The first thing that struck me was McCarthy's gift for language. There was a poetry in his phrasing (a la Ursela LaGuin). It drew me right in. Unfortunaatly, that was where my pleasure as reader ended. The story is endlessly redundant -- like the author wanted to be sure the reader really got the point. The story line is predictable, and there is little, if any, character development.A novel should contain either strong character development or an engrossing story line (hopefully, both). This novel contained neither.It appears the author took a viable short story idea and attempted to flesh it out to a novel. Sadly, it didn't work. Unless you're a fan of beautiful languiag to the almost complete exclusion of good story and character values, I strongly recommend you pass up \\"The Road\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"It couldn't be worse","review":"My first and (most likely) last book by Cormac McCarthy. The plot is simple, uneventful, repetitive, depressing and the end utterly laughable. Sorry, I can't find anything positive to say about this book, which is a pretty extraordinary fact!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why I won't be reading this book","review":"Why am I going to take a pass on this book? Because I have an eight year old son. Maybe it is a failing of mine, but I can't read about kids in peril (real or fictional) without mentally transposing my own child into that peril. Having read \\"No Country for Old Men\\" I can pretty well imagine the depressing nature of this book and quite frankly, I don't need to walk down that road. People with children have to continuously try to keep themselves positive and hopeful for the future. I almost feel bad for this writer (despite his fame and fortune) for having such a bleak outlook on things. Unless he writes to exorcise himself of that outlook, in which case he should pay us for the therapy. Either way, trying to raise a family, got no time to spend in the wallow. I realize the shallowness of rating a book I have not read. But thanks for the warning from those who have read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drudgery and depression","review":"This is the worst book I have read. Slow, repetitive, monotonous dialogue of a man and his pesty son trudging through ash, darkness, snow, cold weather and starving. The boy's main line is \\"papa I am scared,\\" \\"Papa I am hungry.\\" Save you money and time."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS BOOK IS REALLY BAD","review":"i am reading this book for school. Oprha has bad taste in books becasue this book is really bad! its not even a story! to me it is a bunch of words on paper and you call it a story? WHAT? the people in the book dont have names it is really hard to follow everything and most of the time i dont know what is going on, HEY CORMAC GIVE THE PEOPLE IN THE STORY NAMES!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I could unread this book","review":"I suppose I should know better than to pick up a book just because it says that it won a pulitzer. Who decides who wins that prize? What were they thinking? I began and finished reading \\"The Road\\" yesterday evening. So, first of all, it uses some large type font and doesn't have a lot of content. Even considering the lack of content, I felt that toward the end even the author was getting worn down by the bleak picture he was painting. One page in particular read something like, \\"They woke up, they were hungry, the man coughed, they kept walking\\". OK, so I'm paraphrasing in a simplistic way - but it's not far from the actual content. I do not understand what people see in this book that makes it receive such rave reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sick","review":"I read half of this novel and put it down. So disturbing, so sick. The author needs therapy and really shouldn't have taken it out on me. I'm stuck now with the images in my head that no one should have. I don't think I'll read anything marked \\"Oprah\\" again. If she really read this and STILL recommends it, I don't think I'll be watching her show anymore either. Someone that twisted shouldn't be giving life advice to anyone. By the way, I skipped to the last page. It doesn't improve, so if you've looking for hope or a happy ending, forget it."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BOTHER!","review":"The absolute worst book I've ever read. I finished it in hopes that it would improve, which it did not! This is the first book I've ever thrown in the trash!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Road","review":"This book was terrible. Depressing and not that well written. I have never done this before but I actually threw this book away rather than giving it to someone or the local library! If this book has and good points I missed them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful","review":"I should write to Cormac Mccarthy and demand my money back. I bought this book based on the glowing reviews I read here. After finishing I was speechless. This book had the dialogue of two dogs barking. Seriously, how in the name of good fiction can anyone call this \\"brilliant\\"? The story drags and drags and ends up nowhere. I could have started this book on page 200 and still have gotten as much of the story. I feel cheated and fooled to have spent time I will never have back on this seemingly endless novel. Please don't be fooled. Skip this one and save your self!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hope Springs...Artificial","review":"I thought this book was frustratingly vague. It didn't seem so much a way to force the reader to use his/her imagination as it did more a limited effort on the part of the author to tell a complete, coherent story. The endless descriptions were torpid. Worst of all, most scenes ended in a total cop-out. So, whatever they desperately needed, they just seemed to find, like the cache of food when they were starving. Huh? I guess it was just easier to finish the book that way. And the ending? This wonderful family just happened to be right there when the kid needed them? With the exception of a couple of scenes (the people in the basement or the fate of the mother, for example), it just wasn't very good. If that was truly the real world, the kid would have ended up as a catamite or someone's dinner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Desolation and endurance","review":"What survives after desolation? What drives the human soul to endure? How do we come to think about ourselves and about the world when we must accept the apocalypse? Cormac McCarthy, with his insight into the human psyche and his seemingly inexhaustible ability to convey it in stark (and sometimes invented) language, leads us through the unfolding drama while placing us into the mind of the lead character. To call this novel grim is a tremendous understatement, but also misses the point. What drives these characters is the same thing that has driven our species to survive many other massively challenging sets of circumstances over our evolutionary history. That drive, while not uniquely human, is essential to understanding how we got here."},{"rating":"2","title":"You won't be able to stop thinking about it!","review":"Cormac McCarthy's The Road is one of those books that totally engrosses the reader and stays with you long after you put the book down. It is not a light read yet the masterful weaving of the story and events leads the reader down the path with the lead characters at a fast clip. With each the turn of the page, Cormac introduces another layer of moral dilema that makes each page a virtual masterpiece of self reflection. The book has such a realistic tone and feel that once you turn the last page you won't soon forget the characters or events. As I read the book my thoughts alternated between religious comparaisons and modern day survivalist theory - a fascintating and masterfully written book that will provoke the reader to ask \\"what would I do\\" and many other questions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Writer...Unreadable Story","review":"The aftermath of some apocalyptic happening is detailed in excruciatingly horrific detail while a father and son journey to a better world. I cannot blame the writing on this books boring nature; Mr. Mccarthy can obviously write very well. But the storyline, which is not original, does not really provide an interesting read. You just sort of wallow in the disaster that the world has become and wonder what will become of the father and son. Unfortunately, there is no explanation of what happened, or why. There is little explaination of where the father and son are going...and a poor explaination of why they left where they were. So, there you have it, I hate to give the story away; but that's it. I assume that the rave reviews are more about the style of describing the imagery of a destroyed world and the hope of a father. Sorry, it didnt do it for me; Putting more of story around the imagery would have made this book worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too slow for me...","review":"After reading the rave reviews this book received, I picked it up with high expectations. I was extremely let down. The repetitiveness of the story completely put me off. I kept waiting for something more to happen. I guess I was looking for a little more action in a book about post-apocalyptic earth. The prose was eloquent throughout, but at times McCarthy was long-winded in his delivery. The ending was apparent by the end of the first few chapters. My recommendation is to buy it used. Don't make the same mistake I did and pay full price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Emperor's New Cloths ?","review":"Maybe I've just read too many post-apocalyptic stories since my sci-fi immersion growing up in the 50s and 60's but I just can't see what other people find fascinating in this novel. I found it grindingly boring, unimaginative, repetitive, and ultimately derivative. I normally enjoy reading award winning novels (Booker, Pulitzer, Pen-Faulkner, etc.) so it's not as if my tastes run to graphic novels and comic books. This book should be re-titled 'The Load'."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Road... to nowhere","review":"This book is hands down the worst book I've ever read in my entire life. Boring, poor writing style, choppy sentences, poor descriptions of time and place. Do not buy the hype on the book. There is no point to any of it. It is a page turner mostly because you keep turning the page hoping something actually happens. I can sum it up like this: Man and boy walk on road avoiding a handful of \\"bad guys\\" (any confrontations in this book are lame) while running out of food and water and then just when you think all hope is lost they find some food and water. Then, they start walking again to some unknown destination while running out of food and water. There isn't even a logical ending to this. Waste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"strangely boring","review":"really a dull read. kept waiting for something to happen interesting but same old stuff, boring and seemingly pointless story"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a masterpiece...not much of anything","review":"If you're reading this, you know the premise of the book and that many reviewers have given it high marks. I fell for the hype but I hope you won't. 'The Road' is like one of those abstract paintings that some people see as incredibly brilliant while the rest of us think it looks like a five-year-old got loose with mom's oil paints. Who doesn't get it - me or them? Who knows, but I'm pretty openminded in trying to appreciate good writing and my advice is not to waste your time or money on this book. If an unknown writer submitted work like this, publishing house editors would be laughing about it over lunch."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"why is this getting such good reviews is beyond me. nothing happens. i was expecting something but it fell short. they walk. theyre freezing. they go from one abandoned home to another looking for food and supplies. they push what they own in a shopping cart. thats the story. no action. disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Infuriating pricing by Amazon","review":"I'm cheating here, 'cause I didn't buy this.

They are much more entertaining than the book itself. In particular, Russell T. Stodghill's review is a masterpiece of satire. All of the irritating aspects of The Road have been well covered by other reviewers, so I won't repeat them here.The one positive thing I will say is that the book kept me sufficiently interested to read it to the end in the hope that *something* would finally happen. But it never did. So I'm more annoyed having finished the book than I was while reading the book.Okay?Okay."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overly dramatic use of descriptive words makes for a hard read","review":"I read this book some while back, prior to the release of the movie. I must say that I really wanted to like this author, but ultimately I cannot. Don't get me wrong, I do like the story. My issue is with an overuse of what I'll term \\"over the top\\" descriptive words which makes it hard to follow. I found myself having to read certain paragraphs over and over again before grasping what was being said. Sorry, not for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"ashes, ashes all fall down","review":"This is a classic of apocalyptic fiction. I have a 3 1/2 year old son. I cried after I read this book. Few books have ever affected me like that. It is hard not to get emotional even thinking about it. I read it about 2 weeks ago. I cannot fathom living through a \\"nuclear winter.\\" I would do what I have to in order to protect my family. This is dark fiction and some people think its very unusual for Oprah to acknowledge it. I am a fan of apocalyptic fiction and, unfortunately I do not have a very optimistic view of the ability of this society to continue to sustain itself. Everyone should read this."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than the best of 2006","review":"To those who think this book is a re-hash, well, there is, truly, nothing new under the sun. What literature is not a re-telling of earlier stories? As readers, we like what we like. I haven't read anything else of McCarthy's, but The Road is a fine allegory. I'd recommend it to anyone who likes having the familiar made strange and the strange made familiar. It raises issues that need to be considered: if there is no god, what is our motivation for being good?; if there is a god, why does he permit such suffering?; what would I do in such a setting?; am I a good person just because I can be good without jeopardizing my life or the life of someone dear to me?

From beginning to end this book has no plot, no action and you never find out anything that happens. I guess that the lack of a plot makes this book a character piece. You are looking at the lives of a couple of people after the end of civilization. I found that I could not be less interested in the characters in this story though. They were flat, uninteresting, and really at the end of the book I really was just hoping they would die."},{"rating":"2","title":"my thoughts still tender","review":"Well, just finished and to tell the truth most books have a \\"percolation period\\" with me; that is, will I still be thinking about the book; days, weeks; years later?

Dad an boy continue on road. Creepy people all around. Some would like to eat the dad and boy. Others just want to steal their cart.

I enjoyed Cormac's previous novels, including \\"Blood Meridian\\", \\"All the Pretty Horses\\" and \\"The Crossing\\", which is my favorite, but I was bored out of my mind with this novel. The unimaginative apocalyptic world or the dynamic between the father and the son weren't enough to sustain my interest. What kind of conversation did the father and son have? Example:Son: I'm cold.Father: I know.That's about it. It's just an exercise in metaphors, and a pretty obvious one at that. A real disappointment because it just pales in comparison with his other novels, which are so textured and layered, they're amazing. If you've never read any of McCarthy's previous novels, you might find it good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not my cup of tea","review":"As an unpublished writer, I hesitate to criticize my peers who have been published, however, I must say that I was extremely disappointed with Mr. McCarthy's story. I thought the way he structured the novel was interesting in terms of there being no punctuation to distinguish dialouge (I took it as metaphor for the post-apocolyptic world he describes, formless in nature). Perhaps my most pressing issue with the novel is it's aloof and impersonal nature. I found myself being told that the two character in the novel loved eachother, rather than experiencing it through their interactions. I know this novel has received critical acclaim, so perhaps, like I said in the title of this review...it's just not my cup of tea."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dark Book with Not Much of a Plot","review":"This book is pretty much about a man and his young son roaming through the aftermath of some apocalype -- not sure what it was beyond some flash of light. There were some things that happened along the way, but not much.If you are into adventurous types of books, this McCarthy work will probably leave you unsatisfied. If you are into sentimental books, then you'll like it a lot. By the number of stars I give it, you all surely know what type of books I read."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really wanted to give it more stars","review":"The book is touching, in terms of the love between father and son and the termoil they endure; however I cannot seem to get past the fact that everyone was over the moon with the story and it fell flat for me. I actually felt as though something was wrong with me that I wanted more and it did not deliver. Perhaps it is not my kind of read."},{"rating":"1","title":"He's a brilliant writer, but...","review":"I wish I loved this as everyone else seemed to. And line by line, it's pretty much impossible to deny that McCarthy is one of the greatest living writers. That said...how familiar was this conceit? How thin was its execution? How many descriptions of the grey, grey landscape do we need? We get it! Things are reallllllly bleak.He seems (to me, at least) to be ripping off his own themes from earlier works. That people are very, very bad is driven home for about 95% of the book. And then: surprise! A vaguely happy ending. Maybe there IS hope. Maybe SOME people aren't that terrible. But nah, most of them really are. I know, Cormac. I read your other stuff too. Get a new angle, would ya?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Haunting","review":"Beautifully written, stunning portrayal of a post-apocalyptic world. This book will stay with you forever. It is about the most basic elements of what it is to be human and to survive when death is more appealling than life. It is also a story about love and \\"goodness.\\" After learning about super-volcanoes on PBS a few months ago, especially the one under Yellowstone, I hope this novel is not a glimpse into our future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is everyone kidding?","review":"I have read Blood Meridian and No Country For Old Men, and enjoyed them both. But The Road? I wondered about halfway through if someone had a played a joke on me. Like maybe McCarthy said, you know what, screw it. I've been writing books for years with very little recognition, so I'm going to throw out this piece of [...] and see if I can fool them. And he did. Nothing happens, but it happens over and over. It was snowing. It was dark. They built a fire. They ate a tin of peaches. It began to snow again. It reminds me of when Faulkner finally wrote a crappy novel and won a Pulitzer for it. The world never ceases to amaze me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nihilistic poetry","review":"For my money, McCarthy is one of the finest writers working today. His prose is black magic -- look up from one of his novels and chances are your world will feel like the fictional one.It's perhaps unsurprising that a writer whose tone is often described as \\"apocalyptic\\" finally got around to writing a novel about the end of the world. The story follows a father and son as they trek through the scorched ruins of America, walking ever southward in hopes of finding warmer weather and some measure of safety near the coast. It's a bleak and brilliant journey that is near impossible to put down."},{"rating":"2","title":"haunting, compelling","review":"This book, written in short, descriptive sentences, takes us forward into what the future could possibly be for us, our children. the dark,ashy road that we follow with them makes us feel the fear, the hunger, the fight or flee urges that this father/son duo had as they scavenged for food and shelter in a postapocalyptic world. slowly, the reader begins to feel for them, identify with them. the style of writing reinforces the storyline, no excess words or phrases. i found it haunting and compelling--wow. not a long read, but definitely worth reading!"},{"rating":"1","title":"....already taken","review":"McCarthy's limpest novel; worse, even, than All the Pretty Horses. I'd actually be relieved if it came out that some bizarre series of events led McCarthy to hire Orson Scott Card to ghost-write a story line he stole from Stephen King...A cautionary note to readers who attribute to The Road any sort of literary weight or force, and I realize there are many, reading anything before and, especially, including Blood Meridian, is to risk years of PTSD therapy..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull and simple","review":"Interesting story of a not unknown concept. post apolyptic wanderers However the story is dull and repetative. The theme changes little and , and any dialog between characters is fairly close to stupid and repeatative.

With out this trick the book could have been less than 100 pages. NOT WORTH THE MONEY OR TIME."},{"rating":"1","title":"The World Is Depressing Enough....","review":"This is the most depressing book I have ever tried to read. I say it in this way because I did not have the stomach or motivation to finish this book. McCarthy's writing style is elegant and his passion for father and son stories is admirable. However, the story line for this book was just horrific and bleak. I felt like I was in a cold, gray fog the whole time I was reading it and I did not like the utter hopelessness I felt. After I realized I was not going to be able to finish the book, I skipped to the last few chapters and felt even more validated in deciding not to read the rest of it. Maybe it's because I do believe that God provided all of us with His plan of redemption and hope. This book exhibited none of that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horror","review":"This book is a horror story. If you want to read about people turning into canibals with all the graphic details, then this book is for you. This book is much more violent and depraved than anything you are likely to see on TV. I just don't care for this sort of depravity and violence. Its too despressing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vicious comments for objecting to the book","review":"Dark and depressing, but also suspenseful at times. Some of the dialogues were repetitive and the ending was disappointing. In any case I am wondering what the criteria for a Pulitzer price book is - regardless of it's category.When I finish a book I always like to go back to the different reviews at Amazon to see how other readers felt. To my big surprise I found some comments, that people were called names and put down after voicing their opinion that they disliked the book. One really must wonder what it takes to get into a \\"war\\", if people get that hostile over different beliefs regarding a book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read!","review":"The Road by Cormac McCarthy is about a boy and his father struggling to survive in a post apocalyptic world. The characters and the situations are very believable and well crafted. I am a very picky reader and most of the other books in Oprah's Book Club, or most Best Sellers, for that matter, I have not cared for but this book is an absolute must read. The style is quite different but not distracting in anyway, the flow is smooth, the prose easy to read and paint scenes so beautifully you will be completely drawn in. The only reason I did not give this book 5 stars is because I would have liked a bit more background information but perhaps that would not have fit in to the style of the story...I'm used to reading books much larger so background and sub plots are easy to fit in. All in all this book is excellent and will leave an impression on you that will last for a quite while. I highly recommended it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast but deep","review":"This book went as fast as a light summer read, but the subject was anything but. It was very dark or more accurately grey. McCarthy pulls you into his bleak futurescape and purposefully telegraphs his ending as much as any author that I've read. Yet the impact of what you know is coming isn't deadened at all. Don't let the Oprah seal fool you or dissuade from reading this book. This is not the first time she has picked an edgy and dark novel. Read on.(Note on my 4 stars: I almost gave it 5, but I am a huge reader and this didn't quite make it into my top 5 books.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Must Read.","review":"This book is so dark, sad, and brilliantly written.

He adapts Hemmingway's spare writing, mucks it up with 50 cent words, then applies it to a book with no plot, no motivation, no character. Also, he uses a lot of British-style grammar, even though he is not a Brit. He divorced a Brit a while back but that's as close as he got.It works okay as a mood piece, and might have been a decent short story.

A man and a boy walk south. They have a plastic tarp, a grocery store pushcart with a mirror attached to see behind them, and knapsacks on their backs. The man has a revolver. Along the way they speak in grammatically simple, short, childish sentences like characters in an old Dick and Jane learning-to-read book. There are no quotation marks. Do you see that? Yes, I see that. What is it? I don't know. Of course you don't. Are we going to die? Of course we are. Oh, I am afraid. The narrator drops his verbs. The wind cold. The hunger and thirst and cold. Everything ashes and dried and burnt. Memories of her. Fear inside them. The poetry of apocalypse around them. He breaks sentences in two. They sat down. Sipping water. Such poetry.

The characters are one-dimensional with no personality. I loved the premise thats why I attempted the book, however it was a huge disappointment. They journey to the coast because I don't know?, avoiding certain people because I dont know, cannibals? right? No background to the story and no future either. Just the road. So if you want to travel down the road with a no name man and boy, hope you like poor grammar and sentence structure as well as big holes in the story that will leave you annoyed or even pissed off that you attempted what should have been a good story of a father's love for his son. It left me cold."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Road that goes no where","review":"Cormac McCarthy's \\"The Road\\" is an extremely slow read. I found it to have long stretches of boring repetitiveness followed by a short burst of some excitement. The story is like a bad song with a repeating chorus and the only excitement comes in the bridges of the lyrics. \\"The man and the boy walk, get hungry, get cold, build a fire, sleep, REPEAT x2, find some food, eat it, see some people, survive it, REPEAT chorus again.\\" It was certainly not one of my favorite books but I did enjoy the strong relationship between the man and boy.

This is easily the best book with virtually no plot that I have ever read.And then the boy is saved at the end and there's some vague Judeo-Christian pseudo-spiritual/philosophical crap that is supposed to pass for seeds-of-hope and a book ending.

I suspect that I will never be able to enjoy a book in which none of the main characters has a first name. The Road was more palpable to me, but not by much.

What it lacked was any substance what-so-ever to warrant anything beyond a short story. Actually, it is a great short story, told over and over again about 20 times. And don't hold out for a powerful ending which will make the read worthwhile. You could rip all the pages out of this book, randomly order them, and read it again and it would be no different than the original. Every day is the same, told over and over again.

I heard the hype and read most of the books the critics rave about. This was one where they are dead wrong.The story, and writing, is simple, a post-apocolypse United States. We have no idea why the world is at this point, nor will you ever know. It is irrelavant to this story. It is merely a boy and a father trying to walk to a more suitable climate. As for the dialouge, while it often draws nice moral lessons, it is reduntant and after a while the give and take between father-son becomes painfully boring. Son asks questions, dad has some of the answers. Yippy!!The end is as lame as you get. I could not believe it when it was over.

I am always in love with McCarthy's visions, albeit often bleak ones, and his bare-bones yet incredibly descriptive prose. How can I call a 10-line sentence bare bones?

I have spoken with others about this book and gotten a range of reactions... some can only focus on the bleak overtones and miss the glimmers of hope and color.

A boy and his father are traveling to who knows where on a planet that has been struck by some unspecified catastrophic event. Almost everyone in the story has devolved into savage-like behavior, including the father, although the boy somehow retains his humanity. This book is one depressing lessen in how little we can expect from our human brethren in seriously dire times (though the ending does offer a bit of hope).At first I found McCarthy's 'cut to the bare bones' writing style unique; but after a while, the lack of punctuation became tiring. The author was probably trying to make a point here about the fluff of existence being unnecessary in the midst of genuine catastrophe. Ultimately, instead of finding McCarthy's writing profound, I felt the author was just a bit too full of himself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cormac McCarthy's, 'The Road'","review":"The perfect book for literary sadists. It is a dreary tale of despair that leaves the less sadistic reader to ponder why they have spent time plowing through one man's delusions of squalor and hopelessness. There is no beauty, no moral, no insightful commentary, no reason. It begs me to wonder if it was the only book the Pulitzer committee read in consideration of the prize. Mr. McCarthy's unique lack of grammer, penchant for obscure vocabulary, and diversion from familiar textual organization made the reading experience more interesting in his previous works, but being quirky alone in this work does not make a book worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Falls short","review":"Just finished The Road. Knew that it was featured in Oprah's Book Club, but decided to read it anyway. Have mixed feelings. I wasn't wowed by this book. I didn't know what to expect - but it seems like this would have been better as a short story rather than a novel. The characters don't really develop in a way that compliments the rich descriptions of the world they inhabit. It is a powerful book, but it was missing a \\"heart\\". Even the innocent boy is one dimensional. It seems to me that if one is going to write a book in which a post-apocolyptic cannibal-infested hell on earth is merely a backdrop- there needs to be more depth to the characters.It is really just a vivid description of completely random events - the story doesn't build at all. Maybe it isn't supposed to. Seems like wasted potential."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get It Out Of My Head","review":"Some books don't teach you anything but the arcane depths of despair that human beings can reach. Very much like 'Life in the Time of Cholera', this book was a tour through a macabre mind, a desolate wilderness of the desperate soul.If by some feat of technology or magic, one could take a guided tour through the hell of another's life, any sane person would ask - of all human experience why go here?McCarthy scores for those who are such tourists of despair. But even on technical merit, there is no redemption for this exercise in spiritual torture. Get it out of my head - it's like the mind chewing grubs from the Wrath of Khan."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Most Moving Books I've Ever Read","review":"This is unquestionably one of the most moving books I have ever read. Set in a post-apocalyptic America, this book is neither about the apocalypse (never described) nor its aftermath but rather about the relationship between a young boy and his father as they travel \\"the road\\" together. The relationship between the young boy and his father is described in such a way that their love for each other and the boy's trust in his father are almost palpable to the reader. The dialogue is sparse but moving and powerful. I doubt if in the history of English language literature the simple word \\"Okay\\" has ever taken on such profound significance. Cormac McCarthy deserves the Pulitzer he received for this novel. If you love books, do yourself a favor and read The Road. I'm sure I will revisit this book many times in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"What did I miss?","review":"I know it won the Pulitzer and much critical acclaim but I think it is terrible. I bought this before it won the Pulitzer based simply on my regard for McCarthy's earlier work. I think his Blood Meridian and Border Trilogy are great works but I cannot say the same for \\"The Road\\". I read it twice (thank goodness it is a shorter work) and failed to find any redeeming qualities.In my opinion, \\"The Road\\" failed on many levels: the thematic content was as barren as the landscape the novel depicts, McCarthy's attempt at minimalism was sophomoric, and fictional continuity was appallingly lacking(all animals are dead except man?) Of course, any novel depicting apocalypse will evoke some human emotion just as visiting a slaughterhouse will evoke much emotion - but neither can be rightfully called art simply because they evoke strong emotions. I expect art to also entertain, enlighten, and provoke deeper thought; I did not experience any of these with \\"The Road\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not credible","review":"This book has had so many reviews, so mine will be brief. What kind of natural disaster leaves large mammals as the only survivors? Was it nuclear war? Volcanic eruption? Strike from a random meteor? Fellas, it's the big things that die--the little ones find hidey holes and later evolve to become the next big thing. There's nothing to eat but each other because there is no one left except humans and... dogs? The plants are all dead, and other animals appear to have been evaporated by the same ray beam that zapped most of these reviewers' powers of reasoning. A little more imagination would be welcome & next time give the kid a few more lines than: Papa I'm scared. A kid that age would have quite a bit more to say than that."},{"rating":"1","title":"If You Are Depressed, Don't Read This Book","review":"This book is bleak and depressing. I am not a depressed person, but I felt like jumping off a cliff after reading this book. My husband even hated this book and he has read every post-apocalyptic book there is. There is no hope, no love, and no good character interaction. Just doom and despair. So if you want to feel bad afterwards, by all means read this book. Why Oprah picked this book, I have no idea."},{"rating":"2","title":"we're the good guys, right?","review":"I think \\"The Road\\" is a masterpiece! My new \\"best book ever read\\". I'm sure I'll return to this amazon forum for years to come to read readers reaction to this great work of fiction. For me, it turned out to be an eerie tale of good and evil. One day I'll try to understand better why I started weeping during the last paragraph. I'll just say that the the boy (the son) will always be a storybook hero of mine. Suspenseful, unique, riveting, 6 stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Road is one of my favorite books.","review":"The Road is one of the best books I have ever read. It's haunting and suspenseful. The father and son dynamic makes this book a book that everyone can relate to and the characters memorable. It is dark, sometimes really dark, but keeps this heir of hope lingering. Anytime I am in a conversation with anyone about books, this is the first on one I go to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well written, but not my style","review":"I'm not sure how this book was recommended to me by Amazon based on my previous purchases because it was really not my style. The book was good and I read it quickly though because I was dying to see what would happen. In that regard it was a nice surprise. The book is depressing as can be and really makes you think about our future. Would I recommend it to anyone I know-- no. Was it interesting-- absolultely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Required Reading","review":"Don't try to read this book on the bus, train, or other public place unless you want someone's hand on your shoulder asking if everything is alright. Because its not alright. You have to read this book. Once you start you realize that. I have not read anything like it since the Grapes of Wrath in high school english class. I am sure that in a modern world of games like Call of Duty Modern Warfare, that this book should be required reading in my son's english class. At least I hope so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stark, Beautiful, Terrifying, Hopeful...Brilliant","review":"I've just finished reading Cormac McCarthy's Pulitzer-Prize-winning novel The Road. I found the experience to be profound. Out of the ashes of this sad, sad tale of post-apocalyptic America rises a hymn to survival, to the love between a father and a son, to the gift of a strong human spirit, and to the notion that good does trump evil, even when evil is all around and the lines between good and evil get murky. I admire McCarthy's bravery in furthering his stark, sparsely written tale by eschewing common punctuation, superfluous adjectives, and even in denying the father and the son names. McCarthy hasn't just written beautifully, he's crafted a novel as only a master can. You don't often read brilliance. The Road is filled with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing With No Plot or Story","review":"I almost gave up on this book several times because the road never went anywhere but deeper into depression. This was a terrible book with almost no plot and no good ending. By good ending I mean a twist or revelation or something to make you go \\"Wow, what a great ending!\\". I'm sorry I wasted my time finishing this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did the cannibals eat the punctuation too?","review":"Crossing a burned America, a father and son fight to survive. There is no food, no plants, no animals, and worst of all...no punctuation.I wanted to like this book. It could have been so good! Confusing, slow, and crazy use of adjectives, this book completely failed to draw me in. The only reason I kept turning the pages was in hopes of something more exciting that a canned peaches and the occasional cannibal sighting. What the hell Cormac McCarthy? It could have been great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh","review":"I don't see what all the fuss is about? The poetic language is OK I guess if you like that kind of stuff... but there isn't much of a story or even much character development in this novel. Basically it reminded me of a high school reading assignment I had to force myself to finish reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"The book had its moments but for the most part was slow and boring.

How this book won the Pulitzer is beyond me. There is basically no plot, no beginning, no end just wandering and wandering and more wandering. I thought maybe it would have a wonderful ending and I would learn some great lesson - wrong! Don't waste your time. If you want to read a book about the end of the world then I would recommend \\"Life as We Knew It\\" by Susan Beth Pfeffer. Her book is about relationships, reliance on family, survival, struggles and I actually expanded my horizons by reading it. It is 100 times better and actually has a plot!As I said, I'm so happy that I didn't spend money on this one if you absolutely HAVE to read it then by all means go to the library or borrow it - definitely not a keeper."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Road: Inducer of Suicidal Ideation","review":"The world is destroyed and burning for years. Yet, people are alive and are able to respire as the world is consumed by fire, both require oxygen, impossible without plant life. Too many glaring contradictions such as abundant oxygen and piles of shoes not pilfered, make the entire premise of the book absurd.I will not delve into the repetition, the gimmicky writing style and lack of character development and plot. There are no redeeming qualities in THE ROAD.If you read this book and were not suicidal, you will be when you finish reading THE ROAD. The only positive factor is that clinically depressed individuals will most likely not finish this poorly written repetitious disturbing book and not react by committing suicide. And, I almost I absolutely despise this book and the fact that I spent my time reading to the end in search of a literary masterpiece."},{"rating":"1","title":"concept interesting, but plot fizzles","review":"When you got to a few interesting spots, they quickly fizzled.

However, after reading the reviews I went ahead and got it. I was intrigued by the style of writing and was unable to put it down from the moment it arrived. Some of the descriptions are horrifying, but overall it is a very poignant tale of the love between father and son (and the immense amount of love the son has for everyone else). Not for the faint of heart - definitely worth the read."},{"rating":"2","title":"haunting","review":"THis book was wonderful. It was one of the most haunting stories I have ever read.

They scavenge for food and shelter, and they must constantly avoid marauding bands of fellow survivors who would prey on them. The one thing that sustains them on their way is their ferocious love for each other. THE ROAD is the story of their heartbreaking journey.Every now and then, when we need reminding, a great writer shows us one possible future for our species if we continue on the path to self-destruction. In 1957, Nevil Shute gave us ON THE BEACH, and now, 50 years later, Cormac McCarthy has given us an eloquent new version of the same cautionary tale. We didn't listen then. Perhaps we can learn something now.I have rarely been so moved by a work of literature. To call this the most important novel of 2006 is an understatement. Read it and weep. Read it and be uplifted. Just read it--before it's too late."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly predictable with little meat on the bone...","review":"Although the book is a quick read, I wish I could have the time I spent reading it back... Highly predictable, without any real surprise or insight, and of course numbingly depressing.It went into the trash when I was done, a *very* rare event."},{"rating":"1","title":"NHot impressed with authors ability","review":"As an avid reader of 2-3 books per week I sometimes have difficulty finding new books that would interest me. One of my perennial favorites are books on the future, and that is why I chose to purchase this book.To say I was disappointed would be a great understatement. This is not creative in the writing sense at all. Nothing is easier then to produce a piece that is 100% one thing or another with no nuance, no thought of entering even a clue into the writing of where the author is coming from. All is settled from page one. The worlds is a sewer and it ain't getting any better.This book could have been written as a short story of 15 pages instead of a 250 pp novel that just keeps getting more and more gloomy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Redundant and boring","review":"A man and his child walk and find some food. They walk some more and find more food.I basically just described the whole book.One of the most boring and redundant books I've ever read. There is probably 10 pages of interaction between the main characters and other people. Every time you think something is getting ready to happen the book disappoints you. I have no idea why this book was so highly recommended.It only received two starts because of how well it was written.

This was a waste of my valuable reading time.The dark and depressing storyline which trudged through its wasted landscape was interesting and compelling.UNTIL the ending. Much like mystery stories that introduce a crucial character on the last page, \\"The Road,\\" left me furious. Why not introduce the character on page one - and eliminate the need for the book altogether.Don't bother with this one unless you enjoy a contrived conclusion that negates the struggle of the entire book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too grim and depressing for me.","review":"If you feel that in the end the human spirit distills down to primordial need to keep ourselves and our children alive at all costs, then you will find the \\"The Road\\" redeeming and reaffirming to your world view.

The man and his boy will be with me for a long time to come."},{"rating":"1","title":"mccarthy's worst","review":"The Road is a stunningly terrible novel, McCarthy doing McCarthy badly, which is pretty bad. The novel is a slog through a wasted landscape of post-apocalyptic cliches which McCarthy tries to refresh with his tedious prose. This is where McCarthy's post-Hemingway machismo can only lead--the death of everything that we love, but mostly women and children. I was a fan of Blood Meridian for a while, but now McCarthy's writing, like Hemingway's, only depresses me. Give me Alice Munro, who can write rings around McCarthy."},{"rating":"1","title":"i would like a happy ending","review":"I read it in two days and I couldn't put it down, however i was hoping for the blue sea and white sand with survivors on it , not black ashes and the man dying coughing his blood up.

The prose is bad, the characters are uninteresting, and the story repeats itself over and over with no resolution at the end. The only reason I didn't throw it out the car window was that I was sure it had to get better. It didn't. Depressing start to finish.

The is the worst written, and most uninteresting book that I have read in a very long time. And I do a lot of reading.The author doesn't use proper punctuation or grammar, which makes it difficult to follow at times. For example he never uses quotation marks when people are speaking, and he also doesn't separate dialog by paragraphs. So it difficult at times to know if the person is talking or thinking.It speaks very ill of the \\"Pulitzer prize\\" people that they hand this award out to such a poorly written book.I gave it two stars, because I don't actually hate it. It had promise, but never reached it's potential. I would say it is a horrible book, and I don't recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't get this book out of my head!","review":"This is one of those rare books that I can't get out of my head. I read it months ago & still think about it. It's disturbing, thought provoking, frightening & beautifully written.

I kept waiting and waiting for something interesting to happen, and then it just ended. There is no meat to the characters and I never felt any compassion for them at all.

While I haven't lived in an apocalyptic situation (although plenty of people have come unfortunately close lately: Katrina, the Japan tsunami, the Haiti earthquake, etc), McCarthy's vision is horrifyingly realistic. The world he creates is fully formed and disturbing. At points I almost needed to keep the characters at arm's length because their situation seemed so grim that I didn't want to get too attached.Now, having finished it (and knowing how it ends), I look forward to rereading this and picking up on the nuances that I may have missed in my rush to see how it ended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It is beautiful.","review":"Probably one of the better books I have ever read.

The setting is bleak, hopeless and barren. The writing style left you with no real feelings for either of the characters.

He encouraged me to read it but I just put it off, I had no intention of reading this book. But, this April it is my book club's read so, I felt like I had to read it. Well, I loved it.For me this book came down to the strength of love between father and son. I found the journey they went on rewarding to read and I found hope in the end. It truly is a beautiful, poetic, and moving book. I'm so happy I threw away my misconceptions and read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than just a book","review":"This is more than just a book. It is a deep experience of love and how a father gave all that he had to enable his Son not just survive, but to have a vision of the good within a nearly destroyed ecosystem. Reading this was grim. The struggle to survive was, from the Son's view, reducing his Dad to the amoral level of the people that were trying to kill them. A new Ice age was dawning, no animals save men reduced to cannibalism and slavery walked the Earth. The only food available was scavenged from houses and stores left in burned cities. Yet a Dad continues to teach his Son survival skills and how to see the good in himself and others. The Father, far from perfect, is nevertheless a man in the finest sense of that word.I've never been more deeply touched by a book. If you're a Dad, then there is no better example of how to be one than you'll find here. If you're not then you'll just find a masterpiece of American Literature.(James A. Baker Opelika, Alabama)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Luminous, for all its darkness","review":"The darkness of this post-apocalyptic nightmare would be nearly unbearable were it not for the luminous thread of pure, unselfish love between the man and the child he devotes every waking breath to saving.

I'm so glad I read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a better than average book but","review":"Well I don't want to give away to much for people that have not read this book. The story is good.There were parts of it that detracted from the realism of the story, like: why are there mummified bodies lying around when it is always raining? It's a desert or it's always raining, you can't have both. This concept is acceptable in the spirit of the story but not acceptable in the reality of the story.I liked the father and son storyline.There are books as good or better than this available on kindle at half the price, on more or less of the same topic."},{"rating":"1","title":"the road...the road","review":"Im in with the rest who found this book redundant.

It is one of the most important and revealing novels of our time. Painfully sad, bracingly tough, terribly depressing, McCarthy shows us how swiftly, how abruptly, life can be ruptured, and how precarious the illusion of safety and security really is. A book you will remember for the rest of your life. Without a doubt Cormac McCarthy deserved to win the Pulitzer Prize."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disturbing book","review":"Although exceptionally written, I was left feeling depresssed about something that could conceivably happen in this world.

The author's apparent flouting of the normal rules of grammar in favor of stark, harrowing rhythm works beautifully.

Now I'm not sure I want to see the movie. Will it be a dull and incoherent as the book ? The Pulitzer committee must be desperate and clueless, or both. This certainly undermines my faith in critics. (also \\"No Country for Old Men\\" ) was only fair and it won best picture !!!! Maybe it's me ."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Road","review":"The Road is definitely the most haunting book I have ever read. It left a lasting impression on me. After I finished the book, I could not stop thinking about it. The thought of this happening in our lifetime is a possibility. Would I be able to handle all the things the father does to save his son? It would be a terrible responsibility. Read this book, it is awesome. McCarthy is the consummate story teller."},{"rating":"2","title":"A dark, haunting read","review":"What can I possibly say about this brilliant work of fiction that has not been already said? Yes, it's a dark, haunting read, and there are moments where you think that it would be better for the father and son to go ahead and end their lives before someone does it for them in a more unpleasant manner, but they continue to journey. Therein lies the cornerstone of this novel: hope, even where it isn't present."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dust and ash","review":"Dust and ash, dust and ash. That is about all that is left in the world of \\"THE ROAD\\". It is a bleak and desolate world. There is little left to support life and little reason to want life. In this land, Cormac Mccarthy has written a story of love and devotion between a father and his young son as they travel. I wish I could say that it is a story of survival. It is not. It is a well written story of an all too possible future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did I miss something?","review":"I still can't figure out what's so great about this book.

It pales in comparison to the best of the genre. Perhaps critics liked its absence of explanation of the apocalypse, the absence of explanation for virtually all life being apparently eradicated . . . but its lack of background information made it nothing more than a narrative with little of educational value or interest and, it seemed to me, a shallow work with little to commend itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Fuels the Will to Survive","review":"The world has been burned in an apocalyptic like disaster, and the narrative of this book follows a father and son as they journey toward the ocean in the hope of finding a place of refuge, a place to stay, a place to live. Only the father's love for the son compels him to keep going forward.The father symbolizes those who love for family compels them to wake up every morning and forge an existence in a dark, wasteland world. McCarthy contends that at the end of the day, love and loyalty and family are the things worth living for, even when everything else is gone.The book is unrelenting in its bleak outlook on life, but readers will admire the father's determination to provide and care for his son in this otherwise depressing novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nightmare","review":"Strong imagery, depressing, one long pointless video game. And please, spare me the Eastern slant. Funny though, the author's talent is heavy enough to penetrate and light enough to soar.

Suspens is at its climax all the time but in the end...well nothing. This couple just go from luck to luck, they should probably have played loto.All right, the bonds between a father and his child are very well described but apart from that, I found the book pretty empty. The reflexion the father has on his life, on what happens is not even that deep after all and they just are lucky on their trip, finding food just when they needed it the most. fortunate!Well in a word, the book could have been great and has some sparks of greatness but it is definitely missing a little something."},{"rating":"1","title":"If You Must Try This, Borrow It!","review":"I made it exactly nineteen pages into The Road before kicking it to the curb. Mr. McCarthy's way with imagery and description are such that I am inspired as an author to better my own craft, but well-written vignettes do not a gripping tale make. I am therefore left wondering how this book made it to the NYT best-seller list and many other books I've read this year haven't come close.Let me conclude this review with a public service announcement: Libraries Are Your Friend. Had I been reduced to finding this book at the store, I would have flipped through it and set it quickly aside or else bought it on impulse and been rather angry after the fact. Instead, I was able to borrow it from the local library and sample it. No harm, no foul."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"If you want to be depressed and like to have nightmares of how the world could or would be after another world war go ahead and read this. Sorrythat I didn't get how \\"great\\" this book was."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Getting It","review":"I don't get the hype with this book. It seemed like it was trying too hard to be \\"cool.\\" They never mention the boy or the man's name. Why? Is that some artsy-fartsy attempt to be mysterious? There are many examples like this that make it seems like it's trying to be great. Writing something that is different or \\"outside the box\\" doesn;t make it great. Just write a great story with great dialogue, and you'll have a great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Road by Cormac McCarthy","review":"This is a very dark book, and there were times when I wondered why I was continuing to read it. Just as the father and son continued to plod on down the road, I kept plodding through with them. The love they shared was a definite bright spot in an otherwise depressing and sad look at a very bleak future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy read that touches your heart.","review":"I have to say I didn't start out enjoying the book. Once they hooked me, I couldn't stop reading. I didn't want the book to end. Their journey was incredible, lonely, tough, scarey, but most of all the human capacity to survive under any conditions. It left me feeling grateful for what I have, materially and emotionally. I called my kids later on and reminded them how much I love them."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Father's Love","review":"Post-Apocalyptic fiction is not normally a genre that interests me, but this took hold from the first pages and wouldn't let go. An unnamed man journeys with his young son through a devastated landscape that must once have been the Southeastern United States. Most people have died in some unexplained catastrophe, but there is still danger from sparse groups of survivors living by cannibalism. Through ingenuity, luck, and sheer determination, the man shepherds his boy through the Appalachian Mountains to the coast, in the slim hope of meeting up with others who have not lost their humanity. What lifts and sustains the book is the same as what sustains the central pair: the deep love of the father for his son. It is impossible to see them together without being aware of a heart-stopping beauty -- a beauty that shines even through that ash-shrouded darkness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark but Entertaining","review":"You would think a book about the world after some sort of apocalyptic event would be depressing and hard to read but I didn't find that the case with \\"The Road\\". If you can get past Cormac's unique writing style you are in for a great read.The story is simple. A father and son are walking \\"the road\\" south in search of food, warm weather, and shelter at all times. You see the relationship between the two...the good and the bad.Bottomline: One of the better books I've read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worthy of the Pulitzer","review":"THE ROAD is an awesome book that shows a father's love for his child as I've never seen before. Although in a desperate setting, it still holds great hope. I loved it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, detailed, well written, wordy...","review":"I don't want to bash this book; but talk about over hyped. Spoiler Alert: NOTHING HAPPENS.

No wonder the movie was only out for one day.The book is a great literary work, but the story is blah."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Road","review":"I found this book to be far too long, boring, depressing and quite simply GRAY!

It was depressing and simple but somehow profound at the same time. I never would have picked it up based on its description but Oprah came through again."},{"rating":"1","title":"McCarthy's Best Book Ruined by Awful Narration","review":"This book, so carefully constructed to achieve almost mythic tone, is rendered unlistenable by the hamminess. Reading a book out loud does not require dramatization, and when such drama is pushed too far, as it is here,it diminishes and thwarts the power of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"---> A Bitter Disappointment","review":"I did not have sky high hopes for this book. I've been through that and knew better. My hopes were moderate. Even so, they were dashed. I realize that the minimalist approach the author took was meant to create a haunting atmosphere and it did work, but there was SO MUCH MORE he could have done with the 'story'. I kept waiting for something interesting to happen. Heck, I kept waiting for ANYTHING to happen. Unfortunately, the entire book can be summed up as follows;We have to keep walking.Okay Papa.We should eat.Okay Papa.Okay.And that's what passes for a 'great book' now in our TV, WalMart, McDonald's culture."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Road","review":"So this book seemed to start off a little slow, but at the same time it wasn't . The book is written in what seems to be Cormac McCarthy's own format. After watching No Country for Old Men, I can understand his style and writing structure. As you read, you see the love that this father has for his son and the trust that the son has in his father. The struggle together and they believe together and that was awesome. This is a father who truly loved his son and was willing to whatever he could to keep him safe and healthy. A wonderful story with many emotions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark is right","review":"I'll confirm what I've read elsewhere here that The Road is dark. And it's almost unrelentingly dark. I won't go any further in that descriptive direction lest I get into giving too much of the sense of the story away. It's not an easy read, but it's a memorable one. I haven't read anything else like it. The Road was my first Cormac McCarthy book. So I don't know if his others are in anyway similar. Also, the writing style is unique and took getting used to early on. I gave it four stars, because it is well written, a deep story in terms of the characters's thoughts and their relationships, and I was kept interested in how the story would turn out. I held off giving it five stars, because the story was a bit limited."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lackluster prose","review":"After plodding my way through this novel,I too am in full agreement with those who gave it low marks. The repetitiveness as others have commented on nearly compelled me to abandon the novel at midpoint. At times I would flashback to my Beckett's 'Waiting for Godot' whilst in mid dialog. The difference here is that it worked for Beckett but not for McCarthy. I too agree that his other writings kept me spellbound. Thus the disappointment when I anticipated the same from 'The Road.'"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pew! It stinks","review":"Okay folks, this is a case of an acclaimed writer putting out a real stinker and everyone is willing to overlook it. Cormac became a hot Hollywood commodity with the screenplay adaptation for No Country for Old Men, and producers scrambled to find the next great work of his.The Road is a bleak yet utterly inanimate story of loss, cannabalism, the paternal bonds of man, and the ease in which humanity can slip into chaos. It is never discussed what happened to cause the world to be ruined, nothing more than vague inconclusive references are made. To me, this makes the story two-dimensional, a lack of imagination that deflates the plot. Will things get better? Is the world doomed as supply dwindles?Bottom line, if you are a pseudo-intellectual who likes vapid literature then tuck in and enjoy. If you need a novel to combat your insomnia, then this is perfect for you. However, if you enjoy substantive plots and sharp moving prose, don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total waste of time","review":"When I realized that Cormack McCarthy also wrote No Country For Old Men, I knew I was in trouble since that was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Now I can add that The Road is one of the worst books I have ever read and that I obviously conclued that I need to avoid any title or movie associated with the author.I don't care how the critics rave about him, he is vastly overrated.The book was boring, unpleasant, had a weird ending, and was just kind of sickening.Grim, dark, depressing, nauseating.

For an average book I read about 12 pages in 30 minutes. This novel took me a 2 hour layover in Newark to read the whole thing.

I avidly plugged on looking for answers to questions I had, but they were not forthcoming. For instance, where were they? All we know is that they were heading west to the ocean. What happened to the mother of the child? I got the impression she went off and committed suicide, but again, not clear. One of the paragraphs near the end really puzzled me making it unclear who was the child and who was the father. And of course, I'm assuming it was a nuclear holocaust, but that's not clear either.

Believe me..."},{"rating":"2","title":"An all-time favorite, simply incredible writing","review":"This book stuck with me when I read it about 4 years ago and still resonates. For me, it was a spiritual experience and a profound evocation of love. I kept thinking of the story of Ruth in the Bible. Nevermind the bleakness, the desolation, the desperation - the love between father and son shines through brialliantly. I found that I had to (needed to) read it aloud to appreciate the beautiful prose, sparse though it was; it needed to be sparse and devoid of punctuation to reflect the state of the world and highlight the only thing that remained - love. One of my all-time favorites!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"Rarely does a book leave me speechless. This book was engaging and thoughtful, but horribly depressing. I have never read McCarthy, so I was a bit put off at first by his use of fragments and almost stream-of-consiousness prose. After a few chapters, however, I didn't even notice and found that the unique style lent itself well to the atmosphere and theme of the book.

The numerous tedious episodes where the main character lets his mind wander, probing his spiritual self, what it all means deal, were particularly annoying. I wasn't expecting nor requiring a shoot em up, skim lightly over the top of the dark subject matter kind of story, but the point is I didn't find that it had ANY story.

I wish I read the other 1 star reviews before buying this book.

Please do not buy this book if you are at a low point in your life- it might just send you over the edge. There is not one ray of sunshine in the entire book; it is an endless series of disappointments and horror, all in a similar vein, so it becomes redundant and boring. Walk, starve, hide, walk, starve, hide. That's the entire book, in a nutshell."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete Waste of Time","review":"This book was a complete waste of time. If you are looking for a \\"literary masterpiece\\", i.e. a book that says nothing but is chalk full of stupid metaphors and allegories, then you might like it. It is annoying to read due to it not having any punctuation, for starters, but I guess if you are McCarthy you can get away with it. In addition, I hate to be a spoiler, but nothing happens throughout the book!! I will admit it is a page turner, because it leaves you thinking any minute something will happen, but it never really does. One or two interactions with other people on the road, and that's it. 95% of the book is their pathetic cling to survival. Read the first 20 pages and you can put it away, it is the same thing for the rest of the book, and that is not an exaggeration. Unless you are a literature professor, or just a glutton for depressing stories, you will probably be as pissed as me for wasting 5 hours reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not happy with book's appearance","review":"I received this book in a very timely manner, however I am not happy with the appearance. There is no wear on it; it looks new and never used, but the manufacturer, I'm guessing, cut the pages into several diagonals along the outside edge. I have no idea for the reason behind this. It looks trashy and cheap. This should be in the description of the book. I knew I didn't like shopping online for a reason."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the Fuss?","review":"I don't understand the rave reviews of this book. I picked it as my read for my book club and was almost stoned to death by my peers who also thought this was the biggest downer in the history of mankind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can I tell you something? Of course.....ad nauseam","review":"With the opening description of the obsidian ashen landscape, stark jagged rocks, unrelenting rain, shivering cold, impending death - readers are given imagery that repeats (with word variations) ad infinitum. Surroundings are absolutely, totally, unequivocally, omnipotently bleak and barren. Peppered with human jerky-like bodies and a few random troves of \\"goods\\" to keep the pair alive through the book, readers \\"got\\" it from the \\"getgo.\\" Interspersed with the apocalyptic adjectives are stingy offerings of communication between father and son that could be double as caveman speak. Dad has a pat litany of \\"of course\\" (with no quotation marks, naturally). The paragraphs are spaced widely apart so as to give the illusion that this is, indeed, a full-length novel.Boring, boring, boring!!! The only good thing about this book is that you can knock it out in a few hours. All The Pretty Horses was so superior to this."},{"rating":"1","title":"You want me to pay HOW much for the Kindle edition?","review":"Forget it.

That never happened. I should have trusted my instinct to set it down half way through."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Road to Wasted Time","review":"I borrowed this paperback from my son to read. I read the entire novel hoping the book would have an ending worth the hype. Sad to say the book was as pointless at the end as it began. A meandering through a desolate world with no given reason to the plodding of Father & son. The book is hopeless .... Soul less ... Written by an author that must have no hope of future for mankind. I found it interesting that there was no apparent life left on Earth but for a few remnants of mankind. That is hard to fathom, especially when there are hardier life forms on this Earth than man.This is the second book by this author that I have read and definitely my last."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect metaphor for the fragile beauty of goodness.","review":"The overriding metaphor of the novel is somewhat heavy-handed, and certainly impossible (we are more ingenious at survival than he allows), but as a statement about the nature of goodness and love in an empty, meaningless and brutal world, I have never read better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coming home","review":"The symbolism is clear in this great work (e.g. \\"This is my son.\\"). It is about faith, it is about hope, and, above all, it is about LOVE. And it has been a long and winding road for you too, Cormac. Welcome home!"},{"rating":"1","title":"great for an insomniac","review":"This one will put you to sleep. A waste of 8 bucks. A composium of 1001 ways to describe desolation, a non-existent plot. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well written 5 stars - Totally bleak and depressing 1 star","review":"This story is beautifully written and there is definitely the loving relationship of father and son. Having said this, it is one of the most depressing and bleak books I have read in a very long time. I just don't really enjoy spending my free time immersed in such a dismal story. I honestly can't imagine the author spending so much time wrapped up in this to write the story... I would need intense therapy if it were me."},{"rating":"2","title":"beautiful, but almost impossibly depressing","review":"this book is a masterpiece. it truly is. you can feel everything around them,you can see whats happening and feel it. the grey pallor, the grey snow, all vivid. the story should be used as a template for all survival stories. the only problem with it is that it is so depressing that i found it hard to pick it up every time i put it down. thats what was tough"},{"rating":"2","title":"Emotional roller coaster....","review":"Overwhelming despair, yet hope. Anguish, joy, love, and inextinguishable heartache punctuate this book. I tried to tell my wife about this book but became too emotional and yet I'm not sure I want her to read it because of the setting. The love between a parent and a child is the most powerful force in The Road. The paradox of the main character's discussion of God in a godforsken landscape is also worthy of deep contemplation.This author knows how to grip this reader with an ironfist...you won't be able to put it down until you know what's at the end of the road."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book","review":"The Road is a chillingly emotional roller coaster ride with two main characters that I came to love without even knowing their names. Cormac McCarthy translated to written word a depth of human strength which I think we all hope we have within us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous!","review":"This is a spectacular book. It's terrifying, frustrating, horrific, and will keep you thinking about it long after you've finished it. READ THIS BOOK!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is an apocalyptic tale that will survive...","review":"This book was probably the most depressing book I have ever read. That said, it is also one of the most moving books I have ever read. It follows a father leading his son through an apocalyptic world, while starving, freezing, and basically dying. This book makes you realize what we take for granted, and why we basically want to live. This story will move you..."},{"rating":"1","title":"stark","review":"the stark, sparse writing style of this book suits the subject matter, but is somewhat tedious to read. The seemingly endless travails of the father and son go on and on too long for me. I had to wonder how there were still food, clothes, tools, etc left for the duo to find after years of scavenging by the other survivors. How did the boy learn compassion when all his life was a struggle for survival with other people being the enemy? Also, people are essentially herd animals and probably would have grouped together to survive by cooperation in farming,for example, rather by eating each other. That could only go on for so long before the people ran out. Anyway, the book seemed to me to be haunting in its atmosphere but ultimately not very compelling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unrealistic and depressing","review":"I wouldn't waste my time. Everything on the planet is dead except humans and dogs? Really? Everyone IS going to die. I was looking for the happy ending. Boy, was I depressed when I finished reading it...it really never got any better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing Waste of tTime","review":"I wasted my time on The Road. How mundane and depressing. I thought this would get better so I continued to read but it never did. Repetitous and uninspired & dull; it was too boring to pass on to the public library used book store."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Road less taken would be preferable","review":"What an overrated book! I 've heard it was on Oprah's book club so one can only assume she' s getting old and desperate (she should stick to politics she does better!)This is not the consummate book on the after effects of nuclear winter and if the father -son relationship is the apogee of realting we're all in trouble!Real time waster from the literary as well as story line aspect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Planet of the Apes without the Apes","review":"The writing and descriptions at times are pretty cool but not enough happens in this book. Its walk down the road, get off the road, hide, don't hide, walk down the road again. If a little more was revealed or there was more story included this could have been a cool book. It felt just like Planet of the Apes without the Apes and without the shocking ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lives Up to the Hype!","review":"What a great book....I now can make the (somewhat dubious) claim to have read a book in Oprah's Book Club. This definitely appealed to my fondness for post-Apocalyptic sci-fi. Just unrelentingly bleak; the \\"plantation house\\" scene is up there on the Gruesomeness Scale with the best of Stephen King. Really glad I picked this up, and now understand what the fuss was all about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well Written, Too Depressing","review":"I was impressed with the author's images and writing ability. However, the story was so depressing, I couldn't finish the book. I certainly don't plan on seeing the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be a short story, not a novel","review":"I love \\"end of the world as you know it\\" films and books, therefore I jumped into \\"The Road\\". The book, though, is mostly boring. I do not need detailed explanations for plots, I can fill in the blanks and imagine, but there are plot problems (I will not give them away, it is not fair). If the story had 40 pages it would be great. With hundreds more you keep looking ahead just to see if something finally happens."},{"rating":"1","title":"I do not understand it","review":"Just finished reading this novel, have no way of knowing if it is good or not, but my reaction: What is the big deal about this book?Oh, well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth a read","review":"Terrible and beautiful, I keep telling people. Sobering. Easy to read but a bit difficult to come to grips with. Excellent read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Repitious and depressing","review":"Much too dark and the same thing over and over again. I just felt like taking a shower after reading this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would highhy NOT recommend","review":"I know I'm in the minority here, but I really didn't like this book. I knew I was in trouble just by the first 2 sentences. The language should draw you in and move you though the story but McCarthy's unconventional sentence butchering, and flat dialog really falls flat. Even this may be stomachable if it weren't for the fact that the whole thing is just too bleak and lacking in substance. There is barely enough here for a short story. Why this is getting so much acclaim is beyond me. It seems as though people are willing to forgive too much in this book just because it is highly acclaimed and Oprah put it on her list. I think this is definitely a case of the emperor having no clothes on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy","review":"I'm a big fan of apocalyptic literature. Hey, I grew up in the 80s under the spectre of Soviet nukes- how could you NOT enjoy something about trying to survive after the bombs drop?Well, this hunk 'o cheese isn't worth buying. When an author can't be bothered to write complete sentences or include punctuation, then I can't be bothered to consider it in any sort of serious light. I understand he was trying to convey a sense of oppression and desolation, and he did. There are some pretty decent scenes that really put you into the moment in this book. It's not a total waste.But I have to ask: how many times can you read \\"they walked through ash\\" in one single volume? Apparently I've exceeded my limit, because it just didn't work for me. You can read into the story if you like, and try to throw a deeper meaning onto the bare bones of the events in this novel. Personally, I didn't care for it, and don't understand all the hype about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"A sparse and heartbreaking journey into desperation and fear. This is a searing novel about the symbols, by-ways and inherent sadness of survival. I'm reminded of the old cliche in music -- in so far that this book is genius for all the notes the author _didn't_ play."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Lonely, Depressing, Road","review":"Cormac McCarthy has succeeded brilliantly, in depressing the hell out of me. The Road is a magnificent book, and that's the problem, I couldn't just ignore it, I couldn't disregard it, I had to feel the weight of the (dying) world on my shoulders. This book could literally give you nightmares. Compelling? Powerful? Yes, but I'm guessing being beaten over the head by a baseball bat is also compelling and powerful.Save yourself some joy in life, and don't read this book unless you want to feel miserable."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Road","review":"This is the last time I listen to Oprah regarding any book. This book is dark but meaningless. I had to force myself to finish this pointless tragic story.How this became a best seller is beyond me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reader Beware","review":"I read barely half of the book. Who would guess that I couldn't get through 114 pages?I suppose whatever happened could happen but I found it to be a profoundly depressing and disturbing book.Didn't read any reviews first,just downloaded it from my library. They don't have a huge selection soI took a chance. I read for pleasure; this book made me feel ill. Although unfinished, I still think aboutthe parts I did read. Haunting.Lesson: read the reviews first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I did not enjoy this book. Boring. Aimless. No plot. Just darkness. Having just read the first two books of The Passage trilogy, the lack of substance in this story is resounding."},{"rating":"1","title":"There goes several hours I'll never get back","review":"This book went nowhere and as far as a study of love's dedication....fail. Felt like I'd been strung along, waiting for some sort of explanation or resolution and then he wraps up the ending in a few paragraphs? And I'm all for word usage but many of the descriptive words used weren't even in the dictionary and seemed to be there just for obscurity's sake. I can't believe the high ratings this book got. The one thing this book did successfully was create a gloomy, desolate, hopeless atmosphere with the way the dialogue was handled and of course, the lurid gruesome details of cannibalism, but very glad this was a library read and not a purchase for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"I've read it three times","review":"I am a long time fan of McCarthy, but this is by far my favorite book, a true masterpiece. McCarthy is known for his pared down, minimal writing style. In this book, he has not only stripped down language to is bare bones, but the entire planet as well. This paring down of both language and setting throws the relationship between father and son into painfully poignant sharp relief. It doesn't matter what happened or why, all that matters is this one relationship, this last spark of humanity, hope, and love in a brutal world. Oddly enough, I found this to be the most optimistic of all McCarthys works, but I won't say why for fear of spoiling it for those of you have not read it. Pick it up, you won't be able to put it down!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Haunting, Emotional Work","review":"I was completely taken aback by how wonderful I found this book! Emotional, suspenseful, haunting. Beautiful in its simplicity, this post-armaggedon Father & Son story is engrossing from first page to last.Viggo Mortensen is an inspired casting choice for a movie version, but regardless: this book is not to be missed. It is a powerful story of love and survival."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Road--Religion and Detail","review":"The Road is both an emotional and suspenseful ride that follows a father and son through a post-apocalyptic world. A main theme throughout the novel is the role of religion and though I am not a religous fanatic, after reading McCarthy's novel I see the necessity of faith during the darkest hours of one's life. The father and son live for each other but also live for the hope of a better day. The ending is heart wrenching. The book contains so much detail that every line is important."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just did not do it for me","review":"I guess after the apocalypse there is no need for quotation marks because this book does not use them. Occasionally you are not certain if some one is doing something or speaking. I found the deviations from the writing norms annoying rather than ground breaking.This book is lacking. You are thrown into the life of these two wanderers without much explanation. Through the course of the reading you assume the explanations are coming but it just does not happen. They never tell you what trigger the apocalypse nuclear weapons, asteroid? I'm still not sure. How were people able to survive?They say the themes are love, loyalty and devotion but what about stupidity, obsession and insanity? Could go either way. Maybe, i'm too much of a skeptic or lack imagination, but i'll wait till the movie is on TV. I did not pick up on any true endearing qualities in this tale."},{"rating":"1","title":"dreary and grey","review":"I read the book \\"The Road\\", after I had seen the author interviewed on Oprah. I disliked it intensely. It is well-written as a novel, but thoroughly depressing and dreary. Oprah and others said how hopeful it was in the end; I didn't see it. I can't remember being so sure so early that this was a book I disliked. I sold my brand new copy right away to the second-hand bookstore, so certain was I that I would never read it again, or recommend it to anyone.I also had a feeling as I read it...this is very familiar; what book does it remind me of? Suddenly it came to me - \\"Waiting for Godot\\" and \\"Endgame\\" by Samuel Beckett - two plays I love, by an author who has long been a favourite of mine. He can be extremely depressing in the view he paints of man's life and the meaning of life, but there is always humour, at least to me. \\"The Road\\" was humourless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"This is easily one of the most disappointing, boring and poorly-written books I have ever read..... really! I could barely stay awake and finish it. I find the glowing reviews curious. Strange, since the other books by McCarthy were very entertaining and well-written. Perhaps the film will work, the book didn't. Not for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why all the hype?","review":"I ordered this book due to an interest in post apocalyptic fiction, and after reading it, I still can't see why this book was so hyped. I kept reading hoping it would get better, but it never quite went anywhere. If you're looking for an interesting read, look somewhere else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Dark!","review":"Dark is a perfect word to describe this book. While the writing wasn't necessarily bad, the plot was. Actually there is very little plot, I kept hope out till the last page that there would be a surprise ending. What was good though was the dialogue between the young boy (about 6yrs old) and his Father. The author nailed just how a child of that age would react in catastrophic circumstances. I believe most readers time could be better spent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute waste of money","review":"We should have noticed in the photo that the grooved part that screws into the cork is too narrow, meaning it is unable to grab onto the cork and pull it up. Instead, it just drills a hole in the cork and then destroys the surrounding portion of cork. We know how to use a corkscrew and have never had this problem with any other corkscrew. It's really a horrible design and we hope no one else wastes their money on this item. There are much better, some even cheaper, corkscrews on Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful wolf figurine","review":"Sturdy, durable wolf figurine. Very realistic looking, even the tongue is painted pink!Mine differs from the image shown here - mine seems to be a mirror image.

Wooten's book is simply an alphabetical listing of many JavaScript elements (though far from complete in even that). I can't imagine that some one wanting to learn about the window open property and the window close property would want to go look under O for Open and then C for Close. Most reference books prefer to give their information in context. That is, you probably want to go to the window chapter and read about all of its properties in that context. I RARELY want to look up a JavaScript feature based on its alphabetical ordering, and if I do, I use a thing called an INDEX. I can't imagine that a programmer could make much use of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing Title","review":"I found the title of this book completely misleading -- I would never refer to this book as to \\"Programmer's Reference\\". It is more like JavaScript language history overview. If one wants to know about the history of JavaScipt or what the difference between some implementations is -- it may be right book for that purpose. But if one need to have the language reference that is easy to navigate and which contains the details important for programmers, like method arguments description and what that method does -- then this book may be a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Organization Is Horrible; No Index....","review":"I was thinking about buying this book and read through it at a bookstore....I was completely confused.

If reading for leisure, the writing is very smooth and chapters flow into one another, it also teaches you a little of Bolivian history and politics without feeling like you're studying. For academic purposes it is a very useful example of complicities between various groups and how they can undermine people's movements, but it is also a good example of how one can get beyond complicities to help erradicate injustice. It is not naive, and is a very multifaceted analysis of the human condition. If Domitila would write this again I would like to see a fuller discussion of the achievement of trust between different groups that may not have been friendly at times, but that might make it more academic and less interesting for an evening, weekend or vacation read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hogwash","review":"It seems that Sra.

The fuging tune and related music (anthems etc.) stem originally from English psalmody (the \\"West Gallery tradition\\"), the works of men such as William Tans'ur and Aaron Williams. They, their music and the people who sang it in England, as in the US, were very much not of the elite: they were of \\"the folk\\", hence their folk music.

I found the band to be unexceptional and uninspired. The drums and bass in particular are often unimaginative and stiff. The keyboard player isn't much better. Where the leader and guitarist Mario Millo is the strongest musician he too lacks fire and passion in his work. His vocals are somewhat similar to Ambrosia, a bit too high in register for my taste. The compositions are lengthy but they go no where and unlike with other epic minded bands (Yes, ELP) you lose interest in the pieces. If you like the mellower side of prog-rock you may enjoy them (Ambrosia, Moody Blues). I'd suggest you look elsewhere...Simon"},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken in Just a Few Weeks","review":"My daughter loved this toy, but it broke in just a few weeks.

What do I hate about it:1. It's waaaay too loud. And every time it's turned off, it resets to the loudest volume.2. It has no automatic turnoff. I think it goes into a sort of \\"sleep\\" mode when not touched for a while, but it's not off and there's a red light on indicating it's still on. Two year olds do not turn off their toys, so we've already had to change the batteries twice in this thing.3. Most of the demos are Christmas carols, which were fine in Dec/Jan, but now? Notsomuch.I want to make it clear, I don't mind toys that make noise. We have many, many LeapFrog toys and other musical toys and they don't bother me one bit.

The sound and feeling of the music was almost electric and the excitement in his voice was as if he had something to shout about. Ever since then I have collected every Aztec Camera album, single, extended version, b-side and collectible available. However I am completely disappointed with, \\"Surf.\\" It just doesn't sound like he has anything to shout about anymore. He sounds uninspired and almost bored at times.

It is not so much a comparative synopsis of the feminine in the various world religions, but more of a lengthy, personal account of excuses for the author's sexuality.

He uses his knowledge of relgions of the world to try and show how his relationship is ok. I did not even resell this book; I put it in the trash to get one less out of the world.

Of course songs may sound similar or have the same idea but what you should be listening to is the quality and potential. With this being their first release, I think The Starting Line is doing an awesome job. There isn't one song I don't love and I can hardly pick a favorite (although I would have to say its probably \\"Three is a Charm\\" or \\"Nothings Gonna Stop Us Now\\") I think the lead singer, Ken has an amazing voice and I honestly don't see a similarity between his voice and that of Jordan from NFG (as one reviewer commented.)

This is barely even pop-punk, it is so soft. I do like the first two songs though, catchy if anything.If you want Saves the Day, buy Saves the Day, they are easily the most talented, creative band out. They absolutely rock like punk should!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not A New Found Glory's latest release.","review":"Come on, people, don't you realize that this is just a big ripoff of \\"Nothing Gold Can Stay\\"-era New Found Glory? I guess that's why all the NFG kids in my school like this so much. Because it's a band that's not big yet (so they can feel like they're deep in the scene), yet they also have a sound that's not anything we haven't already heard before (so as not to scare them, and not confuse them vs. their Jay-Z records). I guess these guys would be good if they were SO much like NFG, and if NFG didn't exist I'd be telling you how good the Starting Line is.

I decided to try them since I knew Drive-Thru had a good reputation for signing good bands (NFG, Midtown, RX Bandits)an I loved it. I can't wait for a full length sometime soon. A lot of the songs have all those catchy melodic hooks that make you not want to stop listening. Sometimes the way they start their melody reminds me a bit of how Christie Front Drive does/did theirs. All of the 4 original songs are great and I recoginize that cover song.....I just can't figure out where the hell it came from...All in all a good album and a good move by Drive-Thru for signing these guys!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Starting Line start ROCKING!","review":"I first heard this band on a drive thru comp.

No element wants to reveal where the next will go. In fact, while listening to it, the best you can do to predict direction is to reason that where a section seems like it will go is the opposite of where it will. The music directly juxtaposes sounds that are almost attacking with ethereal bits & surprising electronic things. Stockhausen's description of the aim of the piece is that it not resolve or have any noticeable build toward climax, that it present the standard horizontal perception of time with thorough verticality, which results in a sense of timelessness.

Thank God for Bill Moyers and now Christopher Vogler. Vogler relates Campbell's observations with a format and with examples that any of use can relate to. His book is an invaluable tool for the writer who has great ideas but not a lot of time to study plot structure and characterization. Vogler will help you pull it all together, and help you recognize market realities. You will treasure this book"},{"rating":"1","title":"Failed Aims","review":"I started reading _The Writer's Handbook_ with great expectations and ended up disappointed.While the author tries to appeal both the novices and the veterans alike, he fails in both accounts.For a veteran writer looking for a precise and practical guide, this book is too verbose, too repetitive, and needlessly redundant.For a novice looking for help, her situation is far worse. Immediately she will be confused by all the things the author throws at her. All these talks about archetypes, psychological functions, and dramatic functions without any concrete examples (with detailed analysis) are mind boggling. Going through the journey without a comprehensive case study is disorientating.The book is further hampered by the lack of an index, a more comprehensive bibliography, errors in mythology, and the totally distracting bit about the Seekers."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Trout CD","review":"This is Trout's best albulm.

About three years ago I bought a cheap set of WOLOs with a two plastic air horn set up and a small on demand compressor, and they sounded ok...for a while. Living in Alaska, where we are subjected to lots of crazy weather, the ole plastic horns deterioated and sounded worse than stock. Thats when I decided to \\"Go BIG or Go Home!\\" I purchased the cannonball express and the only complaint i have is they are so big i t took forever to find a place for them. I finally mounted them inside my bumper where it has a mount for a winch. These horns are HUGE! you need a spot approximaly 1ft wide x 1ft high x 1.5ft long to get them mounted in. Is it worth it?

The Teach Yourself Beginner's French Grammar is much better, and no less advanced.This is very poorly organized as a reference. Even the index is skimpy. It mostly follows the organization of a \\"topics\\" test -- which is not how I want a grammar book organized. That said it does a decent enough job of running over basic French grammar.

This isn't basic photography, this is garbage. There is a picture on page 49 that is so blurry that the models don't look human. I mean, really...c'mon. Almost every picture is a bad picture. You get better information on posing in the book that comes with your camera. At the end, the author writes in his Conclusion \\"There is no doubt that digital technology has influenced the world of portraiture.\\" What in the world does that even mean ?!The only thing we have when buying online is the reviews. I would like Amazon to have some quality standards. I understand we all have different ideas about what we like, but, just paging through this book and seeing how bad the pictures are,(it's a \\"photography\\" book), should make someone ask about acceptability.Yea, I know...it's only $11.66.

There are many good systems in this book. You may not agree with them, but that is what various theories are all about.The book is readable, laid out well, and very easy to understand.GIve this book a chance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too preachy.","review":"While the basics are described adequately, the author's personal preferences are forced upon the reader without qualified support. The methods and approaches described are not statistically correct and the author \\"talks down\\" to the reader. There is relatively little new insight offered into the game that other books offer in a more readable form."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time","review":"John Patrick's gambling strategy espouses a risk averse philosophy that does little to help the player in the long run. For example, he advocates placing the any craps bet to hedge the pass line wager. Any \\"gambling expert\\" can tell you that hedging does not work. Furthermore, the house edge on the any craps bet is over 11%!Another problem with his book is the \\"big four\\". First of all, money management \\"systems\\" have no effect on the long term winnings of the player. No matter what \\"system\\" the player uses, his/her winnings will fall on a curve dictated by the expectation of the game being played. According to Patrick, however, they are a cardinal rule to gambling success. Lastly, trends can only be seen in hindsight. If you are interested in learning craps, buy another book."},{"rating":"2","title":"noirish symph-rock.","review":"_Symphonic Holocaust_ is a sombre instrumental masterwork, evoking Genesis and symph-ish King Crimson. Morte Macabre's compositional grace is a thing of wonder, wielding luscious mellotrons and delicate guitar lines with sparse percussion at the zenith of subtle craftsmanship. The band's splendid arrangements are complemented by perfectly tasteful sound production, minimalist yet rich. There is no proggy heavy-handedness here! The music tends to be dark and a little discomforting (especially if listened to in the solitude of the morning's wee hours), capable of bestowing weighty sadness. Even the major key \\"Opening Theme\\", triumphant and elated though it sounds, set against its lugubrious backdrop, it becomes rendered with wrenching bittersweetness. Slow and evocative, this is a remarkable, unheralded symph-prog gem. Not like what is common to the genre, _Symphonic Holocaust_ is an affecting paradigm shift of mood with an otherwise familiar instrumental recipe. Check it out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pawn structure and long term planning!","review":"I did hear that saying that, \\"pawns are the sole of chess\\", and \\"chess structure is the backbone of your position\\". Mr. Soltis shows you the importance of planning ahead and having the right pawn structure, or making your opponent have the wrong one - especially looking toward an endgame. Now this not a book for a beginner, who should be learning basic tactics, traps, ideas behind opening moves and basic endgames. This is a book for someone past that stage that needs to learn the more advanced idea of recognizing how to use pawns and the importance of planning ahead keeping the the pawns (the little people!!) in mind! Don't forget the \\"little people\\" would be a funny but true statement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too advanced for even intermediate players","review":"The only types of players that this book would benefit are tournament-level, who have memorized all 50 major openings. For the rest of us, the book is a study in arcane gibberish. The only thing I found helpful is how to position the pawns and pieces for a \\"break\\" into the opponents pawn structure. All other information was confusing. Even after Soltis described \\"why\\" one player's position won or lost the game, I STILL didn't understand why. The only advice I have for intermediate players is that, if you play black, the most important square to defend is e5. I use a variation of the King's Indian Defence (with Nd7 instead of Nf6), to close the center with black pawns at e5 and d4, then launch a kingside attack. Everyone thinks that getting pieces outside the pawn chain is an advantage, but if you advance pawns wisely, the opponent will be squeezed for space, and control of e5 by black hampers any white kingside attack."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting approach, but just another tactical book","review":"You should note immediately that this book is about pawn STRUCTURE, NOT about pawn PLAY. The author classifies the different pawn skeletons typically encountered into similar types or families, and explores the most commonly encountered plans adopted by either side arising from those structures. A good point of the discussion is the lack of connection to specific piece placement. The examples are connected by structure, not by opening variation. Unfortunately the treatment is superficial with limited analysis and vague references to strategic themes that go largely unexplained. Treatment of the Benoni formation is particularly lacking.For insights into pawn PLAY, read the all-time classic, \\"Pawn Power in Chess\\", by Hans Kmoch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enlightening at all. Way overrated.","review":"I can't understand why so many people praise this book. Sure, Soltis devotes chapters to many different structures, but he doesn't teach us anything in those chapters that a good specialized opening book wouldn't cover. The advice is very basic and the prose he gives is, to me, insufficient.He provides supplemental games that don't always fit well with the content of the chapter, and even if they do the notes to these games are very scant.This same author's Opening Analysis for Advanced Players (I have the 2nd part but have never seen the first part) is EXCELLENT. This one is not.There are a handful of chess authors (chess fans who have been around the game know who I'm referring to) who pump out tons of chess books. 1/3 to 1/2 of them are decent-to-well-done, and the remainder are trash. I wouldn't place this book in the \\"trash\\" category, but it leaves a lot to be desired."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT THAT GOOD","review":"Highly over rated . Too much so . This book is not as good as Pawn Power in Chess by Kmoch . Save your money . Buy the book Pawn Power in Chess which is cheaper and way better . The main disadvantage of this book is it deals mainly with openings . Not many concepts are given about pawn play -- mainly how u handle pawn structures in some openings. Your play will suffer if your opponent does not play the openings or if some variations turn up . U will be a sitting duck on the chess board . Get Kmoch's book --- please . U won't be disappointed ."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Dreadful tirade!","review":"This is a truly dreadful book, filled with bitter tirades from Frazier about Muhammad Ali.

The characters and plot kept me guessing until the end. The humor mixed with the quotable wisdom on almost every page supports the theme of the book. The book design is outstanding, for example each chapter is set up as minutes on a clock and the end of the book, is the count down. Exciting read, a real escape into another world yet holds to associated reality and wisdom for our own world. Sometimes the style is fairy tale like and the language is formal, but I think the author was going for that.

Well when it arrived it was not fully assembled as the product discription states it would be. Assembly was fairly easy, especially if you've assembled one before. The motor is extremely quiet. The remote works really well. The timer is a great feature if you don't want it running non-stop. The speeds are all great. The high speed is extremely fast in my opinion. My main dissapointment is the the natural rythmic wind feature that is mentioned is not applicable. At least not as I understood it.

If you are looking for a \\"thriller\\" mystery or a horror mystery or a CSI mystery, you will be disappointed. These are just tales of Africa and tales of people interacting and solving personal problems and having normal conflicts. The resolutions are based on good common sense.

As other people have mentioned, there is a lot of repetition, which can become boring.One part of the story involves someone being blackmailed. The person who initially tells Mma Ramotswe about the situation says that a cleaning lady at the college told her about it. Later on the detectives wonder who else might know about the situation and be blackmailing the head cook, but never mention the cleaning lady. I would think an editor would catch that.

I had previously purchased a different humidor through a different company about 1 month earlier and it did not have a good seal at all, and would not hold constant humidity and temperature levels. This humidor, on the other hand, has a perfect seal and keeps the humidity INSIDE the box like I want it. Beautiful cedar fragrance, excellent craftsmanship, and really just the perfect small humidor to hold around 50 cigars. The wood is beautiful and it really is an attractive piece. The inlay is also a nice design touch that adds some character. In addition, [...] had first-class customer service, great prices on products, and ridiculously fast shipping. I have ordered humidor accessories from them in the past, and I will continue to use them as my exclusive source for all things humidor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Humidor","review":"This was for my husband as a gift.

The pace is fast and engrossing, there is plot, humour, and satire. Remo and his father are no longer boring karate dancers filled with fears. This book is not only good in comparison to the previous three but is excellent on it's own. I am immediately buying #110 and #112. I purchased this book based on an E-Mail from the current author promising that the debacle of Remo as the Executioner would not be repeated.

Haunting Beckett ghost story","review":"Despite its mathematically precise stage directions (there's even a diagram), pinning down the dramatic events, 'Footfalls' is ultimately as elusive as its heroine, pacing endlessly up and down a strip of light, tending to her sick mother. The pacing is interrupted by two monologues which may, or may not, tell the story of May's life - it is typical in a play with a literally self-effacing heroine that her story should haunt others' stories, that others should speak for her, that the imagery should be ghost-like, inchoate, tantalising; one voice doubled, splintered. Her mother is a mere voice; by the end of the play, May is on her way - is this the natural fate of women for Beckett?It goes without saying that such a visually precise play doesn't read very well, although there is an accumulation of words and feelings that is tremendously powerful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Russian Review","review":"I can recommend this workbook for those interested in studying Russian.

Sometimes events gave me a slap in the face and I vowed not to go to the next story...but I also couldn't resist. It reminded me of the shocks I had with \\"The Painted Bird\\" so many decades ago...not to mention Abugrade prison in real world 2003. These are lives certainly below (or above? or beside?) my normal horizon. I considered the graded slope that I was on...I am just on the edge enough to read it...Mr. Reed's twisted enough to write it vividly and make me care...but this book makes it undeniable that there are those out there living these sometimes violent, often cruel, but strangely fascinating edges.

I can't understand what all the hype was about this book. I found it be quite unbelievable at best. The character of Leah was boring. Johnny wasn't too bad.

This live CD, however, captures the energy in her live shows and has some great cover versions of some great old tunes. \\"The Water is Wide\\" is perhaps my least favorite song on the CD because it pales in comparison to Karla Bonoff's version with Brother James. The next CD I would love to see is one done with Livingston, James, and Hugh (if he is still performing). I think with all these talented siblings they owe it to their many fans.

I even gave this one a listen to see if the quality was good or bad. The quality of the recording was awful so if it was the real deal, it was crap. Her original CD from the 70's was great!

America did not lack for home-produced classical music. Heinrich's piece has many virtues: The orchestration is inventive and colorful and the music is at all times pleasant and listenable. What it is NOT is memorable. It goes on for long stretches providing a pleasant background (violins and winds interweaving, occasional punctuations by percussion) but nowhere is there a semblance of a tune or melody. It does work fairly well as abstract tone painting- I can see some of the \\"Conflict of the Condor\\" at times- but often it's a lot of build up with no resolution.

I felt like I personally experienced each of the author's highs and lows in the Gulag as they were related. This is a rare look inside the system that swallowed up so many of the best and brightest people.It is too bad that Hollywood is so obsessed with the dozen or so screenwriters who lost their jobs in 1950's America to the anti-communist investigations because any one of the many films devoted to their plight would have been better served by profiling just a single member of the millions who perished in the Soviet Gulag."},{"rating":"2","title":"Required reading for humans","review":"I read \\"Man is Wolf to Man\\" three years ago, and it haunts me to this day.

(Beck sounds the most proficiant to me) A friend of mine had this album (or at least an album with some of this material on it) back in 1973. I believe it was called Guitar Boogie. It's very dated sounded with a few of the tracks just having 2 guitars (Eric on lead and Jimmy on chords I think)and sounds like they had a small reel to reel sitting around someone's house in an informal jam. I bought it just for the memories, a little bit of the earlier jamming by Eric, Jeff & Jimmy. I believe this was probably around the time of the Yardbirds, or shortly after Beck split from them, around those years. I would only recommend this for those searching out everything these guys have done. But there are some good moments on there. A few tracks have vocals in what sounds like sessions one of them were playing on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly disappointing","review":"This CD is advertised as a box set but it contains one CD and for the price it is extremely disappointing.

Since our cells contain re-pressed e-motions and can elicit dis-ease the author suggests that we address the wounded child within, emotionally becoming this child again in order to heal it and thus heal our cells and ultimately ourselves. I love her honesty and humor. I also especially enjoyed her playing with words, which is not so much a play on words but a breaking words down into their components. Words are worlds, after all, and sound can make us sound. Sound, Movement and Tears is not just a book. It speaks to our hearts and souls.

Inevitably, they submit to the attraction that has been growing throughout the series/I give it four stars because it's a great story with good characters.

I'm biased in that I am big fan of Elizabeth Moon's series and this is one of the few series I buy in hardback. I won't rehash the summaries, the other folks are spot on. My pain over the series is self-centered since there is only one book in this series per year. There are four story lines, following Ky, Rafe, Stella and Grace. And the amount of attention is in that order from greater to lesser. About two thirds of the way through the book I realized there were going to be lots of loose ends to be picked up in subsequent books. If Ms. Moon doesn't split this series into multiple lines of books, longer books or write faster it may take a decade to pull all the story lines together.So great read for the diehard fan.

The Melissa & Doug ink pads don't work that well and the wooden stamps are a pain to get in and out of the case. With kids, it's much easier not to have to wash the stamps after each use, and it would also be nice if the ink colors were separated with separate lids.

Plus many include dum techniques just to fill on more dvds to charge you more. Although I do agree that few of the techniques are hard to perform on bigger guys in general its still one of the best self defense dvds out there. I also agree its expensive but whatever..good stuff usually is. Another dvds on self defense I also recommend are the \\"gracies street self defense\\" eventhough is old, the \\"street fighting self defense techniques\\" from froes and koulikov and the \\"hand to hand combat\\" from the marine corps.

In this DVD Rutten shows the techniques that he thinks are the best for different situations. Here comes the biggest problem of this film, the techniques that Rutten shows may work great with Rutten, but poorly on normal people. Most of the techniques shown on this DVD demand a lot of power from the people performing them. And as you know, a typical MMA-fighter isn't a portrait of an average man. Therefore, this DVD doesn't work very well for most of the people.The most positive thing about this DVD is that it allways underlines the fact that its about street situations. Rutten seems to know a lot about real-life fights, and makes very good points that many people haven't even thought before.Bas Rutten also tells a lot of good things about the use of improvised weapons, a part of the DVD, that I would have hoped to be a little longer and more thorough."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE!","review":"This DVD is more like a $2.00 movie packaged in a $1.00 jewel case.

If you recline the the back seat you can put a baby carrier back there and the older one can sit in the front (which ours loves). If you put the older one in the back the foot room is a little cramped but doesn't look uncomfortable. The two seats are nice if you have younger ones that still will sleep in a stroller. Underseat storage is a little small and not easily accessible, but we knew that from our other Sit n' Stand. Overall, we have been very happy with this purchase"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for kids having gap of 0.5-3.5 years","review":"Very good stroller but since I bought when I had second kid with an older sibling of 5 years. But still I use it but cannot take full advantage of it. The very first thing I had to do was to remove the rear canopy and rear seat; cause there is no way a 5 year old can sit front facing. And in that case I should have bought the one without rear canopy and seat there by not paying the premium for having having extra seat and canopy.I would have loved this stroller if my kids were 3 years apart and would have given a 5 star rating but just this is not perfect fit for me; I have given 4 stars.Overall, the stroller is a value for money. Other cons are same with any other double stroller...little difficult to operate, too big, bulky.One thing I didn't like it was if there is anything in stroller basket, it is difficult to close and stuff in the basket may fall also."},{"rating":"2","title":"Same as Sit n Stand Elite Double Stroller from One Step Ahead","review":"I was wondering the same thing about this stroller - i.e. how does it convert to \\"stand\\" mode? etc. I had seen the version of this stroller on the One Step Ahead website, so I called Baby Trend and they told me it is the exact same stroller.

I have only been using it since December, and I rarely use it (4 or 5 times a month) but the 'sturdy' platform in the back is cracked. I contacted support last week to find out where to get a new platform. So far all I have received is questions regarding when I purchased it and how heavy my kids are. I have a 3 year old girl and a 9 month old and they are not heavy kids (30lbs and 19 lbs). Still the platform broke and I need a replacement. I wasn't asking for anything for free, although many good companies would have been more helpful. So here I am a week later with no solution. Apparenlty timely communication is not their strong suit. In the meantime I am considering getting a different brand of a double stroller so I am not without for any longer.

I ordered three of these spindles in November 2009 and just began using them. Immediately I began to get music with skips making them unacceptable for use. I opened a new spindle and experienced the same problem. I was afraid that my write drive was bad, but regular (non-music) Maxell Cd's recorded music fine. As a last resort, I went to my local computer store and bought a Maxell Music 50 pack, (which differed only by having interior plastic wrap and a \\"Made in Taiwan\\" sticker on top). These work fine, as I have always experienced. I can only conclude that the discs that Amazon is selling are defective. It may be that some will work and others will not, but I do not have the time or inclination to try each one to get a correct burn. Of course the return date has expired, so I will just have to recycle them.

The ones that did burn played OK but we noticed what looked like a lot of flaking in the CD material itself.Bottom line - We will not use this brand again nor do we recommend it at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time or money","review":"Of all of the CD-R Music media I have used, Maxell has been by far the worst. Out of a spindle of 30 I have had to throw at least half of them away (and a number of the CD's that \\"worked\\" I burned pictures to, so it wasn't just a music issue).When I contacted Maxell they agreed based on my feedback that I was using the discs correctly and asked for information from the packaging (which had been discarded; there is nothing of note on the packaging beyond what is on the shrink wrap). Then they asked me to send the bad discs in for replacement (and since I generally don't sit down to burn 30 discs at a time, most of these had again, been discarded as the problems occurred).I think that Maxell will work with you if you save all of the \\"garbage\\" (shrink-wrap, bad discs) - but it seems unlikely that someone is going to save/collect these things over the course of using the entire spindle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap Imitation of Real Maxell Quality","review":"We own a recording studio and make fine classical compilations. Maxell must have sold the quality rights or are making these \\"pro\\" discs on the cheap. Maxell USED TO BE a brand we could trust (their high-expatial metal cassette tapes are without compare - THE BEST) but now every third on of these CD-R discs are defective (can't record) and then when you do get a recording down it lasts for a few plays then skips. These are almost as bad as the worst - the Memorex discs. What a waste of money - no wonder they are so cheap. If you want to get the REAL quality get with FujiFilm CD-R Pro. If you can find them in the US (we get ours from the UK). We wouldn't use another Maxell disc if they gave them to us.

But nothing stirs more emotions then the thought of that train racing past you, on its trip from Chicago to LA, at 100 mph, with two Santa Fe EMD F7 warbonnets at its point. But with passenger trains in their heyday the Santa Fe railroad needed to focus their attention to freight. Unfortunally, what made for an excellant passenger engine, made for a lousy road switcher. This book chronicles the production model CF7 rebuilds from F7 locomotives at the Cleburne, Texas shops. If you ever wondered how they turned those engines inside out, this books for you.

As I read pages, my mind kept saying \\"and this applies to non-Jews as well.\\" Anyone from the three traditions that see their roots in the story of Abraham should find this a really thought provloking read.There are portions that do drag a bit, but read through them because there is always a wonderfull insight following the slow portion."},{"rating":"1","title":"A few interesting ideas, but","review":"mostly just another attempt to conform Judaism to someone's preexisting ideological vision of the world, arrived at completely independently of Judaism."},{"rating":"1","title":"A life without faith","review":"Going through life without faith is a sad existence.All ideas shared in the book are a fine presentation, better said compilation of thoughts by Conservative and Reform theologians.The paradox is to give such validity to the early thinkers of Judaism with the absence of a Divine mandate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nasty and Profane","review":"This is a horrible book written from a very nasty point of view. Basically, this is a systematic dismantling of everything sacred about Judaism - to the point where the author actually uses the sacred name of God in the book. Obviously, the author knew that his use of the name of God would deeply insult those devoutly Jewish, and just as obviously, the author did not care if he insults deeply held beliefs.It's important to understand that this is coming from a man that feels that what is now Israel will soon no longer exist as the Jewish homeland - and he demonstrates absolutely no concern for that, either.No concern for the basics of the Jewish religion, disdain for the Jewish homeland, and disdain for the future of the Jewish race. Anti-religion, Anti-Judaism, Anti-Israel. There's a word for that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice, but way to small for most dSLRs","review":"Pros:*Nice looking bag*Fits nicely at hip*Plenty of pockets*No zipper when you open the flap makes it SUPER EASY to pull your camera out for a quick shotCons:*Very narrow front to back and very deep top to bottom which makes it very, very difficult to position dividers*Dividers are too tall for my dSLR leaving too little room between the top of the divider pad and the top of the cavity (camera rides too high)*Can't put camera and spare lens inside AND have dividers between them*Velcro is too hard to position and peel on and off; I wonder how durable the velcro straps would be*No zipper on top flap may be off-putting for some"},{"rating":"1","title":"scratched my xsi","review":"bought this based on the quick review that it fits my Canon EOS DIGITAL REBEL XSi and it does. however, after two weeks of usage, i noticed a few scratches on the pop up flash part of the xsi body. ignored it the first day as maybe the clip from the bag accidentally nicked it. the second day, the scratch got bigger. the velcro holding the bag's adjustable panels developed into a hard plastic edge and was scrapping the camera body inside the \\"protective\\" case as i was carrying it while walking. now my Canon EOS DIGITAL REBEL XSi has \\"battle damage.\\" turned me off tamrac products altogether.btw, it's not like a little messenger that doesn't look like a camera bag. it's more like a lunch box size thing that still garnered me a \\"man-purse\\" comment from people on the street."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice bag but too small","review":"I purchased this bag to hold a Nikon 3100 with an 18-55 lens as well as a 55-200. I like the design but found it too small. A previous reviewer indicated that this was a good fit, but I don't agree. If I tried to squeeze both camera and extra lens in, they would have been very difficult to remove. I returned the the bag and ordered the Tamrac Rally 4 instead, but not before checking it out at a local store. The Rally 4 is about two inches wider and a bit deeper, making it a lot easier to insert and remove things."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice but what is up with the velcro","review":"It has a nice look, the materials are not bad, and lots of pockets. The problem that I have with this bag is the amount of Velcro inside. It is very difficult to customize the positioning of the padding, but I guess if one is going to use only one configuration then it is not a big deal. Secondly, the Velcro strips have sharp edges which will scratch your camera every time you put it in or pull it out. My intention was to use this bag with a Rebel T1i, and the size of the bag is about right. The bag is capable of holding the camera with a lens attached (e.g. 18-55mm), an additional lens (e.g. 70-200mm), a flash, and other small items (e.g. memory cards, additional batteries, etc). However, because of the Velcro issue, this camera is being returned as I write this review. A good bag is supposed to protect the camera, not scratch it."},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty awesome smaller bag","review":"I'm a dentist and have a Canon rebel xsi I use for intraoral photos. I was looking for a smaller bag that can fit in a narrow space. I can fit my macro lens (100mm), the standard lens the camera comes with, the body, and the macro ring lite flash (MR-14EX) inside the main compartment. The ring part of the flash won't fit unless I tuck it into the front zippered pocket. You could probably fit another smaller lens as well.I thought that the front lighter part of the bag was a pale yellow color. However, it really is more of a weird brown color. Not quite what I was expecting, but still nice.The shoulder strap can be tightened, but if you do, the ends are loose and hang funny. They are not attached to the rest of the strap and are not a loop like I'm used to.Overall, I'm very satisfied with this purchase. All of my gear fits in a compact bag."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for less","review":"I have been using this bag for a year now and it works fine. For the beginner photography who just wants to carry around there camera and lens plus the cords and a book or two, this bag is for you. Its very easy to organize everything, and with the deviators that are adjustable, it just makes it more easy to keep things where you want them. So if you dont have too much camera stuff and want a small easy bag, then this is for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good bag, but not enough space","review":"The Tamrac 3536 is a beautiful bag and the suede adds an air of professionalism to the package, however it's just far too small. I recently bought a D80 and with the stock lens with lens hood inserted into the bag with padded inserts intact, the lens would zoom out as I tried to remove the camera. I now store the lens hood elsewhere. Also, it does get quite packed once you add the charger and other items, so be careful.I did however use the bag in some fairly dirty environments, and it cleaned off perfectly with a damp cloth, so that's a pretty big plus for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Bag!!!","review":"This is a perfect size bag for all your needs.

While it's not as stealth as hoped, it still is a good looking bag. Plenty of room for Canon Rebel Xti and zoom, plus gadgets - Velcro dividers make it completely customizable. I like the side pocket for cell phone. Zippered compartment on flap is great for tickets, etc. Only drawback is the fact that it isn't waterproof, but the heavy bag it comes in works nicely for setting it down on wet bleachers. Handle on top is very convenient."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it's low price","review":"It's inexpensive and not even worth the price. It is entirely too small for a T2i and 75-300mm lens, it is such a tight squeeze, I'm afraid it'll mess up my fisheye lense. In the drawn dimensions it shows it has room for the camera with a mounted lens and and another lens with a filter and a flash or light meter but that drawing is just a drawing. Invest in something better, seriously."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deceptive!","review":"This bag is expressly advertised - via the provided cross-sectional of the bag - to fit not only a digital SLR camera with large lens attached, but also a flash unit, lots of pocket space for small things and two additional lenses. Nothing could be farther from the truth.This bag could barely fit my camera body with 14-16mm lens attached (not that big of a lens), much less any additional units. I attempted to fit my 430exII flash, a 35mm prime (small lens) and a 50mm prime (very small lens) - it wasn't close to fitting. Furthermore, as soon as you fill the bag up - the outer pockets become squished so you can't fit anything in them either.Get the larger bag."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Bag, but Small","review":"Ordered this bag for my Nikon D80, Since I only intend to cary one lens, sunshade and extra sd card, charger and usb cable I thought this would be fine and okay when I wanted to bring along the SB-800 speed light. Well this is not going to be the case. The bag it's self is nice enough but it just cant easily accomidate the robust body of the d80 if you want to bring anything else. I think if I dump everything else from the bag I may be able to fit the flash, camera and one lens (so no charger or cables) so I will probably keep it for quick trips where I wont be downloading or charging. If you have a similar sized DSLR and want to carry more than the absolute basics look for a larger bag."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good bag; not as big as they say.","review":"Bought it for a Nikon D40x.

It's clear that this movie was made \\"just for kids.\\" The exaggerated acting, slapstick humor, and tweedle-dee soundtrack make this a big disappointment if you watch it in the wrong mindset.

Other CG Cutters transport Royal Marines to the shores of Greenland to hold-off Nazi sympathizers from Denmark and Norway from establishing weather and communication stations.The book opens up a whole new history to the role the Coast Guard has played in our nation's past.

I called their customer service to ascertain what was done and they told me that it is done assembly line and they cannot tell if it was repaired or replaced or nothing was done.

Talk about weird... this certainly held the attention of a group of 17 & 18 year-olds, but not in the way that I had hoped. It was strange and had several inappropriate scenes. It is very frustrating as an English teacher to not be able to show what should be a classic, but is instead turned into... a horror film???

Just amazing. While I watched it, I remembered being in high school and reading the play for the first time. Most of the kids just weren't getting it. We had to read it and then talk about it. But if we had seen a production like this--I can't imagine every child not responding to what Shakespeare is all about!I will definitely be adding this DVD to my collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant.","review":"Saw this on PBS and WOW- just a brilliant adaption.

It is still fun and slightly creepy, though, and the author does avoid the more famous sea tales, such as the Mary Celeste, and sticks to stories the readers is less likely to have heard. Taken with a often large grain of salt, the tales ring true within the context of this book. The author does a good job setting the scene and telling the story, although so often ending the short narratives with a question can, at times, get a little grating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rehash from the 70's....","review":"Richard Winer is best known as the author of the Devil's Triangle books in the Devil's/Bermuda Triangle craze in the 1970's.

The James Brown side is horrendous-- it is just plain bad, and I will venture to say that it is bordering on racist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cold and clinical","review":"The Gershwin tracks are minimalist deconstructions sounding a bit clinical although they have their eerie and atmospheric phases. The James Brown interpretations have their amusing moments, especially in the audience participation and I suppose they go a long way to deconstructing James Brown' legendary Live At The Apollo set, but of course it lacks soulfulness, thereby completely missing out on the essence of James Brown's music. Maybe that is the point? The structure is there, but it's like a mere skeleton without the flesh of the soul, with the possible exception of Night Train which is quite rousing. I can't imagine this music having anything but an intellectual appeal. I prefer The Residents with Snakefinger doing their own stuff. The other album in this American Composer Series: Stars & Hank Forever, is more accessible and enjoyable.Stars & Hank Forever: The American Composers Series, Vol. II"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Resident's Miss Their Mark","review":"It is unfortunate that such a good idea as the Residents doing reworking of other's music did not work out any better than the first few cuts of the Stars and Hank recording. This recording, like Stars and Hank, was originally released as a plastic LP with one side being the George Gershwin and the other a reworking of the James Brown \\"Live at the Apollo\\".It starts out promising enough, with an air siren melding into the first few notes of George Gershwin's masterpiece \\"Rhapsody in Blue\\" (a decent job by the Residents). Unfortunately, the rest of the Gershwin works pale quickly.The James Brown side is amusing, for a bit... but never quite makes it as a decent parody of the works of that troubled artist.Two stars, but not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bit of a sorry CD!","review":"Bought this as I am a great Residents fan - but really don't know why they bothered issuing it.

I guess I just am left feeling let-down. I was not drawn into the story at all. In fact, I found the plot a little too predicitible. I also felt that Althea worried too much about her kids for almost half of the book. No real person worries that much and pushes off the man as many times as she did. I couldn't quite understand why Patrick kept coming back to her. It is a good book to read if you just want something for here and there, but don't waste your time if you want to get into the book and the characters.

It also clearly demonstrates the extent to which terrorism networks have developed and coordinated their strategies with the active participation of Iran and other government sponsors. After reading this it would be hard to support anything short of a multi-front comprehensive campaign to rid the world of ALL the players involved.

While many of the details in Bodansky's book are plausible, and even correspond with those of other authors, no footnotes are given throughout, and many details (such as Al Qaeda's possession of nuclear weapons) are highly suspect if not patently false. Bodansky portray's Bin Laden as largely a state-sponsored terrorist, and I think he fails utterly to show the grass roots genesis of Islamist resistance. In fact, most of the book isn't even on Bin Laden, save one chapter, and deals with background events of Islamist terrorism. Most damaging is Bodansky's failure to be transparent about his sources and convincing about his facts. A critical reader should suspect an agenda or ideological lens in this work that is absent from Bergen and Gunaratna."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bin Laden, The Man Who Delcared War on America","review":"I'm sorry I was forced to give this book one star--it deserves none.

This is a work of propaganda, freely mixing fact and fiction. The author, supposedly to protect sources, offers no references, which gives him a licence to confabulate, and is a cover for these confabulations. For instance, he inserts Iranian agents and efforts behind Bin-Laden at every step of the way.

It is easy for him to do that, since everything supposedly comes from \\"intelligence\\" sources which he cannot disclose, etc. But people with some knowledge of the topic soon realize that it is a mixture of accurate information and mere allegations. ...

Bodansky does not predict 9/11 but he sounds the alarm that \\"spectacular attacks\\" were in 1999, in the imminent future.No, it is not an easy read. Every page is full of facts.

Yet, Bodansky's web of global conspiracy hinges on untested assumptions and unverified claims stitched together by an Islamic-phobia that belongs in a previous century. Bodansky shows his analytical weakness by lumping together every so-called Islamist from the Maghreb to Mindanao in a mythical anti-Western crusade. Bodansky falls within a long line of so-called policy analysts who have invented the clash of civilizations thesis by promoting fear and demonizing the other. Osama Bin Laden is a terrorist, yet he is hardly the face nor mastermind of a world wide Islamist militant movement. He is an extremist, isolated by his theological and violent beliefs, with marginal support among the mainstream Muslim intelligentsia, professional groups, and working classes, dangerous to the West and the Muslim world equally."},{"rating":"1","title":"A fiction book","review":"I was astonished by the quantity of the information in this book that doesn't contain any sources or evidence.The only thing mentioned about sources is a few pages in the beginning saying that the writer got the information from many sources but due to secrecy, he can't reveal them.By going through half of the book, I stopped reading it.

This book is clearly the product of exhaustive research. It is not in any sense light reading and will mainly be of interest to people who already have quite a bit of knowledge about the militant Islamic jihadist movement. The book mainly focuses on the 1980's and 90's when the Islamic militant groups stepped up their operations, formed an internationale based in Khartoum, resolved differences between Shiites in Iran and Sunnis elsewhere, and decided in the 90's on a strategy to challenge the United States directly in the places where it is most vulnerable. It is amazing that Bodansky has managed to discover the detailed information he brings to this study, and one has to wonder if all of it is 100% accurate.

The author's obvious pro-Israel anti-Iran bias and total lack of documentation for fantastic claims of insider knowledge undermine the essence of the information contained in the book. Reading it, one wonders how an outsider, a Jew and a representative of the US government can get detailed accounts of insider meetings of terrorist organizations. We're told to trust him, he has to protect the sources. Sorry, but without documentation, there is no factual basis to judge this book on. His bizzare theories with regard to TWA 800 are offered with little understanding of explosive physics and no documentation whatsoever.Any valid information in the book is undermined by flawed and undocumented claims elsewhere. There are far better researched and documented books on Bin Ladin available."},{"rating":"2","title":"6600 GT","review":"I upgraded from the 5500 for World of Warcraft and the new graphics are amazing.

The video seems to record fine, but there are usally at least 2 audio dropouts on every DVD I burn :( Since burning DVDs from my camcorder using the iLink connection feature was the main reason why I bought this unit, I am very disappointed. I can, however, burn DVDs using the standard composite RCA cable connector cables. This is the first Sony product I've ever bought that had any kind of issue at all. What a bummer. Sony's quality assurance testing group was obviously asleep at the wheel during testing. How about ensuring that the product works before you market and sell it to the public?

Basically don't buy this if you like Alter Bridge, you'll be horrible dissapointed. A little too radio-friendly rock, which wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't so darned boring and not catchy in the least.

The overall effect, however, is not the boring treatise one might expect. Instead, the author delivers a lively work that is more a trade title on homesteading than a research report. This is a fascinating study of the individuals and groups who are drawn to the roots of urban civilization, complete with romantic misconceptions, hard-edged political values, escapes from the rat race, and the appeal of nature. As much as is possible with this social segment, descriptions and measurements are included, as well as individual anecdotes -- sometimes humorous, sometimes grim -- that put life and meaning into the search for agrarian fulfillment."},{"rating":"2","title":"EASY TO UNDERESTAND THE WALLSTREET CRISIS","review":"WITH THE UNIQUE AND BRIGHT BACKGRAOND OF N.FERGUSON, THE PBS DOCUMENTARY EXPLAINS A LOT OF THE REAL ROOOTS OF WERE ARE WE IN THE CRISIS.THE HISTORY IS VERY WELL EXPLAIN AND THE VISUALS ARE REALLY EXCELLENT.IT IS VERY USEFULL FOR THE EXPERTS AND THE LAYMAN.IT IS FUN AND IS INSTRUCTIVE WITH OUT THE EXPERT LENGUAJE OF THE BOOK."},{"rating":"1","title":"Official Propaganda","review":"I watched this program on PBS.

This is a really horrific piece of propaganda from the ever declining BBC. I doubt very much that the documentary writers were ignorant to the basic, simple mechanism of the fractional reserve system (whereby banks, rather than lend you money that they already have, create it out of thin air!), so my conclusion is that they have purposefully ommitted such a discussion to divert people from the real problem.

The third one stopped working two days after I received it. Two of the phones I've been through also had a few buttons stop working (the back button and the right arrow button).

He is not a computer programer and is not invloved in computer issues. Why is it that these same people say Grant Jeffery is qualifed? Does Jeffery have any more experience than Hank? I found this book refreshing in a few ways. 1)Unlike the normal accusations thrown, Hank looks at and critiques the veiws of men that he respects and says they are wrong in their views. Normally people say he only attacks Charimatics (which he doesn't) and people of the Faith movement (in that he only attacks theology, not the people themselves); 2) This book (unlike Jeffery's) is well documented making it easy to double check Hanks finding.

Unfortunately, this item is not made well and I cannot recommend for any use. Within 24 hours of purchase, the original light bulb burnt out. I replaced the bulb, but found that the florescent light would now constantly flicker. I think the problem was that the battery contacts aren't tight against the batteries, as I whenever I moved the unit, the light would flicker on and off. Also, you can't use both the florescent and flashlight at the same time (not a big deal to me, but maybe for others). I ended up returning this light.

A couple months later I decided to fix it. After tinkering with my volt meter for a while I thought that the switch may be bad, but then I discovered that the only problem was that the batteries weren't in tight enough to have all of the contacts touching.I fixed it by removing the batteries and bending the contacts in the bottom of the battery compartment up with a screwdriver. I didn't have to bend them very far and it fixed the problem. The batteries are now snug and it works. I assume that I will have to repeat this process once they become loose again.

While I know that casting on the Spiderman sequel has begun and rumors of the sequel's story lines use the traditional, original villains that many of us grew up with. I hope that down the road that movie producers will have the insight to do at least one film about Venom and Spidey."},{"rating":"1","title":"A ho-hum Spider-Man book...","review":"I'm going back to read all the Marvel books (I have just recently completed my collection), and will post reviews on all of them for people who still care.Fist up is Spider-Man: Venom Factor by Diane Duane. This is not a good book to start off on, but oh well. This book is bland and, worst of all, boring to boot. The action scenes are poorly done and not at all exciting, and the \\"character development\\" scenes between Peter and Mary-Jane consist of talking, eating, and having sex....not necessarily in that order. Yes, we know they are a married couple who are attracted to each other, but we don't need their ... ...high school-ish innuendos every time they speak to each other. There are better books for you to read then this one. AND this is just the first in a LOOSELY tied together trilogy that doesn't get much better from here...sigh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spidey fans MUST BUY!","review":"This is an awesome book!

I found myself unable to put this book down, and plowed through the 300+ pages in only a few days. Bonnell is a very insightful and careful scholar, who does an excellent job decoding the visual language of Soviet propaganda posters. In the process, she transcends the apparent limitations of the subject matter: by the end of the book, I felt that I had gained a greater ability to understand visual symbolism in general, and also understood a great deal more about Soviet history and the process of collectivization.If you have any interest in contemporary Soviet history, I'd highly recommend this book. I hope that Victoria Bonnell continues her great scholarship!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Jermaine Collection","review":"Forget Arista's too short Heritage Collection, this is the one Jermaine Jackson collection to own.

I loved her other books, the circle etc. However I was extremely disappointed with this one. The examples/teachings are too airy to me. There is little if any practical guidance on how to use the intuition specifically for guiding you to the love of your life. The examples provided are questionable. You are told of examples where people made a choice based on their intuition, but never told how they got to that choice, or what made them choose that choice over the others. Sure some turned out ok (and I bet those are the ones in this book) but you never hear about the ones that didn't etc. Not convinced by this book but thought I share for what its worth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Insider's View Of Second City","review":"For the first time ever, Second City allowed cameras to film the process of creating a revue.

The writing is lazy. He is also too crass at times. I thought it was stupid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Poor Presentation of the Topic","review":"While this DVD course has much interesting material, the presentation given by the instructor is unsatisfactory. The instructor simply reads from his notes. There are very very few graphics supporting this (even simple power point slides are missing for the most part). The camera wobbles back and forth as it tries to follow the instructor rocking back and forth. This would be an excellent resource if the production company would simply use the narration given by the instructor and replace the video portion with supported graphics to support the topic and details.

The snare and tom tom drums flies off after every hit leaving me to always have to connect it again. The electronic panel worked only for the first night and stopped, and the headset doesn't work.This toy is not suited for 2 yr old. I don't know what purpose it serves because a one year old would probably only bounce it over because of how frail it is.

I am very dissapointed with this little tikes product. Don't waste your time or money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Idea - Lousy Quality","review":"We bought my son for his 2nd birthday the keyboard set, and he also received this drum set. The drum set is really colorful and bright - and it is a great idea. BUT it is a piece of junk! Every time my son would play, the drums that were on the side kept falling off. Eventually they BROKE off, so that I couldn't fix them. He had it for 2 days before it broke. Not worth it. The keyboard is okay, but again the stand falls apart easy and the microphone stand cracked off. Really a disappointment.

Not recommended. Shame on Little Tykes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy!!!","review":"I heartily agree with all the other reviews-do NOT buy this drum set.

It is the flimsiest and most unstable toy and I can not believe that Little Tikes allows their name on it. The side drums do not stay on, the plastic pieces broke in 1 day, and the foot drum thing when pressed make the whole set fall over. The most frustrating thing about it is that after you have to take it away from your child any try to explain why they can't keep it, is that the concept of this toy is great. If a quality drum set like this could be made with the music and lights etc. it would be great. I haven't found any other drum set that's really appropriate for a 2yr old.My son also received a Little Tikes CD Player with two microphones for his birthday and they literally worked for 1 minute. After that only the CD worked and not the microphones. Both of these toys have the Little Tikes name but are actually manufactured by another company.

We saw the Little Tikes name and knew their reputation and we very excited about this item. I wrote to Little Tikes and informed them hoping for some sort of refund or something.

Well, let me tell you, there was nothing updated about it. It uses computer and word processing terminology from the early 1980's. In the section which talks about what the freelance writer needs to get his/her business off the ground, it tells the reader that you can get a good computer for around $2,500! Personal computers havent cost that much since the late 1980's!! These are just a couple of examples, but the book is filled with 1980's references. You can tell that a proof-reader simply read through the original copy and missed such references. Then, the publisher gave it a new cover, and sent it back to press! Overall, I found this book to be a pile of badly outdated references and advice which is useless in 2005!

This author is so careless in her story telling which is sad because the fundamental plot is such a good one. However, dialogue is stiff and falls erringly on the ear. You know no one speaks like that. The characters are shallow and only knowable on the most technical and superficial level. What makes a good or great detective story is a good plot plus exquisite attention to the details. Whoever edited Sun Storm for Ms. Larsson has done her a great disservice.

Creative ideas mashed with old, many times seen tricks.When you think of Sweden you don't imagine rigid evangelicals, and that is the surprising twist in this story. What is much less surprising is the cardboard characters of the pastors and the faithful. I very mich dislike evangelical fanatics, but even so, they are much more complex bunch that Ms. Larsson gives them credit.Little more originality and little less worn cliches would make this novel better and our experience richer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Choppy writing and unlikable characters","review":"Maybe this book lost a lot in the translation, but this book comes across as written by an author who has no idea how people interact with one another. The relationship bewteen Rebecca and Saana is stilted and the dialouge is awful.The basic plot is okay, but I suspect part of the author's message is to bash Christian fundamentalists. Ultimately the idea that 3 people acted together is too unbelievable. Very surprising that this book won an award. The final suggestion of a relationship between Rebecca and her boss is also pretty ridiculous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing and beware","review":"I purchased this book as one of the Top 10 Swedish Crime Novels.

Based in a small coal mining town in Pennsylvania, the material and emotional hardships of the coal mining community play a big part in this story. Shae-Lynn is a tough but maybe not so strong woman trying to come to terms with the choices she made as a young girl/woman having to deal with an abusive father, witnessing her mother's death and bringing up her younger sister. The cast of characters in the book from Shae-Lynn herself to EJ, Pamela, Clay and esp. Fanci & Kenny will stay with you for a long time. Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"O'Dell Pleases Again","review":"Tawni O'Dell again gives us an incredible book about incredible characters. Each character has a small story that makes the big picture that much better. O'Dell's best trait is that her vivid detail makes the reader see out of the colorful Shae-Lynn's eyes. Also, she makes the reader truly care about the town of Jolly Mount, which is no easy task. Two thumbs way up, can't wait for her next book!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good chick lit.","review":"If you like this genre, this a well-written example of this type of writing. I especially liked that the author didn't use the \\"leave you hanging and switch to a new story line\\" trope. I think this hackneyed trick is a substitute for good writing and is very annoying. The protagonist, Shae-Lynn, is a well drawn figure who faces life with wit and charm as she tries to understand why her long lost sister suddenly reappears after disappearing years ago. Her sassy style, despite abuse, abandonment and exploitation is refreshing. A fast read that will keep the pages turning."},{"rating":"2","title":"HONK!","review":"Our family loves the music to HONK! and the fact that the only recording is from our area makes it even more interesting since my children know some of the actor from the show.

If this doesn't work, I will either be requesting a refund of my money or, if Sony refuses to do so, initiating legal action against them to recover my money.

The upconversion for DVDs presented such a clear picture. The built-in Dolby decoder was also a plus since I owned an older Sony AV receiver that was Dolby Digital-Ready.

It is not organized very logically, spending long periods of time obsessing over hand-drawn formulas that are clearly the work of an intelligent man but not very pragmatic or applicable to \\"building your own wine cellar,\\" which is ostensibly the purpose of the book.

My wife really frowned upon the idea of digging up the front yard to lay down a plastic barrier. When I suggested we drill into the concrete floor to create a dry-well, she took my last bottle of Haut Brion, poured it into the pasta sauce and said, \\"There- no need for a cellar now do we?\\" The book was over the top, scared the ba-gee-bees out of me and still, after 2 years of thinking about it, I haven't built the cellar.

Assembling it to the tongue was easy with one exception: the handle must be screwed on and it requires a metric socket to do it. The other bolts and nuts use SAE.

On the positive side, it is a refreshingly honest depiction of an intimate relationship, spliced with some OK-ish music and a few brief, stunningly beautiful scenes of Antarctica.What will the film be remembered for though? The sex of course, which is certainly every bit as explicit as you've heard.Apart from a few amusing snippets of dialogue, I didn't particularly warm to the characters though. Matt is pretty dull and doesn't come over as intellectual enough to convince as a scientist, whereas Lisa is selfish, concerned primarily with her own pleasure.Michael Nyman's piano piece was good (but irritatinly truncated). So what is there after the shock value of the sex? Not a huge amount.I expect viewers will buy this out of curiosity.

There is passion, lust, pleasure, mild bondage, explicit ejaculation, and lots of kissing. The fact that this is a British film of essentially, a series of erotic sequences, interspersed with episodes of rock concerts, is novel in itself. The episodes in Antarctica offer the visual and even conceptual expanse, to contrast with the enclosed environment of his apartment and the almost claustrophobic atmosphere of Brixton's sweaty rock concert hall. It is certainly about love and how it can be expressed through mutually satisfying - that is to say, \`good' - sex.Ian Hunter.Author of \`e-Love'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Calling this art?!!","review":"I am generally fond of most movies many critics find fault with... However on this one I have to agree with the majority of the negative reviews I have read. The acting (Or attempt at being real and true to life.) is horrible. Although I will say that Kieran O'Brien is relatively natural in his role, Margo Stilley however should be banned from going in front of a camera for the rest of her life... Yes it was that bad. And as far as those of you looking for a erotic film, look elsewhere because there is nothing overly erotic about this film and you would be better purchasing an adult video, nor is there anything remotely groundbreaking or artistic. All you have is two people on screen whose attempts at improvisation are juvenile at best. I hate to be so critical of a film especially when the director was truly trying for something new and special, it's just unfortunate how he fell so far short."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth my time","review":"My husband recommended this movie to me while he was deployed, so I purchased and watched it. First of all, there is practically no storyline. It's like a bad porn movie without the pornographic aspect of it. Yes, there are explicit sex scenes in this movie, and on first glance, that's what appealed to my husband. But, the characters are awful, the storyline is non-existent...even the soundtrack is bad.

The music is murkily shot from the cheap seats, the presumably high resolution video photography doesn't seem very high-res at all, and the two young people just aren't very interesting as movie characters. The girl is kind of cute, I'll give the movie that, and some genuine steaminess seeps into the proceedings here and there. But the smattering of good sex is done in by inane acting, frequent dull stretches, and mostly unmemorable music. If sexy indie film fare is your occasional cup of tea, you could do a lot better.

I like the idea of using real sex to tell a story- if it a story worth telling.This movie has no story. This movie has no characters really, simply songs and sex.This movie could've worked had there been an actual script, character development, and some cinematography. There was none of that.The concert scenes were uninteresting. The sex scenes were cold and yet the audience is supposed to believe that Matt actually loves Lisa. There's no emotion between the two, no sense of attachment, no feeling that they even like each other.Many people argue that this movie isn't porn but I completely disagree. I think the director had a vision that was good in his head but failed on screen. There are far sexier, more erotic, more romantic movies out there and I'd highly recommend you not waste your money to see what the hoopla was all about it because that's all there is to this movie- sensationalism."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time :(","review":"Was VERY disappointed in this film when I saw it in the theater. I was excited about the bands, because I LOVE most of the bands featured here, but the way it was filmed, I could not even get into the concert footage. So grainy and amateurishly filmed...And the sound was so bad, I was shocked. :( I do not object to the basic idea of the film, but it just needed to be more interestingly presented with a genuine story with characters that we care about that just happened to have both elements(sex and music) in it. ZZZ...So what about the \\"real\\" sex. It's TEDIOUS because it's real. It made me feel very detached while watching it.

It has been a belief of mine that some men can be more \\"sensitive\\" in relationships than women are. Don't get me wrong... women are vocal and animated about such subjects... but a lot of men are more broken up and devastated about an ending relationship than women.

Ok, maybe it does deserve some attention because of the explicit sex scenes, but if that's what you want to see you might as well buy some quality porn. Anyway, even these \\"hot\\" moments tend to be rather tedious in the long run. The music is ok, but doesn't justify buying the DVD - buy the actual music instead.

Hardly believe that such relationship will be remembered in a couple years - memories will be melted away with the next spring waters. Even rock music (which is also pretty averaged) , cocaine and explicit details doesn't add emotions to this plain, causal, pointless movie. Another example that if a person have nothing to say - no tricks will make his creation an Art."},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty cool","review":"nine songs is not great art, but it is historic insofaras it pushes the boundaries of conventional cinema.

Between hard-ons and concerts, the film is boring. But this is my point of view."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too soft to be porn, too hard to pay attention","review":"This is a story of images. The dialog consists of about 2 pages worth of material so don't expect there to be a lot of talking. The run down is basically Sex, concert, sex, concert, sex, concert.Admittedly the sex scenes are pretty sweet and filled with tender moments. They are tastefully if explicitly done. You really get the sense that you're watching a real couple make love, at times it feels almost voyeuristic and wrong.Sadly there is not much in the way of plot to this movie, and the concert scenes end up feeling more like filler material than actually contributing in a meaningful way to the film. I wouldn't recommend buying this film, if you're really intent on seeing it I would suggest to rent it. Weighing in at only 69 minutes long it's hardly worth spending more than 5 dollars for this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is it porn or just sex","review":"I have to admit, the story line of the movie the first time I watched it totally escaped me. It seemed to be a gradual build up of moderate sex scenes to completely explicit sex scenes and not much in between except for some noise which is passed off as music.Nevertheless I give it four stars because it does not pretend to be either pure porn or a story of pathos and deep emotion. It is just a series of increasingly explicit sex scenes and as such, since it is available on the non 'adult' market, it deserves four stars. If you enjoy watching sex between 'legitimate' actors where you see penetration and other fun stuff, this is a good movie. If you appreciate good music - forget it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never realized sex, drugs, and rock & roll could be so dull","review":"This film consists of nothing more than explicit sex scenes alternating with live concert footage intending to tell the story of a young British scientist's (Kieran O'Brien) brief, physically intense affair with an American woman (Margo Stilley). Unfortunately, I didn't like any of the music. More unfortunately, I didn't find either of the principle actors attractive, so I didn't like the sex either. What's left? Well, there are some nice shots of a man walking across the ice in Antarctica. For me, this was a colossal failure, albeit a brave experiment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great sex, awful movie","review":"I'm not sure what the difference is between a porno flick and a legitimate movie. Supposedly legitimate films have a plot. This movie claims to have a plot but it's hard to find. We know almost nothing about the characters, or how they got together or why they're together and through the course of the movie we never do learn anything about them except they love to have sex. We don't have any compelling reason to care about either of them. I guess this is considered an art film because the lighting is bad, it especially gets bad during the explicit sex scenes. The story consists of having sex intermixed with rock concert scenes. Somewhere in there they insert a few minutes of some kind of documentary with clips of Antarctica. The bottom line is the director did a great job of capturing some pretty hot and explicit sex that's better than most porno films but like porno films the plot is hard to find."},{"rating":"1","title":"9 songs","review":"The video quality is good.

It was one of those books that get you caught up in and can't stop reading. It is a part of history that I think is not being read enough by our younger generation on what happened a little over fifty years ago. What stood out was the immense loss of life that was envolved and still the ability to go on in such a manner.

Envy of the author, and trying to make light of all his values. Clancy obviously values the armed servants of his country high and I fail to see why this is cause for diverse derisive comments about him as a person.Mind you, I haven't read all of this, I could't stand to. I think the Clancy books stand on their own, without anyone having to do their best clobbering him for his great writing.Read a Clancy book and form your own opinion, don't buy this highly colored collection of defamatory sentences."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coherent and Interesting","review":"A acquired this book a while ago from a local used book shop, and only afterward read the comments by the previous reviewer. After that, I dispaired of opening its covers.But was I in for a surprise. The book is lucid, coherent, and engaging. It is well written, at times amusing, and if you let it, thought provoking. I can hardly believe that the previous reviewer actually read the same book; if I were the editor of a soft porn press, I would dismiss this book out of hand: there can't be more than 3 erotic words in the entire book. It's focus is decidedly fixed on time-travel, what it means to be human, and the results of the loss of free will. Of course, it's extremely difficult to really thoroughly deal with such topics on under 250 pages, but Wallace does an admirable job in opening the window."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dr. Orpheus?

This long interview with him takes you on a journey beyond his charming wit and storytelling.Clower, in his modesty and ole boy ways, belies how fascinating his own story is. Stepping beyond the yarns he spins on stage, he takes you on a trip through the South and introduces you to a string of people he has met along the way.Join Jerry in a chat with William Faulkner or Will Davis Campbell (Will D. Campbell, author of Brother to a Dragonfly).Take a nostalgic visit to Jerry and Homerline when they were tenants at primitive artist Theora Hamblett's home in Oxford, Mississippi.Clower loves to tell a story and he's made a career out of doing it well.

She wanted a drum set, and I didn't want to spend a lot of money on one. My daughter enjoyed pounding on the drums, but the drums are not of great quality and the electronic crash of a cymbal or thump of a drum pad is hardly heard above the din of a wooden drumstick against hard plastic. The unit is top-heavy and can easily be bumped and fall over. The footpad is essentially useless. In sum, I should have either paid more money to get a nice Yamaha electronic drumset, or a real drumset, or just forestalled the decision entirely. After I couldn't take the rukkus of my kids pounding (not playing) with the thing, I hauled it up to the attic and there it's been ever since.

Ticonderoga. He places the Fort on the Hudson River. (????) Ft. Ticonderoga, so important a location in the French/Indian and Revolutionary wars is, in fact, on Lake Champlain. Mr. Lengel also incorrectly writes that Henry Knox, after retrieving the cannons from Ft. Ticonderoga takes them down the Hudson. This too is incorrect. Knox and his men took the cannons across land to Lake George (which was frozen in winter), down to Lake George village and south to Albany before turning east to Boston.

The book started out with a dramatic story of a risky encounter that 72 year old Nuland had on a subway and since I am also 72, the author had my full attention. Unfortunately, the book went downhill a bit from that point on. Some sections were very informative but others were much too wordy. I found myself wishing that Nuland's editor had taken on a more assertive role in shortening and in some cases rewriting certain passages. Overall, the book didn't quite meet my high expectations."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't waste your money.","review":"This book offers no new insights biologically or philosophically for living through the final years of life.

I was so intrigued with parts of it after listening that I purchased a used copy through Amazon. Perhaps it is a little wordy at times, as other reviewers have noted, but you get the sense of man with a great vocabulary, a brilliant mind, and a certain style of writing that shines with a genuine caring for people.In my opinion, chapter six alone is worth the price of the book. Through a series of letters written to an older widow, the author addresses the topic of depression and aging in a way that is tender, thoughtful and incredibly respectful of this woman's point of view. If you are a person facing the changes associated with aging yourself, or know of a friend or family member who may be having difficulty with some of the issues we will all face sooner or later, I highly recommend this book as a guide in shaping a realistic, yet positive outlook on the aging process."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little disappointing","review":"Some of this is useful..

And, as if that wasn't enough, Van Veeteren is due to go into hospital for a serious operation and is facing his own mortality. Nesser is an excellent writer. This is a clever and brilliantly plotted book that spans twenty years, but it is the character of Van Veeteren which is really special. He's slightly glum but with a great sense of understated humour. He's also realistic about justice, without being totally cynical.
