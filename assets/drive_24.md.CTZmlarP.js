The guitar work shows great touch throughout, perfectly complementing John Mayall's distinctive and apt vocals.\\"Subtle\\", \\"fluid\\" and \\"sublime\\" are words that spring to mind even before the agonisingly beautiful guitar solo that starts at 1 minute into the song and stretches your emotions for another 1 minute 15 seconds or so. Mick Taylor makes the Les Paul cry, and if you allow yourself to be immersed in its gentle wailing it is hard not to be moved, too.Spoil yourself with this masterpiece which is performed with sheer genius."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well made, compact storage sleeves","review":"I've transitioned to the jewel sleeves several years ago, and I find the sleeves to be very well made, and compact.The one problem I have is finding something to store them in other than the storage chests the manufacturer sells.

Normally I would be dragging doing something like that. Since then, I use it to lift my energy - 2 per day in the morning. This doesn't make me nauseated if I take on an empty stomach either.

Spelling errors in a SAT prep book!","review":"The Sparknotes webpage is an excellent resource, so I figured their book on the SAT would be just as good. Nope. As it turns out, they know nothing about the SATs. I've taken a few practice SATs and know the feel for the real test, and Sparknotes does not prepare you.Its fill-in-the-blanks are incredibly hard, and not just in a challenging way. The real SAT will never have any questions like they do. If you crave hard questions that are like those on the test, get the Kaplan book SAT 1600. Also, in the Reading Comprehension section, the questions are ridiculously easy, which is not how the real SAT works. And then, there are numerous spelling errors, and literally a hundred words with no spaces. (e.g., howdo )To top it all off, when referring to passages, it always gives the wrong line number. This completely ruins your test-taking experience, because you are forced to find the word or words yourself.Don't buy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Informative and well written","review":"This book feels like sitting with Neil Gunn and sharing a wee dram as he relates the history of whisky and extols its virtues. The reader learns how the manufacturing of good whisky is fundamentally at odds with modern means of production. This is a delightful read and a must for anyone with an interest in whisky, especially Single Malt Whisky. Gunn's writing is fine, though the conversational tone of the book may put off some fans of Gunn's fiction. The beautiful prose of Highland River is replaced by a warm and inviting conversational tone. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"beefy switch","review":"I searched all the auto parts stores around where I live in San Diego and all they had to offer in the way of an electrical current \\"on-off\\" switch was the type with a green plastic knob.

This knife switch has a visual confirmation that the current is either \\"on\\" or \\"off\\". When the green plastic knob type fails there is no visual clue so you have to go through a sequence of disconnecting electrical connections and eliminating possible culprits. A real pain in the you-know-what. If you are in need of this type of switch, do yourself a big favor. Pay a little more and get a LOT more...performance.

A lot of the information about servers and networking goes way over your head unless you already know about the topic, and about half the info on networking is just touched on superficially on the exam.

While a network engineer may scoff at the networking chapters, it does seem to cover the topics required for the exam. From a programmer's perspective, the HTML and programming chapters are poorly done. According to the author's bio, this is a book written by a person with networking experience, but very little programming experience, and it shows.This book is useful as a review of information you have learned elsewhere if you approach it with the goal of finding all of the errors.

I've looked at the ones currently out there, and this book unfortunately, does not meet many of the mapped objectives. For example, the over emphasis of Networking seems to be about an introduction course the the Cisco CCNA rather than the book trying to give an overview of the CIW objectives. Subsequently, because of the undue weightage, the other objectives suffer, and notably, the HTML section which is briefly skimmed through.While this book might give some additional info for those who have an added interest in networking, nevertheless, I feel that there are other books out there that give much more networking info and cost the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long Knife order through amazon","review":"This is a wonderful book about Meriweather Clark.

Forget it, the suction is so bad it won't pick up a crumb on the floor.I am very sorry I bought this vacuum.

Incidentally, we used a Dyson DC07 for 3 years until it became too expensive to repair."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pricey, but good","review":"We have two and have given 2-3 as gifts. Everyone loves them. They are solid and sturdy. Just the right weight. So far, no rusting or chipping. They feel good and are easy to use.The crackers work much better than the ones we've had for 30 years (and which probably cost 99 cents at the time). There is no wobble in the hinge and the large middle cracking area is perfect for just cracking crab and lobster legs without crushing them.The picks are well made. The forked design works much better than the curved single-tine picks and the spoon scoop end easily finishes the job.This set is expensive. Many sets are available for half or less. That's the reason for only 4 stars. I have not compared the quality of the cheaper sets, so maybe these are really worth the extra. I'm glad we have them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Functional and Stylish!","review":"I cook a lot of Alaskan King Crab Legs so was looking for something to give my hands a break.

I don't need, much less \\"enjoy,\\" this kind of graphic fantasy. After all, there's only so much any author can do with the same graphic details of gay sex before it all blurs into the usual \\"oh.\\" After the third instalment, I tossed the book.If you want extremely graphic gay porn in narrative, this \\"trash\\" or \\"tintilation\\" might appeal to you.

But even his spin on thirty gay fantasies wasn't going anywhere with me -- fast."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"This is a great lip balm with no scent or flavor, other then a slight beeswaxy aroma that disappears shortly after application. The formula itself is more 'waxy' then 'slick', but in no way does it ever feel like this heavily coats my lips. The balm partially sinks into my lips, and partially remains on top to continue moisturizing.

Prepare to spend a lot of time breathing out fear, repeating mantras and intentions, envisioning light flowing into you from the universe, etc. I'm not trying to critique others' beliefs, but they should let you know in the ads that this aspect is so prominent in what is supposed to be a workout video.I'm a fairly advanced user, very active with a lot of cardio and yoga experience. I would not recommend this for beginners - it's hardly a workout, but the moves are confusing. The camera work is terrible, with narcissitic close-ups when they should be showing you moves. You often can't see what they're doing & the verbal cues are useless. Whether they call the workout hip-hop or caberet, the music is always non-stop Indian drumming with no variety among 4 workouts.

The dance steps are taught a little fast at first but after a few attemps it is not hard to follow. I like the yoga sections that are incoporated into the routine. I have found that if you want to make the ab section more challenging substitute a weighted ball for the beach body squishy ball used and you will increase the intensity. Over-all this is a good series. I have already bought several others and have a fun time when I use these videos.

Those are all the same exercises I've been told to do for ages and I hate them but they're here in Yoga Booty Ballet. One of the DVDs is more of a herky jerky dance dvd, but it all leads back to the same old exercises at the end. On top of it all, the music is dull and rather off beat most of the time.I believe this workout will produce results if done continually because it IS filled with a lot of the moves we already know to be affective, but this is not a fun, innovative, energy filled dvd.

I remember some of the great classic images,cinematography, and acting, and see them in my mind. Great collection. The only draw back is that some of the soundtracks are not the original ones, but the memory is still there."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is an intensely Irish story and a good read!","review":"Although this book is wordy -- the prose is poetic in some places -- it's a wonder to read. Williams portrays the intense emotionalism of the Irish with a flourish. The characters and problems are of the real world, the miracles are not, especially the miracle of love. Yet these two worlds drift and blend together in a world entirely Irish. I enjoyed the book very much."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best love story and so much more","review":"I read a borrowed copy of this book some years ago but never forgot it as I so often do. Recalling it recently, I decided that I must purchase it and see if it still resonated. Not disappointed, I once again devoured the parallel stories of these lovers. (They don't meet until near the end of the book!) The characters are so beautifully drawn and their stories so compellingly written, that the final chapters are deliciously satisfying. The descriptions of the Irish countryside and moody seascapes perfectly enrich this lovely tale."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lyrical prose in narrative form","review":"Niall Williams captures the heart of all who struggle to examine themselves. In this particular work, he brings forth such imagery that the reader cannot help to be transcended to that particular moment and the feelings that he wants his readers to feel are evoked with these ease of master's paintbrush. The literary piece is truly masterful yet in some instances difficult to follow as the character's lives are interwoven like bits of thread in a gallant tapistry. Once immersed in the character's lives, a hunger emerges to read on and discover their outcome. I found it like lyrical prose in narrative form, he is truly an artist!! I look forward to reading more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starts great - ends with a wimper","review":"I thought I was liking this book, but the more I read, I just wasn't sure.

For my taste - far too many words to say little."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring, boring, boring","review":"I am sorry to say this after reading some of the glowing reviews from other readers, but I felt this book took itself way too seriously. The author felt the need to over analyze every situation and turn every sentence into a imagery- filled masterpiece. All the author ended up doing was writing a boring book that I forced myself to finish. When done, I asked myself, \\"Why did I waste my time?\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Judge This Book By Its Cover","review":"What an incredible book! I first picked up Four Letters because of its stunning cover and from the first line found myself lost in it. Williams is a talented novelist, and while I didn't want Four Letters of Love to end, I couldn't put it down. The characters and plot are rich, the story well-developed. Though the stories are all different, this book would be idea for anyone who enjoyed The English Patient or Remains of the Day. (This rarely happens for me with a book, but as I read I could see the story on a movie screen. Let's hope Hollywood treats this one well!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Trys to hard","review":"Niall Williams admits in the interview he tried to make every sentence perfect in an attempt to get this book published. As I writer myself, I know that you can try too hard and rewrite too many times. Williams' writing and sentence structure taken in small doses are dazzling but grouped too closely together, the shine is lost. The plot and characters are also veiled by the flowery, gem-like sentences one after another. As for the ending, it lacked a strong finish to satisfy the imagination."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magical","review":"Wonderful characters, stories within stories.

The book does a fantastic job in describing wolf life- and making the reader fall in love with the characters. The book keeps your attention well throughout the whole book- and you really care about what happens to these amazing wolves.

U gotta read it!","review":"Ok, oh my gosh. This book was really good! I think the ending was happy/sad becasue i wanted him to join the pack. I cried when they sadi they were gonna put Kapu in a Zoo. I would reccomend that kids in the 6th grade and over read this book, it may be somewhat hard to follow. This book got me thinking of animal rights (when they caught capu and held him captive) i dont use makeup tested on animals. Or shampoo. You should read this book- It feels like you are there, part of the pack. You feel the emotions- its very strong. Every time i read this book i always cry when Kapu gets trapped! it ThAt good.

My mom would call me to dinner but I would be so lost in the world of the wolfs I wouldn't even hear her.I read the other books in the trillogy, but this one was different. This one showed you the life of the wolfs through thier eyes. I almost cried when the pups died.Don't take my advice. Read the book for yourself. I am positive you will love these books if you like wolfs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting book about wolves","review":"The thing that I liked about the book was the wolf. I liked the book too because my uncle had a wolf before and it reminded me of that wolf. I liked it too, because it was really interesting. The best part was when the lady let the wolf go to its family pack. The reason I liked this part the best was because the wolf needed to be with his family instead of with humans. Wolves have to have their own family and protect their siblings.I would recommend this book to anyone who likes to read about wolves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another winner","review":"Kat Martin delivers with this new book.

Can't wait for the next book by Martin."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING BORING BORING","review":"Don't waste your time reading this book. It was very predictable. It just seemed to drag on and on. It seems like Kat Martin took ideas from other books and put them into this one. It gets boring to read the same old stuff written over and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down!","review":"Reading Kat Martin again was a real pleasure. The story of Kitt and Clay was really intriguing with the twists and turns. When two people meet and there is an instant flaring of the senses, you know that it is only a matter of time before the sparks fly and passion ignites. This was the kind of book I just couldn't put down. I read it in line at the supermarket, gas station and even at a long red light.I am really looking forward to her next book. Fanning the Flame that is due to be released in August 2002. Way to go, Kat. Keep 'em coming."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where Was the Author?","review":"Kat Martin has written some very good books. This book is not one of them. It has neither well-developed characters (to call them one-note would be giving them more resonance than they have) nor a credible plot. Good cookbooks have more genuine passion. I hope she was producing (not writing) this disappointment while on autopilot thinking about a forthcoming novel worty of her skills."},{"rating":"1","title":"yawn","review":"I am a total Kat Martin fan. I absolutley love her, but the problem with this book, is that it goes no where! I can barely turn the pages without falling asleep. Her best book, by far, was Devil's Prize. It was packed with drama, some mystery, and suspense! This book was just too boring for my taste!"},{"rating":"1","title":"More like \\"The Fire Died\\"","review":"I read Hot Rain, Martin's contemporary romance, so I wasn't expecting much in the way of plot. However, the characters in Hot Rain did maintain great chemistry, which unfortunately was not the case for The Fire Inside. The hero and heroine begin with a sizzle, even though their verbal battles weren't near as fascinating to me as other reviewers seemed to find them (The heroine says \\"You're incorrigable!\\" several times throughout the book). The chemistry dies off about halfway through the book, and to make it worse, the heroine is a complete [...]. I had to throw the book down when Kitt came breezing back to London expecting Clay to simply forgive and forget the fact she had left for months on end without an explanation. I can't tell you how the book ended (I couldn't bear to finish it), but I can probably guess. If you're in the mood for a coookie-cutter romance, go ahead, but I felt compelled to warn everyone..."},{"rating":"1","title":"ANOTHER NO-SOUND VICTIM","review":"I ordered JOHNNY LEGEND'S DEADLY DOUBLES VOL 2 because a previous commentator wrote that themanufacturer had stopped sending out defective copies with no sound for Murder in the Red Barn.Not so.

If you like the genre you're bound to know at least half the people who play along with John on this album, all of them \\"name\\" talents in their own right. I picked this up on a whim since I'm a fan of Shannon Curfman, and had heard of John Mayall but had never listened to him, I was VERY happy to discover just how good the entire package was!

If you like the Blues you owe it to yourself to give this a listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW !!!!!","review":"I was in my local music store looking for some blues - very small selection of blues in my area. I was getting frustated when I happened onto this CD in the wrong bin. I decided to give it a try because of Mayall's track record, and with the awesome talent assembled here I thought that some of it would be OK (plus it was a dual layer SACD disc as well).I always knew Mayall was an excellent band leader, but he does an amazing job keeping this level of talent focused. The song writing and material selection for each artist is right on target. This is a must have CD for any progressive blues fan - maybe any rock fan !!! I would put this in the top 20 of my favorite prog blues albums of all time. Buy this CD !!!! - you will not be sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Movie!","review":"Having just watched Fuera Del Cielo immediately before watching this film, I expected a lot more to go wrong in the way of violence and crime, in Mexico City. Instead this film, effortlessly follows three separate, but equally interesting stories, as the four young men separate and have their own adventures and misadventures, over one evening. All of the actors are good, but I especially liked the beautiful Montserrat De Leon as the Bus Driver (that is her on the DVD cover.) This is more of a character study and the connections the characters make with the people they meet that night. This was not really a comedy, but there were some funny moments. Overall, I really enjoyed this film. I liked the fact that most of the characters were decent people and not the usual jerks that inhabit the American version of this type of film. The subtitles were a little quick and I had to hit pause a few times to keep up, but otherwise no other problems. Good Direction by Eva Lopez-Sanchez."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor","review":"dvd was not in a re sale condition, the rating is less than a 25%, dvd was too scratch to watch on any kind of dd player"},{"rating":"1","title":"A bust if you use XP","review":"Can't get Painter 9 to work on XP at all.

The trial version that came with my CorelDRAW X3 worked fine, but now that I've bought and installed the program it continually crashes with certain brushes. Corel support for the program seems non-existent. I evidently bought a useless program. I can't find updates or patches. I've been using CorelDRAW programs professionally ever since Corel 4, both the vector and the painting programs, and had nothing but respect for Corel, but the lack of support for their older programs seems to say the company wants to force you to buy new computers and brand new Corel products."},{"rating":"1","title":"Corel does not patch or stand by this product.","review":"I loved this program.

The ergonomically designed handle holds my wrist in a non-stressed position, which is important for not causing damage to my wrist, and the quick, cutting/sawing action makes the work much faster, making the use of a knife much less painful. Bread is not the only item that this knife cuts either. I have used it to cut cheeses, meats and frozen vegatables. My husband doesn't suffer from my afflictions, yet he loves using this knife too.

The reminiscences from a number of people work well, the pace of interview/footage is well crafted. Some of Kelly's career gets glossed without much attention, but for a 90 min. documentary, this is about as good as it gets. The tone of the piece is never cloying, for all the admiration Kelly engenders, and rightfully so. He was an immense artist. Stanley Tucci narrates, and there's ample enough coverage of his private life, especially with his children, to whet your appetite for more.

He can play everything and he can play everything very well. He has a great voice with great control, but he's got no soul. The music is very cheesy and predictable. After a few songs, which all start sounding the same, I was so bored that I was regretting buying the tickets to see Susan. I acutally felt sorry for the musicians that he hires because there's no way anyone that I know would want to play this without getting some $$.Thankfully Susan came out and kicked ass and made me completely forget about this guy. When I was leaving someone was talking about how his recordings were great so I checked out this disc to give him one more try, but it's just safe poppy middle of the road music. It's just like Coldplay, Eric Clapton, or even Hootie and the Blowfish...safe radio friendly music. Jackie please stay away from the blues because you just don't have it in you."},{"rating":"2","title":"another great record","review":"What a treat to get 66 minutes of new music from this talented musician! More fine songwriting and musicianship on this new record, with a richer sound than his previous releases thanks to the addition of synthesizer on a few tracks. I still wish he'd decrease the amount of slow, sad numbers and increase the lively blues tunes he does so well, but I'm still glad to hear anything this guy does."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dare I say Dylanesque?","review":"This is my first Jackie Greene CD, and based on my reaction I'm sure I will be adding to the collection. Comparisons to Dylan are probably inevitable. Greene's style of songwriting owes a lot to Dylan, and on the couple of acoustic guitar/harmonica driven numbers on this disk you may find yourself having flashbacks. But Greene's arrangements are deeper and more complex and except for the couple of aforementioned songs, fully fleshed out with a full band. Make no mistake, the guy has developed his own voice and isn't simply a clone. Great range of themes here on this disk, too, from playful to songs of lost love, and of a friend who died too young. This guy definitely deserves success, and I hope he finds it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Music, Truely","review":"I used to hate this type of music.

Very happy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not live up to other OXO Good Grips products","review":"The main problem with this product is that the metal part is way too flexible. It bends all over the place when you are trying to use it to make a slice of cheese. It needs to be much more rigid than it is. When it does actually cut, the slices it makes are nearly transparent.

Am going to look for a slicer that has a sturdier looking neck/handle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Faulty design","review":"I received this for a gift. It worked well for a couple of months, but is not made to last. Because the metal connecting to the handle is flimsy, it flexes and bends slightly with use. After less than 4 months, mine broke cleanly in half. My previous cheese planes lasted for many years, only to be discarded after getting dull.After sending an email to OXO, they replied quickly and offered to replace the item.Pros: thin,sharp, flexible, cuts nicely.

The only reason I bought this, was to have a CD copy. The sound, the songs still incedible sounding. This is one away from Terry Kath's tragic death, and should be remembered as some of his last work. As a guitar player myself, I loved his playing, to this day some of his 40 year old solos are still fresh and hard to duplicate by some of the best. As Trombonist James Pankow said at their 35th anniversery concert, \\"Terry was the living breathing soul of the band\\".If your a Chicago fan and don't have this album, buy it you will like it. If you are not a Chicago fan Why? Buy it, it has some good cuts on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Dud","review":"I found this album to be pretty lame not one sung jumped at me after numerous listens. We all know the overplayed sappy insipid ballad If You Leave Me Now i was tired of it 15 years ago. I have no problem with ballads but when they are made strictly to make money that is when i have a problem with them. The thing with this album is the music is simply not that good no standouts as i say. I realized Terry Kath passed away before the making of Hot Streets but at least that album has four good tunes. Skip this one please"},{"rating":"2","title":"Royal Doulton Series Ware Vol. 4","review":"If you want to collect Royal Doulton series ware, I consider all four volumes in this series a \\"must have.\\" I like this book because of the detailed photos -- the author goes way beyond just giving you a taste of Royal Doulton. If you only have one or two pieces of series ware, this book will help you identify them and let you see the whole spectrum of items that would complete your collection. While a terrific reference, this book is not a price guide and no prices are included. The only thing I wish this book had was more color photos. The china is so beautiful it deserves more color. That is the only reason I didn't give this book 5 stars.

A serious musician, Hubbard is also the best story teller around. For those of you who have not seen him live, this album is a perfect introduction to his special brand of humor as well as his ability to handle soulful ballads and honky tonk rock. If you like the intelligence of folk, the downhome feel of Texas country, the excitement of honky tonk rock all packaged in some humorous (and uniquely Hubbard introductions) get this album. It is the real thing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"For real jazz heads this is wack!!","review":"If you enjoyed this you obviously really arn't into raw jazz. This is worst than the smooth jazz out now. I appreciate this album for what it is musically( im a jazz trumpet player)but this insnt even a challenge for me to play. I respect it only because Miles was just taking new directions.

I wouldnt pay over 5 dollors for this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful... pure dreck.","review":"If you've never heard this album and are a Miles fan.. AVOID THIS ALBUM AT ALL COSTS!! This is nothing like any Miles you would know or ever want to know. It's the cheesiest pile of 80's rap, trumpet twidling and absurdness ever put to CD. I am still a huge Miles fan, but this seriously knocked my respect for him down a notch or two. Beyond awful- it's almost painful to hear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Miles's worst album","review":"This album, I definetly don't reccomend. There are two or three good songs but the rest stink. A poor follow up of Decoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Come on man!!!!","review":"It never ceases to amaze me on how fans of Miles Davis (few) claim to really enjoy this piece of garbage! Truthfully, I don't even know why this album in particular was reissued. The first track \\"One Phone Call/Street Scenes\\", the crappiest track on the album re-caps from when he was arrested by the police while driving his Ferrari. Sting makes an unnecessary appearance on the track posing as a French cop (gag). \\"Time After Time\\", and \\"Human Nature\\" are the only songs worth listening to out of the rest. I'm not so sure what a genius like Miles Davis was thinking when he put this one out, but this was a big let down. It does, however, feature some great musicians i.e. John Scofield, Darryl Jones, etc. If you're interested in 80's Miles, start with Tutu. The songs on Tutu were written by Marcus Miller and way better than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Miles' Nastiest Album Ever!","review":"This album contains an embarrassing \\"rap\\" and an even more offensive cover with Miles and a toy gun. Insulting to my intelligence, this album should be banned. I've heard Miles empty his spit valves with better musicality. Stay away! END"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality Miles","review":"This is one of the very worst albums in Miles' entire 45 year recorded output. It contains uninspired performances by Miles' standards, and some of the least distinctive material. Even a great artist can have a dud now and then, and this is Miles' big dud. When you listen to this album in the context of all of Miles' electric music, it is dull and disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Miles' pop album is really neat","review":"I bought this in '85 just prior seeing Miles in concert. The show really knocked me out. I haven't seen of bass player Angus Thomas anywhere else. One of the best bass players I've ever heard. I recall they played all of the Arrest tunes but maybe even 1 hour more of cooking funk. The album is more polished as the case often is when it comes to studio albums, but I think it is really good anyway. Hard driving and funky. Even the pop ballads are nice!"},{"rating":"1","title":"bad","review":"a complete letdown after decoy, a nasty follow-up, but it gave him an FM hit. I think it was a remake of Time after Time. There are no redeeming moments that I can remember on this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Arresting Concept...","review":"I have no harsh words of criticism for Miles' 1985 pop-soft jazz effort. While so-called die hard fans of Miles or jazz used adjectives such as \\"flop\\", \\"poor quality\\", and \\"worst\\", it is anything but...The only slight unstable choices he made was to do cover instrumentals of Michael Jackson's Human Nature and Cyndi Lauper's Time After Time at a time when the original songs were still fresh. Instead, he should have opted for writing a couple of original tunes himself (even if they were only going to be filler material---the key word being original).These two tracks ended up being played as light elevator music tunes in department or grocery stores. The rest of the album, however, showed that Miles could adapt to the changing times and styles of music in order to reach younger listeners as well. No longer was his music exclusive to hardcore jazz purists...Miles Davis is for the entire world !"},{"rating":"2","title":"SOMETHING'S ON MY MIND","review":"This is a great disc. This is the companion to Decoy and I happen to like it alot better. A Pop type feel. Very accessible music. Great players. John Scofield, Darryl Jones, Bob Berg (I love Bob Berg), John Mac, and many others. Two songs from this disc, \\"Time After Time\\", and \\"Human Nature\\", became a staple for Miles in the 80's till his death. These songs were introduced here, so it is an improtant disc. \\"MD1/Something's On Your Mind/MD2\\" is just the coolest, hippest, deept groove that you are going to hear. Seven minutes of it. If you want to know why Miles is so cool, this is the cut. I would buy the disc just for this. The opening cut is silly with the rap, but who cares. The whole disc is a cool groove. It holds my interest all the way through. Very cool Miles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Miles in a rock context","review":"This is Miles at his most acceessible--meaning anyone can find the beginning and end of the songs and follow what's going on.

Part of Lennon's narcissism - shared with McCartney in earlier Linda days - is the assumption that we'll love what he loves. Indeed, how many people actually listen to this album or Double Fantasy with equal attention to both artists? Unfortunately, John Lennon's creative life after the Beatles was long on promise but very short on delivery. Not one of these songs has the grace, cleverness, craft or exuberance of 1963's It Won't Be Long, let alone Strawberry Fields. Many Beatle fans seem to be as indulgent with Lennon's later mediocrity as he was."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Don't Want To Face It, no no no no","review":"Have I ever listened to this all the way through?

The Three Stooges did the same kind of thing with finesse, just funny slapstick that did not leave a mark and you knew was done in jest. Here, Pesci and Stern go through so much I felt myself getting numbed to the consequences.

I was hoping this edition of the DVD would have special features with more shots and footage from the set from back in 1990. However, I'm sure that since it was 17 years ago most of the behind the scenes footage from the filming was lost. Most of the special features are just interviews with the people who put the film together, talking about what they did for the film. Be sure to listen to the DVD commentary with Macaulay Culkin and Chris Columbus. It's interesting to watch deleted footage that didn't make the film as well.

It's a \\"total cartoon.\\" Now---you may dismiss my review, but I am here to tell you that my 6 year old felt the same way. He LOVED \\"Home Alone 3,\\" but \\"Home Alone,\\" downloaded for $3.99, was ho-hum in contrast. The movie always aggravated me with its gratuitous \\"Ahhhhhhhh\\" from Culkin, but its biggest offense is that it tries to be a cartoon and real movie at the same time.

I contacted amazon to send a replacement and unfortunately it came after Christmas. When we got around to playing the replacement, it too had the same issues.

Thought the 1080p picture was pretty good.I thought The DTS-HD audio was great. John Williams soundtrack sounded awsome in Lossless.Plus the Christmas music thats heard in the movie sounded great too. Realy cool Blu-Ray. And now I see Home Alone 2 will be making it to Blu-Ray this fall along with Miracle on 34th Street orginal version,and the remake.

This magazine only has a handful of articles... I subscribed to it thinking that there would be a lot of DIY wedding ideas and in the entire magazine (400 pages)there was only one. Out of 400 pages, there was only 20 articles, and most of them are advertising for something.

It is interesting that the author chose not only to show the terrible suffering that came from slavery, but also she revealed how slavery extracts a toll on the master. Personally it exemplifies how religion can (as in many cases throughout history) support and justify cruelty and violence. This book should stir everyone at the gut level.

Stowe was very well aware of the plight of these people and she wanted to make a change. She wanted to make her feelings about the evils of slavery known to the public. She wouldn't allow people to ignore the tragedies surrounding them because it was socially acceptable at the time. Although this novel is a work of fiction it accurately displays the lives of American slaves in the 1800's. In fact, the main character, Uncle Tom, is based upon the autobiography of Josiah Henson, and other slave narratives. She also appeals to the reader through emotional pulls that are easy to identify with, as if you were experiencing what the characters were. In all, I enjoyed reading this book and I think that Stowe created a very impressive message that is still important for us to look at today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic historical novel","review":"This book gives you an outside looking in view of slavery in the early US history.

I think everyone that is an American should read it to learn from the mistakes our ancestors made."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as hard as you might think.","review":"Even thought Uncle Tom's Cabin is over 600 pages long, and it was published 150 years ago, the book is not the hard work that many would assume it to be. The story telling is simple and easy to follow, and the characters are realistic.It took over 100 pages before I started to find the characters compelling, but once I did I breezed through the book. Also, the message against slavery is a tad heavy-handed, but I suppose it would have to be when the target audience is people who are ok with slavery or slave owners themselves.The book was an altogether enjoyable read, but not an entirely necessary one for someone trying to build their knowledge on the canon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Important anti-slavery novel","review":"Uncle Tom's cabin is a famous work of American literature, because of its historical context and its political importance as a piece of anti-slavery propoganda as much as for the story and quality of the writing. The phrase \\"Uncle Tom\\" has even gained some currency as a derogatory term in modern usage. The book captures and condences much of the worst elements of slavery in the south as it recounts the trials of several slaves, their owners and their families. The story is enthralling and the crossing of the ice flow remains one of the more famous scenes in literature. The story unashamedly promotes the anti-slavery position and promotes its activists Apparently this book had considerable impact in its day and although to some extent some of the thunder has since been stolen by blockbusters such as Roots, is still a powerful book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Profitable for historical relevance, but long and indirect","review":"I do respect and embrace the historical significance and effect of this novel in it's place and time. I applaud the author's goal, courage and tenacity. I loved the main character, Tom.That said, the writing style is not for me. I'm too spoiled by modern authors' constraints of being direct and succinct.I understand that in the culture of the time, a female author would find it necessary to obviate, to beat around the bush in making her (socially activist) point in order to comply with expectations of politeness and humility, to include occasional flattery of the opposition to make the novel more palatable to a wider audience and thus further her underlying goal.

Like a phoenix from the ashes, we rise!I recommend this book. I think it is good to remember the pain of the ancestors, and how we benefits from it today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin","review":"The reason why Harriet Beecher Stowe wrote Uncle Tom's Cabin was to let the North know what was going on in the South with slavery . Black families were broken apart and sold, young girls and women were taken advantage of by white owners, some were beaten to death by their owners and slaves could be treated anyway the owner wanted because they were not citizens. The white women characters cared more about the slaves than the white men. They didn't want to sell or break up families.Uncle Tom was an uncommonly good and honest man and devouted Christian. He was sold when his owner needed money. At first he was sold to a man who was ok, but then he was sold to Simon Legree. Legree was a mean man. When Tom was a slave for Legree he was beaten to the point of death. Everyone should read this book because it gives you an idea of what happened at the time of slavery."},{"rating":"2","title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin","review":"Uncle Tom's Cabin is definitely a great classic. I enjoyed the story plot of this book. I especially loved the chapters on Eliza and her boy and how they ran away from their master. I actually thought this book might be boring but it was very interesting and shows one what slavery was really like and what happened in those days. The story plot is that Eliza and her boy, Harry, are running from their master and the trader because their master sold Harry to the trader. Eliza is just trying to save Harry from the trader taking him away from her. Eliza's husband, a slave for another master, is also running away from his master.

The tremendous influence of this book on Anti-Slavery attitudes are considered to be a very real factor in leading to atmosphere which helped bring about the Civil War. This work is thus in terms of its 'real effect' in the 'real world ' far more important than 'Moby Dick' or \\" Leaves of Grass' or 'The Scarlet Letter ' or 'Walden', the greatest books of the American Renaissance.The literary quality of the book is in no proportion to the Influence which it had.I have found it an almost impossible read, in good part because of its language."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Must Read!","review":"Beautiful book that describes the horrors of slavery and what a mother risked to save her son and what a Christian man did to help his master.

We read about their triumphs and hardships that they go through in order to get one thing. Freedom. There are just a few things that I didn't enjoy about this book. The dialogue that takes place in Uncle Tom's Cabin was a little more difficult to understand than what I am normally used too.

Once you get past the first hundred and fifty pages the plot picks up enough to give the sheer boredom a minor respite, but the characters are about as flat as anything imaginable. Little Eva in particular I was ready to strangle, with hair or without, by the time she up and died. It's historically interesting as a spark to abolitionism and to the beginning of the Civil War, but as a novel it's dreadful.

It stirred feelings of disgust in me when I read about the overseers of the slave plantations - same as it did 100 years ago.Harriet Beecher Stowe showed how lucky slaves could be and how lucky most of them wasn't. She used a southern dialect that was most likely used by slaves. She also included slave folklore and songs. Anybody who loves a great story that tells the truth should read it.

I love classic books, but sometimes I find them difficult to understand. However, Harriet Beecher Stowe wrote in a way that is pretty much easy reading. While this is a long book, I am glad that it was not edited like a lot of modern books are. There is such a depth to this book that I believe will touch anyone's heart. Slavery is so cruel, and I am glad this book was written to bring to light many different sides of slavery. Since slavery is still going on today in many different countries, I suggest reading this. It is good to see different views. Different reactions. This book references Scripture a lot and sometimes the characters resemble those found in the Bible.

The end result is almost embarassing.UCT's heart is bigger than its brain, and that's a dangerous thing for an intended instrument of social change.

I needed to keep a tissue box handy -- it would be a hard person, indeed, who will not weep while reading this, especially knowing that the stories told are in no way exaggerated.

The band name-drops a lot of radical political figures (in \\"Hot Topic\\"), but the lyrics aren't simple platitudes or slogans. They're poetic, goofy, surreal. Musically, I hear the influences of the B-52s, Sleater-Kinney, and a lot more. I love Deceptacon, What's Yr Take on Cassavetes, Phanta, and Sideshow at University (this great instrumental that samples a hilariously conservative lecture on art).

There are some crazy clap along tunes and some cool lyrics...What's your take on Cassavetes?...Or...I went to your concert and I didn't feel anything. How many of us have been there before?Because of groups like these I don't download music. I'd rather buy it and have them earn some money. I'll download other [music], but I'll always support the good bands. You should too.So, I'll take my Metrocard (I'm in Mex City at the moment, and we have a Metro) and I'll head on over to all my friends' houses and have them listen to this CD, hopefully turning them onto this band which no one seems to know about here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Let me hear you depoliticize my rhyme.","review":"Yeah!

The spiky end pokes holes in the meat nicely and the flat end flattens out thick chicken breasts in no time flat. It's fun to use (or at least I think so!) and it doesn't require a huge amount of strength. The grip is comfortable and doesn't lend itself to flying out of your hands. It's easy to clean - meat doesn't cling to the spiky end - and while it probably isn't rated for dishwasher use, that never stops me from throwing it in anyway, and I've had no problems.~ Ana Mardoll"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good, thorough astronomical encyclopedia","review":"So far,I haven't found a single astronomical term that was missing or one for which the encyclopedia gave less than satisfactory explanation."},{"rating":"2","title":"RACIAL TENSION SOLVED BY THE GOVERNMENT??","review":"i read this book, and must say that it really got my mind thinking in a new direction regarding racial tension.

I'm back to using old faithfull, a good chefs knife."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless!","review":"The Oxo rolling mincer is lacking one important feature: Blades! It has thin little discs of metal, but they aren't blades. They are dull, dull, dull and do nothing but mash your herbs to pieces. Do you really want finely hammered herbs? It's like replacing a chef knife with a screwdriver. Ok, it's missing a couple more features: It's too small and the \\"blades\\" don't rotate independently. After the first use I noticed one of the \\"blades\\" had already bent about 5-10 degrees from parallel (which would have been prevented with independent blades). For quantity tasks, it is far slower than a chef knife. Try a nice double- or triple-bladed Mezzaluna instead. Mezzalunas have real blades that can be re-sharpened. (But don't buy one with a matching bowl shaped cutting board, they completely ruin the rocking action of the Mezzaluna)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment","review":"As an avid cook, I'm always looking for time-saving utensils.

While I usually like OXO products, I cannot recommend this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to like this...","review":"...really, I did. I am a loyal Oxo customer and nearly everything in my kitchen is from either the Good Grips or the SteeL product line.

I'd give it zero stars if I could. Even apart from the fact that the blades do absolutely nothing, it's also extremely difficult to re-assemble it after you take it apart to clean it.

However, it has the slight flaw that it doesn't actually mince herbs. Tried it with parsely, a fairly durable herb that slices easily. The herb mincer managed to slice through some of the leaves on top, but left a layer of mutilated leaves underneath! It did not matter how hard I pushed, the bruised leaves would not cut! Even if it did work the wheels are not closely spaced enough to mince; I would describe it as closer to chopped. You will be much better off with a sharp knife than with this worse than useless product. I returned mine the same day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better use kitchen scissors!","review":"This utensil is not able to cut various types of herbs. It does not work with basilicum, it does not work with cilantro either. Perhaps it works with parsley? I did not even care to try anymore.

He really spoiled Faith Evans song All Night Long doing that.Now about the song and Toni Braxton; This song is a backward step for Mrs. Braxton who has paid her dues with her debut album. This song seems like something the yet mature TLC would do aside from that No Scrubs garbage they put out a couple years back.

I know they were not inexpensive. However, within a year, three of the six knives seperated from the grips during use.

In all three cases, the blades flipped upwards during slicing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paring knife is so dull I couldn't stand it.","review":"Sorry to disagree with other reviewers, but my experience of the paring knife was that it's perhaps the softest metal I've ever seen used in a knife, and as a result, it's not very sharp and doesn't improve if you try sharpening it. My friend, a fellow cook who got it as a gift, doesn't like it; I hated it and would never choose to use it. There's a reason the price is so low."},{"rating":"1","title":"Razor Sharp - sometimes convenient","review":"The only reason that I give the mini chef knife (I have not used the paring knife) one star is because its size has sometimes come in handy and the blade is extremely sharp.WORDS OF WARNING - <1> the grip has a tendency to move/slide while you are using the knife... do not use this knife to cut anything that would require significant pressure! <2> The back side of the blade is also very sharp! I have better than average culinary skills and have cut myself twice on the back of this knife. <3> Though it is a small, cute knife, only a fool would think that this knife would be a good \\"junior\\" knife for a kid who wants to cut and cook like Mommy (or in my case, Daddy)."},{"rating":"1","title":"very poor quality for OXO","review":"I love OXO products and own almost every product, but these knives are very poorly made.

For the casual fan, this, American Beauty and Workingman's Dead will probably be all you ever need by this band. If, however, you develop a love and devotion for The Dead as I have, this will only be the tip of the iceberg. This album contains not only the signature songs of The Dead, like He's Gone, Jack Straw, and Brown Eyed Women, but also definitive and flawless performances of all of them. Check out the incredible versions of China Cat Sunflower > I Know You Rider, Sugar Magnolia, and Morning Dew as some proof of this. The album is not, however strictly \\"live\\", like Live/Dead, rather, many vocals and some instruments were overdubbed in the studio, as well as being subject to mixing edits. This is the case, however, with many of rock's great live recordings, and is not of determent to this quintessential album. It is a must for any collection; one listen and you'll be hooked!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Seminal live recording","review":"Curious about the GD phenomenon? Their rep is for live performances.

I was so disappointed to hear these tracks- they're slow and drawn out. I guess it's a more relaxed show, good for people that want to chill out, but I just feel like they weren't giving me what I wanted to hear, like the album was just a big tease. I really dislike 'American Beauty' as an album and I guess I put this into a similar category. If you dislike AB (not exactly common within the dead community) then stay away from Europe '72."},{"rating":"1","title":"This remastered version is actually a step backwards in sound quality!","review":"What a big dissapointment this Rhino remaster was! As soon as I played it I noticed that it sounded worst than my original copy of the Warner Bors. CD release.This remaster is about 5-6 dbs louder than the original release but it is compressed, muffled and clipped. There is a lot less clarity and separation between the voices and instruments (the drums are a mess). It seems the engineers jut compressed the hell out of the original master tape. I did an AB comparasion with my two players (one of them a HDCD machine) and the results were not what I expected.This applies to the original Europe 72 material. The extra tracks are better, but apart from an excellent \\"Looks Like Rain\\", it is all Pigpen howling, and that is my least favorite GD music.I bought the \\"Live Dead\\" remaster at the same time and it has the same problem.Stick with your Warner versions if you still have them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"This purchase was to replace an old, long-lost copy.

I have listened to this CD literally thousands of times and never tire of it. The arrangements (done, I believe, by Torme and Shearing) are superb and Mel's work on \\"Berkeley Square\\" is as good as you will ever hear by any singer. This album is truly a joy to listen to. If you haven't heard it you are in for a treat as the piano playing, the singing and the choice of songs is simply brilliant.

These are the last peeler and parer you will ever need. Throw out the old flimsy peeler. These tools are dynamic, rugged, beautiful and functional. If you want to try them out, go to the kitchen store in the mall nearest you. You should be astounded by the stunning simplicity and functionality of these tools!

That's how I feel about OXO International products. And this bargain priced set of paring knife and peeler is no exception.I especially am amazed by the peeler. The swivel action of the blades skims potato skins like fine silk, leaving you unwasted meat of the spud. And those pesky 'lil eyes? --poof, disappear with the nifty corer OXO provides. On carrots, this peeler is a dream. Perfect while making my favorite carrot cake or getting a veggie tray prepared. I've even tried it on firm tomatoes--absolutely perfect for stewing or canning.Good products from a good company. OXO's health concerns have won them awards from the Arthritic foundation.

In fact, they just feel good in your hands and work great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not purchase this item coating wears off","review":"Coating came off on my hands while cutting up brownies I had let cool on rack.

This album by Amon Amarth stands out in that it is both incredibly brutal and yet has a very strong underlying message: infidels and heathens (especially christians) should prepare for an ultimate reckoning at the hands of Odin and all his comrades. This album does not let up after you first push play, and it truly makes you wish you were on some hill in the days of old leading hordes of Nordic savages and vikings down upon those who dare to test your wrath with their devotions. On top of all this, the production is top quality. The clarity of the instruments and vocals are superb, and this album all around further enforces the fact that the Scandinavians are still leaders in phenomenal metal. I highly recommend this to anyone who's a fan of absolutely relentless, brutal metal in the Nordic vein."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amon Amarth \\"The Crusher\\"","review":"First of all, I love the way the Amazon editors misclassify, and at times, are just flat out uninformed when it comes to the albums they review. Like calling Dimmu Borgir's album \\"great death metal.\\" Yeah, that's a genius remark for sure. You guys need to hire somebody who actually knows what they're talking about. Now to the Amon Amarth album at hand...Unfortunately, Martin Lopez did not continue playing with Amon Amarth, his drumming is superb. That doesn't really effect the quality of Amon Amarth's music, however, as The Crusher proves to be the strongest, most aggressive album thus far. Johan Hegg relies mostly on his battle-screams, while the band concentrates on crushing, semi-melodic death metal riffs and blasts. After you buy \\"Versus The World\\", get The Crusher. Or better yet, order them at the same time.Standout Tracks: Annihilation Of Hammerfest, Bastards Of A Lying Breed, Masters Of War, As Long As The Raven Flies, The Sound Of Eight Hooves"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amon Amarth Stay True to Their Style","review":"I have decided Amon Amarth are not a band that will surprise very much with subsequent albums. However, if they are good at writing songs within their style and their fans like it (like me) then why not stick with what you are good at. If it ain't broke, don't fix it. The songs on the Crusher are more technical than their previous album, just like Avenger was more technical than Once Sent, and the Crusher is less hook-laden, which is not necessarily a good thing. Bastards of a Lying Breed starts this album off with pure speed and aggression. There are a few stand outs, but they will be different for everybody, because if you have heard their first two full lengths, then you have heard this album. It's just too bad the Crusher doesn't have a song as strong as Last With Pagan Blood or Friends of the Suncross. Still, this album is a good time and fun to listen to when you feel like hurting someone."},{"rating":"1","title":"From a Dedicated BJ Fan","review":"Avoid this book like the plague.

Through the separate narrations of each character, we see how the nihilism that swept Japan's prewar intelligentsia prepared each character for his or her role in the vivisection. Evocative of the understatement in Camus's \\"The Stranger,\\" Endo's characters relate their stories in straight line, cinematic narrations which reveal the desensitivity to life and suffering that Japan's prewar society had conditioned them to, and in doing so Endo offers readers a sober warning of the dangers of living in a moral vacuum."},{"rating":"2","title":"A horror story about the \\"Culture of Death\\"","review":"When the sanctity of life is not honored, no one is safe, as the characters keep saying -- \\"Today everybody's on the way out. ... What's the point,then, of pitying ... .\\" As Endo implies, everybody is ALWAYS on some point of the continuum from birth to death so we are all in jeopardy when the Modernist utilitarian philosophy is applied. It is only a matter of changing the definition of who is no longer \\"qualified\\" to live. People steeped in such a system have no defense, no final moral keep or fortress from which to defy a system based on such principles and say \\"No.\\" All social interaction and politics becomes mere maneuvering to control the decision-making machinery to avoid being politcally or legally \\"defined\\" out of humanity.

The old, the young, the innocent, the pure of heart, caregivers, families, traditions, institutions - all will be degraded if not destroyed by it.

There are layered tracks of Jerry's voice singing perfect harmonies. What made the Dead great was that they were far from perfect (not including most performances the year 1977) and their imperfections made them one of the last honest and improvisational rock bands out there.

Uninteresting characters, and the usual, \\"widowed husband seeks revenge\\" plotline make this film one of the worst of 2002. How anyone could take an interesting plot subject such as meth cookers, and the underground methadone trade, and make it completely dull and boring is beyond me. The only reason I gave The Salton Sea two stars instead of one,is because of D'Onofrios' performance as a noseless meth dealer.

People tend to call everything trance these days. So while I am browsing through \\"trance\\" singles trying to find some fresh tunes, I often come upon very bad music. This music is uninspired, overly-repetitive, migraine-inducing, and generally low quality. It gives trance a bad name. A bizarre region of glow-stick wearing \\"trance-addicts\\" are the only reason this music hasn't gone the way of the dinosaur. People like Ferry Corsten. Ugh. If you're looking for music that sounds ANYTHING like Sasha, Digweed, Oakenfold, or any other big name \\"trance\\" dj, you won't find it here. Skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Laminated computer print out","review":"This is really nothing more than a laminated computer print out, using legal sized paper. Hardly a poster, save yourself some money and make it yourself at Kinkos or something. Also, some or the exercises are miscategorized."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Isn't the Miles You Want","review":"By this point in his career, Davis was just mailing it in. The caliber of the musicianship is par excellence as always. The quality of the songs is what makes this CD a bore. Either Miles just didn't care any longer or he was totally burnt. Take your pick. Either way, these songs are unimaginative, repetitive and say absolutely nothing. Davis was no longer a musical trailblazer but a trend follower."},{"rating":"2","title":"We want MORE Miles","review":"At first listen, I thought the album title was kind of a joke, or actually a literal request seeing as how Miles really doesn't play a lot on this album. However, Miles really knew WHEN to play, and when he does, he always hits the right notes. We want MILES! But we get Mike Stern, with amazing progressive guitar solos that really dominate the album.This is fusion all the way, and as others have said, you could buy this album just for Marcus Miller's stellar bass playing, but you could also buy this for some insane guitar work from Stern. Of course, Miles is great, and so is Minu Cinelu on the percussion. Different from most of Miles' catalog, but great music!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Funk driven, open improv","review":"I am not a fan of golden-age jazz, and the Miles I love is the Miles of Bitches Brew, and not Kind of Blue. We Want Miles is far from traditional jazz, and is really funk-driven, with wonderful energy and riffs, and Jean Pierre as a recurring theme. This tour is usually considered as part of Miles' cocaine period, and I believe that in the vast majority of cases cocaine utterly ruins the spirit of vituoso music. But with the funk basis, somehow the music not only works, it excells. Sparse funky bass riffs with Miles's careening improvisations are beautifully complementary. This remains one of my five favorite Miles albums of all time. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Conclusion of the cliffhanger at the end of \\"Ship of the Line\\"","review":"\\"Ship of the Line\\" ended in a cliffhanger and this novel finishes the story. This turned out to be one of my favorite Hornblower novels. It mostly takes place in Spain and France, but we get to know a lot more about Hornblower and Bush as they struggle with captivity. We find that Hornblower struggles with guilt feelings and is ashamed of some of his feelings and actions. He is clearly human. The book did end up with some good action, and had a poignant, but satisfying conclusion.I heartily recommend this book, but it should be read with \\"Ship of the Line\\" since this is the conclusion of a cliffhanger."},{"rating":"2","title":"flying colours","review":"I bought this book as a gift for my dad. It arrived in less time than it would have taken me to go out to the book store! GREAT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite Hornblowers!","review":"In my project of reading the HH books chronologically (according to Hornblower's age), I confess I bogged down in BEAT TO QUARTERS because it was too much Lady Barbara Lady Barbara Lady Barbara and Hornblower ragging (mentally) on poor, fat, blowsy, adoring wife Maria. Ugh. Thankfully, after a long hiatus, I picked up again with FLYING COLOURS. What a wonderful book! One of my favorite in the series, it chronicles Hornblower's adventures after losing the Sutherland and having to escape from France, where he is slated for execution. (And if you were one of those who enjoyed HH mooning after Lady Barbara and dissing his wife, there's more of that in this book. Whatever. I'm over it.)Love this series. On to the next!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perhaps the best Hornblower book","review":"My favorite of the Hornblower series. Both a good look at the character development of Hornblower and Bush, and a great sea yarn. As with many other reviewers of this series, I have been through it several times. First read Hornblower as the 3-volume single book \\"Captain Horatio Hornblower\\" in high school. It includes Beat to Quarters, Ship of the Line and Flying Colours, and I suggest that new readers start with these 3 and then go back to Midshipman Hornblower and read the rest of the series in chronological order. These are great books for action and sea lore, but also interesting for the introspection into the psychology of warrors and conduct in battle."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Hornblower Saga is worth reading","review":"The first book of the Hornblower Saga was given to me as a birthday present at my 13th birthday. I read it time and time again. Both my sons did the same. Unfortunately at that time only the first book was translated into Hebrew and my English was not well enough to read the follow on episodes in the original laguage. Now, at 65 I found it very educating to pick up the missed books and learn about the atmosphere during the Napoleonic wars. For me it is very \\"refreshing\\" to read Hornblower's adventures in between my biographys and history books I usually read."},{"rating":"2","title":"grapefruit knife","review":"I enjoy grapefruit on a regular basis and find this knife to be an efficient, handy tool. It does the job along with the grapefruit spoons I ordered. I recommend this item without hesitation. The delivery was prompt and everything was safely packaged."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant Book...","review":"I found this at my school's library and was intrigued by the cover, which I think gives a little peek at what's to come. It's a wonderful story with a little fairy tale flair, with lessons and morals we still value today. I'm 15, and I thought that this was a good book for teens, but I would caution younger readers for the rape and violence that occours in this book. Besides that, this proves to be a fasinating and wonderful read. I plan to read more novels by this very talented and \\"reading pleasing\\" author. Please read this book again and again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"unrealistic","review":"This book has an interesting plot, but did not live up to my expectations. The main charachter, Marnie is not very likeable. She regards herself as superior to Raven, this does not give off the message that she loves him,but rather that she feels sorry for him and is being kind to him out of pity. I find this kind of unbalanced rlationship to be extremly irritating."},{"rating":"1","title":"How sad that young adult literature is now on par with trash","review":"To say I was diassapointed with this book is an understatement. It had real potential but instead chose to be a salacious story with no moral value at all. Girl is in an arranged marriage. Sex is a awful. Meets deaf boy. Sex is wonderful. The end."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite book","review":"This book is brilliant. I reccomend it to anyone who really enjoys a great story. It is about a young girl living in medevil times who meets a strange boy named raver by the village he lives in.It's different but still classical."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truely Astounding","review":"I loved it! Jordan intrigued me with her words, and made everything seem so perfectly real to me. I loved the romance in it- Raven was so gentle and serene-- I only wished that they would've waited one more day to make love. Otherwise it was one of the mostest bestest greatest book I've ever read!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An overall good book","review":"The Raging Quiet is an uplifting tale that has strong characterizations and a interesting plot. The book follows the tale of a young teenage girl named Marnie who has been brought to the town of Tocurra against her will through a marriage that she isn't all to happy about either. She is then put through many hardships with only the priest and fellow outcast Raver/Raven. This book is very well written and enjoyable. The characters seem real and have their flaws as well as their strengths. The villan is completly dispicable and the townspeople are simply infuriating.Even though this book is wonderful, it does have it's week points. Sometimes, things just get so bad for Marnie it seems exaggerated. That or she just seems to have incredibally bad luck.Overall though, this book in incredibly entertaining and a good book to pick up when you are looking for a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best book i ever read","review":"this is one the most moving stories i have ever read.the relationship between Marnie and Raven is timeless.the are some parts where you cringe at some of the stupid and unknowing stuff Raven does but it just adds to the sure enjoyment of the book.at some points you are in tears when you read about the harsh ways the village people treat marnie and Raven.But you know the priest will always be there for them.A surpurb book and i highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of my favorites!","review":"I liked this book a lot. I found it facsinating how Marnie came up with a whole bunch of hand signals to communacate with a deaf boy, Raven. Her determination and frustration with him make the book seem even more real. Even though it's fiction, the witchcraft trial and other basic things from life in this time era keep the reader interested while teaching them some new things at the same time. I would suggest this book to anyone who is interested in deafness, witchcraft, and tales of determination and the struggle some people went through in life during this very strict time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Teen Girls Beware","review":"This book may be fine writing and may have great characters, but I was disappointed to find that in the first few pages, we see a young girl basically experiencing rape at the hands of her new \\"husband\\". My daughter is 12 years old, and perhaps the author thinks that 12 year olds are ready for this type of writing. The writing was explicit enough that it made my daughter uncomfortable. Parents, please pre-read this book to make sure that it is appropriate for your teen daughter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Castles","review":"Colin and Alesandra were great together from the beginning. I enjoyed Colin's disregard for propriety and Alesandra's little schemes that were always meant to help someone whether they wanted it or not. Again I thought the mystery portion of this story was a little predictable, but not overly so. Other than a brief mention of Lyon, he and his wife Christina were absent from this book, but all of the other couples from this series were included in this story. I appreciated the chance for an update on all of them. This is a wonderful series and highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible writing - skip this one!","review":"For a novel presumably set in 1820, Garwood sure uses a lot of phrases that weren't used until 1920 - like \\"yeah\\" and \\"sexy.\\" Regency gentlemen don't think someone is \\"sexy.\\" Reading that just jars me entirely out of the story. Also, how about how he has her sit on his lap in front of visitors? Please, they would barely touch in company. Garwood obviously knows nothing about the period - and it shows. This is just terribly written. Skip and read something by Joanna Bourne or Loretta Chase!"},{"rating":"1","title":"So bland, I couldnt even finish it.....","review":"I have read a lot of Julie Garwood's work, and for the longest time she was on my list of favorite authors. Im sorry to say that that is no longer the case. Lately every book that I have read by Ms. Garwood has been mediocre at best. \\"Castles\\" was just awful..I actually liked Colin , but Alesandra was just a whiny, childish wimp. I normally force myself to never let a book go unfinished, but this one just wasnt worth the effort. I'm sorry to say that I think my days of Garwood are over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Romance!","review":"I loved this book! I read the whole thing from page to page without one minute of boredom. Some books i find myself skipping paragraphs but not this one! The love that grew between Colin and Alesandra was well written and I loved how she molded her characters...this is my first book that i have read from Garwood - I plan on reading alot more! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great novel from Garwood","review":"I have read all of Garwood's books, and like the others this one is also magnificent. The story, the characters, and how she flows the story of this book from Guardian Angel and The Gift was terrific. Everything just comes together(From all 3 novels). Nothing is confusing. I recommend this book to all readers. All of Garwood's books deserve 10 stars and more."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved it. Julie Garwood is the best.","review":"The characters were charming. Julie Garwood is at her best. The 3 books in the series are great a must read. The women are all so different and seem to fit within that time period, when a woman had to keep her brains a secret. Julie please write more books about the ton."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Book!","review":"Everyone just mentions two other books with this one, \\"Guardian Angel\\" and \\"The Prize\\" but even before those two, \\"Lyons Lady\\" is a MUST read. It all ties in more beautifully then."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Book","review":"This is probably my favorite Julie Garwood book. It is the 3rd book of a series. The first book, Guardian Angel, is about Colin's brother Caine. The second book, The Gift, about Colin's partner Nathan. But this book surpasses both of them. Colin is afraid to love Alessandra because he feels he is not good enough for her because she is a princess. He marries her out of family obligation and because there is a cruel man after Alessandra's title and fortune. Only after he almost loses her, does he realize how much he loves her and how deserving he is of her love. You will read this book over and over. It is definitely a keeper."},{"rating":"1","title":"quite poorly written, and not very interesting","review":"This is the first Julie Garwood book I have ever read and I must say that I was quite appalled. The writing itself was not very good at all. Often the words were clumsily thrown together as though with no thought at all. There was extreme word overuse. The story was even worse. It is so unrealistic and unconvincing that the whole plot, or what could possibly be called a plot, is dull in the extreme. Alesandra is made out to be a rich, bumbling dullard while Colin is the suave and intelligent one who laughs at her mistakes. It makes me sick, because this is basically all the book is about. I do not recommend this as any sort of reading material, serious or just for fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"No strong leading lady","review":"Being a big fan of Julie Garwood and having read Lyon's Lady and Guardian Angel I looked forward to reading about Colin. I was extremely disappointed. Whereas the female characters in the previous two novels, Jade and Christina were very strong and interesting - challenging the respective heros in the novels, Alesandra was rather weak and suffered from a rather nondescript personality. After the promising beginning showing her as a problem to the convent, I expected a bit of non conformity from her, but instead was given a non descript not fully realized, rather weak individual. I'm still a Garwood fan, but couldn't even finish Castles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst novel...","review":"Absolutely hated this novel! I have read many good novels from Johanna Lindsley, Judith McNaught and Jude Deveraux. They all write with such grace that reading this made me feel like it was a novel I should have been reading as a teen. The whole book lacked description and feeling. Julie didn't quite bring you into the story because of the lack of these things. I can only hope for her sack that her other books are written better than this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Castles (Crown's Spies)","review":"It was a bit mysterious at first but then it became a love story and also a who done it! Liked it a lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing gets by this man...","review":"I had to smile as I read this book, because Colin (our hero) was a little \\"too\\" perfect. However, the plot made me forget this, and I realized his pigheadedness was indeed his flaw. I loved Alesandra, and the way she managed to organize her life, despite the men in it. The author kept one engaged and although I guessed who the bad guy was, I still wanted to read the story and see how it unfolded. It's a good read, and I'd like to read the rest of the series!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully warm story","review":"The fourth book in the series tells the wonderfully warm story of Caine's brother Colin and Princess Alesandra. Although not my favorite book in the series (Lion's Lady is my favorite followed by The Gift) I still couldn't put it down.Though this book CAN be read on it's own, I do recommend that you read the other three before you delve into this one as characters mentioned in Castles are revisted from the previous books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best","review":"I was very disappointed by this novel. If I'd read it alone, maybe I would have liked it. But I read it as a continuation of the series. I was very upset that Nathan does not make an appearance until the end of the novel. I was also disturbed by the physical changes Garwood made in the other characters from previous novels. To me, it just isn't a sequel. Colin did not seem like himself. Even when viewing the book separate from the rest, the character of Alesandra is not fully fleshed out. Nor is the story believable. I didn't buy their romance for a minute. I can only recall a few memorable moments from this novel--one touching, one funny. This is definitely a novel to borrow but not to buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I am a guitar player and a fan of good guitar music. If you are hooked on good guitar, don't get this album. It is really bad. The singing is whiny and the guitar playing is uninspired and uninspiring. The compositions are mediocre. If there is good Ritchie Kotzen out there it is not this one. I heard Ritchie on a compilation album called Guitar On The Edge which is an overall great compilation. (There are three volumes). I am just plain disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Murs Cleanest Effort","review":"One of the my favorite records so far this decade.

Maybe the everyday topics make this album extremely relatable to some people, and I hear that, but honestly the only thing worthwhile on this album is the production. He can't ride the beats and his rhymes and wordplay aren't clever at all. In the end, I don't care about any of the things MURS raps about on this album.I'm glad he's doing his thing but this album is not that nice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Swooning and sighing over these, this book is a must!","review":"Relationships.

The singer Tony Hansen have a rather high pitch voice, and on some songs it works just fine but on others, like \\"Ready to leave\\" it's far from good, and it seems as Hansen try to sound more or less like the superior Rob Halford (Judas Priest) and it's rather annoying. I would say that the material on this release is quite alright with cuts like the strutting \\"Last summer's evil\\", the fast \\"Tor with the hammer\\", and the ballad \\"Without your love\\". In \\"Break the ice\\", TNT sound very much like Dokken.

Micheal Ruperts score is touching and fun along with the lyrical banter of Colker's writing. It's a worthy buy, but a rarely produced show.

The Pig, The House, The Bighead, The Minotauress. All genius that had me laughing all the way.Goon is generally boring. It seems like a very basic story written by someone other than Lee (Pelan) where Lee has added several sections of gross sex. Lee is usually very good and very funny at this stuff but on this occasion it comes off as a half arsed effort that probably took him a couple of hours to write.There is one piece of classic Lee in this novel, a conversation between two police officers. The rest? Sorry, glad this was not my first Lee book.Not worth the $20 asking price. Sorry Ed. Love your work but this is lacklustre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun little book","review":"I really like Edward Lee. I know I am not alone in this thought. I enjoy what he writes and I have started to spend the money in order to read some of his harder to find books. This book cost forty dollars and it was only about 140 pages, but it was worth it. It was worth it because I really enjoy his writing. This was the first Pelan collaboration I have read and I look forward to reading the rest.

Chloe could have been written as a much more compelling sympathetic narrator through which to see a turning point in a life of a country. There is not enough wit or drama or lirerary cleverness to make one want to read beyond page 15, the only reason I did, is that I made it a rule to finish all books I start. Johnson has written much better books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will anything interesting ever happen here?","review":"I wanted this book because I thought it would describe INTERESTING events happening in the life of an American woman in a Middle Eastern country. Not quite. It merely threw a few week's boring events together to create a boring story that went nowhere. The story is called \\"Persian Nights\\", yet the reader wasn't informed about the culture, customs or traditions of this mysterious land! The few somewhat eyelifting parts (that would seem difficult for the author to solve)somehow were suddenly patched (Noosheen and the whole passport thing). There were so many parts that could have gone somewhere and never did. Awfully boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of paper.","review":"This book is terrible. I am an avid reader and I am really sorry I wasted my time and money on it. The main character has no redeeming qualities whatsoever. It was impossible to care what happened to this poor excuse for a women. How this novel could be described as fast-paced is beyond me. Three quarters way through the book I was still waiting for something, anything, to happen. At about this same point in the story the author tosses out a stream of vulgar language that seems to have no place in the book. Perhaps it is to get our attention away from falling asleep. Sweeping negative generalizations for nearly every ethnic group mentioned in the story abound. Iranians men are ridiculed right down to the size of their collective private parts. Was the author trying to be funny or just plain offensive? If you need to prop up the leg of a table perhaps this book would have some merit. How it could have been nominated for the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction I do not understand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Front cover shows it all","review":"This was not a good book at all.

It wouldn't even make the B-movie list. Reviewers said there was a lot of editing out of violence. I can't imagine what could be restored to make this worth anything. It was cliche-ridden, poorly written and poorly acted. For example Burton's character was supposed to be crippled--Richard Burton hardly ever maintained that simple bit of acting. The Klan was an evil entity. Actually more insidious than the film depicts. So much more could have been made out of the story. Even the climactic scene was cut short. I can't believe it, but the best acting was done by OJ Simpson. Then there was the penniless white woman who was raped, She had a hair color job and make up that would have cost a month's salary--not convincingly destitute. Her rape was never cleared up--among several loose threads left dangling.It was even worse than the first BILLY JACK from the same era."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two Drunks and a Unconvicted Murderer","review":"I don't know who was more lubed, Marvin or Burton.

When this movie was released I was the night projectionist is a grind house in downtown San Diego, California. It was so incredibly offensive that I immediately put it in my \\"Cult Classic\\" list. Imagine my horror upon watching the DVD. The sound track is perfectly horrible and the \\"editing\\" is nothing less than a hatchet job, to say nothing of being a close relative to book burning.

The Original Opening Scene, Where a Topless Young Black Lady (Jeanne Bell) is tossed around by White Men standing in a Circle is Edited Out as well, the Producers try hard to omit Racially-Charged Scenes, but to do so leaves the Film empty, unfortunately they keep the Redneck Characters intact, the crappy acting from both Marvin and Burton, and a Dull O.J.

Lee Marvin was a dynamic actor in his own right as well. Why they are wasting their time in this ugly, worthless (...) movie is anybody's guess.Many films that incorporate a racist theme merit importance when they depict the horror and any subsequent violence that such bigotry and hatred derives.

The plate that mashes down on the potatoes is not a very tight seal so you will have some small amount of potatoes that squeeze through the top part, but it's OK, I just throw those in with the mashed potatoes as well because they come out mashed.

So on that note I will make this short.This book with take your breathe away and make you question your life. It will make you teary eyed not because he is exposing the process of dying. But because he is exposing our mass failure to pour ourselves into our lives.Laurence Shames parts of the book you can skip...they take away from message.I am happy this book is short for two reasons:1.

The recommendation to read his book came during our recent 35th reunion. I have two observations after reading it: the first, is my regret at not having kept up with Pete. He lived his life fully and always had a lot of fun. He was irreverent, a trait I admire. The second is his admonition to slow down and enjoy the \\"now\\" that life offers. It has given me pause as I reflect upon my own life and values. While most in my generation have assumed responsibilities that require more than the narrow focus of living entirely for the moment, Pete's experiences in the last year of his life show that responsibility and enjoying the now can go hand in hand: after all, today may be all you have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting, heavy, and well written.","review":"Not Fade Away was given to me by an older friend of mine after we had a conversation about Death and its meaning.

His memoirs that chronicle his journey to death are enlightening, funny at times, and very heavy at others.I appreciated the reminder this book offers. It helped re-remind me that those things in life we tend to take for granted (our health, our relationships, the beauty around us everyday) are so very valuable.As a spiritualist, this book will be interesting; you'll see a very objective, very rational corporate raider lean spiritual.As an atheist/agnostic/rationalist, this book will be interesting; you'll see a very objective, very rational corporate raider lean spiritual.Like they say, \\"there are no atheists in foxholes\\".

I mentioned my interest in reading this book to a few people, and got some sideways glances...I'm sure they were wondering why a pregnant woman would be drawn to a memoir of a dying man? Shouldn't I be reading something a bit livlier? I knew just enough about the remarkable life of Peter Barton that I really wanted to know, what were his final thoughts?This book is about the adventure of being alive, the choices we make and the risks we take that make it incredible. There are pearls of wisdom in this book -- his remarkable insight into business, parenthood, love and of course the eventual struggle we all will face with our own mortality. It's the type of book you finish, and then just sit there for awhile soaking it in -- feeling a bit changed from having read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stays with you","review":"It's been a few years since I read this book. I still think about the story and suggest the book to my friends who may be at a crossroads in life.

This story will give reason to pause and reflect both during and after you've consumed it. Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best in Real Life Drama","review":"This book thrilled me and annoyed me at the same time. I was blown away by the family dynamics that led to the murder of the main character's husband. And the insane world of drugs and Dungeons and Dragons that her son (who the reader suspects is involved from the beginning) inhabits is a glimpse into a real person's dark side.But don't expect the story to end like a fictional murder mystery. You'll be left with many unanswered questions, unexplainable evidence, and a sinking suspicion that there's more to the story than what was revealed. But it's just this ambiguity that makes this such a compelling read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great job with a difficult subject","review":"I thought McGinnis did an incredible job with some very, very touch subject matter. I read \\"Blood Games\\" as well, and while both had their advantages, \\"Cruel Doubt\\" was far and away the better book. Like other readers, I was shocked that Moog was convicted without physical evidence, and while I'm sure he was involved, I feel confident that others -- including Henderson and Pritchard -- were also involved. Unlike Bledsoe, McGinnis took the time after the trial to gauge those involved on what THEY thought really happened, and that is where the book really gets great. I, too, am hoping for another book on this crime.Along those lines, does anyone know of a site or message board that addresses this particular crime? Thanks."},{"rating":"2","title":"My first taste of Elliott Smith","review":"I don't know if it's his best. I don't think it is, but I like the CD, and it's one that I will be playing for awhile when I drive. I will be getting the two CDs after this one to see if he has grown. He has a good musical sensibility. Although it's a lo-fi album, he has written songs with complexity. This tells me that he has a lot more in mind than what he has done on this CD. I hope that he has gotten out of the solipsism in the work that follows this."},{"rating":"2","title":"truly beautiful","review":"Elliott Smith wears his inspirations on his sleeve and sings like an angel. I have fallen in love with this album. Either/or is an album full of hauntingly beautiful songs that give me faith again that at least one man is still making music worth listening to. Somehow this is the punkest album I've heard in a long time...in the gentlest, sparest way. Brilliant!"},{"rating":"2","title":"you better sit down","review":"I didn't like it as much as XO at first. It seemed a bit too lo-fi, but after many listens, it revealed itself to me. His songs just open up. The storytelling is so vivid and the emotion so intense, you can't keep away. When you hum Elliott Smith songs, it's not just because of catchy melodies. I am in love with the songs on this album. \\"Ballad of Big Nothing\\" is the best song recorded this decade. GET THIS ALBUM."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazingly delicate, beautiful and sad","review":"Elliott Smith is my favorite artist because his music is so delicate, beautiful, sad, honest and real. This album has some of my favorite Elliott songs (Between Bars and Angeles) which are sung in a fragile whisper, and the lyrics speak of the sadness, weakness and beauty of being human. While I do recommend XO first to someone new to Elliott Smith, I would recommend Either/Or be in your music collection if you appreciate beautiful and sad music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Begin here","review":"This was my first Elliott Smith CD, and I can't think of a better point to begin an Elliott Smith collection (although you should buy them all).Either/Or has the perfect mix of the softer, folkier stuff from Smith's first two CDs (\\"Roman Candle\\", \\"Elliott Smith\\") and hints of the more complex arrangements of what's to come (\\"XO\\", \\"Figure 8\\"). Highlights of the disc include, of course, the haunting \\"angeles\\", but also \\"ballad of big nothing\\", \\"rose parade\\", and the unusual sonic ride of \\"cupid's trick.\\"When faced with a new artist, it's often difficult to choose where to start your journey. For Elliott Smith, begin here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eclectic, raw and truly creative","review":"Either/Or is a fine example of Elliott Smith's unique songwriting, his \\"whisper\\" singing voice and multi-tracking harmonies drifting over complex, often schizophrenic chord progressions and song structures - indeed, his brain was wired differently. Then there is the darkness - Either/Or is a raw recording, an appropriate soundscape for the angst that appeared to plague him to the end. His psychological issues aside, Elliott Smith was a songwriter's songwriter - he was gifted artist, a tormented soul - perhaps the two go hand-in-hand, but sometimes the most beautiful things are not all fun and games.

It was described as \\"the perfect winter day album\\". In having listened to it as much as I have, I wouldn't entirely disagree. Elliott Smith's Either/Or album is amazing for what it is. The best descripton I have is this title - Raw, Painful and good. As opposed to the following Album, XO (also amazing), there is nothing at all refined about Either/Or. Which suits it to a very different and, simultaneously similar, mood.Give it a listen, give it a chance. This is a must have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre","review":"I hate to be the voice of dissent on this board. I bought this album after going to a really great Mary Lou Lord concert where all she did was rave about Eliot, so I just went out and purchased it, without ever hearing any Eliot songs. The album is very quiet and Eliot's voice is high and not very good. The lyrics are disappointingly shallow. The melodies are okay. \\"Between the Bars\\" is the one salvaging tune on the CD, it's a nice little song (little being the operative word). Then I went online and read some reviews of Eliot Smith. Critics were pretty mixed, but mostly positive. Mary said Eliot reminded her of Joni Mitchell in her \\"Cold Blue Steel\\" phase. I just can't see the connection.I just can't really see what's so great about this album. Your immensely positive reviews interest me, however, and I'll have to go back and listen to it again. I doubt I'll change my mind.

As a woman, I was blown away by Elliot's gentle, mesmerizing, sexy and yet curiously comforting voice. As a musician, I was dazzled by his sense of melody, lyricism (reminiscent of James Joyce's stream of consciousness writing), and orchestration in songs like \\"The Ballade of Big Nothing,\\" \\"Alameda,\\" and \\"No Name No.5.\\" He is now my favorite male singer-songwriter of all time (and I never had one before him). Though he struggled with life very hard, God made him an arist, and he expressed depths of emotions and inner conflicts for which most people and musicians can't find words, much less express them with such tenderness as he does. This tough tenderness transcends anything dark about his music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entranced, interested New Englander!","review":"I bought this book a couple of weeks back at a local book store.

This is by far his worst work. The biggest problem is the way that he writes. It is apparent in his other books, but not as prominent. He comes off as if he is the world's best ghost hunter and that his opinion's are fact. Many times he states in the book that he doubts and discredits any person that hasn't in the past had some kind of psychic occurence. There is no history to any \\"haunt\\". He and his medium are the only credible people in any story. My overall consenus is that he is getting old and is trying to cash in on a few more books. there was no thought or follow through, just cocky, arrogant fatigue in this book.

Their gritty, simple, energetic sound has been a trademark of sorts, and leaves audiences to enjoy the music without having to invest too much energy interpreting what they hear -- it is straight-forward picking, with a twist.Straight-forward continues with this album, but with a foggy, studio sound indicative that all good things come to an end.

I was so dissappointed when I heard this over-produced, compressed crap that isn't even their style of writing. With that said, I think they're realizing that this album was a messup and because it was their worst album, they are heading back to their roots a little and got rid of that record company.

BTW, I love all our other Oxo products...this is the only one with which I have had trouble. It is just poorly designed for continual use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Great","review":"I bought this as a gift for a friend of mine, and it works great.

I've noticed what other reviewers complained about - small pieces left in the metal folds; but I'm not concerned about it. The pieces are extremely small and will eventually fall out. There are much worse things to be bothered about than that.My biggest complaint is that the corer isn't quite big enough for large apples. It gets most of the core, just not all. What's left on the slices is edible, the leftover core in some slices is a bit tougher (maybe 1-2 slices/large apple).It's also not very good with apples that aren't straight/flat/sits crooked). Overall it's a nice tool to have for quick slicing and coring; just not the perfect ool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Apple divider works!","review":"This aple divider works great!

Cracks have appeared at each every point where the blades met the frame, indicating weakening and potential failure. Additionally, the cutting blades have lost their sharpness, so you need to exert a lot of pressure to get through an apple. I'm worried that applying all this extra pressure will cause it to break in my hands, and potentially slice off a finger!I conacyted OXO about replacment under their warranty, but they want me to box it up and send it to them. It will cost even more time and energy to mail than the product is even worth, so I'm not sure why the warranty is of any value."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk!!!","review":"I bought 2 of these because I eat a lot of apples and pears. Both of them split on the sides within 6 months. These OXO units 'look' like they are sturdier, better quality than other plastic units, but they aren't. If you use a corer/divider on a regular basis, don't waste your money on these; go for an all stainless steel unit instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm on my second one","review":"They both have cracked on the sides where the blades join the plastic.

I was really wrong. The center blades are not securely attached to the outer (very strong) metal. I pushed too hard and the blades separated from the outer ring and handles. Worse, they were jammed right in the center of the apple--and I needed that apple!Since I was low on apples it took me quite a while to figure out how to get the blades out. After using a knife to cut the apple away from the many blades I was able to salvage much of it. Needless to say this is not a time saver!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Product","review":"Inexpensive and sturdy. Works well. A must have if you are juicing because it saves alot of time.

The handles are big enough for man-sized hands, unlike the one I personally own, and the only drawback of use he's found so far was that if he leans over too close when slicing an apple, the juice can squirt you in the face! Too funny. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too big for my apples!","review":"I guess we have small apples where I am from, because this corer and divider were huge in comparison."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Junk","review":"I intended to replace an antique apple corer that I got when my Grandmother died. It was getting dull and because it was flat across the top it was a nuisance to use when making more than one pie. I saw this Oxo unit with the nice offset and I bought it. What a piece of junk. The cutting blades are dull and all it does is leave the core and apple slices attached to a web of uncut apple skin on the cutting board. Unfortunately, I didn't use the item until recently when the apples ripened. Therefore I can't return it. Anyone who is happy with this thing got a different one than I did or doesn't know what a good one is supposed to do. It's back to the knuckle-rapping antique for me - at least it cuts. I tossed this piece of junk in the trash a week ago. At least that action had a satisfying feel to it. JUNK. Also,I'm a chef, so I've used hundreds of kitchen tools and gadgets.

If you're a child you can even enjoy eating healthy foods by using this product. The apple will taste better, believe me. You won't have to mess around with no silly core. Just don't go around shopping online without your parents permission."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oxo mango corer","review":"Save your money! As a long time mango lover I was happy to see this product. After several tries I am no longer happy. If you have a stringy mango it is impossible to cut. If you have a nice firm mango it is hard to cut. It just does not work as it is cumbersome and one is unable to press down on the fruit itself to get it through the cutter. I do not recommend buying the mango corer.

For the most part this apple corer worked great while it lasted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good, but not great","review":"I like the design with the raised handles, but the cutting edge is flush with the plastic frame so the apples don't get get cut cleanly all the way through to the bottom. That means you need to turn the tool over and push the partially cut pieces through individually.For that reason alone, it's no faster than cutting and coring with a paring knife, but it's a good alternative. I use it to give my cutting hand a rest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheaply Made","review":"This apple slicer lasted through 2 apples before coming apart in my hands.

It rarely goes through completely and I always have to pull out the core so that it flays out.

For example, the red locking clip that keeps the scissors closed (scissor is based on a spring lock system) has not functioned properly and cutting anything has become a vexing challenge."},{"rating":"1","title":"I have re-evaluated my review after a year","review":"I bought these scissors for myself and liked them so much that I bought more for bridal showers. They make a nice gift when paired with the OXO soft handled vegetable peeler.They are easy to use, comfortable to hold and nice and sharp. The locking mechanism is handy as well. The price is very reasonable. However after a year, I am having a problem with the spring that is key to the scissors periodically falling out. I have to put the scissors down and replace it. So I have lowered my rating to 2 stars. The vegetable peeler still rates 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to Oxo standards","review":"I normally like Oxo products, but these fell apart almost immediately and I couldn't figure out how to put them back together.

They are awkward, not sharp, and the spring mechanism doesn't work most times. After you make one cut you have to use both hands to pull the blades apart. Useless for cutting up chicken."},{"rating":"1","title":"They Come Apart","review":"I have never been able to use these. On the first try the two halves split apart. Unlike the previous reviewer, mine will not hold tegether long enough for use. I keep trying to fix them but to no avail. Very disappointing as the handles are well made. It's a pity they just don't work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Faulty design","review":"After a month of trying to use these for poultry I tossed them. The first time I used them the nut holding the blades together loosened. If you know scissors, once this starts you might as well forget it. After one cut I would have to try to tighten the thing, usually with hands greasy from handling the bird. Oxo grip products are hit and miss. Some I like, but others are just turkeys."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only worthwhile if you have arthritis.","review":"This pair of scissors is mediocre at best. I can see it's value for those with arthritic hands, with the easy to grasp, spring loaded handles.The pair I had was very poorly put together. The spring which keeps the scissors open kept dislodging and flying across the room. The nut and bolt holding the blades together would also come undone intermittently. I fixed the problem by melting the plastic around the spring, permanently fixing it into place and by tightenign the bolts.My advice is to spend a little more money and get a pair of Henckels scissors, which are much sturdier. The blades also can be separated for easy cleaning (there are no nuts and bolts to become loose either)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money.","review":"I purchased these kitchen scissors based on the Oxo brand name. They worked great the first couple of times, but dulled very quickly. Also, I experienced the same problem as other reviewers, where the red latch will try to close during use. With a toddler into everything at home, I like the safety feature of the latch, but it's very awkward during use. Finally, cleaning these scissors leaves much to be desired. The blades don't come apart, so the only way to really get them clean is in the dishwasher. After about three washes, I noticed some rust spots on the blades! I'm going to follow the advice of other reviewers, and spend a little extra money for a better product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not too bad","review":"I have owned these scissors for several months now and was disturbed by reading some of these reviews...

It is extremely poor quality, I'm so surprised to see it still for sale."},{"rating":"1","title":"good idea, terrible quality","review":"I thought this grater would be very easy to use. I really like the design of the grater and the grip on the top. It was easy to set on the side of a bowl and grate right into it. But it broke within the first two weeks of using it. The plastic cracked and broke making it impossible to use. I would not recomend buying this grater. Spend your money on something that will last."},{"rating":"1","title":"Breaks quickly","review":"I bought one of these, thinking that the price is pretty reasonable. I got what I paid for.When you try to slide out the grater, so that you can clean inside of the ridges that hold the two plates into place, it's awkward, because you have to align it just so, or else it won't come out. I'd toss it in the dishwasher after using it. After the first round (we don't use the drying cycle, because it costs so much electricity), it came out with multiple cracks along the side. A couple months later, the plastic underneath the fine grater broke off. That made it so that the black piece up top is absolutely useless, because now it won't rest comfortably on the table. Then, the wide side broke.I went to walmart, and got an $8 box grater. That thing is solid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy","review":"It lasted just about a month before cracking and breaking. Also, because it's an oddly shaped thing, it doesn't like to sit firmly on the counter or cutting board. Get a solid box grater, and skip this trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak and broken","review":"I purchased one of these because it looked like it might save some space. It broke along the sides at the corner of the metal after only light use. Save your money and don't buy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good!","review":"This grater came highly recommended, but broke within three weeks..... the plastic broke so one side would no longer slide into the handle. I wrote to the company and they sent me another one. THAT one broke too within a couple of months. I still use it as a separate grater, but the triangle formation will not work any longer. A surprising and disappointing purchase!"},{"rating":"1","title":"lousy grater, better customer service","review":"It would have been wonderful if this grater had lasted - I really liked the idea of grating into a bowl. However, the design is such that cracks quickly develop where stress is placed on the plastic housing around the metal grate. Not only did two of mine break, but I've spotted these in thrift stores with similar breaks. The first time mine broke, I had it replaced under Oxo's lifetime warranty policy (which requires you to pay to ship your defective item back). The 2nd time, I asked to upgrade to a box grater (and I asked if I could substitute a digital photo of my broken grater, since this was my 2nd broken grater); as a goodwill gesture, customer service sent me a free box grater (which works very well) without requiring me to ship anything back or send a photo. So the grater gets 1 star and customer service 4 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lasted a couple of years","review":"I purchased the Oxo Good Grips Multi Grater back when I was first outfitting my kitchen. At the time, I really disliked box graters because they're hard to clean and once you use it, you couldn't use any of the other sides later without cleaning the entire thing.So, I bought this multi grater because it's easier to clean than a box grater and you can take apart each side and use them individually. The grater is quite sharp and worked well with hard cheeses as well as soft. After a couple of years of use, the side with larger grating holes broke. The plastic surrounding the metal grate snapped. Now the other side is starting to go. All in all, it was a decent purchase but didn't stand the test of time like I would have liked. I'm starting to rethink the box grater idea."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after 6 months","review":"I bought this from a retail store, but I wish I had found these reviews first. After about 6 months the plastic cracked and soon I will need to buy a new grater."},{"rating":"1","title":"Best if you keep looking","review":"I normally like all of Oxo's products and this started out as a real favorite. However in less than 6 months, the plastic cracked on the side by the handle making it unsafe to use. I recommend you keep looking and not waste your money on this until they design it with considerable more durability"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"This would be a wonderful little kitchen tool if the plastic sides did not break within a few months. It is very sharp, perfect for those little grating jobs where you don't want to haul out the food processor. OXO replaced this once for me and the new one started cracking within a month. I only used it for cheddar, as noted by another reviewer and it still broke soon. I will not buy this one again and think that OXO should take it off the market."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not hold up to the task at hands","review":"For parmesan cheese, lemon rind and fine delicate grating, I swear by my Microplane zester and grater. I have another shredder from Williams Sonoma that is extremely sturdy but must either be held at an angle over paper/plate or across a bowl flat, and that's sometimes awkward. I thought the Oxo Good Grips Multi Grater would be different than my box grater because it would be more structurally sound, have a better handle, collapse and take up less space, and mainly because I'm very pleased with the brand.Wrong. This has fallen apart after falling into the plate many times. The plastic has cracked on both sides, so the fact that it's collapsible makes me wonder if they were referring to the material and not the design. The blades have remained sharp but it's going to be recycled today because it simply doesn't hold up to the task."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works As Promised Until It Breaks","review":"This grates well, stores well, disassembles for easy cleaning, and is dishwasher safe, BUT IT BREAKS EASILY! It's made of cheap material that cracks, leaving it unsafe. I recommend buying a sturdier product. If it didn't work well in the beginning, I would've given it a one. This product inevitably breaks within a short period of time. It's not worth the purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke!","review":"A good idea, but after only a few uses, the plastic started cracking and finally just broke completely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better buy the box grater","review":"This looked like a good solution to the ever-vexing problem of storage, but it turned out to be a waste of money. It started to fall apart from the first use. Now it's just another piece of junk that's going in the trash can...splintered plastic, bent metal and all. OXO's box grater is a far better choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yes you can count on this breaking...","review":"I liked that it folded for storage, but -- now that the plastic has cracked -- there is no need to store it. Bad bad grater."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works until it breaks","review":"We've tried a few of these because they look like they would be more comfortable to hold and use, and stronger, than the more common and less expensive stamped stainless steel variety. And they are. . .until the plastic gives way, and only one side remains useable. A beefier design could make this potentially good product into a good product. Until it's redesigned, spend your money elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Neat design--bad materials","review":"Although I like the design--especially the non-skid feet--I'm ultimately very disappointed in this grater. Like other reviewers, I've found that after less than six weeks of use, the plastic has started cracking.Contrary to what other reviewers have said, however, you CAN separate the two halves of the grater for cleaning or storage, but I was disappointed by how you can barely spread the grater's feet out more than a few inches...I wish it had a full range of movement. As it is, you can only position the feet about 4 inches apart. I was hoping for a wider foot print for things like quesadillas.Overall, a disappointing product. Neat design, bad materials."},{"rating":"1","title":"Breaks too soon","review":"I loved my new grater for a few months -- until the plastic on one side split, meaning it no longer stands up on its own, and the broken side cannot be used. What a pity it wasn't more sturdy! All I ever grated with it was cheddar, so it's not as if I used it for anything too hard."},{"rating":"1","title":"another good while it lasted","review":"I too have experienced the plastic cracking and breaking. Would not buy another."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to usual OXO standards","review":"After having this grater for a couple of years, the plastic frame started cracking in several places and finally broke altogether. The grater wasn't mistreated -- dishwasher cleaning was okay per the instructions, and excessive force wasn't used in grating. It's just a faulty combination of design and materials used. I'm surprised to see OXO still has them on the market. I'm not quite sure if the \\"Satisfaction Guarantee\\" covers this kind of problem, but I'm certainly not satisfied. With the time that's passed, it's unclear where the item was purchased (maybe even a gift) so how to pursue the warranty is unclear. I look a lot more carefully now if/when I buy an OXO product. I certainly don't recommend this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it...","review":"The only good thing about this grater is that it doesn't take a lot of space, but after using it few times it cracked on the bottom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lasted a couple months","review":"This thing kept falling apart when I grated with it.

The only good things about it are the non-skid rubber footings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken, and Bad","review":"When we got this grater, it was nice, the grip is nice. It is hard to fit in a bowl, so we used a plate. Now the plastic has broken, the plastic is very thin, and apparently this item was not made to last. I have always thought of Oxo as being a good product, but lately several Oxo items have been junk.Do yourself a favor, and get an all metal one, with no plastic to break."},{"rating":"1","title":"kinda rinky dink","review":"Who care about a review for multi grater? I think it is fine, although I had one that was much cheaper and was more stable, unfortunately it broke so I bought this one because I am low on space and I like things that fold up and go away. How much do I really grate cheese? Not that much plus cheese is full of fat, something I am avoiding as my waistline expands. But on the off chance I need a grater this one works fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loved it, but...","review":"I bought my grater because I have always liked other OXO products - but I was disappointed. I was never able to actually take the thing apart for the so-called \\"easy cleaning,\\" and it broke very quickly. I think I had it for a year before it started cracking (with low usage - maybe used 20 times. Maybe.) When it did work, it grated well. But I returned it and got an old-fashioned box grater instead. I'm much happier with that, knowing that the stainless steel will not break anytime in the near future!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ok until it breaks is right!","review":"Mine did break too. I ended up buying a box grater soon after I bought this one. When I did use it I was more worried about cutting my self because it was so unstable. Do yourself a favor and don't buy this product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"World's worst cheese grater","review":"DO NOT BUY THIS. It breaks in 4 places on the large hole shredder side even with light pressure and soft cheeses like brie. Only moderately hard cheeses like cheddar or moderate pressure will breaks it after very little use, as mine did, and which I had to repair with super-glue. The plastic is poor quality (i.e., too weak for intended use and this design) and the design is faulty (too little plastic aroun each metal shred grid). Best to buy an old style handle-at-top all-metal one at thrift store or Goodwill rather than this extemely poor product. A complete waste of money and time, in repairs. OXO usually makes fine products. This is not one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mine Broke, Too!","review":"I had my grater for about a year, and washed it by hand the whole time, never in a dishwasher, and the cheap plastic cracked and soon completely fell apart. I thought that the collapsable design would be great, but I think that I would prefer a sturdy box grater any day. I love oxo, but what a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fails the test","review":"My wife and I have had very good experiences with OXO products, and after handling this grater in a store we expected to continue that experience.However, after a very short period of use (we use a grater every day for grating cheese - both hard and firm - for personal use) the plastic frame began to crack and disintegrate, rendering the grater useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"OXO is slacking","review":"I am usually a fan of OXO products but I have noticed lately that they are not as good as they used to be with shoddy execution or questionable workmanship. I, like everyone else, was hoping this would be the solution to my storage issues with graters but it proved useless less than a year later and with little use to stress the thing out (almond paste and cheddar cheese were the only things I used it for). It developed cracks in the plastic that are impossible to repair. Also, I do not think this is a good grater for the supposed market of arthritic people - it can be difficult to put together.So, in short, it stinks for those suffering pain in their hands and for those who cook. Save your money and just buy a KitchenAid grater."},{"rating":"1","title":"great grater .... but not for long","review":"I originally got this grater about two years ago and gave it a very good rating based on the ease of use and cleaning; however, I am amending my opinion after having small cracks appear in the plastic beside both grating surfaces. These cracks quickly grew bigger until finally the item is unusable.I guess for the low price you can buy a new one every couple of years but really, a kitchen tool should last longer than a year or two. I'd rather pay more and have it last. It seems that many people have been having this same problem.Good design. Flawed execution. This will make me think twice before buying an OXO product again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It broke in a month","review":"I have enjoyed OXO products in the past, so when my last grater failed, I decided to try the OXO grater. Unfortunately, the plastic broke in less than a month. It was also a bit clumsy to use. Why aren't there more choices made entirely of stainless steel, in easy to store shapes?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do your research before you purchase this product:","review":"I was considering this grater, based on the overall quality of the OXO line of gadgets and the ease of storage, until I had a chance to view it at a local brick and morter store. The concept is a good idea, but, when open, the grater does not sit and stay in a stable manner. I would be hard conviced that during a grating process that the whole thing would not collapse. Did not impress me as the safest tool to be using.Couple that with the fact that for the serious cook, you are limited in your choices of different grate and slice sizes, I would not recommend this item. There are better choices, with more functions and a stable footing out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mrs","review":"Do not buy this item unless you do not mind replacing it in 3 months.

DO NOT BUY!!","review":"I put this grater on my wedding registry because I liked the fold-up, space-saving, and ergo-friendly design. BIG MISTAKE! Where do I begin? First, it tries to fold up while you're grating cheese, which is downright annoying, so I started using it unassembled, which worked for a very short while until it cracked (about the 5th time I used it). Then it cracked more. And more. And more, until all that was left was the metal grating plate. Even though it hurts to hold it while grating, and it's highly inconvenient, I've been using it this way for 4 years now, since I refuse to buy a new grater until I'm sure I find one that won't fall apart like this one. And because, believe it or not, the metal grater itself, is really perfect. I just wish they'd found a housing for it that actually works!"},{"rating":"1","title":"cheap material, breaks easily","review":"I was disappointed that this grater only lasted for a couple of weeks. At first it broke into two pieces, so I could only use one half (even when it stood upright as pictured, it never did stay open or grip the counter- it was never stable, and either closed or fell down while grating). Then I was left with a flat grater that was difficult to use. The piece that was left cracked on the corners, and broke apart within a couple of uses. Usually Oxo makes great products. This is not a good product. Save your money and buy a different model grater. You will be happier with an all metal model for sure!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Bad design, made with inferior materials","review":"I was looking for a grater that was easy to clean. This one seems like a good idea... until it collapses on you. The sides don't spread apart far enough, so it is unstable and without proper pressure it folds up.

Averatec notebooks are very powerful packages for a relatively modest price, however they do run hot, just like their more expensive cousins. I do need a cooler, but it has to be one that blows air toward the bottom of the case, since that is where the air intake is located. A negative pressure would work against the computer cooling fan and would likely in higher internal temperature. The widely distributed Targus works the same way. I don't know how many laptops have the air intake on the bottom, but that is something to check before buying one of these coolers.

After I received the movie, five of us watched it but only two finished watching it. My niece and I were the only two that finished the movie, however, overall I wasn't a big fan either. My niece was the only one that thought it was a good movie but she is also the only one that is college age.The concept was fabulous, the film just didn't live up to the concept. Alot of good questions were asked, and struggles shown, but no real solutions. We all have struggles but I was hoping to use the film to help others find solutions to those struggles. Not just talk about them and then end the movie basically in the same situation...struggling. But then again, maybe that's reality. However, I do wish they had some sort of hope and direction to help solve it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I've passed it on!","review":"This movie was good enough that I've passed it on to my local Teen group (majority of them are boys ~ which they will easily relate to). An honest look at this world and the \\"pleasures\\" it offers. These pleasures are momentary. The phrase that comes to mind is \\"There are a lot of people who believe in Jesus, but they don't FOLLOW Jesus.\\" That's what needs to transpire. Jesus wants you to follow him.

It's about a bunch of (rich?) college kids visiting every country in Europe and behaving like the ugly Americans. Don't buy this.

Really inspires people to learn what it means to follow Jesus. Most Americans really don't know what it means to give up everything and follow Jesus. This movie inspires people to do just that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware Catholics, of Trojan Horse","review":"I bought the DVD with a chance it might be a positive witness for teens and a forum for discussing faith in Jesus Christ to offset difficult cultural influences. I should have suspected a trojan horse with a cover picture in front of St Peter's Basilica. I found most discussions and topics acceptable to a Catholic audience. However, an unsupported and repeated claim that Jesus did not found a Church will not fly in Catholic circles. Try to find that claim in scripture without ignoring direct wording to the contrary! Fundamentalists should find this section righteous, but for a Catholic, unless you want to have scripture interpreted for you by young fledgling college students with no philosophy or theology study, I suggest you pass on this video."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Thought Process Was?","review":"Okay, expected something totally different like something powerful or meaningful.It was silly, boring and a waste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self-reinforcing for evangelicals","review":"I confess that I could not finish watching this film because it was incredibly boring. The previous reviews are all correct: these guys represent every stereotype of the ugly American, expressing complete ignorance about everything in other countries. They seemed to completely lack self-awareness and express surprise that anyone wouldn't be evangelical. Maybe this film could be meaningful for evangelicals who want to learn what non-Christians or former Christians believe, but I highly doubt that anyone who wants real dialogue or ecumenical understanding will find it here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh, it's a filmed sermon that I don't mind watching","review":"I will preface this with the fact that I am an atheist.The introduction to this film is misleading because the guys say they're questioning their faith when they are really focused on defining Christianity for themselves. Their exploration is flawed since they interview primarily American tourists and other English speakers. I disagree with some of their beliefs (i.e: Pre-Marital Sex/ Marriage is Between a Man and a Woman), especially the discussion of trying to sway non-believers to convert by doing good.The overall message is still good that they're focused on becoming better people and focusing on the core of Christian values. So meh, because I don't agree with a lot of their spiritual beliefs, but I'll give it 2 stars for working on being better, nonjudgemental people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"Very slow... hard to get into... never got past the first 30-minutes.

The eccentric lyrics, that you do not pay much attention to because of the incredible virtuosity of the musicians, also sounds silly. THis is boring elevator music with lyrics.However, \\"I'll find my way home\\" is a stunning and majestic masterpiece of sheer beauty.

I was doubtful of the sound quality of adapting through the cassette deck, but it was cheaper than an FM transmitter. It actually sounds really great, and there's really no distinguishable loss in sound quality. The only downside was that it constantly clicked all the time (the cassette itself, not the sound from the stereo), but I only noticed it when the volume was very low or silent.Then it changed. Now, after about 2 months of use, it has lost all ability to play midrange, and instead crackles loudly in its place. Turning the midrange all the way off solves this, but then you've got no midrange."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a fantastic value","review":"What a great little item. I have a ten year old vehicle that has nice speakers, but only a cassette/radio combo. This pops into the cassette player and the little cord hangs out the front to attach to the iPod. Works great and I can adjust the sound either from the iPod, the cassette, or both. I was a little concerned at first, because it would pop itself out the first couple of times I tried to use it. The unit is shaped just like a cassette and I suspect it just had to get \\"seated\\" into my older player unit which has played a lot of cassettes in ten years. So after maybe 1-2 days of it being finnicky and popping out, it is happily staying in through bumps and whatever, until I decide to eject it. I highly recommend this for a low tech, high quality solution!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DREADFUL Writing ruins what should be an important book","review":"This is the only book I've ever taken back to the store because the writing wasn't good enough to be read -- no exaggeration, this reads like a sixth-grader wrote it; it's awful.

They most certainly deserve more than this crummy book offers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a very good book.","review":"This book may please casual fans or beginners to the Southern Rock genre. It's poorly written and hardly offers any insight to Lynyrd Skynyrd. There are a lot of errors and gaps, which will leave you with more questions about this band than before reading it. No extensive discography (I'm still wondering about the exact order of Muscle Shoals material) or any revelations concerning releases or the band and its members. Feels like a lot of gossip and hearsay. Definitely not satisfying. One star is for doing a book on Southern Rock."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book","review":"I liked this book. The stories are very entertaining and I learned a great deal about the Band from the very early days until now. It's quite a story and much deeper than I had known. For that alone, I appreciated the book. While everything obviously hasn't been rosy and there are disagreements today, I felt the book was fair. I enjoyed the pace of the book and would recommend it as a \\"must read\\" for any Skynyrd fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST HAVE FOR ANY SKYNYRD FAN!","review":"This is a greatly indept book that was highly researched. Although some events in the book may sound questionable, Marley Brant clearly states that he took all sides of the stories and put them in there. This book is so direct that it actualy stired up some bad blood with the band today. The book tells the story of the band from its days as One Percent to the rebirth of the band after the plane crash. Along with being a great read it is also accompied with alot of rare photos. CLEARLY A MUST HAVE FOR ANY SKYNYRD FAN!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book - Don't Miss It","review":"LYNYRD SKYNYRD is an enjoyable, well written book. It tracks the band from its scrappy beginnings to international recognition, honky tonks to stadiums.I liked quite a few things about this book. Author Brant conducted many personal interviews and the resulting first person accounts made for very interesting, often amusing and occasionally poignant reading. There were also wonderful photographs, many I had never seen and I am a longtime fan. The story was told chronologically and that made for easy reading, as the book has quite a cast of characters.I would recommend this book to a friend without hesitation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast exchange for defective first cartridge!!!!!!","review":"First cartridge received was defective, it was leaving a 1/4 inch black line on the left side of every page.

Thus far, I'm happier with Schaum's than Cliffs. Cliff's is incredibly vague (as is Schaum's, but less often) and so much so that it hampers the scholar from fully grasping the concepts. A major, albeit reoccurring issue I encounter with math guides is that they are way too vague, or they're missing some steps, which happen to be critical in the comprehension of the topic. I can assure you that if you purchase Cliffs notes that you will be overwhelmingly frustrated and irate.

I do not think Elton knew how to deal with his fame and got carried away with his ego and less with his abilities. His albums AFTER this one do not come close to the earlier ones like Tumbleweed, Madman, Honky Chateau or Don't Shoot Me. GYBR is a very good album- with some great material. A few of my favorites are Sweet Painted Lady, Grey Seal, All the Young Girls Love Alice, Funeral/Love Lies Bleeding, Danny Bailey, I've Seen that Movie too. Definitely worth buying!

THANK YOU"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quintessential Elton John","review":"While Crocodile Rock may have been his major springboard (Don't Shoot Me ... 1972), the 16 songs featured on Goodbye Yellow Brick Road are arguably the finest of his many collaborations with Bernie Taupin. From the solemn-turned-rocking Funeral for a Friend/Loves Lies Bleeding to the whimsical ballad Harmony, John gives us a splendid example of what one writer once labeled as \\"his superlative musical perception.\\" And few albums spotlight the talents of supporting cast like this: Nigel Olsson in particular deserves major applause for his drumming technique, especially on Funeral for a Friend/Love Lies Bleeding. I loved this album when it first appeared on vinyl, and I love it as much today on CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elton's Sgt. Pepper","review":"Goodbye Yellow Brick Road was the 2nd album I ever bought, and still in my all time top five. It's taken about 30 years, but I finally realized that it was intentionally modeled after the Beatles classic Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. Consider:Both albums start with a medley of two inseparable tracks. (Funeral For a Friend / Love Lies Bleeding vs Sgt Pepper / With A Little Help from My Friends).Both contain tracks segued by animal noises. Both contain tracks intended to sound live but actually recorded in the studio. (Bennie & the Jets / Within You Without You)Elton was a huge Beatles fan and within a year of recording this album covered Lucy In the Sky with Diamonds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow, Ain't Technology Great!","review":"We All know Elton John's signature album.

Originally released on MCA as a double LP and later as a double CD set, *Goodbye Yellow Brick Road* covers a lot of ground, from John Lennon (\\"Funeral For A Friend\\") to prostitutes (\\"Sweet Painted Lady\\"), teenage lesbians (\\"All The Girls Love Alice\\"), a scathing indictment of how the Hollywood star system builds people up only to tear them down (\\"Candle In The Wind\\"), and gangsters (\\"The Ballad of Danny Bailey (1909-34)\\").

Bernie's lyrics positvely blow, however, and get in the way of Elton himself. Songs like the obnoxiously homophobic All the Young Girls Love Alice, racist and sexist Sweet Painted Lady, I've Seen That Movie Too and This Song Has No Title have some of the worst lyrics ever. And some of the songs are awful even without the lyrics: the supremely annoying hit Bennie and the Jets, Roy Rogers, Social Disease, Ballad of Danny Bailey, I've Seen That Movie Too...Anyway, there are only five songs I do like on this album: Funeral for a Friend/Love Lies Bleeding, Candle in the Wind, title track, Grey Seal and Saturday Night's All Right for Fighting.

Pepper, The White Album, then this.","review":"This album is one of the best pop albums of the seventies. Elton was at his peak and the band was tight - at least in the studio. While everyone has heard Candle in the Wind ad nauseum, what many listeners may not realize is that for every hit on this album - title track included - this album features some of the best album oriented pop ever produced. The Ballad of Danny Bailey, Harmony, Roy Rogers, and Saturday Night's Alright For Fighting are the kind of story tunes that draw you in and sparkle with John/Taupin genius. While many modern albums these days give you one or two hits with a selection of poor to mediocre tunes, every song here is a gem. If you weren't around in the seventies, pick this up and listen to some of the best white bread pop ever produced. The re-mastered version actually adds to the experience. Should be in any serious collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"This printing is GARBAGE.","review":"I agree with the first reviewer.

It is still not a light breezy read. While non-mathematical, you do still need to pay attention to the various concepts as Keel explains them.Some of the observations are very elegant, like gravitational microlensing. And the analysis of the vast data accumulated from IRAS, Hubble and Chandra.

We liked the \\"Good Grips\\" handle and the rounded brush. Beyond that, it is useless. The sponge never recieves enough soap, which is frustrating, and the durability is nil. After less that a week, on average, the sponge separates from the plastic backing that attaches it to the soap dispensing handle, rendering it useless. The sponge is barely worn, yet you have to throw it out and buy a new one. This is disappointing for a company that seems to have such well made products. We sent an e-mail describing the design problem to OXO customer service, and did not recieve a satisfactory reply. I hope they listen to their customers and pull this off the market, and replace it with a more durable product."},{"rating":"1","title":"I AGREE: Bad Product","review":"I agree with all the other reviews! The sponge separates from the plastic after only a few weeks!

I LOVE all my other OXO products...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Soap Dispenser - A misnomer","review":"This brush has to be coaxed and begged, to allow the soap to come out! Do not buy this product, I bought a couple for my wife and her friends, and now every time I am in the kitchen with my wife, and she's washing the dishes I get the evil eye. One of the sponges unstuck from the brush within two weeks. Her friend's brush broke while she was trying to take off the sponge.This is really a poor design for a company with such a big reputation. I hope they read this and re-design this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ripoff on sponges","review":"I feel like it is a big ripoff to keep buying new sponges and to have them come unglued after a few uses. I cannot believe that a company of this size cannot find a better solution to the problem. I also feel that you are taking peoples money by selling a good washer and then selling inferior sponges. Once you have the washer it is natural to buy refills, and by the time you figure out that the product is defective you have already thrown away the wrapper and have no recourse, but to not buy more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor showing from a great brand","review":"I bought this thinking I would love it as much as every other OXO product I own - boy was I wrong. The sponge constantly twisted off the handle during use, and after just two weeks, the tabs that connect the sponge to the handle broke off completely. This product does not live up to the OXO name. Go buy a cheap no-name brand; you'll be happier with it's performance."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent book","review":"Probably the best book on the subject of the Model A Ford.

But I think the previous reviewers must have been expecting something else. A LOT of trance is somewhat repitious - thus inducing a trance-like state. I have heard trance attempts that got TOO repititious, and this is not it. There are a few songs here that could have been better, but none of them are bad. If you just want break beats and drum & bass, go check out Digital Empire: DJ Girl. Plenty of that there. If you want good general trance, get this album. If you want GREAT goa trance, check out Hallucinogen (Shpongle) and Pleiadians."},{"rating":"2","title":"star-studded trance performance","review":"in short, this is a quality cd that is worth my time to review it.

Internal Wrangler was such an excellent realease - it had passion, a fresh sound and variety between tracks while still being cohesive.Walking With Thee is OK, but lacks all of these elements. I was so excited to come across Clinic, hoping they could break new ground in music (cuz there aren't too many who have done that since Mercury Rev's \\"Yerself Is Steam\\"). However, with this record it appears Clinic is just a one trick pony.With their new found acceptance by the general public, I don't think Clinic will ever feel the need to stray from their singular sound. Tis Sad indeed."},{"rating":"1","title":"All downhill from here","review":"Sheesh, this band doesn't just rip off the VU more than the Jesus and Mary Chain ever did- they take it ALL from one VU album.It's galling to me how this band doesn't even seem to have a clue how to appropriate their influences - there is nothing here but pure regurgitation, and they've been doing it for SEVEN YEARS without the slightest change up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Clinic Live","review":"Clinic's studio material is not bad, but their live shows are quite poor.

However I wasn't aware, when I read it, that it was the last in a trilogy so it might be preferable to read the other two first.I found myself getting gradually absorbed into the story, feeling compelled to follow the main characters through their quest for the Grail, honour and acceptance.The battle scenes were very descriptive as was general life in mid fourteenth century France, all making this an excellent and persuasive read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic series","review":"I really enjoyed this trilogy and plan to read Cornwell's entire works.First class."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vintage Cornwell (but read previous books first)","review":"This is a great book and an enjoyable read. One point that should be made up front is that it is definetly part 3 of an on-going story and if you have not read the Archers Tale or Vagabond then you are not going to get the most from the story. The plot line is rather involved and Cornwell does not spend much verbiage on a recap. Also if you are a fan of the Sharpe novels (as I am) it is not long before you start seeing the similarities (ex: Sharpe with faithful Irish sidekick Sgt. Harper, Thomas with faithful Scots sidekick Robbie Douglas). This however is a minor quibble, Cornwell is a master at blending history and a good yarn into a seamless enjoyable package."},{"rating":"2","title":"great action","review":"The Middle Ages need more expousureThis does it! The Holy Grail has been a legard for milliminumsTold very well"},{"rating":"1","title":"Suspect Motives","review":"The greatest impediment to enjoying a novel (for me) is when characters act in ways that don't make sense, thus poisoning the rationale for the story line. Even given the notable lack of self-control of Cornwell heroes when it comes to women, in this case the major plot line was Thomas abandoning his course for the woman. The only motivation offered for Thomas's attraction is her beauty. But there is absolutely no indication of any character lurking beneath the body! I haven't counted, but I doubt she has more than 30 words of dialogue in the entire book. For the hero to make a 90-degree behavioral turn for a woman, one has to understand the woman to understand why he would do so. Because there is no credible explanation, the book from a story perspective has to fail. I hasten to add that the historical accuracy, battle scenes, etc. are Cornwell's normal high quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring carnage?

It is connected to my XP system via USB 2.0 and has about 20.5 GB used (mostly music). Now these errors seem to occur at random.As far as I can figure, it might have to do with the amount of data on it, but with only 20.5 GB used (out of 160) doesn't seem likely.I really don't have time to goof around with this -- so I bought a Seagate external 160GB HD (USB 2.0), but am unable to even copy data from the Iogear drive to the new one. I am going to try deleting all the non-music files from it and see if I can at least avoid having to reload everything onto the new drive.

Indeed, when it comes out, I may even find myself glad to have read this book, as it seems mainly to consist in providing backstory for what comes next. In the meantime however, I am sadly disappointed. Coulter had the makings of a real winner here, but between bringing us up to date on the last generation of Sherbrookes and setting up one of the youngsters for a story of his own, the love story of James and Corrie as well as the developing relationship between Jason and Judith, is left with very little substance. I have to give Coulter credit, for the denoument of the mystery subplot takes one by complete surprise, and the interplay between Corrie and James, what there is of it, is charming and amusing. These together almost make the book worth a read. Almost that is. . . but not quite."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blech...","review":"I genuinely enjoyed the story of Alexandra and Douglas Sherbrooke's stormy relationship, and how the finally settled into a decent couple. So it came as a complete shock to find that the qualities that drew me to them (their tempestuousness, spark and vigor) were completely devoid in this novel. Their children were equally as tepid; the only calling cards were their handsome good looks, which we were constantly reminded of. For every good Coulter book, there is an equally bad selection, and unfortunately this is one of the bad ones. On the plus side, it does set up the potential for a good Coulter book to come next."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grade\\"S\\"for Sorry","review":"I'm mad that Catherine Coulter actually put such a weak novel together.Don't waste your money buying it or waste your time borrowing it from anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really bad material from an excellent author","review":"I couldn't believe how much I disliked this book. I gave it two stars just because Coulter is such a usually fine author. However, she missed the boat on this one. I read about 100 pages (or less) at the beginning and maybe about 30 pages at the end just to get my money's worth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read it Instead","review":"I've only listened through the 3rd CD and I can't seem to get into the story. I don't know yet if its the story line or Ms. Flosnik's grating voice. But her voice interpretation for James, Jason and Douglas (and all the men) make them sound ridiculous. Ms. Flosnik (as well as all female readers) should not try to sound like men -- just read it straight. I think I'd rather read this one. I don't recommend the sound recording."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry excuse for a Sherbrooke Book","review":"This book was so boring. I was very, very disappointed. The relationship between the twin (what's his name) and Corrie seemed almost incestuous. She was more like a kid sister to them. I never, ever saw the relationship and the passion grow or ignite between these two. Waste of time. Catherine Coulter played her readers with this mess. She could have had more respect for us than to put this book out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but could be a little better...","review":"After just finishing the book, I have to say I liked it, but am deeply confused. The title led me to believe it would be about the Sherbrooke Twins, when in fact it seemed to be more about their father and mother. The wording at times seemed confusing and the plot a little jumpy. But I did enjoy it once the plot got rolling. I can't wait to find out what happens with Jason."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only persistence kept me reading this one.","review":"This is the story of James and Jason Sherbrooke, loving twin sons of Alexandra/Douglas book. They are too beautiful by far ...and the reader certainly tires of hearing over and over how beautiful they are...and are steering clear of the marriage trap. Suddenly they are involved in protecting their father from an assassin and everyone joins together to this goal. The story line is weak and for some reason the characters never really come alive. They're \\"nice guys\\" and a nice family but the characters never grab you. The writing is very stiff and what little romance is in this isn't very inspiring. Certainly the 2 sex scenes are not impressive. Basically, don't bother with this one. In fact I think I'll be slower to pick out CC's bks in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of her best works","review":"There is not much danger to Corriander (Corrie), the love interest of the first-born twin. And not much show of possessiveness, jealousy, nor romance between the two. No sign of pain nor struggle when apart. Just a flat \\"love\\" story. And surprisingly, how it is titled, the Sherbrooke Twins, would suggest to readers that both the twins would find love. Unfortunately, only one does and its James. I think the author started out wrong with naming it the Sherbrooke twins and should have a book title more fitting for James and Corrie's story and not get too focused on the part of the sons being twins."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not her best","review":"I have read all of her romance novels and have to say this is not her best. It is good in parts but others aren't worth reading. The ending was so sad that I cried for Jason and was so hoping for a better story for him in the next book in the Sherbrooke saga."},{"rating":"1","title":"zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz","review":"I read the whole book waiting for it to get good. Too many storylines for such a short book. If Ms. Coulter wanted this to be an good book she would have been better off spending more time developing the relationships between the characters. Corrie is the only character that was adequately developed (note adequately development is just that merely adequately) You dont get the opportunity to feel the stresses and the emotions b/c you dont really understand the characters. Granted this is a mere romance novel and one shouldnt expect much. But this is definitly the worst book I've ever read. I felt more emotion out of the stoic Edward Wilson in the Movie \\"The Good Shepard\\" Fortunately \\"Jason\\" was developed a little more towards the end to allow \\"Lyons Gate\\" to be a potentially decent Romance nove. I'm definitly going to go read the reviews on it first before I waste my time, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong Movie","review":"I have been on a French movie kick lately and find many of the Alain Delon movies to be especially entertaining. So I was quite psyched to put this rare movie in the DVD tray the other night for an evening's entertainment. From the opening credits I knew something was off - instead of an ultra-cool French movie from the 60s, I was presented with a very strident 1930s British movie about fishing trawlers (see The Last Adventurers (1937)).What a disappointment! At first I was incredulous and expected to see a grainy Alain Delon make an appearance, but alas he would have been a 2-year old toddler. What makes matters worse is that this movie was obviously captured from a tape source and is a poor presentation of the boring 1937 film. After about 5 minutes I accepted I had wasted my time and money (hello Amazon) and that Alain would be sitting this one out. Either this is gross incompetence or outright bait-and-switch, but do not be deceived by the cover art on this Synergy DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not detailed enough","review":"When I searched for the specific book that I wanted, this book popped up. It is a overall good book, but not what I need. I did ask the seller a question about it, but since they are a volume dealer, they could not answer my specific questions about it. I took a chance and lost out, suppose it is the fault of both parties, the buyer and seller. I wish sellers knew what they were selling :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Back to Form!","review":"This is a hauntingly wonderful CD from The Residents. The lyrics seem quite banal when read on the page, but hearing them sung is akin to coming across a diary one kept as a child and re-discovered in an attic many years later - there is a creepy sense of familiarity with the themes but an increduality that the words were actually put on paper in innocence....

To my shock and disappointment, the first song on the cd was some hip hop type music with Tonex who i'm not a fan of. Ms. Cesear has put one foot into the world and one foot with God and in my eyes is between 2 opinions with this CD. I think hip hop belongs in the world and has no place in gospel. I was disppointed with Shirley Cesar on this one! Would not reccomend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Support good music... Give this a try...","review":"I was drawn in by their innovative and startingly original video for \\"Pony Ride\\". It is truly amazing that Mtv has given soo much airplay to such an (until now) obscure band. The bulk of the material off of this album, has been released in some form or another, dating back from 2002. They basically combined their previous two ep's (White Printz and Red Prinze).However, the album adds up to a hypnotically entrancing, fun filled smorgasbord of beats, melody and rhyme. From the opening track, \\"OUNO\\", through the closing track, \\"Come Ova\\", each track is consistently engaging. Standouts include, \\"I Come With Water\\", \\"Microphone Diseases\\", \\"Pony Ride\\", \\"Bambino\\" and \\"Vila Attack\\".I can't wait to see what the future holds for this impressive new presence on an otherwise bleak musical landscape."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Lotta the Same","review":"I love a loose rock group as much as the next guy. Probably more. With their debut Hot Printz, Australia's Bumblebeez 81 are so loose they're slack. But lazy is another story. Most of these 14 songs and/or fragments are based around a good beat, fuzz guitar, raspy vocals, and occasional rapping. It's akin to backporch alternative. Singer Chris Colonna even sounds like grandpa with his teeth out. And it's intermittently fun. \\"Pony Ride\\", the single, is genius/stupid with its chorus of \\"come on ride the pony gotta get it up\\". \\"Come Ova\\" is a cute Pixies rip. Otherwise, the rap is lame. The playing is amateur. And the songs kinda sound the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"This cd gave me a headache!!","review":"Okay i love Punk, i like Techno alot, I even like white girls rapping, but this cd is just bad!

I admire their courage. I am grateful they worked diligently to find these masters of death. I am dissappointed they felt they had to do so by putting themselves in danger with the result of these leaders being released. A wonderful story of adventure to be sure. But was the adventure inspired by an erroneous label placed on our national guardsmen, or too many chiefs and not enough indians?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The book was short on action and long on complaining about their treatment by the Army.

The John LaSalle Quartet also includes Bill Smith and Hugh Martin to round out the group. Arrangements are by Billy Ver Planck who is wonderful in whatever he does (also Marlene's husband). Among the well known songs are Let There Be Love, I'll Never Smile Again, Out of This World, Just in Time, and Clementine. The title song, by John LaSalle and Hugh Martin starts out this truly unique and well worth having CD. Nothing Marlene has done is a disappointment and I have them all, so I know for sure that's a true statement. Well worth it if you can find a copy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overblown and self centred","review":"I bought this CD reminiscing about when live music was more dangerous and less predictable than the arena orientated music we experience now, where we were accustomed to musicians taking risks in their performances.Alas this CD is an object lesson in self-centredness. From the first track where Stevie Marriot tells the audience to 'shut up' to the final agonising minutes of the long, foggy jam that is 'Walk on Gilded Splinters' , it appears the assembled talent have disappeared up their own collective jacksy.This particular set predicts the interminable delivery of 'progressive rock' that became familiar in the 70's whose only saving grace was that it resulted in the reactive rise of punk and other celebrations of the short sharp song.Humble Pie were never very big in the UK and I think this demonstrates why."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Book!","review":"This book is one of the best I've read on WWI.

I decided to read it first to my husband, a Lt Col in the USAF (with tactical experience in both Gulf Wars), to see what he thought of it first. Honestly, we couldn't finish it. While Richard Maybury brings out some good points about historical events - things you don't hear often- he also leaves out a deal. He says up front he has a bias, but my husband considered the book biased to the point of dishonest propaganda - something Maybury says the US Government has used almost since day one. He's entitled to his opinion, but his ideas about how the country should be run are simplistic to the point of absurdity, and, my husband says, completely unworkable in this day of airplanes, missiles, and dirty bombs.Maybury should stick to economics.

They are brilliant and redefined my world.But I tell you true that Promethea reads like someone who can't write trying hard to sound like Neil Gaiman while revamping an old superhero. Don't waste your money on this one. Maybe once Alan has time to season the heroine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Philosphy meets the 4 color world","review":"Philosphy as the setting for the drama of a comic book? Or is that the other way around: a comic book as a setting for philosphy. Either way it's different and it's interesting.Alan Moore underpins his drama with timeless philosphy and well researched metaphysics. As long as he can maintain the drama in this complicated form he'll be fine.The characters are intriguing and touching, with a degree of surreal clarity that grabs hold and won't let go.Unfortunately this collection has the first 6 issues but the initial story arc doesn't climax until issue 8 where events are resolved and it prepares to pick up again.Allow me to mention the high marks for the book's excellent production values: good paper and color printing, excellent binding, solid construction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Conventional Moore","review":"Unlike Moore's ground-breaking work on Watchmen and From Hell, Promethea is more traditional fare. However, because it is by Moore, this is still above the majority of comics/graphic novels being produced today. In some ways, this is Moore at his post-modern best, as the very nature of this character (channeled through the years by the artists that imagine her best) allows him to discuss the power of the creative imagination, while still indulging in the kind of esoterica that has filled his other work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Graphic SF Reader","review":"I looked at this for a long time, picked it up off and on, and kept dismissing it as looking way too girly or frilly. I was wrong. This is good. The use of myth and story is excellent, and the hero group in the city is hilarious, as can be the ex-Prometheas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Moore's not on top of his game","review":"Readers who know Neil Gaiman's Sandman universe will find a lot of familiar territory in the world of Promethea. Like the Sandman saga, we find a narrative set on the liminal landscape between the psychic realm and the material realm. Here we have the \\"Immateria\\" instead of the Dreaming. Also like the Sandman, the premise becomes a vehicle for exploring both worlds and their intersection. Unlike the Sandman, the chronicles of Promethea are flat, dry, two-dimensional, and predictable. A lot of superhero-style action will disappoint readers looking for the sophisticated antiheroes of Watchmen or the visionary storytelling of From Hell. I recommend that new Moore readers look to those works instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"He's oversinging and skidding on the high notes","review":"I can believe what Voice Lover said: that this guy has a good voice on other recordings. But this is not a good performance: he is oversinging and you can hear the stress in his voice on all the high notes.

(My ideal tenor voice, the one I envy the most, is Jussi Bjoerling.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible album","review":"Giordani can be excellent in the theater, but this album seems to have caught him at a bad time. He always seems to be changing gears during his performances here. He seems to have several voices in each register and you don't know from one minute to the next what you are going to get. I found this album to be a very unpleasant listening experience and think it was a mistake for Giordani to let Naxos issue it.If you want to hear a better performance by Giordani, pick up a copy of Verdi's Jerusalem on Philips which catches him in much better vocal estate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some assembly/stabilty issues, but impressive model nonetheless","review":"Sammy is a pretty hefty chunk of solid, unbending plastic, and you're supposed to balance him on a 1-and-a-half inch metal spike that sticks out the bottom of one foot---to simulate that cute little hop he does, right before a homerun lap. Problem is, the lightweight base has a very shallow hole to receive said metal spike, so Sammy's body tends to lean heavily atop the shallowly-anchored spike once assembled on the base. You have to position him carefully, to avoid the whole model just toppling over. Also, carefully concealed in the box is a short black plastic rod which is necessary to mount the bat to the base. The rod barely fit the too-small hole the on the bat, causing some restrained cursing during the build process. Once assembled, I must say it's a surprisingly lifelike and detailed model that does not disappoint."},{"rating":"2","title":"British poetry 1900-1940","review":"For some of the well- known poets here , Hopkins and Yeats for instance the selections made are of their finest work. For others , Dylan Thomas , W.H. Auden this is not so. The Anthology does contain selections from the lion's share of the well- known British poets of this period. It also includes a long list of poets who are not at all known today.

Alot of them were complaining that these sheets wrinkle. Yes, they do after all, they are cotton! But, they are very very nice. I washed them before putting them on my bed. My matress is 17\\" thick and the fitted sheet fits my matress perfectly and it doesnt try to come off. When I took them out of the dryer, I quickly put them on my bed. Everytime I put the fitted sheet (or the sheet, pillow cases, etc) on my bed, I sprayed them with a wrinkle releaser and smoothed them out with my hand. Almost all of the wrinkles came out and they smell great! You can make your own wrinkle releaser-its 1/3 fabric softener and 2/3 water. Put those in a spray bottle and shake it up before using it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for the price","review":"These sheets are an excellent value for the price. I was shocked at the quality when I received them. They have a beautiful sateen striping ,which is very subtle, that make them look much, much more expensive than they are (I have the linen and khaki colors). So far I have washed them many times and they continue to get softer and softer and they wrinkle much less. And with the bonus pillow cases you can't go wrong!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleased with this duvet cover","review":"Cotton is soft, but does wrinkle after washing.

A high school drama club could produce a better movie. It looks like it was shot using a discontinued Video Camcorder. The lighting is terrible, and there are absolutely no production values. I can not iterate how bad this movie looks.The movie was terrible; acting, and film quality really stinks. I did not like it at all and feel this one was a waste of money.

Wish I had known how bad it was, I would have saved my money!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Light Treat for Horror Fans","review":"Have you time to thrill? Check-out Mental Scars on DVD. This B-movie, this cinematic junkfood (set in a junkyard) offers all the goodies: gore, violence, salty dialogue, tacky make-up, semi-messy plot, semi-stale acting, and T&A. Add popcorn and beer to your viewing. Simply, the film should appeal to horror fans. Especially fans who appreciate admirable, skillful creativity exercised within certain budget constraints. I liked it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Scary Monster...","review":"Last night I watched Mental Scars. I didn't know what to expect, other than that people would die in various bloody and scary ways. And I wasn't disappointed. They died, all right, in all kinds of imaginative ways.I was curious to see how well a music composer did as a villain. Richard Myles did a great job. He makes one creepy, yet sympathetic monster. If bad things hadn't happened to his character, if he hadn't been left on his own, would he have become such a creature? Or was he doomed from the start to become an instrument of revenge, because of a secret I won't divulge? And is he really the monster? Or is the monster the woman who wants to turn the junkyard into something else for her own profit?No spoilers here. Just let me say watching Mental Scars was a fun way to spend a couple of hours of my Friday night. Thanks, Viper Productions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Design, Extremely Poor Quality","review":"We loved our Oxo Rotary Cheese Grater until it befell the same fate that many others have reported: the plastic ring at the bottom of the grater cracked and a piece fell off.

I usually like OXO products, so I was eager to try this grater as a replacement. It is much clumsier to use. Worse, the plastic piece that holds the cheese close to the grating drum broke off completely during normal use.

To be honest, I DO admire the cover page and artistic design. But I purchased this book envisioning it would be about the key question of 'putting pleasures back into work.' It is instead a wide-ranging review of many different scattered theme related to work satisfaction and culture. I found it hard to identify the personal voice of the author and why he selected this subject area. To some, however, these drawbacks may not be a big concern.

It tears very easily, we've replaced the brush at least 3 times. Also, while it soaps up well (as other types of these do), it only has a rough edge (see red in picture). You might not want to use a rough edge on everything you clean.OXO makes some fine products, but they need to go back to the design board with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flawed design; get the OXO Soap Pump Palm Brush instead","review":"Though OXO is a company dedicated to making durable, high-quality products, this is not among them. Utterly unsatisfying, the Soap-Dispensing Scrub Brush wastes soap, breaks easily, and doesn't really fit into tight corners. Ours broke after only a few weeks' worth of use, mainly because the tracks onto which the brushes glide can't take the stress. Ironically, the thing that makes it easy to add new brushes is also the thing which makes the device unstable. Also, there's no way of turning off the soap dispenser; it ALWAYS flows from the reservoir.OXO, fortunately has not been content to have just one soap-dispensing product, so if you're really looking for a good all-in-one soap scrubber, check out their Soap Pump Palm Brush instead. It's far more durable and less wasteful of soap."},{"rating":"1","title":"needs improvement","review":"The sponge tears off easy.

I figured I was just being too rough with it, so I went out and bought another one, and made sure to be more careful...had the same problem. The sponges don't last all that long, either. The only thing I liked about it was the oval head (as opposed to the round kind you see most often) made it easier to wash tall, narrow glasses.

First, the CD insert was very poorly printed to the point of being neary illegible. When I opened the case and removed the CD-Rom, I unhappily discovered that the label was not fully stuck on and the CD-Rom was actually a CDR. The whole thing looked to me like something very unprofessionally and shoddily home-made. Still, I reminded myself that what I had purchased it for was the information it contained and not its esthetic values. I went ahead and popped it in my computer and given its shabby appearance, I was hardly surprised when it did not function whatsoever. My system meets all the requirements for the CD. It simply was not properly made. I cannot comment on the information the CD might contain, because I was never able to get that far. This item seemed far below Amazon's usual standards and I can only say, thank goodness for their return policy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"AS i was looking for a complete listing of party places i came across this book that completely opened the doors on the places that i could go 2 have a good time.

It's an outdated rant mostly directed against John Thompson (who hasn't been the Georgetown basketball coach in 5 years) and Leo O'Donovan (who retired as University president 3 years ago). This book does not even redeem its age by being funny. The jokes are unoriginal and dry. This book is one in a series of \\"I Hate _______________\\" books.

The book starts on Katharine's 46th birthday.The characters in this book are very well drawn and the plot situations are realistic. One likes the protagonist and her family and friends. Reading the first book made me want to read the second, \\"Sins of the Fathers,\\" which I have done. Again I like the descriptions and the characters.I do have a problem with the mystery part of these books. I have some trouble understanding the motives of the murderers.

Save yourself the trouble and do what I ended up doing - go to Target and buy a nice, heavy slicer with adjustable width and screws to tighten the wire should it stretch. It will set you back less then 10 bucks.

A good, solid cheese slicer! Money well spent!","review":"I have had the WORST luck with wire cheese slicers , regardless of whether they were purchased at the grocery store or gourmet cooking shop. I actually had a $20.00 slicer fall apart with its very first use. I just bought this one a month ago, and though its longevity has yet to be proven, I just had to slice a TON of cheese for a large family Christmas party of 30 people, and was SO glad I bought this when I did! I love the grippy handle, and it made relatively quick work of 6 Sam's Club size blocks of cheese. It worked well on cheddar, monterey jack, colby, colby jack and mozerella. It has a nice weight and feel, and if it's as good as the rest of the Good Grips line, I expect it to last for a very long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only lasted a few times...","review":"I was very disappointed with this cheese slicer--the wire broke after about the fourth use.

VERY disappointed as I expect more of OXO."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheese slicer with a flaw","review":"As advertised, the grip on this cheese slicer looks more than adequate. However, I was very disappointed when I was not able to adjust the width of the head on the slicer. If you want to slice thin slices of cheese, this is not the cheese slicer for you. You will be able to slice only one width and it is a thick width."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Slicer Ever","review":"We've never been anything but pleased with the OXO products we've purchased in the past. The garlic press, for example, is so sturdy it'll likely outlive us all. Unfortunately I bought this slicer in a store, not on Amazon where I'd have read the reviews and known better than to waste my money. It looks hearty enough to pound nails, but in our experience it was barely up to cutting cheese. We probably sliced three dozen pieces of Tillamook cheddar with this thing before that wire snapped like a cheap guitar string. The sad part of it is that you can replace a guitar string. You can't replace this wire. No screws. No way to adjust tension. Don't do what I did and assume it's worth the few extra bucks because it looks solid. Without the wire slicer it's just a cheese roller and I'm not sure what use anyone has for one of those."},{"rating":"1","title":"Go witht the traditional \\"cheese plane\\" type","review":"Like in the other reviews, the wire broke after only a few uses.

I pulled out a block of cheddar cheese and tried the new slicer. The comfortable handle made holding the slicer a dream, but the dream ended quickly. The wire broke halfway through the first slice! Unlike my old slicer, this one does not have a screw on the side to re-attach the existing wire, adjust the tension or replace a broken wire.

The wire itself didn't break, but it pulled out from the handle and is non-repairable. The good news is, I called Oxo to inquire about warranty info., and they said that it's warrantied for life and would send me out a replacement right away. The whole call took about three minutes.

It turned out to be much more! Isaac Hayes is smooth & tough as Truck Turner, a no-nonsense bounty hunter. I'm surprised that Hayes didn't a make many more movies like this. He's more interesting than some of the better-known blaxploitation stars. I'd rank this near the top of the heap (a notch or two below movies like SHAFT and ACROSS 110th STREET). This is a great choice if you're looking for a good shoot-em-up . . . with an attitude!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mack \\"Truck\\" Turner is one bad mutha","review":"This 1974 entry in the blacksploitation canon is a fun watch, even if it isn't\\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\\"It took a little while to catch up to the jive talk without the aid ofBarbara Billingsley. Even then, some of the dialogue, especially Isaac Hayes' deep baritone, is difficult to hear. The best part of Truck Turner is Nichelle Nichols (Lieutenant Uhura) as a foul-mouthed madam. I detest hyperbole but that is truly a LOL scene. (See IMDb link below.) The best sight gag is probably the funeral procession full of pimp cars. Also really enjoyed the \\"buddy cop\\" character played by Alan Weeks, although it took me forever to finally place him: the drug pusher cornered in the opening (Brooklyn) scene ofThe French Connection.Good car chase, slammin' tunes (by Hayes, of course), epic costumes, and more political incorrectness than you can shake a bucket of fried chicken at!Genre rating: 4 stars"},{"rating":"2","title":"Is best practice ball","review":"I saw a CBS News review of several practice golf balls.

I never had those problems until she got this big either, though! it gets really easy to get on & off - if you can wear a vest, you can wear this. my husband never wore it, so I can't say how well it fit him/switched between us, but I am very happy with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"School Daze!","review":"Great news!

If you're opening an older bottle or one that has a particularly long cork, use another corkscrew."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good portable corkscrew","review":"This is not the corkscrew you want for home -- that honor goes to the Screwpull. But this IS the corkscrew you want to have with you when you travel. The open screw design means you can safely open old, dry corks without fear of breaking the cork off in the bottle. The foil cutter works well, even on those plastic bottle toppers. This corkscrew does require some practive, however, as you need to line up the screw correctly -- not in the center of the cork but more towards the edge, about halfway between center and edge. On one end is a tiny flip-out blade that can be used for cutting off the foil capsule. On the other end is a lever that serves as a brace that rests on the edge of the bottle to give you leverage when extracting the cork. This makes it easy to open a bottle of wine without setting it down on a tabletop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after a few months","review":"Before the rivet holding it together got loose and then broke, it did a great job.

The way Jamie writes, and even the way he uses approximate measures, like a \\"handful of basil\\", encourages the home cook to have more confidence, imagination and fun in the kitchen.

I had to put it down after 80 pages (of 140 or so). I haven't felt like precious moments of my life were being lost so viciously since I last hurled Cryptonomicon across the room. I'm told that I should read North's papers rather than his books; this seems wise.If you want to read books that refocus economics on institutions, I'd strongly suggest starting with Bowles's \\"Microeconomics: Behavior, Institutions, and Evolution.\\" It's the best synthesis of the subject that I've seen, bringing in threads from evolutionary game theory and probably every major economist from the last 75 years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ordered new, paid for new, & received a used one","review":"Very dissatisfied, simply i paid for a new book and recieved a used one.

I cannot understand how there numerical style system works because it is almost meaningless. I got these and the waist was too big, thighs too small and boot cut seems to be almost more of a bell bottom look rather than having room for boots. I then got a size smaller locally of the 514 straight fit and they were almost the exact same overall, including the boot area. So if your waist measures 34 with a measuring tape, this 34 is too large and 33 in the 514 is also too large. However, the thighs are tight in both so I figure a 32 (which possibly might actually measure 34) is probably going to looking like skinny jeans. because the thighs will be too small. So good luck with all that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Levi's changes sizes again","review":"I have worn the 517 for over twenty five years and Levi's exclusively over 50 years.

I bought a pair online, set the jeans out on the floor, and even with a 29 waist, there is so much extra fabric they look like women's jeans! It's like they have room for hips or something.Gimme a break, someone who buys 517's is not going for the baggy gangster look, they're 517s!!!Thoroughly disappointed with the direction Levi's have taken the fit of their jeans, I will never buy a pair again.Don't be fooled by the other reviews that say these have a classic fit.

The boot cut has a closer fit around the knee with comfortable room in the hips and waist. What Levi Strauss needs to understand is that there is a huge population of men out there that has a 31 inch inseam. Men between 5'9\\" and 6' fall into this size range. My growth did not stop at 30\\" inseam, and did not make it to 32\\".

I have other OXO products that I like and use, but this one is a real disappointment. The very first time I used it, the corkscrew broke off halfway into the cork.

I've used waiter's corkscrews, the fancy two prong kind, the lever 'Rabbit' ones, and the standard winged kind, like this OXO version.I have to say, of every wine opener I have ever used, this is the worst by far. I love every other item I've tried that carries the OXO name, but this one is a miserable failure. My main complaint is that when you line the screw up with the cork, and the wings are down, there's nowhere to grab for stability when turning the knob on the top. You have to kind of poke your fingers between where the wings meet and squeeze. Once you do get it going, half the time it only goes part of the way in and you end up with a half-removed, or worse - broken - cork.Terrible terrible terrible. But the $2 winged corkscrew at the grocery store instead. Even better, get a good quality waiters corkscrew and never worry about how you're going to open a bottle of wine again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good","review":"The grip is great, but the \\"screw\\" part of the corkscrew extends too far below the lip.

I bought it for the OXO name, but I will never do that again. During a dinner party, the plastic split right near the top, and exposed the metal rod that attaches the screw to the plastic mechanism. The corkscrew would not work after this piece broke. (Note: the corkscrew broke after a total of less than 10 corks were removed in approximately 3 months...not heavy use by any standards. Wish I'd kept my receipt.)I also had the same problem other reviewers had with the wings not allowing for any room to grasp the top of the bottle.Moral of the story: Buy an all metal winged corkscrew. >$5 at most grocery stores."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of toy for the $$$","review":"I bought 2 of these for my granddaughters, 6 and 9 years old.

It has such a very dry (no reverb), raw-but-clean sound to it that (to me anyway)it just doesn't quite work the whole time. Also I think that songs like \\"Fly\\" are arranged a little too \\"bouncily\\" and lose what could have been a heart-wrenching mood (though the line \\"now you're alive\\" is one of the most poignant expressions of Heaven that I have ever heard). Despite the imperfections, though, \\"The 11th Hour\\" is a strong cut above most music you'll hear released in this age of pseudo-grunge; I would recommend it to anyone who appreciates something not run-of-the-mill."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Musical Masterpiece","review":"Each Jars of Clay release is unique and full of creativity. The Eleventh Hour is no different. Many people compare the sound of this album to Jars Of Clay's self-titled debut, however the album uses more electric guitars than their previous releases. Don't worry, many of the songs still the acoustic Jars of Clay sound. The element of this album that truely stands out is the passion and emotion put into the lyrics. Example: Silence. The lead vocalist vocals are sang with incredible passion in a song about the doubts many face. Songs such as Fly and The Edge Of The Water also have great vocals. The Edge of The Water is the final track on the album which expresses the hope and longing of our savior's return. The album also features more upbeat rocker tunes like Revolution and Whatever She Wants. Overall this album is full of diverse well written songs with passionate singing of incredible lyrics.

This is, without a doubt, the BEST Jars of Clay album to date. I had purchased Overjoyed before, and, save for a few notable exceptions, was less than thrilled. The Eleventh Hour rekindled my love for the band! The song 'Revolution' is the best song on the entire album. I go for more hardrocking groups and songs, such as TobyMac and Pillar, or The Benjamin Gate. Even if you don't like softer rock, this album is both inspiring and, though it does not talk about God openly, has very subtle Christian elements."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is the Big Idea?","review":"Ok the first Jars cd was superb.

Yes you can find hints of God, but they are very watered down. The music also is a disappointment. People are saying that this is a very strong album musically. I don't see the big idea of the amount of talent. I was strongly disappointed. Come on Jars, stick with your honest and strong lyrics, and your beautiful acoustic arrangements.

Each of their first four CD's were very distinctive sounding, (Though 'Much Afraid' could have done so much more).On thier fourth CD 'The Eleventh Hour', they've really put all the pieces together, both lyrically and musically. The pulse is livlier than ever on songs like 'Revolution' and 'Whatever She Wants', taking their sound to a harder direction than on prior CD's.The poetry of the lyrics is just plain awesome, painting vivid word pictures through symbolism, allegory, and even in-your-face straight-on candidness. One of the best CD's I've heard in a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eleventh Hour is time well spent.","review":"I listen to music because it is music. I listen to production, I listen to musicianship, I listen to vocals. What catches my attention the first time I hear an album is the creativity. Something that sonically catches my ear the first time I hear it. Sometimes you can listen to music and you have to play it many times before it captures you. I own two Jars Of Clay albums and the first time I hear them I instantly like them. They are fresh, positive and perfect packages of music. The hooks, the melodies and the lyrics are all well structured. This is the only Christian music I own. And to be honest with you, I do not like to put any label on a band or performer. Because we tend to judge and shy away from music if it is in a certain category. This album is well thought out music without a label. It is good music. And Jar of Clay are an excellent band. I have not been disappointed in anything I have heard from them yet!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Only Reason I gave this 4 out of 5.....","review":"\\"The Eleventh Hour\\" is one of my many cds that I listen to frequently.

I've been touched by every Jars album thus far, but can't manage to make myself like this one. After the personal sounds and emotions on their self-titled debut, I fully expected to enjoy their return to more raw sounds after the experimentation of \\"If I Left the Zoo\\" (which I also enjoyed), but this album left me disappointed. It felt forced. They've grown up musically and the sound doesn't, and shouldn't, work for them anymore. Also, the lyrics of \\"The Eleventh Hour\\" didn't feel as personal and interesting as their earlier stuff and really felt distant from the music. Songs I really enjoyed included the title track, \\"I Need You\\", and \\"The Scarlet Letter\\". Nothing else really struck me.

Their first album is really the only one you should buy of theirs, because their subsequent ones have just paled in comparison. This one in particular is the worst one they've ever done. I feel sorry for those people who say this one is their best. They obviously are not right in the head and need to learn to think more clearly. This album is pure garbage and anyone should be smart enough to realize that. In fact I believe that this one album being as popular as it is signifies America's downfall and God help us all if this album continues to be a hit.

However this edition is horrible in that it appears to have been pasted together, daily poems may be numbered at the bottom of one page and begin on the next.

The descriptions of activities draw an amazingly close parallel to our present day situations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Relevant Today","review":"What I love about Richard Hofstadter is how well he writes and how well he builds arguments. These elements help explain why he remains as relevant today as he was throughout the 1950s and 1960s. This collection of essays features his classic work on American paranoia as how it impacts politics (birth movement, much?) and several very thoughtful analyses on Barry Goldwater.I found the introduction by Sean Wilentz to be sorely lacking in depth. I also found the second half of the collection to be less useful and dated.

It could have been an interesting plot: a kidnap-mystery with a twist, including a late-night sexy-voiced DJ...but it ended being quite creepy (all the female's obsession over the DJ) and extremely cheesy. The mystery was barely mentioned and the \\"twist\\" was made way too obvious early on as it could have been a good \\"shocker\\" at the end.Narrator, Sandra Burr, uses a little-girl, syrupy voice for her females and usually a goofy or nasally voice for her males."},{"rating":"1","title":"change the station","review":"A bland and sluggish 1988 effort from the usually dependable Delinsky.I found the main characters to be very one dimensional.One character in particular is extremely annoying and highly unlikable.

The A3s weigh about 17 lbs each, so I was a bit concerned about finding mounts that could handle the weight. The OmniMounts handled the speakers just fine, though I did have to buy a little bit of extra hardware (nuts and washers) to fix the speakers to them. These are probably best for a wall-mounted application, as the range of motion/adjustment is limited in a ceiling-mounted configuration. Still, these held my heavy speakers in place with no slippage, no rattling or vibration at high volumes, and no problems to speak of. If you're buying larger speakers for your home theater, I definitely recommend these mounts."},{"rating":"2","title":"works as advertised","review":"This product worked find.

Many speakers that you will find for your home will have a 1/4\\" - 20 mounting thread in the back of the speaker. The Omni-mount 20 lbs mounts (both wall and ceiling type) will have 3/8\\" - 16 threads. Personally, I used the 20 lbs mounts and added a 3/8\\" - 16 female to 1/4\\" - 20 male thread adapter (also called a standoff sometimes) in order to mount my speakers. If you are mounting wood speakers with no pre-installed threaded insert for mounting, than the thread size doesn't matter since it comes with the required parts for screwing into the back of the wood frame speaker.I agree with the other reviewer(s) that you should mount it to studs to get it properly secured."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Mounts On Market!","review":"These are great! Obviously you can not mount them on wallboard without added support. Anyone having problems with them holding has the mounts upside down! Put them the right way up and they will support like they are built to. I have used these over the years and they are the only ones I would buy again. My last set I put up yesterday and they work perfect. The instructions are not printed rather copied and a bit hard to read, but a little brain power will get you there easily. Make sure they are mounted with logo stamp on top as the instruction states, or they will fail! Mount them the right way and they will defy gravity for years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weight rating is misleading","review":"I have used the Omnimounts twice: the system rated for 20 pounds, with 16-pound speakers; and the system rated for 10 pounds, with 7-pound speakers. In both cases, I tightened the ball joint as much as possible and the mounts still wouldn't hold the speaker in the desired position. In addition, the drywall mounts on the 10.0 failed completely, and the instructions are vague and not terribly helpful. Finally, the location of the Allen fastener for tightening the ball joint is all but inaccessible. I can't recommend this system."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wouldn't hold 13 pounds..... How are they supposed to hold 20?","review":"I wish I would have listened to the 2 star reviews.... But I went with these because the manufacturer of the speakers I bought (Ascend Acoustics) only sells these so I figured they HAVE to work. Unfortunately I was wrong, and to boot, I accidently tossed the boxes in recycling so I can't return them. Decent concept with poor execution. You simply cannot tighten the clamp tight enough to hold a speaker over 5 pounds. I tightened them as tight as I could and within a few minutes the speakers were drooping. I highly recommend bottom mounts if you have heavy speakers because these stink....."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't believe 20 lbs rating.","review":"Idea of using an Allen wrench to tighten in tight area between the speaker and the wall is a very bad idea. Especially not easy to do when you're on a ladder, supporting your speaker with one hand. Would be much easier if I could use ratcheting socket wrench. Can't get it to support 15 lbs. speakers. The speakers end up resting against the wall. Maybe you'll have better luck.Directions that came with them seem to be bad photo-copies. Get on-line directions - not the highest resolution but better than the ones that come with the package."},{"rating":"2","title":"Did the job!","review":"Although I agree with other reviews, these mounts would have gotten a 5 star rating if they had engineered them to accommodate the speaker wire in the mount. However, the sturdy construction would have been compromised in doing so. Otherwise, this mount(when installed correctly)did the job very well. It came with every thing I needed to hang my JBL ES20 bookshelf speakers for my surround sound system. Including the mounting plate that attaches to the speaker. The speakers weigh about 11 pounds and the mounts held very tightly. I was able dial everything in easily and quickly. ES20s are bare boned bookshelf speakers and do not have mounting capabilities. I would highly recommend this product. \\"Word to the wise\\" Anyone attempting to hang JBL ES20s, take great care to mount the plate to the speaker with 5/8 inch pan head screws. If a longer screw is used you will destroy the electronics mounted to the inside back of the speaker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't hold","review":"I bought a pair of the 20.0 wall mounts to hold my 10 pound speakers. One worked and one did not hold.I saw the other poster's comments that said maybe I wasn't doing it right but I tried at least 10 times before I gave up. I even took them apart to compare the one that worked with the one that did not. I could not see any difference. The nylon ball on the one kept slipping and within a few seconds my speaker would droop and end up pointed at the floor. I tried tightening in small increments and also tightening to my maximum ability. No luck.The Omnimount website made no reference to how to fix this and so I am trying to send them back to where I bought them (I did not buy them from amazon because they wouldn't ship to Canada where I live).These look and feel like top quality items. I think they would be perfect ceiling mounts but for wall mounts the company has to provide a better idea of how to set them up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty bad","review":"The range of motion is so limited that I can't aim the damn speakers right without a lot of fuss. The design is such that screwing them into the wall is just this HUGE pain in the butt.

They do what they're supposed to.But it is a little difficult to get to the allen screw that holds the speaker position solid. Which is important with 15 pound speakers that you don't want just leaning into the wall.Also a hex type wall mount screw would be better for mounting to it to the wall, (I happened to have some around) as the big phillips heads supplied are tough to get into a stud without stripping the head. Even with a good predrill.These items aside they do work well and fit our needs perfectly as they are slick looking and very easy to hide."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice construction, but don't work","review":"The mounts are very nice construction and the kits are good, but frankly they don't work that well. I have 14# speakers on each mount and no matter how hard I have tried to tighten the bolts, the speakers sag until they touch the wall for a wall mount. I have had someone else hold it up while tightening with both hands and a wrench until I can turn the bolt no farther. 30 minutes later it has slowly slid to the wall. For a lighter speaker it may work, but the mounts shouldn't be rated to 20#."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weight of speaker is a factor","review":"There are several reviews that reference the fact that heavier speakers sag with this mount. I found the same thing to be true. One mount i purchased held the speaker nicely while the other would not hold the same position even after numerous attempts. I did find an easy solution. I used small piece of wire (i.e.. a coat hanger) cut to the proper length to use as support at the bottom of the speaker to keep it from sagging. It is really a shame that i had to find a solution to this problem in that these mounts are pricey, but it works perfectly just the same.

Especially for a classical musician (I am a jazz musician who frequently interfaces with classical players) he is at home in both worlds.I had a high regard for Mr. Previn to begin with especially because of his conducting of my favorite composer Ravel.

I've had it for at least six months and I still listen to it almost everyday. First of all, Common is one of the greatest m.c.'s of all time. His rhymes are metaphoric. They are so superior to really everyone else out there in the rap business. But despite how intricate and deep his rhymes are, he still comes off as just having fun. After one song, you can tell Common both loves being an m.c., and respects his position as an m.c. Something a lot of rappers forget to do. Also, the production on this cd is amazing. Almost every song is a masterpiece. Not since MC Solaar's Prose Combat have I heard an album so complete in both its lyricism and its production. By the time you get to the 15th track, you're already psyched to hear the first one over again. It really is that kind of an album."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Name COMMON is a paradox","review":"This has gotta be the dopest sophomore effort from any emcee. I remember about six or seven years back, I was really feelin Common's first album \\"Can I Borrow A Dollar?\\". Then about two years later, he hits me with Resurrection. From the first track, all the way to the last track there are dope rhymes and beats. The banginest track on the album \\"I Used To Love H.E.R.\\" really changed my life. I've always had love for hip-hop but I never realized that she was being abused until I heard \\"I Used To Love H.E.R.\\" That track really opened my eyes. What makes the album so tight is the fact that Common seems like a regular guy, but he possesses ENOURMOUS skills on the mic, and that's what makes his name a paradox. He's my favortite emcee and I hope he gets his due props soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Common's Classic","review":"After listening to this album, you'll probably come to the conclusion that Common is a superb MC. His lyrics and wordplay are amazing; just listen to \\"Communism\\" where flips verses with words beginning with \\"com-\\" (e.g. \\"I'm too Com-plex/Watch Com get Com-plicated..\\"). \\"I Used To Love H.E.R.\\" is one of the best metaphors ever used in a hip-hop song and tracks like \\"Sum ...

Take Back Star as a prime example. This is one of those records that will always be remembered as a timeless hip hop classic.

Also quite noteworthy are \\"Nuthin' to Do\\", and the introspective \\"Book of Life,\\" a commentary on trying to keep it together in a society that has lost all traces of sanity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic","review":"94' was one of hip hop's most memorable years. Many classics, including this one, were released that year. I got into Common when I first started listening to an underground show on a college radio station back in 94'. Since then, he has grown and become once of my favorite emcees. My journey with Com started with this album. Com has a unique style. One of hip hop's most groundbreaking classics, I Used To Love H.E.R., is found on this album. My favorites are Resurrection, In My Own World, Communism, and Chapter 13."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this damn CD....","review":"Common is so refreshing, \\"Can I Borrow A Dollar\\" he was in his thug stage, but from this CD on he has grown into a lyrical genius.

Common raps about his infatuation with hip hop on \\"I used to love H.E.R.\\" and a whole lot else on the rest of the album. If you're someone who doesn't like to be challenged when you listen to music, than this CD isn't for you. If you're someone who likes to listen to intricate wordplay and jazz-filled thumping beats, then this is the CD to get. Plus, it's a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic","review":"Every so often an album will come around that will immediately be called a true hip op classic. When Common Sense, now known as Common, released Resurrection a classic was born. Common is on his own level of rhyming ability. Only a select few rappers compare to his lyrical genious. The first songs bring you into Common's world and his thoughts and you are kept there for the albums entirety. With deep meaning and excellent production Resurrection is placed on a pedistal as one of the best hip hop albums of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Common Classic","review":"\\"It's ashame I have to do whitelabel to keep my life stable.\\" Best said by one of hiphop's true underrated lyricist, Common formerly known as \\"Sense\\". While many MCs speak about going to the next level on their sophmore projects, Common simply let his work speak for itself and it did just that. RESURRECTION is a dynamite display of raw lyrical skills from start to finish. Common wastes no time displaying his improved skills on the title track \\"Resurrection\\", and breaking down the love of his life on the track \\"I Used To Love H.E.R.\\". This also being the track that blazed the fued between him and Ice Cube. A classic album consist of equal balance, and this album had just that. The beats were just as ill as Common's lyrics, both coming together in splendid hiphop harmony. RESURRECTION is a classic that truly showcases one of hiphop's best golden years."},{"rating":"2","title":"common will always make sense","review":"BEST ALBUM..YOU HAVE TO BUY THIS.

This chi town warrior crafted an underground release that will bring a vibrant smile to the hardcore hip hop head and even awaken the minds of some of the fake commercial rap artist lovers. Songs like I used to love h.e.r and ressurection start the classic album and take you on the road to classic chicago hip hop. Not only the lyrics are dope but also the beats and the hooks.

While the product's promise of ease in opening a wine bottle proves true, the problem is in removing the cork from the corkscrew thereafter. In my case, not only was I unable to remove the cork from the corkscrew (turning counterclockwise did not work, and there is no space inside the plastic chamber for your fingers to get a grip on the cork) I ended up piercing my finger in an attempt to extract the cork, thus turning wine-drinking into an unsavory and painful experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"This thing is lousy","review":"I usually love Oxo products, but this one blows. It is without a doubt the worst corkscrew I've ever owned. I don't use it anymore, but when I did, it routinely:. shredded the cork in the mouth of the bottle without removing it. lodged the removed cork inside the corkscrew, making nearly impossible to remove. drilled all the way through corks, leaving cork bits and dust in the wineAlso, the foil cutter is completely worthless.Try a Screwpull or a regular waiter's corkscrew -- either would be a much better choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"a disappointing purchase","review":"I've used this maybe 5 times, and am going to throw it away. It doesn't always work for cork removal; once it pushed the cork into the bottle. And the method for removing the cork NEVER works. When you end up with a cork stuck on the screw, the plastic guard keeps you from accessing it with your fingers. I often drink wine with plastic corks, so that may be part of the problem. At this point, I can't get a cork off the screw, and it's going into the trash with a cork attached."},{"rating":"1","title":"too bad so sad","review":"should have listened to the reviewer who said it's hell to get the cork out of the corkscrew. have to be very careful that you don't pull the cork up too far or you'll spend the next minutes looking for a needle nose pliers. they used to make a better one similar but didn't have that problem.i read that review, didn't listen. my bad m.w."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Paucity of Information","review":"I would not recommend \\"Which Way to the Vomitorium?\\" to anyone who is even remotely serious about the study of Latin.

The law was not inherently \\"bad\\" or oppression to the people of Israel. The problem resided with the people themselves. Only a remnant were true followers of Yahweh. For this faithful remnant, who had the Spirit operating in their lives, the law was good (cf. Psalm 119, et al). But for those without the Spirit (the majority of Israel), the law was simply \\"letter\\", and a burden. They did not want to keep it, nor could they.

Someone mentioned Binder Clips...yes, but they are harder to get on and off, ugly, and very tight; sometimes you want a clip that holds things together well but doesn't crush them---this is hard to explain, but I'll just say that I find the amount of tension on the OXO Clips ideal.OXO makes easy-to-use real handy products, and I have never been disappointed in any of them. At this price, you can afford to try the clips out. You'll probably want to buy more.

I also feel the same way about \\"The Bottled Imp\\" by RL Stevenson as well.Mind you, I also think that Asimov and Vinge's sci-fi novels end too quickly as well.Have fun, and remember to book off a solid 2 - 3 hours to read the book in one shot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Classic to re-read..","review":"This bok is the original book on this very well known tail about Dr. Jekyll and his evil alter ego Mr Hyde.This book gives a very psychological version of the story and less focused on the actual killing portion.

This is a book that is told in a collection of letters. the letters compile to make a great scary story for people of all ages. The fact that this story is told the way it is gives it a real life feeling. When I was reading it I felt like it was a real case that happened in the streets of London. The letters that are made make it seem like that the case happened because it gives the tail of many people from the story. Even though the story is well known around Europe and the US the ending is still classic. The fact that the story is ended in a letter is quite original on Stevenson's part. It probably would have been more of a thriller if I had known the ending. The ending is probably the most well known in literature history and that kind of stinks.

It is one of his best stories and the writing is descriptive and will put a chill down your back. It is a look of a man who wanted to separate his good side from his dark and malicious part of his personality. The transformations are a man's method of discovering his true soul and he is torn between two distinct and different ways of life.It is a well written story but a short one. The inner conflict between the two personalities drives Dr. Jekyll to realize the duality of the nature of all men. It is an insight into what a split personality can really mean.

When you read this book you really have to pay close attention. I'm sure that won't be a problem. With everything that occurs in this book there's never a dull moment. I liked the idea of how Stevenson used one man, but transformed him into someone else. The mystery of finding Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is what I enjoyed.

This book is so famous and referenced and retold that it was very interesting to read the original 1886 prose! The story is written as an account of events told by Dr. Jekyll's concerned lawyer friend. It's very detailed and by the time you've finished hardly a stone has been unturned! Being so accostomed to the idea that people may have different sides to their personality has somewhat conditioned my response to the story. I do really enjoy thinking about the people who originally read the story when it was first published who must have gotten a thrill from the horror of science gone wrong! The edition I recieved was simply the story with no other added info which was fine with me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the read","review":"I always thought I knew this story just because the idea of having a dual personality is an idea with which a lot of us can relate. I knew that the story was about a doctor who made some potion of sorts that turned him into an unscrupulous man. But there were several things that I learned from taking the short amount of time to read this story. I did not know that the story of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde was being told in the aftermath of the confusion of it all. I discovered that there were deep of emotions and grief tied to Dr. Jekyll's decisions and actions. I also learned that Hyde was the complete picture of the devil on our shoulder. So for knowing what the book was about, I was missing key pieces that I found delighting to discover while reading it for myself. I would recommend it.

I could not get very interested in the book because I am not in to science fiction novels. Another reason I did not enjoy it is because it was kind of scary with all of the killilng and evil. It did have a plot that could keep a readers attention, but it was too evil to keep it very long. Personally I did not take very well to the fact that that the evil side was brought out in such a good man.

Just as interesting as Dostoyevsky's Crime and Punishment, Stevenson's Jekyll and Hyde novel is both unexciting and a waste of time.

It is easily read at leisure with a couple of hours in hand.

The book is beautifully made: The design, layout, and text is very easy to read. And of course, what a great story.

It's not only thought-provoking, discussion-lending and well-written, but in the case of this copy, aesthetically pleasing and really well designed by Cricket House Books.

I really enjoyed this book because it kept me interested."},{"rating":"2","title":"The veil of self-indulgence","review":"It's always interesting to see how a classic like this differs from its many Hollywood adaptations. In this case, the book is very little like the lurid depictions of Mr. Hyde and his doings. In the book, Hyde's depravities are mostly offstage, and the reader learns about them through Jekyll's elegant euphemisms. In fact, the last half of the book is entirely Jekyll's narration of events through the means of a letter he leaves for his friend Utterson. It's a device that probably wouldn't fly today, but was possibly necessary in RLS's day, to avoid detailing just what Hyde had been up to. Some of the language in this book is a bit turgid and I occasionally had to re-read passages to get the gist of them, but I still enjoyed reading it. It's an interesting look at the duality of human nature and what happens to those who give in to the dark side."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Horror Classic","review":"Dr. Jekyll And Mr. Hyde is one of the most popular horror classics.It is one of my favorites.

Only after Dr. Jekyll and a friend die tragically, does anyone learn the horrifying truth.If you've seen any of the movies or the recent stage musical, please forget them when reading this book. It is ten times better. While most of the suspense of the book, what is Dr. Jekyll's relationship to Mr. Hyde, has been ruined since the book first came out, that is no reason to skip the book. I was surprised to find this book is really an allegory about the struggle between good and evil in each of us.

I was surprised by two things (a) how slim and quick this book was and (b) how different it is from all the movie versions of J&H I - and probably you - grew up with. It's interesting because there's a whole other cast of characters that are never mentioned in the adaptations and what ultimately happens to Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is quietly powerful and more suited for the book. I won't give away the ending but, like I said, it's not what you expect.

The concert footage of portions of \\"Keep Yourself Alive\\" and \\"Stone Cold Crazy\\" is the best 5 minutes of the DVD.

I love the way traditional South American and Mexican stuff is mixed with jazz and blues...Mariachi and blues; mambo and boogie.

This is not one of those books.Ms. Speltz takes a scary thing -- a parent's battle with cancer -- and turns it into a learning experience. Calmly and seemingly effortlessly she anticipates the fears, anxieties, and emotions of a young child and skillfully illustrates the questions a child may have and distills sometimes cold and frighteneing medical jargon and presents it in a way that children can hear and understand. At 15, my son is a little old for this book, but I am very glad to have read it because it gave me a lexicon for communicating things about my own cancer to family and friends in a way they will understand.It would be unfair for me not to compliment the illustrator of this book, Kate Sternberg, who did a wonderful job and helped keep the book light."},{"rating":"2","title":"From Sea Yarn to High Tragedy","review":"Melville is something of an enigma, as if his brief and quickly declining career were a stage for the apparition called Moby Dick, most likely the Great American Novel, and one of the few novels ever written to approach the tragic mode in the true sense. This brisk and not overly detailed biography is a good lean introduction to the life, or what's known of it, and thus a fitting portrait of the secret intensity of the man behind his sluggish career as a writer. None of which matters beside the magnificence of the greatest of all sea yarns."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Biography","review":"I was in Munich in 2008 and I brought one book with me--Delbanco's wonderful biography of Melville. I've read many biographies of writers, philosophers and statemen. Without any other worthwhile book to read and out of boredom I read and reread his biography and as a far traveler, it seemed as if Melville became a distant uncle, someone I knew or someone who was a good friend. Please read the section about the difference between a pipe smoker and a cigar smoker. Delbanco is writing neither out of passion nor is he writing to impress; he's presenting a great American writer like he would a favorite wine or an inexpensive dish from his favorite local haunt. Indulge and imbibe. Such wonderful biographies are quite rare."},{"rating":"2","title":"Places the man squarely in his setting","review":"This is a fascinatingly rich account of Melville's development as a writer with a particularly strong focus on his surroundings and environment and their influence on his work. DelBanco is at his best when describing settings such as 1840's Manhattan with it's noise , crowds and filth. Melville emerges through the details as the narrative shifts seamlessly between historical anecdotes to literary biography and analysis.

In any case this is not the type of book that you pick up and read in one sitting.The book presents a unifying theory that covers a great many phenomena in mathematics and science. The basic concept is deceptively simple: transform a problem, solve the transformed problem and then reverse transform it. One elementary example is to mulitiply two numbers by adding their logarithms. A second is to communicate across a long distance by tranforming voice into electrical current.This simple idea has wide applicability. Most of the book presents examples from a wide range of fields.

See his insane book, \\"Race Traitor\\", for the twisted worldview of this nutty Harvard Professor.The best review here came from Mr. Sheehan of San Francisco. Those positive reviewers need to look at either their own bizarre white guilt, or their racist anti-Irish, and in a larger sense anti-white stereotypes they have exposed in their reviews. Ignatiev must not be allowed to spread his filth. Intellectual discourse is fantastic, but when it is merely anti-white racism disguised as critical thought, that's strictly another.This book has no place in ANY classroom, neither does its author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Racist Crap","review":"I picked up this book hoping to have a better understanding of the Irish past, and all I got was a racist slant on an otherwise abused people.

Although it is true the Irish suffered for centuries under English (British) rule and were treated horribly in America, intermarriage and cultural similarities probably had more to do with their integration into WASP society than a concerted, organized effort to keep blacks down. Just as the Irish were blamed for all sorts of social ills in the 19th Century: violence, alcoholism, orphans, ghettoes, crime, etc., now Ignatiev wants to blame racism on the Irish. Having white skin clearly worked to the advantage of the Irish and many gained acceptance in a Protestant, Anglo Saxon nation but Ignatiev goes too far in judging and generalizing the entire Irish race when many fought against slavery, racism and inequality, especially in labor. Ignatiev seems to have a bone to pick with the Irish, heaven knows they have been oppressed and ridiculed enough already!"},{"rating":"1","title":"neither racist nor about the irish becoming white","review":"While he choses an eye-catching title, his book is actually a history of the Irish in Philadelphia. This history conveniently touches on issues of ethnicity on occasion, but it's clearly not his original subject.

The genocide of the Irish at the hands of the English is no where to be found... The tremndous racism of Irish-Catholics is not mentioned either. Where is the mention of murdered nuns and catholics? The books claims that the Irish climbed up the American ladder by pulling the black man off... This is simply placing blame where it does not belong. I suggest the author read up on his histroy to learn the facts"},{"rating":"1","title":"Marxist nonsense","review":"If the Irish became \\"White\\", why are they still overwhelmingly Catholic? The religious affiliation of the Catholic Irish in no way endeared them to the Protestant Establishment. The Irish also created the Catholic school system in this country. How did that square with becoming part of the \\"White\\" establishment. The fact is that the Irish remained Irish and became the most affluent ethnic group in this country. Why settle for being \\"White\\" when you can be Irish? A non-Irish person could never understand this and Ignatiev is laughably out of his depth. The Mumia Abu Jamal endorsement doesn't help either, this genius never finished high school,killed an IRISH-AMERICAN police officer,and has been in prison for almost 30 years successfully ducking a death sentence.th"},{"rating":"2","title":"Under Your Skin","review":"Ignatiev tells the tangled, tattered history of Irish-black relations in America in the 30 years or so leading up to the Civil War. It shows how the Irish used labor unions and the Democratic Party to elevate themselves in the stratified American republic. At first, the white protestant majority in America made little distinction between Irish immigrants and free blacks -- it scorned them both. But by emphasizing racism, leaders of the Irish-American community were able to swing themselves over to the side of the dominant class, to the horror of their brethren in Ireland, who identified the slaves' struggles for emancipation with their own battles against English rule."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good reference, but Prof. Ignatiev overreaches","review":"This book is useful as a catlogue of many important and interesting events, and students will find it a handy reference tool. However, Prof. Ignatiev would have us believe that the Irish, in their natural state, were pure and untainted by bigotry, but that contact with America somehow caused them to become racist. This is untenable at best. He could have argued his thesis more effectively in a shorter essay. Short on analysis, the book is merely an interesting laundry list of riots and other events, and his many anecdotes do not do much to advance his argument. Nonetheless, the work is an interesting read and should prove useful to students."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keyboard","review":"This keyboard is junk!!

With practice, your form will flow, but do not force yourself to do everything Dr. Yang does, if you are not ready for it.

It is wonderful! I pick the lettuce, put it in a bucket of water and soak for a few minutes, dump it out and spin it in batches. I purchased the large spinner and it is not too large to store. The small would not have worked for me. We make big salads in this house. I wish I had purchased it years ago!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to use and clean","review":"This is actually my second salad spinner. My first salad spinner wasArcosteel Deluxe Salad Spinner. You wouldn't think getting the wrong salad spinner would make a difference, but it does. The Acrosteel with its crank was so awkward to use that I found myself wishing I had spent a little more and got this one instead. When it cracked and broke I knew this was the one I wanted. The fact that it is operated by pushing down a button make it so easy to use that it really does live up to the claim of only taking one hand. Even if I am juggling other tasks this is easy to use. It also cleans up well and if you don't have a lot of space for kitchen gadgets the basket doubles well as a strainer. This is a really nice product that is durable and works well. I own countless OXO products and this, like the others, lives up to the price and reputation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke at 2 months","review":"Eh. I guess most people have good experiences with this, and it's the top-rated on Amazon. Good price. SO I'll probably buy another, from whatever store has the best return policy.

The two spinners I had before it were hard to use; they jumped around the counter unless held with a sort of bear-hug, leaked water outside the rim, etc. But this one stays put on the counter, the lid fits tightly and it's so-o-o easy to spin using the push top mechanism. If you need to stop it, that's easy too. I bring home and grow LOTS more greens now, and love that it takes so little effort and time to prepare them for salads. You'll love it too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"worked well until it exploded","review":"I bought this item and used it for about 2 months, then It exploded while I was spinning a salad and was impossible to repair.

I've been using spinners like this for years and consider it one of the most useful kitchen gadgets I've ever owned. I use it typically once or twice a week, sometimes more often.It works very well not just as a spinner to remove water, but also as a crisper. Limp lettuce becomes crisp again within hours or even minutes of refrigerator storage in the spinner. I leave a teaspoon or two of water in the bottom, which seems to help keep the lettuce crisp. Romaine stays crisp for days when washed, spun, and stored in this thing in my refrigerator.I use it to wash and spin-dry cilantro, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonder gadget","review":"I purchased this item under the advice of my oldest son. My wife and I love to make a large salad that lasts for about 3 days but wouldn't you know it, moisture from the different vegetables spoil it sooner. So I looked up different spinners and found this one. A bit pricey it thought at first but worth every penny. I chop, slice, shred, dice or drain and pour my salad content into the bowl. And like a little kid, make the excess water go away. Just pop up the plunger and giving it a few presses. (OK, so I'm having too much fun spinning it all around)The water is on the bottom, and the salad is dryer in the basket. Just wash your items chop them up, spin them down, serve and eat. Our salads have lasted almost a week now saving us lots of money and time. Easy to use, easy to clean, sturdy but a bit large for some. A definite recommendation from me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Dishwasher-safe","review":"My inner basket to the spinner warped after one cycle through the dishwasher.

I wanted to try the \\"push button\\" version, however, when I opened it up and looked it over, I wondered immediately how enough force was going to build up to actually spin off all the water, since that is no longer in your control and is up to the \\"button.\\" I tried it with spinach and romaine, and unfortunately, the leaves were still water-droplet covered. A good spinner will leave the leaves almost entirely dry, and gorgeously ready to use. Am sending back immediately and going to try a different one. Why o why did I leave the one I loved w/ the ex?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I love Oxo, but . . .","review":". . . this salad spinner does not work and I'm surprised at so many positive reviews. The old string-pull type I had (and recently threw away, alas) let you run water into an opening while you spun it, then you could turn off the water and spin it dry. All the way dry, unlike this one. Because the string spinner let you get it going fast enough to repel all the water. This one won't get going fast enough to get the greens all the way dry. So you have to rinse the greens separately, then put them in the spinner, and then finish off by drying them with a paper towel.

In my kitchen, very few things break. The occasional wooden spatula after fifteen years of use is fine but things tend not to break unless I drop them. This is my second Oxo product that broke while I was using it (the other one was a knife--yes, a knife snapped in two while I was cutting).

This brand is truly the easiest to use!

My children and my husband usually ask if they can spin the salad. My children and my husband will talk to me while they spin it, and I cook the remainder of the meal. This salad spinner is a simple design. It works great, cleans up great in the dishwasher, and is a necessity in my kitchen. I highly recommend it for the busy family who tries to have fresh salads regularly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great at first, then dies a clunky death","review":"We got this as a wedding gift and it was wonderful. However the plunger spring soon failed. You could push the plunger down, but it would never pop back up. You could sort of dig it out with a butter knife, but then that sort of defeats the purpose of its design. I think OXO makes one that uses a pulled chain to spin the contents, and while that may be a bit more tedious (rolling it back up like a yo-yo), it won't get stuck the way this one did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Liked it at first... but","review":"This was a gift from my in-laws and I was thrilled to have new salad spinner. I have always had those really old cord ones.Initially it worked really well, but it is hard to clean. You have to disassemble the lid, and it appears the more you do that, the more goes wrong. Eventually the whole thing just stopped working and the lid wouldn't stay together.The older-style pull-cord spinners have fewer parts to break and are easier to clean. Get a Zyliss instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Indispensable for Salad Lovers - FOR CLEAN CRISP SALAD WITHOUT THE DRIP drip drip","review":"If you are a Salad Lover, this device saves you A HEAP OF TIME washing and wicking away remaining moisture in seconds, so that your salad is readied for serving, crisp & dry. There is nothing worse than the drip drip of wet salad, with the run-off diluting the dressing (and runny dressing running down your chin).The inner bowl doubles as a strainer and the outer bowl is useful for soaking/ washing fruits & vegetables. The rubberised palm operated (press down) spinner button, is effortlessly activated with a gentle \\"palm-down press\\" and locks into the bowl with the flick of a switch for easy storage. If desired this can be brought to a picnic and the salad can be served there in as well.A little expensive when I bought it even on special BUT Very Recommended. Will last for years."},{"rating":"1","title":"a waste of money","review":"My old salad spinner, which I had for about 10 years, was getting shabby. So I replaced it with the small Oxo salad spinner. Big mistake! First it took many many spins to get the water out and even then some water always remained. But the main problem was that within a month, when I took the top apart to clean it,as directed, the spring popped out. I was able to get it to work again, somewhat, for a few more months after that. But yesterday, it just fell apart and like Humpty Dumpty, it couldn't be put back together again. I've liked other products by this company, but the cheap construction and poor quality of this product would make me look more closely into buying other brands instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Salad Spinner","review":"The OXO Good Grips Salad Spinner is a winner. It works great and is easy to clean because of a well made design. If you never used a salad spinner before, you will never know how you lived without it after you use it. The only reason this was not rated 5 stars is because I have to sit there after I pump the salad spinner and hold the top to keep ot stable or it will go off the counter. This is a minor inconvenience that I think could be resolved by OXO on their next design."},{"rating":"1","title":"warped second time in dishwasher","review":"We have used our salad spinner twice and were impressed with how easy it was to use. The salad is not completely dry but most water is removed and much better than towel drying or a puddle of water at the bottom or your bowl. But the second time we washed the unit in the dishwasher (top shelf) one piece is visably warped and no longer aligns properly. Now the basket only spins a few times before stopping on its own if you tightly close the lid. Now we need to return and decide if we want to get another knowing that we can not put in the dishwasher or just return and consider something else. The salad spinner components take up the entire top shelf of the dishwasher, so we probably would have hand washed most times anyway. But it is annoying that they state it is dishwasher safe then a piece warps after a couple of washes. And after searching through the reviews I see that others have run into similar problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great until it broke","review":"I've had my Oxo for about 3 years now.

My husband planted huge amounts of lettuces this year and we thought perhaps a spinner would help keep some of the produce longer. This one is perfect.

However, with the concern over contaminates in produce such as salads we had begun washing the greens...something we had not done previously.

This salad spinner does a good job of removing the excess water."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my favorite spinner","review":"I bought this spinner to replace an older salad spinner that had a handle attached to a string that is pulled out to set the top spinning, the string could be pulled repeatedly to get the spinner going really fast. I found that with this OXO salad spinner I could not get the speed going as high, even when repeatedly pressing the top plunger. I was rarely able to get as much water removed from my greens as I was used to with the older spinner.I recently replaced my OXO spinner with a Zyliss salad spinner which is of the style with the handle attached to a string which starts the spinning. It spins faster and gets my greens as dry as I wish. I am much happier with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good but questionable durability","review":"I bought this a year ago and was excited and happy with it. Now about a year later I'm dissapointed enough to write this review. The first thing to go missing was the little black knob that is the brake.

I just don't know which one is better and more durable?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not durable at all","review":"The spinner works well. The problem is when taking it apart for cleaning.

Stay away!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as large as some of the people claim","review":"Some of the people claim that this thing is humongous. It is not. It is exactly the dimensions listed, no larger, no smaller. Personally, I eat relatively large salads, so it only makes two me size servings.

The description is deceptive---it is big enough to spin salad for a small family dinner.

This was designed for convenience and durability."},{"rating":"2","title":"This spinner is a winner!","review":"The first time I heard about a salad spinner I thought, \\"oh please - is anyone really that lazy?\\" Then I saw it being used and tasted the crisp, clean, DRY lettuce that emerged and couldn't get to the store quickly enough. I didn't want to spend much money, so I picked one up at IKEA. Big Mistake. Its true that you get what you pay for. Thankfully, my old IKEA spinner passed on to the the great salad bar in the sky last summer and I was able to justify purchasing an OXO spinner. Oh. My. God. The experience is akin to going from a Pinto to a Porche. Not only is it a solid, dependable product (the plastic bowl is thick enough to feel substantial and sturdy enough to stay put while in use) but it is a wonderful size and the salad can be served straight from the bowl. One-click one for yourself today!"},{"rating":"2","title":"the only perfect salad spinner I've used","review":"If you're like me, you've used dozens of differant salad spinners in your days in the kitchen. Well, let me tell you, this one is like no other. I used to be resigned to placing two hands firmly on my spinner to prevent that terrible shaking and trembling from the centrifugal forces exerted by the spinning water and greens. Well, no longer with this product by Oxo...the solid design keeps the spinner absolutely still, which is no small feat considering the weight of water swirling at some mad rate of rpm. This is more than a great kitchen product...it is a feat of science, and a pleasure to use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not dry lettuce well enough! Would NOT recommend.","review":"I dropped my old Zyliss salad spinner (with a pull string) on a tile floor and broke the bowl. I could not find another one like it anywhere, so I purchased this Oxo version after reading mostly positive reviews. It's awful! After pumping on the top of it until I am exhausted, the lettuce is still too wet and if I put it away like that, it rots within a couple of days. I need to take the leaves out and put them on paper towels to finish drying. I plan to dump the Oxo as soon as I can get the Miu pull string one that I see on this site--once it's back in stock. Maybe that will be an improvement, and closer to the Zyliss that I miss so much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality, and BIG.","review":"I am replacing a smaller version of this that's been around for over a decade, so that alone will tell you something about the quality. This unit is quite a bit bigger, perhaps will hold 3x as much as my old one, though you still need to put a realistic amt inside for it to get decently dry. Operating the spinning does require some muscle, at least to get it up to the crazy speeds that I prefer. Don't forget to use the brake and let it fully stop before opening or lettuce will go flying!. The black rubbery texture allows for a good, solid grip too.The new design separates easily to wash the parts. Typically, I wash it by hand and air-dry, though it's been through the dishwasher many times and seems to be just fine.Nice product, well made, and should last a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Great for Sprout Prep","review":"I purchased this to clean and prepare my sprouts after they are done and ready for storage in the fridge. After putting in the sprouts, I fill with water and separate the bunched up sprouts to dehull them. The hulls float to the top and can easily be poured off, and other hulls pass through the basket and can the sprouts can easily just be lifted out of the bowl and the hull water poured out. Afterward, just put the spinner lid on and pump the handle to spin the sprouts dry. Easy to do, and spinning the excess water out of the sprouts keeps them fresher longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost DOA","review":"Purchased this on June 12, 2012, delivered on June 18, 2012.

I'm happy.Several weeks later, no lid, so I call OXO again and speak to Barb. Barb advises that the lid in question is back ordered till September 2012 (today is July 18, 2012), but they will FedEx once it arrives.Happy wife, happy life. Product did not impress and the customer service was as bad or worse. Will I ever see the new lid? Will Martha admit she lied? Do I care?Should you buy this?

The other 2 worked great out of the box, but soon they both stopped working. This OXO spinner was noticably different the first time we used it. It seemed to have a better center of gravity and the inner bowl with the salad kept spinning to point where we had to use the brakes (the little black button on top) to stop it. Inner bowl lifted out easily and we drained the water. Spun again to try to get it as dry as possible and it got a little more, but not too much was left. We drained the bowl of water, then tossed the salad into the main bowl to use as out serving bowl. We like to make a lot of salad so we had leftovers. Just to test it, we left the salad (romaine and radicchio)in the bowl with the lid on and put it in the fridge. I was still nice and crisp 4 days later when we decided to just eat it. So far so good with this spinner, but if any problems come up I will update."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best salad spinner","review":"This is our third salad spinner.

It includes a plastic lid for storage (why this isn't included with the spinner is a mystery) and a useful lettuce knife."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor performance","review":"I was unable to get the salad spinner to spin with salad in the basket.

It was literally after only a few seconds of use that my salad spinner broke. When I pay over $20 for a bowl, I expect it to last at least minutes. Well the bowl itself and inner colander are okay, so at least I will salvage about $5 of my money's worth. It was the lid that popped and snapped and twisted and all sorts of great things."},{"rating":"1","title":"(22) 1 STAR REVIEWS!","review":"The quality of this salad spinner is complete garbage, any good reviews simply did not use it enough to know or used it VERY gingerly. To preface I am obsessively careful with my belongings.1) The first one I purchased the knob came apart (impossible to put back on) within 20 seconds of testing.2) Replaced the first one, and on first use of the 2nd one, the lid cracked upon depressing the knob to spin the salad.3) Though irrelevant after #2, the lock does not slide with the finger indent. You have to wedge your finger between the knob and the lock to unlock the knob.Shame on OXO for releasing such a substandard product."},{"rating":"1","title":"great until it broke 2 months after I got it!1","review":"This worked wonderfully but exploded in a spectacular way when I was spinning a salad about two months after I bought itdon't waste your money, find a tupperware one instead they're really sturdy (we've had one since)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Probably only acceptable for salad","review":"I bought this device in the hope that I would be able to put it to use with more than just salad, to rationalize the somewhat inflated price. I assumed it would be effective in drying things other than leafy greens, and now my hamster is dead.I would like to have been able to review its ability to dry spinach or lettuce, but the spinner's failure in the hamster-drying test was such that the spinner is no longer fit for use with food (or much of anything else, I imagine).Also- and I am trying to phrase this delicately- the spinner is not very easy to clean. Again, though, this could be a usage-specific problem and may not reflect situations where it is used in a manner that more closely adheres to its intended use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great to dry lettuce","review":"I got this for my son for Christmas and we gave it a try one night before he took it home. It did a great job spinning the water out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chinese junk","review":"I bought three of these in the last three years. The first one I purchased lasted almost a year before the plastic bowl cracked. The second one lasted eight months before the bowl cracked. The third one was a stainless steel one but the plastic lid cracked after nine months of use. These salad spinners are nothing but Made in China trash."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like the spinner brake","review":"After dealing with the unreliability of a cheap plastic spinner for years I decided to upgrage to this model after doing a lot of research. The thing is solidly built and the bowl is nice enough to serve from however given that this thing is built to last I'm sure over time it will get scratched from the serving/mixing tongs but who cares. The spinner brake allows me to access the lettuce quicker without having to wait for the spinning to naturally stop."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Product!!","review":"I love this item. I used to go through tons of paper towel and waste tons of time drying lettuce. I always thought a salad spinner was silly and would take up lots of space. I was very wrong. I don't need to use any paper towel whatsoever, it takes only a couple minutes to have dry lettuce, and I can store my remaining lettuce in the spinner in the fridge. I've used it a few times and I am really happy that I made this purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect size for our trailer","review":"I already own the larger version of this Oxo salad spinner, and it gets lots of use at home. I am skeptical of the supposed \\"pre-washed\\" bags of salad, and washing our salad using the salad spinner is so easy. I was hesitant to buy one for our Airstream trailer, since the large version takes up so much space....even at home, in my kitchen cabinet. I was thrilled to find this smaller, compact spinner! I am currently traveling, and the mini salad spinner by Oxo has been put to good use on the road already."},{"rating":"2","title":"great capacity, good durability","review":"Works great, better than other salad spinners I have had, my only wish is that it had a stainless or glass bowl because the plastic gets etched after a while and just won't ever look clean again.update 12/17/2012 - I still use this all the freaking time. Every day almost. It works great. The clear plastic has gotten foggy looking, but I don't care."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Spinner!!!!!!","review":"This salad spinner is the best.

I use it for salad greens and also for sprouts...works great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A gimmick proven valuable","review":"My wife bought this a while back, and my first thought was that this was a gimmick designed to part a fool from his money. But after using it to make a salad and then using it to preserve lettuce in airtight jars I can definitely speak for the value of a salad spinner. This thing has saved me a lot of time in trying to dry my lettuce before preserving it or using it in my salads. Looks like I was the fool for not believing in the hype, but this is well worth the small amount of money spent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after 1 months use","review":"We had our old salad spinner for years.

This is big enough to fit large leaves without breaking them,is easy to use and efficient. I love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice item","review":"Works as described. The only slight downside would be that the plunger goes down into the bowl (protected) and that takes up a little room if you have a lot to spin."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE this salad spinner","review":"I shopped around for about a month and looked at several different brands of spinner but the Oxo seemed to be the heftiest of the bunch. It's solid and has very few parts that can break. This is a long-haul type of kitchen tool.Beyond the quality of the spinner, I am amazed at the ability of this little machine to keep lettuce fresh! I grew green leaf lettuce this spring and had a ton of it! I was giving it to neighbors in an attempt to clear it out of the garden. One of my neighbors came back within three days asking for more because hers had already grown wilted and brown. Mine, on the other hand, stayed fresh for three weeks! Three days versus three weeks is a big improvement for a little plastic bowl!Needless to say, I heartily recommend this appliance. What an amazing little gadget!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great spinner and storage unit","review":"I have been eating my garden grown loose leaf lettuce for almost 2 months.

We use it when we come home from the store to clean all our greens. Very good, affordable product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Charmed at first, but it didn't last.","review":"We got this salad spinner (the small one) from our gift registry, and at first we just thought it was the cutest little kitchen toy we'd seen. Almost immediately, however, the spinning mechanism popped apart and since then anything but the most gentle usage causes it to deconstruct again. It was not easy to pop back together either. It turned out to be a big disappointment we just need to return to the store."},{"rating":"1","title":"It spun for about 5 weeks","review":"I bought the smaller unit. This spinner was fun to use and really did a great job of spinning the water out of freshly cleaned lettuce. But cleaning the unit is difficult. The top/lid is supposed to easily snap apart for cleaning. This happened effortlessly the first time. The second time was more difficult. By about the fifth time I could not separate the two halves. Instead the plunger mechanism unlocked itself, the spring popped out - and I was never able to reassemble the unit (without cracking the plastic). Cleaning this unit is an exercise in frustration!"},{"rating":"2","title":"no need for the large salad spinner","review":"I have had this spinner for about 6 months and I love it. I have a very small kitchen and the large spinner is just too large to store. This one will hold 1 romaine heart at a time so I just do several batches of lettuce at once. Once it is spun, I put it into a ziploc bag in the produce drawer and it will last for 2-3 weeks (I have a fairly new fridge-that helps). The money I saved on lettuce alone paid for this very quickly. Also the little black button you see in the photo stops the spinning-very nice to be able to do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Salad Spinner","review":"This item really does the job it dries the salad items so that the dressing sticks and does not become watery. Great price and fast service."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Salad Spinner!","review":"This thing is a hoot. Sure, it does a good job of spinning salad - but the pumping action beats any crank style spinning. Gets some great rpms! Even has a brake to stop it! It only holds enough for one serving (at least one serving my size), and it would have been great to be big enough to do several servings at a time - but what it does, it does very well. No more soggy lettuce and diluted salad dressing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it while it lasted....","review":"I purchased this a few years back (not from amazon) and loved it. It was big enough to wash a whole green leaf lettuce, spinned nicely, and removed most of the water. However, the lid was accidentally dropped on the kitchen tile floor and a part on the bottom cracked. From then on it was trouble. The button would push down but not come back up and start the spinning. I tried unsuccessfully to keep using it but it was more effort than it was worth.So... yes I would recommend it, but NEVER drop the plastic lid, as it's the hard type of plastic and will crack on a hard surface. The transparency of the base was really nice to see how much water had been spun out. The rubberized top button was great too. My slippery formica countertop is not so nice when things skate off onto the floor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works GREAT!","review":"Bought this for my mother for Christmas since she always dried her lettuce with paper towel after washing them. We now use this item for cleaning our lettuce or any greens. Defiantly removes the water quickly and easy to clean right away!"},{"rating":"2","title":"OXO Good Grips is a WINNER!","review":"Not the most expensive but the best! The salad spinner spins with one hand and is very stable to operate. This spinner is easy to clean and store. Don't think the low price means you will compromise on constuction quality, easy of operation or salad spin drying efficiency---the OXO SALAD SPINNER is top quality in all areas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like the spinner, but difficult to store","review":"The spinner works well. It does what it is intended to do. Takes up a lot of cabinet space though. If you have space to spare, I recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Plastic parts require care in use","review":"These work very well, but as other reviews have stated the gears in the spinner are plastic. Remember to start slowly and let the speed of the spinner build up. Also dump excess water. It drags on the basket increasing stress on the gears. (This applies to the spinners with a draw cord, also. I've had both types and both work well.) It is worth the trouble. I had thrown a lot of lettuce away until I got one of these."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Salad Spinner is For You.","review":"Spins well and dries lettuce as expected. Main plastic bowl should be designed a bit thicker. I won't place the large acrylic bowl in the dishwasher for fear of it losing it's shape from excessive heat. Great product and would have rated it a 5 star if the bowl was a bit heavier. You won't be disappointed. I recommend you purchase the spinner."},{"rating":"2","title":"OXO Good Grips is Fast and Easy! Wash it , Spin it , Water has gone.","review":"Not only good to wash fast and easy salads but also convinient to wash all kinds vegetables. If you want to make small size salads, there is a litle size model as well. I am making salad everyday. I can not think of washing it without OXO.

Love the way it spins the salad greens dry.Had it for about three weeks. Would recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love Oxo!","review":"I bought this to replace my small Ikea salad spinner. I used to have a tedious process of rinsing, spinning and packing my lettuce away. I love this Oxo spinner because it is big enough to hold a whole head of lettuce (romaine at least). And after spinning it is dry enough that I can just leave it in the bowl to store it. I also don't have to break my arm spinning it at hard as I can. It does the work for you and looks nice too. I don't know if you can go wrong with this brand! Spendy yes. But it would have been cheaper if I hadn't bought the cheap salad spinner to begin with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"If I'd known how well the OXO Salad Spinner works I would have bought one long ago. It is far superior to the old hand crank spinner I was using. Washing salad greens wih the OXO is almost effortless. It is easy to clean too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Design, Not Sturdy Enough","review":"I finally broke down after years of drying lettuce on paper towels and bought the OXO Good Grips Salad Spinner. It performed as promised, making a salad became a breeze. After owning it for 6 months and making use of it about twice a month, the push down handle completely broke from the spindle, rendering the whole spinner useless. This happened on Christmas Day while I was preparing a large meal for several guests. I am very disappointed that a simple kitchen gadget costing [price]had such a short life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nicely designed spin knob","review":"You'd think that a salad spinner is a salad spinner, but no. There are differences. The inner sieve can be thin and break easily. And then there's the issue of the spin knob itself. My previous one had a knob that was downright clumsy to use. This one is very well-designed.Of course, the way we USED to spin salad dry was to put it in a French collapsing wire basket and step on the balcony and wave it about, daringly, allowing centrifugal force to hold in the Romaine and drive out the wash water. You looked daft for two minutes and the cat got wet, but it was fun. Unless it was raining. This is better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mine broke","review":"My OXO Good Grips Mini Salad Spinner performed the task decently when it worked. You put the colander in the plastic bowl, put the cover on, and press the big pump to spin. Pretty simple, well designed.The problem is that the \\"patented pump mechanism\\" broke recently. I had been using it for perhaps a year or two. A plastic piece inside the spinner cover broke, and I can't find a way to fix it. I'm left with a colander, a bowl, and a non-functional spinner cover. Perhaps I pushed the knob too forcefully, or perhaps I got a lemon, although it looks like a few other reviewers on this product have reported similar problems.I generally think OXO makes well-designed products, and I don't mind paying the premium price. But in this case, I'd hesitate to buy another of these."},{"rating":"1","title":"very poorly designed","review":"This salad spinner is spins reasonably well, but the quality of the components is abysmal. In particular, the tabs one must press to separate the two top pieces are ridiculously poorly designed. I bought this salad spinner, managed to take it apart once, and then the second time I tried one of the tabs broke off. I bought it from Bed Bath & Beyond, which fortunately has a great return policy, so I just exchanged it for another. This time I knew how weak the tabs were, and so was very careful. I pressed lightly, and it would not release. Harder, would not release. Harder still, would not release. Very hard, released and broke in one movement. The margin between hard enough to release and hard enough to break is at best small and at worst non-existent.If you never clean it in the recommended fashion (disassembling the top lid), then you might find it adequate. Otherwise, avoid this piece of cheap plastic crap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much nicer than the cheap spinner it replaced...","review":"I was hit with the \\"budget bug\\" and bought this used here... should've paid the extra $10 for a new one, just because we use it every day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great spinner with one dubious feature","review":"We use our OXO spinner nearly every day. It is mighty. We have had it for two years and it still works beautifully. Salad greens go in wet, spin around, come out dry. Simple. It hasn't failed us yet. The dubious feature is the brake. The button is small and requires quite a bit of force to make it work. I never expected an instant \\"whiplash\\" stop from it, but if you do have arthritis I can't imagine the brake will be your friend.Overall it's a very good spinner and we are happy to own it but I'd like to see OXO improve the design of the brake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked for about a year","review":"Worked for about a year. Then the plastic gear spinning mechanism broke. The spin brake button lasted about 3 months before breaking. Find another model, avoid this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"very nice","review":"this works so well i have no complaints at all i hope it lasts as i have gone through too many spinners, others that werent made as well and i love that it comes with a cover so i can spin the greens then remove the basket and spinner top and store the bowl with cover in the fridge till i need to dress the salad in my salad bowl,i have also put potato salad in the bowl with the cover its really quite nice to have more uses than just as a spinner but if it had only one use id still like it the whole thing is stable and one touch of the button will stop the spinning and you can lock the spinnertop on so no wild lettuce flying around the room as with the string spinners. i recommend this"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a toy!","review":"This is no toy.

I had this one and broke it after trying to take the lid apart to try to clean under the lid--don't attempt that! I didn't like how this one had a domed lid so you couldn't stack stuff on top of it. I also found that the interior of the basket wasnt smooth but a bumpy basket weave so little bits of lettuce get stuck in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor construction and lousy quality","review":"I really liked this spinner when I first got it. It looked sleek and worked great. The first and second times I used it. On the THIRD try, the whole thing broke. The button that you push to make it spin and the plastic construction around it all completely fell apart. This is either poorly made or was defective. I live in a house with housemates and found another sample of this spinner, also broken, so my thought is that it has a track record of breaking, a very short shelf life.

The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is that in the chapters covering OOP and DOM the author try to explain the new functionalities but also attempt to throw in the mix more generic info on this two topics.

He fights the attraction and intends to just help her out of her predicament but soon the heat of their attraction gets the better of both of them. Of course Adam is planning to make her his mistress. The plot is a good one involving who actually murdered the Earl and the love stories are a great back drop to the romance.

I bought this for use with my Novatac Storm light. After slipping off the pocket clip from the light, I slid on the rubber lens cover with the red filter. Great for tending my baby at night without waking her or losing my night vision.I also found that the rubber ring, when slid on the back of the light, makes it much easier to grasp, hold, switch on, and stand on end. Depending on your tastes, it makes your light look either kind of cool or kind of gawky. Personally, I like the effect.You can (I suspect) also glue a red or white Fenix diffuser wand to this lens cover and create a great camping lantern or emergency signal. At under five dollars each, they add an affordable new layer of utility to your Novatac."},{"rating":"1","title":"This doesn't match the description","review":"The description says that it has an AMBER lens.

The other two are about starting at the new dance school/academy and general family/friends issues. This turned out to be a better way to introduce my girls to the Nutcracker than an actual performance by adult ballerinas on DVD. Maybe this coming Christmas they will actually want to see a live performance. My 5yr old does notice that Angelina doesn't look like the same mouse in the books we have by Katherine Holabird but it doesn't bother her enough that she doesn't want to watch the DVD.

This is on par with any of the best recordings from the afore-mentioned singers. Honi has a wonderful voice that really conveys the mood of the songs she's selected. That the music provided by the supporting quintet stands on it's own is a real bonus. Ken McIntyre's magical and mystical flute and the beautiful guitar work by Wally Richardson really add to the appeal. Listen to this and you might wax nostagicaly about a warm fifties something summer evening in a really hip part of town before we were concerned with terrorism, aids and a million other ugly things. This recording will set a mood for you that you will probably wish you could stay in forever. I really like it and I think you will to. By the way, the playback quality is very good.

Fogerty checks in briefly with two terrific songs--the country opener Lookin' For A Reason and Someday Never Comes. Sweet Hitchhiker, despite a roaring guitar riff and a great Fogerty vocal, is CCR by the numbers. Stu Cook and Doug Clifford contribute some interesting numbers but they lack the focus and power of Fogerty's weakest material much less his strongest. Most of the originals sound like second hand garage rock knock offs of popular songs.The reality was this; CCR had returned to The Golliwogs. For the first time in their history CCR sounded like a pale imitation of themselves and half a dozen other bands. Like The Beatles' Let It Be, Madri Gras was anti-climax to a brief but bright career as America's finest rockers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stylish yet not very secure.","review":"The Good:Great PriceStylishProtects the phone when you drop (and boy have I)Easy access to phoneThe Bad:Does not stay on my belt!

He explains that his Guru from India loved to hear him chant, and he got the idea of serving his Guru through chanting. As I've practiced Yoga the last two years, his descriptions of all the chants and devotional prayers in this cd are so well conveyed. It reminds me of the times I've spent in the Ashrams listening to Swamis explain the meaning of Bhakti Yoga (The Path of Devotion to unite with God). The insert booklet is wonderful, and I can see he wrote this from the bottom of his heart. I love track 2, which is a prayer to the Divine Mother. He explains that this is from the Devi Mahatmya (Hymns to the Goddess).

Most BBQ tongs are so tight, they'll give you hand cramps at the end of the day. The springiness on these is just right, and the rubber grips reduce slippage. Also, I don't know why, but many BBQ tongs have claws instead of being scalloped like these. These are much less likely to tear apart tender fish.The locking feature is great so you don't have to have 16\\" tongs splayed open all the time. They lock in the closed position by pulling on a metal ring at the end of the tongs. I tied a leather loop to the ring, so I can hang them and lock them in one motion. To unlock, I just press the ring against my body - all done with one hand.To top it all off, they are sold at a great price. Don't let the fact that these tongs are not advertised as BBQ tongs fool you - they're great for grilling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Quality","review":"The quality of these tongs is pretty good.

More than a year, but less than three. I keep hoping OXO will upgrade the quality of their black grips, but sadly no change. So, I gave up. I simply buy these and expect to throw them out in a couple of years, and buy another pair. They are good enough in all other ways that I'm willing to do that.

I loved the locking mechanism. The opener was solid and held up great. Unfortunately, the handle snapped off in the middle of a chili batch during the opening of many cans of beans and tomatoes. I couldn't find one like it anywhere so I ordered it from Amazon since the shipping was free. I am extremely unimpressed with the quality of the new one. It is lighter in contruction and I can see why the chief complaint is the locking mechanism breaking. It's going to occur sooner than later. I wish I could remove the opener and put it on my old opener handle. Two stars for this looser.Update 10/5/11: Been using this opener for nearly a year now. Have to say, it's held up and I've gotten use to the ligher weight construction. I would 3 star this item if I had it to do over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kitchen life made easier","review":"Today's cooking means opening a lot of cans.

It was inexpensive (I mean come on, do can openers need to be fancy?) but it did have nicer features than a standard metal one. Like other reviewers who were less-than-satisifed, mine broke about one year after purchasing. I could tell it wasn't working quite right because it wouldn't completely finish opening the lid, in other words there was still a tiny part of the lid that would remain attached to the can no matter how many times I went over it (and it's always fun to practically slice your finger open trying to retrieve the lid that has sunk down into the can and its contents). Then shortly after it just didn't even attach to the can at all. Maybe in this case, you do get what you pay for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Friends want to steal it!","review":"This is the greatest can opener ever invented! I have no need for an electric opener as I only use certain canned items, but the other kinds always caused my hands to cramp or would slide off the can.This opener locks on and works every single try! It's fast to work with, too, handy when you need to open 10 cans of tomatoes when making a batch of sauce, etc.I found one years ago when they first came out. It's had fairly regular use for the last 4 1/2 years without a problem.If people are breaking them, I can only imagine the kind of force being put on the mechanism, as I've put mine through a lot and it's still perfect.I've had at least 3 friends beg me to let them have it."},{"rating":"2","title":"there's a trick","review":"Some of the reviews mention that the plastic is too flimsy to 'bite' right in to the can.

Recently, though, the cutting blade seems to have dulled or come untrued. The locking mechanism still works, but the opener will wheel itself off of the can without cutting or will move around the can without cutting anything. Because the openers is locked, it's not possible to put much more pressure on this to correct it. Seems like a better plan to get a standard opener or an electric opener if you're avoiding the need for a strong grip."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works poorly and painful to use","review":"I loathe this can opener. I hate it in a way that I find vaguely disturbing, like I'm anthropomorphizing it. The idea is awesome for people with hurty joints, which is why I bought it. The problem is that a locking mechanism is a lot less useful (and a lot more frustrating) if it takes five tries to get the jaws around the can properly. And when the button locks in a misaligned position (those first four tries) it is extremely difficult to release. My joints hurt a lot but are pretty strong as I'm still in my mid-20s, and I have serious trouble using this. It negates its own purpose by being badly put together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy the *other* Oxo can opener","review":"After briefly playing with this unit at a friend's kicthen I went to a local retailer to buy one, only to find they were out of it- so I bout the other, less futuristic looking Oxo can opener. As it turns out, I lucked out.My Oxo is still going strong after two years; it's the best hand can opener I've used. This model, though, has since been discarded by my friend. It works great for a few weeks, but then the plastic bits start to wear, and the locking mechanism starts to stick, and the user starts to swear.The idea for the lock was a good one- that seniors and others with limited hand strength could lock it on, using both hands if ncessary, and then concentrate on turning the knob. Unfortunately it doesn't work that way. The lock becomes more of an annoyance than a help, the handle isn't terribly comfortable, and ... well, it's just not a terribly good design.Oxo makes a lot of lovely products, so I suppose you can't fault them for the occasional turkey."},{"rating":"1","title":"More difficult than it's worth","review":"This can opener doesn't work that well.

The improvisations are also more flamboyant than when he is partnered by other musicians, like bassist David Finck or when Previn is playing as part of the Trio with Mundell Lowe or Joe Pass on guitar and Ray Brown on bass. On these other discs, Previn blends in with his partners but playing solo piano he can give full rein to his creative imagination. If you enjoy jazz piano inspired by the wonderful melodies of Jerome Kern, then this is a disc for you. Only one minor criticism - as this recording was made in 1959, there are only 10 tracks on the Cd, which makes for quite a short playing time.Dinah Sings, Previn PlaysAfter Hours With Andre Previn"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too \\"jazzed-up\\"","review":"I wanted a fairly straight rendition of Jerome Kern's beautiful songs, but this is not it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must-read over and over and over......","review":"I remember being 10 or something like that and reading this book to the point of wearing down the binding.

Also, Ronald Dahl's writing style is great for kids ages 7 and up! It's easy to understand and engaging at the same time. I'm gonna go and watch the 'Matilda' movie for the 50th time.

Her teacher, Miss Jennifer Honey, is impressed with Matilda's accomplishments, and with further tutoring, she helps the young girl master her spectacular gift. This gift later becomes useful when Matilda decides to save Crunchem Hall Primary School from the sadistic Headmistress, Miss Agatha Trunchbull, and free her favorite teacher (Miss Honey) from poverty.Like all of Roald Dahl's books, this was a breeze and delight to read, filled with lots of mature humor and fun games. The book was made into a movie in 1996, and although I never saw it, I'd encourage anyone who plans to watch it to read the book first. Generally, Dahl's books outshine the movie version.

Matilda is sent off to school and finally is appreciated in her class. But there is a problem at school.

For a Roald Dahl book Matilda is pretty good-it has an interesting plot, at least.Unfortunately aside from that I hate it. The characters are all either Mary-Sue's or horrible cardboard villains. Matilda is so annoyingly perfect, she taught herself to read as a baby, soon read the kids section of the library, is a complete genius, quite nice, and has telekinesis. Miss Honey, her teacher, is annoyingly sweet and smart. Headmistress Trunchbull and Matilda's parents are ridiculously mean with no attempt whatsoever to make them human and realistic, and no one bothers to explain why Trunchbull got her job or wasn't arrested for her horribleness.

None of the mature female characters are good role models: Miss Honey is wimpy, The Trunchbull is cruel, The Mother is indifferent (the Father and Brother, bullies); what's here for a girl to look forward to in adulthood? Nothing good, I daresay.Dahl's rather bizarre idea of girl empowerment encompasses petty revenge and telekinesis; hardly what ordinary girls in the real world can depend on for life skills.One might say, \\"Lighten up, it's just a book for fun.\\" But I suspect that kids or young teens who identify with this book have experienced what Matilda has, and need to find more uplifting literature."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't like this book","review":"Matilda is a five year old girl who has parents who don't know her intelligence. Matilda has gone to the library since she was four years old. She read all the childen's books in the library. When Matilda started, she was five years old.Miss Honey is her teacher.When Matilda started school, she learned about the Trunchbull. She learned that the Trunchbull picks kids up and throws them out the window. She puts them in the chokey. The chokey has nails and glass pointing out of the walls.Matilda scares away the Trunchbull by tipping water over with a newt in the drinking water.She also practiced picking chalk and writing messages on the board from Miss Honeys Dad.Somebody might want to read this book because it's exciting and intelligent, but I didn't like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Matilda","review":"Do you like mischievous books? Matilda is a silly smart young lady. She was reading chapter books at the age of four. She wanted to go to school and her dad sold a car to a principal so she got to go to school. Her principal is so mean. So she gets back at her principal. Then her dad got in trouble so they moved.I believe you should pass on the book Matilda. Some reasons are I don't understand the text says mum instead of mom and tele instead of t.v. And it just doesn't make sense. Also it leaves you hanging it doesn't give enough information but the information isn't always helpful. Her parents are mean to they don't let her read she can only watch television. That is why you should not read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"matilda","review":"well it is a noice movie so ivexpect it to be a exciting bookdont make trunchball hurt youbecause matilda will save you and then you will thank her she might be weird but nothing can stop her from being funny.Matilda"},{"rating":"2","title":"A little girl named Matilda","review":"A little girl named MatildaMatilda is a wonderful girl who is very smart but her parents ignore her and say she is a bad daughter even though she is certainly not.One exciting part is when she stuffs a parrot up the chimney. \`'Rattle my bones!'' \`'Rattle my bones!'' says the bird. She put the bird in the chimney to scare her parents.I think anyone who likes to read half fanasty and half realistic would like it would really love Matilda!If I was to rate this book1-5, I would rate it a 4 because I think lots of people would love it! I loved it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Roald Dahls best.","review":"The greatest childrens writer of the century. Matilda is simply the most wonderful Cinderella story told in a modern setting. Only we replace a prince with a mother figure, and a Castle with a schoolyard. Both Matilda and her teacher need each other. Both struggle through the same problems in life. Both have overbearing relations who Dahl characterises with fantastic story writing. Using his wit and humour he pulls us though a captivating tale of realising our entitlement in life. One finishes the book quickly and satisfied that Dahl has again told another meaningful yet childlike story of life. Five stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"A nice but too unrealistic book","review":"Matilda is an extra ordinary child, who loves reading and learning. She's a lot cleverer than the other children but her parents are so silly that they don't care at all about her.The idea of the story isn't bad but unbelievable : we can't believe that parents can be so mean, we can't believe a headmistress throws her pupils like a hammer ...The beginning of the book is very funny and interresting. But it rapidly becomes boring and we aren't surprised anymore.It must be a good book when you're about 7 or 8 because it's quite easy to read and understand.But it's too unrealistic. Everything seems to be black or white :on the first hand there are Miss Trunchbull and Matilda's parents who are silly and cruel and the other hand there are Matilda and Miss Honey who represent brightness and kindness.But it's still a nice book ...But it's just the advice of a French girl who has read this book in English ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Matilda","review":"You might think that this is a bad rating but come on! Don't you think a 5-year-old getting super brain powers is a little cliché? Anyway, I would recommend this book for anyone who likes Roald Dahl books. It's a story of a girl named Matilda who has parents that treat her like dirt and a headmistress who, well lets just say if life were like Star Wars than she would be Darth Vader. From hats glued to somebody's haed too a parrot up a chimny this is a must read book for any Roald Dahl fan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Matilda By Roald Dahl","review":"As being a vivacious reader, and critic.I'd have to vote Matilda, on my top 10 list.I think that Matilda is fabulous. It sends out a good moral for children: telling them that they can do anything if they put their mind to it.It teaches children not only to appreciate what they have, but also the values and feelings that burn inside a child, ready to give way.Matilda is a very bright child, who has no limits to what she can do.Matilda, in a few words, is about a young girl. She is not loved at home by her family. She turns to where else? The library, to take herself into a story. Matilda then is offered by her reluctant parents, to attend school. (Which Matilda loves) She is way beyond the normal child, academically. She befriends her lovely teacher, Miss. Honey. And then of course, there is the Trunchbull. The meanest, scariest head mistress ever to face this earth.So with Roald Dahl's, \\"Matilda,\\" begins adventure, and sensitivity into the child (Adult) reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alittle sad, a book that makes you wat to know more.","review":"This is a great book by Roald Dahl.It is about an extraordinary little girl who loves reading.

I started reading it for the 5th time in a row when my friend asked what I was reading. I said Matilda. She asked me to read a little bit to her, and so I did.

The others often fall apart or the rubber top is too thin to be able to press it effectively. Just don't put it in the dishwasher. I put the brush part in and it wouldn't stay attached after so I found replacement brushes on here. Oxo products, in general, are far superior.

I examined it with magnifying lenses, but cannot make it stay on. A simple tool should simply work. If it needs writen instructions/can not easily be made to function, it's pointless. I'm a fan of OXO design, but this one seems to have a high fail rate. The design and materials of this are very nice, too bad this goes in my trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lasted about a month","review":"I liked this brush a lot when I first ordered it but, after using it for about a month, the bristles were completely flattened like a pancake and the brush was useless for scrubbing - and it is not as if I was cleaning anything super aggressively either, just pre-washing stuff for the dishwasher. I generally like OXO products and it was a comparatively expensive dish brush. I expected it to hold up way, WAY better. I feel kind of ripped off.I know there are a lot of positive reviews - that's why I ordered this particular brush in the first place. Maybe the product is being manufactured differently now or maybe a lot of people are reviewing the brush right when they first get it which is really misleading? In any case, for me, it was a total waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"REAL comfortable jeans!!","review":"Nice look....extremely comfortable....one draw back I have found with all Lee jeans is that they wear out sooner then I feel they should, but for the price that is something I can live with...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value","review":"These jeans seem to run a bit smaller than comparable Levi's carpenter jeans (which apparently Levis doesn't make any more).

I take good care of my clothes and have not had any issues with other brands but recently they have started using cheaper thinner fabric on these jeans.. I unfortunately am going to have to switch to a different brand due to the lack of quality.

Nelson is joined by Joe Newman on trumpet, a major addition to any recording date, and two-thirds of a new rhythm section: Hank Jones replaces Richard Wyands on piano and Charlie Persip takes over from Roy Haynes on drums. The music really swings on this CD; only one of the six tunes is taken slow. Everyone is in a very relaxed mode, and the music is as pleasing and pleasurable as a summer's drive with the top down.

After numerous viewings the hairs still stand on my arms and tears well up in my eyes. a couple of reviewers claim they may be distastefull or offensive,...In my mind, only to those so closed minded who don't or can't see all the beauty life and the world around us has to offer.I didn't think it could any better than the music of Sigur Ros,I was wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"Untitled review","review":"Wow!

The music itself (on disc 1) is a good extension of their latest album, \\"( )\\", although it's not 'meaty' enough to really hold us over until the next release. Great musical effort and a fantastic DVD make this a must-have for Sigur Ros fans. The only reason I couldn't give this five stars?

If you ever have the opportunity to hear them live, do not pass go do not collect $200! It's up to you. The words mean nothing on their own.

I was very disappointed in this DVD. The CD was pretty cool, and that's what the one star is for, but the music videos on the DVD were terrible. When I listen to Sigur Ros I picture abstract and eretheral things, like weird or peaceful landscapes or romantic stories - not dancing down-syndrome people dressed as angels, and not children playing soccer (football). I wasn't really offended by the scene with the two boys, but I didn't really feel too good about it either. A music video should reflect what the director feels when he/she listens to the music. I didn't see any connection between these images and the genius music of Sigur Ros (except that the videos were in permanent slo-mo).

She was the glue that held everything togther. Other highlights were the singing of (American Idol Season 5 finalist) Paris Bennett & (Youtube Sensation) Melanie Daniels! These two ladies can sing the heavens open! All of the singing was on point. I know some of you might think that this is the same ole Tyler Perry play with the same ole message. This play hit home on so many levels (acholism,drugs,love & lies) to name a few. Tyler always leaves his fans with some kind of message or teach them something they didn't know beforehand.

However the non-actors made a decent attempt to be any good with what they had to work with in regards to the script.In conclusion \\"Bam\\" is a sidekick and should have stayed as such. Not worth her own show. This was thrown together to make money from DVD sales (genius btw) because this production didn't tour.I can't hate. Until TP has some competition this is what we get. Welp David E. Talbert is bringing it... A great producer in his own right. Let's give credit where credit it due, both men have different approaches.

That way when it is presented as a movie you will also get the rating, therefore you kinda know what to expect. I didn't think this play was funny at all, and I hope Tyler Perry wasn't trying to convey a christian message, because these days in Tyler's plays and/or movies there is no more christian values present.

But after a visit to Land of Nod, read lots of review online my husband and I decided to splurge on the Quinny Buzz Stroller for our first and only child. It was the trip to Land of Nod that triggered me to consider this stroller. If you live in a walking city, like Chicago, it is one of the best strollers; it is excellent on the sidewalks, great for jogging, light weight, handling with one hand. The stroller comes with ALL the accessories, unlike most strollers. Our daughter enjoys the comfort of the Quinny Buzz; it is her little hybrid car.

The other is \\"What's going on\\". Those of us who are true fans of his know the story behind the album, which makes this a unique, yet bizzare CD at the same time, and truly deserves to be listened to from beginning to end in complete form. It brings back so many memories for me. Especially Saturday mornings, when my mother would clean the house to this album. Everytime i play it, it reminds me of my mother, and being a kid again.

And Marvin Gaye's \\"I Want You\\" in this format is no exception! Excellent essays, one from Jan Gaye, are windows to Marvin's mind. You might as well have called it \\"I Want You aka Ode to Jan\\" because she was the inspiration for this suite. Although Marvin didn't write some of the songs, he sang them as if he wrote them for himself. The outtakes are real treats...it shows true creativity and evolutions of a masterpiece.

This is probably my favorite album of Marvin's as an adult woman, because the subject matter of the songs are more intimate and mature for me than when I was in my early teens when the What's Going On album came out in the early 70's (it's my second fav by Marvin). Marvin is clearly singing his most intimate thoughts of his second wife Janis, on this album, just like he was doing on the Let's Get It On album.

Still with genius producer Timbaland, the funk hits the fan on more than just one track.Her voice is still as sweet as ever, and provides the perfect Sunday evening driving background music. This is the last for our princess,because God would caller her home shortly after the release of the album.

Meaning that she can go from hip hop to ballads and her music be irresistable. When I first heard \\"We Need a Resolution\\" It took me by surprise, because it was different from anything she had written before, but the more I heard it, it actually became my favorite song. I look forward to hearing it in the clubs. Because we truly need resolutions to today's problems and issues. I've been following Aaliyah since \\"Age Ain't Nothing But A Number\\" I enjoy her music, her style and all that follows. She will truly be missed and continually loved.

I only like four songs on the whole album. Matter of fact, I don't listen to the album at all. I bought the album out of respect for Aaliyah because she seemed so sweet and nice. To bad I will never get to met her."},{"rating":"1","title":"tried too much","review":"Aalyah's new self-titled album is big on trying out new cutting edge sounds, but not big on making great songs. Most Aaliyah fans who liked the lead single \\"We Need A Resolution,\\" will probably like #3 \\"Rock the Boat\\" and #6 \\"Care For You\\" which are slow songs. They are actual flowing songs, which are a rarity on this disk, which is filled with so many music and temo changes, that you can't tell if the song is supposed to make you dance or cry. The one good thing about the disk is that it shows off Aaliyah's vocal talent more than anything she's done before, and while she'll never be a diva it shows that she is a more than competent singer. I give the album 2 stars because it is groundbreaking, but it shows me that sometimes it's just good to stick to your past formula."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Last Album From A Great Artist","review":"Aaliyah was killed in a plane crash on saturday. Her death is an overly sad occurance. This is by far Aaliyah's best album. AALIYAH is a must buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can you say overrated?","review":"Aaliyah made 3 decent songs, IMO. But other than that, she was unoriginal. She didn't have a great voice like millions claim and she didn't write her own songs. Very average to me. Even Monica has a better singing voice, but no one payed attention to her. Jeez...I wonder why. Aaliyah was mediocre. Great performer, but not a great singer. Get anything by Anita Baker, Whitney Houston, Aretha Franklin, Phyllis Hyman, Chaka Khan or Tina Turner. REAL singers. Aaliyah's music was never groundbreaking or new. Basically her team wrote songs that ppl like Jlo, Britney or Ashanti could've sang. And no, this album is not a classic. THe reason why Aaliyah is this so called princess b/c:1. nothing was bad written about her2. she died at 22"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Beautified Masterpiece.","review":"Aaliyah's new album entitled \\"Aaliyah\\" is a beautiful work of art. She's got those tight joints produced by Timbaland, but also, slow melodic tunes that could rock you to sleep. I know that when I first got this CD I was so open, and still am; true, most of her songs are not produced by mastermind producer, Timbaland, but I think that it all together shows how much her vocals have grown in the last 5 years. it also lets other creative geniuses like Static from Playa... and her other writers have their place in the sun. Aaliyah truly did a marvelous job on this album. Everyone, please purchase!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Aaliyah","review":"I love this album. It showcases Aaliyah at her best. It's a definitive album, showing exactly what she was capapble of as a woman and a singer. Definitely one of the best albums ever. Each song is strong and classic. A new sound by an artist who always pushed the envelope and set trends for many to follow. This album is simply amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A BEAUTIFUL artist to grow up listening to","review":"This CD, I believe is the best one yet from Aaliyah. The lyrics and beats are \\"right on time\\". I cannot believe that Aaliyah is no longer with us to make more CD's. And I think it hurts me more because I grew up listening to Aaliyah. When she came out with her first album, I was only 16 years old myself. My favorite track is \\"Whatever\\". I think that it really sums up a whole lot about love and life. Aaliyah you have touched so many by your life and your unfortunate death. Your mememory will live on....through all of us!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not good quality","review":"I purchased this CD used and indeed it was USED. Skipped from beginning to the end.

So enough is enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rest In Peace, Baby Girl","review":"Aaliyah's third and sadly last album is one that took me by surprise. I had come to expect the standard pop charts-friendly songs that had brought her to a place of fame. Although uptempo tracks are not my favourites, her songs had proven to be very good. I an act of memorial, I purchased the album.I discovered an album that was very different from what I expected. As well as several amazingly listenable uptempo tracks, their were some really lovely ballads. The track \\"It's Whatever\\" almost makes me cry everytime I hear it. The song sounds so sad, and her voice is so beautiful and fits perfectly.Many of my friends and my cousin think this album is not that good, but I think they missed the point of this album. Well done Aaliyah, may you rest in peace."},{"rating":"2","title":"To the person below me...","review":"To the person below me, your assessment of the album is invalid because you're obviously biased towards anything anti-Aaliyah and obviously don't like her as an artist. What does having bad taste in men have to do anything with the album? Give me a break. This is someone who gave Britney Spears' album 4 stars out of 5 and this CLASSIC Aaliyah album only 3. PLEEEASE."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dearest sweet aaliyah","review":"Dearest sweet aaliyah was the best person who has came into my heart.I felt like god took the best thing i had away from me. I loved her so much and will always remember her and know thats she is in a better place. Aaliyah has completed her life time. I will do what she wished now that she is gone. I will no longer look at her as just an actress or singer but as a full on entertainer and a good person. She wanted to be known and spooken amoung legends. I will now look at her as how she wanted. I know she is looking down on me and watching over me as i sit here this very moment.I want to let her know that i love her and always will. I also want to thank her for blessing me with her magneficent peresonality. No longer shall i mourn her death but celebrate her 22 years of life.

I thought there would have been more hot beats and a little bit more production from Timbaland. Instead, it seems as if she tried to experiment on different things a little bit too much and it backfired badly. The only bright spots on the album are like the first 3 or 4 songs and then the rest of the album goes downhill from there.

I may not be the top 100 reviewer, but I feel I know what good music is. I enjoyed Aaliyah's One In A Million, and Age Ain't Nuthin' But a Number, but her self-titled CD is...flat (and I'm being nice). I don't feel any of the tracks, even the current \\"We need a resolution\\". Well resolute this...GET TIMBALAND BACK! I may be wrong-maybe it will win Grammys-but for now...Look for my copy on the auction block!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's ok but not buyer worthy","review":"It's a very bland album. I did not care for it at all. \\"We need a resolution\\" was a dumb song. She is very talented and pretty woman but her songs were no good. You could say it was boring. The only good song on this album was \\"rock the boat\\" and that was about it. If you like Aaliyah, you should just buy the singles and save your money. I'm glad did not waste my money on this lp."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Album,Give Me a Break I Beg You","review":"Vocally Aaliyah is lacking BIG time.She can't sing at all.This album is the worst album i've ever heard.Some songs are ok but most of them should not have been created.I wouldn't recommend this album to anyone but if you're looking for your first Aaliyah release,\\"One In A Million\\" is a good choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was her failure album to me","review":"Aaliyah was a good person, at least thats what you guys are saying.But do any of you all know her,NO,DIDN'T THINK SO!!!!She could have beeen the meanest person in the world, and nobody would know.You all have no idea how crazy you all sound talking about that girl like you all knew her!To me this album was stupid!!!It was not all that good as you all are trying to make it seem(just cause she dead)And heres something you guys didn't know, her album was number 55 on the charts for a while, and that's not good to me.Then she dies and it goes straight to #1.Am I the only one that notices how dumb that looks on the fans.You all didn't talk about that girl at all when she was alive.There were never any specials on her really, until she died.She got most of her fame from her dealth.The album sucked.She did a horrible job.I heard that album once, and hated it.Don't waste your money coustomers.It's not worth it.!!!I highly Recommend Brandy's Full Moon, though!*"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best CD of the Year","review":"This is truly the best CD of the year. Its a nice mix of RnB, Hip Hop, and Soul that never lets you go. I think people have overlooked this cd b/c of Alicia Keys, but this CD goes so much deeper and goes into more different subjects and has a more mature yet youthful sound. It saddens me though that Aaliyah won't be able to reach her true potential. May she rest in peace."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not exceptional, but good!","review":"Aaliyah's new effort is decent. To me, she's taking R&B into new areas. One of change, which is better. There's even a rock influenced track on this CD. Although I can't say that I really like it, at least she's doing something different from all these others out here. And it is a step in a new direction. There are some really good songs on this CD like \\"We Need a Resolution\\", \\"Loose Rap\\" and \\"More than woman\\". For a 21 year-old girl like her, she seems mature beyond her years. Even more mature than an older artist like Janet Jackson. It's clear that Aaliyah is mature and different from most female artists and her latest effort definitely deserves attention."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great loss of talent...","review":"This is by far her best CD.

This cd allowed us to see the growth and maturity in such a talented young lady. I have all her cd's and she will be truly missed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunately disappointed","review":"I really hoped that this one would be a blast. Her album \\"One In A Million\\" was definitely already a step in the right direction, especially with the inclusion of Timbaland as a producer on half of that albums tracks. What followed was a string of excellent singles and soundtrack cuts like \\"Are You That Somebody,\\" \\"I Don't Wanna\\" and, of course, \\"Try Again.\\" Next to \\"Try Again\\" (it is included on the German version of her new album) the only other stand-out track on \\"Aaliyah\\" is \\"More Than A Woman,\\" once again a collaborative piece with Timbaland. The rest, and I really hate to type it, is disappointing. She is still talented, but she really should look out for better material next time around. She really should go back and \\"Try Again\\" quite quickly before her star as a singer might fall considerably, and why not work with Timbaland for a whole album for a change? - August 26, 2001: I just heard about the tragic incident and at first I was in shock and disbelief - R.I.P."},{"rating":"2","title":"With this album, u see another side of Miss Aaliyah...","review":"Having heard previous albums by this young & talented artist, you really take notice to this album from the ballads to the up tempo-rock joint.

I cannot begin to express what a terrible tragedy the world of music has seen for there can never be another Aaliyah. Just as this world has seen many entertainers depart into the heavens, this is without a doubt the worst one yet. Her music made you feel like you knew her on a personal level and her beauty was even more evident when she began her acting career.

The self titled Aaliyah embarks heavily on laid back jazz-r&b rather than the electronic effected radio songs weve grown so accustomed to. Timbaland is on board once again, but at times, one may wish theyd apply some of their soundtrack smarts to full length albums. The stronger stuff remains in \\"Try Again\\" and \\"Are You That Somebody?\\", but there are a few gems on here; like the sleek snake charm rhythms of \\"We Need A Resolution\\", the suggestive and signature Timbaland sounding \\"Rock The Boat\\",and the whats this! industrial-like \\"What If\\". While its not a classic, the late great Aaliyah's last album contains a few songs that may rock our boat a little."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as expected","review":"From the advance word of mouth on this album (especially its stellar review in RollingStone), I expected a knockout. Instead, I got perfectly competent, at times thrilling, R&B/hip-hop from one of the most talented artists of her time. Unfortunately, we could have expected much more from Aaliyah, and in my opnion, this album isn't what she should've left us with. In her previous work, she showed a girl far beyond her years, struggling with complex relationship issues. Here, she's all grown up, and though singles like \\"We Need A Resolution\\" and \\"Rock The Boat\\" are amazing songs, all together, the album feels somewhat forced together. I don't regret buying it, but overall, I think that this isn't the last album Aaliyah would've wanted to leave the world with."},{"rating":"2","title":"rock da boat","review":"I think aaliyah's song rock da boat is really nice.

She could have done so much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this album","review":"It took me a while to get sue to some of the in between tracks like Loose rap, Extra Smooth, but I love this whole album. I Can Be jams. Aaliyah was not the stongest vocalist, but she was multi-talented. Had she lived long enough to really promote the album and do more videos, artist that came up after her passing like Alicia, Beyonce as a solo artist, and Ashanti would have really had to be on top of their game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aaliyah's Best Album.","review":"I've been a BIG fan of Aaliyah since \\"Age Ain't Nothing But A Number\\". This album captures a more Mature Aaliyah. Unlike her first album, which was mostly written by R Kelly, This album shows a more soft, sexual side of Aaliyah. My only problem with this album is that it is no longer in print in the US. This is a must buy for any Aaliyah fan.

Aaliyah always came off as a real person who cared about the people and gifts of God around her and did not take her career for granted.Aaliyah was a wonderfully gifted artist who gave a lot to her generation and the people around her.A life cut unexpectedly short for no reason.

To me, \\"Aaliyah\\" really isn't worth the money. I listened to the CD all the way through, and out of all the tracks on this CD, there are only three of them that sound good. Those tracks would be \\"We Need A Resolution\\", \\"More Than A Woman\\", and \\"Never No More\\". Of course, her first single off this CD was the reason why I went out and bought it. I thought to myself after listening to this, \\"I should've gotten the single instead.\\" I was very disappointed and felt that I wasted my money. It lacks the production that her two previous CDs (\\"One In A Million\\" and \\"Age Ain't Nothing But A Number\\") had. All the beats and the lyrics on Aaliyah's self-titled CD sound the same, and the lyrics are just plain awful. I recommend you save yourself [price] and go buy the \\"We Need A Resolution\\" single."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aaliyah minus Timbaland & Missy = very lame release","review":"I was a huge fan...but with a release like this, I think she will be losing a big part of her fan base...not one hit on this album...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"\\"Aaliyah\\" is another amazing CD from the late Aaliyah Haughton.It's filled with songs of passion and pain.Aaliyah's voice is very soothing to listen to.It's tragic that this was her final CD,but she left us with a beautiful work of art.Best Songs:I Care 4 U-This is the best song on the albumRock The Boat-A little sad,a little ... but goodMore Than A Woman-Great beat,great lyrics"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rest in Peace Aaliyah","review":"I dedicate this review of Aaliyah's latest album to Aaliyah, whom we know that tragically died in a plane crash in late August of this year. My condolences to her friends and family. I'm very glad I bought her latest album because I am a great fan of Aaliyah and I've listened to her since she first appeared in the music scene in 1994. Her music has been consistently great and she keeps up with it in her latest album \\"Aaliyah.\\" I like certain songs on the album (\\"We Need A Resolution,\\" \\"Rock The Boat,\\" \\"More Than A Woman,\\" \\"I Care 4 U,\\" and \\"Read Between the Lines.\\") However, I can see she's experimenting with other music genres like heavy metal in \\"What If\\", which I don't like at all! I recommend buying this album especially if you liked Aaliyah and her music. Otherwise, its a good album to listen to, and even dance to at times."},{"rating":"2","title":"From My Point of View","review":"I enjoy mostly all of Aaliyah's music. She has a voice that is sweet and astonishing-reminds me of an angel when I hear her voice. It is sad the way that we loose many great artists through any type of tragedy. She was just beginning at the peak of her uptight carrer, and now she lost it all without exploring it and her life. This album woke me up in many ways. She had this certain type of lyric style that you would enjoy hearing without all the hatred and violence, not forgetting the profanity that we hear now these days. She had that smooth touch that shows how relaxed she were with herself and her music. Not only on this album, but on the rest as well, she put that certain style in there that would make you just sit back, relax, and smile."},{"rating":"2","title":"*Truly More Than a Woman*","review":"WOW! All I have to say is WOW! I was never too much of an Aaliyah until I heard ROCK THE BOAT which is now my 7th favorite song of all time.

MORE THAN A WOMAN is super catchy and it's pretty fast moving and fun to listen to.LOOSE RAP and WE NEED A RESOLUTION are 2 other classics.

And anyhow, I hope you all buy her new album.. \\"Love ya, Aaliyah!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"I wouldn't advise you buying this album!!","review":"I have to say that Aaliyah isn't one of my favourite people because I think that her voice is only mediocre and after listening to her album, I have become even more convinced of this fact. I have been brought up listening to well developed singers with excellent vioces, all of which are somewhat naturally talented. Aailyah isn't one of these people. Trust me!! I have listened and listened to this album trying to find that special spark of something that was worth listening to but my tiresome journey has failed (miserably). I wouldn't advise you buying this album unless you were a complete Aailyah fan otherwise I personally think that it would be a waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"stars in heaven","review":"all i can say is that the spirit and music will live on forever rest in peace and have a peaceful journey home"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bold display of talent, beauty, and undeniable potential","review":"Aaliyah, (highest, most exalted one), lived up to her name in the production of this album. From her Back & Forth days to her One In A Million, and now to her Rock The Boat days. The album Aaliyah, nutured and created proved to be a stand out in the commercial R&B. This album, gives the listener a bit of every kind of music, that is widely listened to. Her breathy vocals (Rock The Boat), and seductive adlibs (We Need A Resolution), puts the listener into her world. You feel, Aaliyah, you feel Aaliyah's problems (Never No More). You feel her sorrow (I Refuse), u feel her happiness (Its Whatever), u feel her independence (More Than A Woman). She IS a true artist, and created a masterpiece with Aaliyah.

Dunn","review":"None of these Aaliyah songs sound like Janet rips offs. We all know Aaliyah's voice is way stronger/better than Janet's and even Rolling Stone's 5 star review said that 'Aaliyah' is what Janet WANTED to make. Lets first get clear that the only song reminiscent of Janet is I Can Be/What If.....channeling Black Cat. Understand that Aaliyah's music was criticall acclaimed BEFORE death. Her first two albums were widely successful. Especially in other countries. It is totally unfair to credit the success of 'Aaliyah' to her death.....when One In A Million did better than 'Aaliyah' did. So what sense are you making?

Not having listening to this since 2002, I decided to pop it in the Cd player and start reading my favorite book. It hasn't left my Cd player since. I totally remember seeing in August of 2001 on the news that Aaliyah died and remember crying. Being 13 now, I actually understand what the lyrics mean and it means much more to me. She was the artist that steered me away from the Britney Spears/girly pop era to the R&B/Soul era. I currently like to listen to this album of course, Jill Scott, Faith Evans, India.Arie,the recent Mariah Carey album, and stuff like that. Aaliyah changed me emotionally and affected me on a personal level.

A great day for Grindcore.","review":"Looking through the nonsense scribbled here that are supposed to pass for \\"reviews\\" I have to laugh. Barely anything is written about the music. Instead, you are presented with incoherent babble about a dead girl. Who cares? No major loss. And when a review is about the music, there is no explanation whatsoever.I think Aaliyah was a poor talent. Like all R&B singers and bands I have heard. Rap and Hip-Hop, too. It's funny though, because even though I'm not a fan of this genre, I probably know more about it than most fans. Oh well.She was a weak Death Metal singer with a poor growl. Instead of this false Grindcore nonsense, I would like to suggest the new Pig Destroyer album, Prowler In the Yard.P.S. When you say \\"we miss you Aaliyah\\"...she can't hear you. She's dead."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is terrible","review":"I agree with the previous reviewer. I am trying to use this book to teach a basic class in animation at the university level on the Mac. I do many multimedia/web design/digital imaging tutorials in the course of my job and this book is the worst.There is not a lot of literature on Amorphium Pro. The tutorials in this book are missing steps and are unclear. What the user sees on the screen after following each step in the tutorials does not resemble the illustrations in the book even in the most basic of exercises. I called the publisher thinking that perhaps there were typos and was told that there were not any errata. The e-mail address that I received for the author of this book was invalid. The questions I sent via e-mail were returned.I have ordered the Learning Amorphium CD from lynda.com and am hopeful that I will have a better learning experience.

I was hoping there would be some tutorials in the book that would instruct me how to build something that I would like to make, but I don't see anything in this book that I would actually want to learn how to model. I logged on to this site hoping to find another book on Amorphium, but no luck. FYI - The \\"Learning Amorphium Pro\\" CDs by Vince Parker are very thorough in explaining the in's and outs of Amorphium, tips on things to watch for and a few modeling instructionals. I can see it would be a much better investment than this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing book for such an incredible 3D program.","review":"The book contains some good tips and tricks and the author seems very familiar with the tools. Unfortunately, the models that appear in the book look very amateurish. This is certainly not a book you would use to show off the capabilities of Amorphium Pro. The author also annoyingly exports most of the models to Bryce for rendering instead of using Amorphium Pro's renderer. How does that show what Amorphium Pro can do? It doesn't.At one point he makes a snide remark that \\"Liquify\\" is spelled wrong in the program and should be \\"Liquefy\\". This seemed petty to me, and according to my dictionary both forms are acceptable. The book also doesn't cover texturing as well as I thought it should. Still, considering it is the only book currently available on Amorphium Pro, it does have some handy tips and if you have the money to spare, it is worth a read. At least until more comprehensive and professional looking Amorphium Pro books are published."},{"rating":"2","title":"MoH: Sick Girl","review":"Super grossed out by bugs even more.

This film is another entry in that august collection. It's a twisted take on a romantic comedy featuring lesbians and mutation spawning insects. Lucky McKee is well represented in this quirky little horror/romantic comedy. His previous work (the film May is a prime example) mostly consists of emotionally rending surrealist horror. It's nice to see him going for bigger laughs with this work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull, drawn-out lesbian horror fare not worth watching","review":"Please oh please tell me why anyone would call Angela Bettis an actor?

The mystery of the medallions takes Frank, Joe, Chet and Tony on a treasure hunt to Guatemala. Personally, I didn't find this book very good. I thought that it lacked much action and many of the chapter endings didn't entice me to read more right away. The plot of the book was rather weak and not very creative and it took the Hardys and their friends no time at all to find the treasure after arriving in Guatemala; although, that didn't happen until page 160.

Kelly should have known the songs were garbage, I find it hard to believe anyone would like them. A couple of high points are that she actually sings pretty well and is aware of her voice limitations. She keeps within her voice range. The first two songs could have been awesome had the teeny bopper bells been deleted and the overkill flanger effect minimized. The second song has a 70's disco drumbeat that just doesn't work - it weakened the song. Song three and four are latrine filler. The rest of the songs are low average. Ok to buy the CD if you like early 90's music and Kelly's voice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good","review":"I was impressed with the single \\"One Word\\" and the B-side, I thought what the heck, I'll get the album.The album is very well produced. The songwriting by Linda Perry is good and matches Kelly and her lifestyle well.The tunes are catchy.Kelly's singing is a bit weak, but covered up nicely with the slick production.I enjoy this record."},{"rating":"1","title":"K. Osbourne vs. Visage","review":"Listen to One Word (the first track on the CD) and then to the 80s hit \\"Fade to Gray\\" by Visage. Sounds familiar or what???"},{"rating":"2","title":"So much better than her first, and NOTHING like her first!!!","review":"So I heard Kelly was making a new album. I just kinda was like. \\"Oh...great. BLAH.\\"I listened to the single \\"One Word\\".Wow. This stuff is almost industrial in some cases. Awesome vocals, great sound effects and all the songs are very well put together.Kelly's vocals have matured greatly, and she is doing a great job in this one. I never expected this sound from her at all.\\"Redlight\\" really is probably one of the best songs on the album. It has a catchy tune.Another word on the album, \\"One Word\\" is by far NOT the greatest song on the album. My favorite being \\"Entropy\\". It's really electronic, good beats and it simply rocks.A very good album by Kelly, and I hope she keeps coming out with new stuff after this one. Totally unexpected and simply amazing!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of electro/new wave hybrid dance gems--plus the full club mix of One Word","review":"Mixing guitar and old synth sounds, the production on this CD is reminiscent of Missing Persons and Berlin--and the types of retro new wave tracks Gwen Stefani has recorded on both her solo CD and her discs with No Doubt. Red Light, Secret Lover, I Can't Wait are perfect examples. And check out the bassline on Entropy and you'll swear you're listening to \\"Effigy\\" by Ministry. Plus, track 11 is the 7 minute and 55 second Chris Cox mix of One Word.Who cares if it's kelly Osbourne, and whether or not she's talented or has a plain voice? If you are into the electro/retro 80s trend going on right now, you're gonna be feeling this disc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kick-a** rock and roll","review":"If you like good ol' back to the basics driving rock and roll then this CD is a must.

Then I read a review of this product that mentioned using the brush for counter tops and stainless steel sinks. I am so glad that this review prompted me to buy this brush. It really cleans up the counter tops and the stainless sink looks really great after cleaning with this brush. It is also a great tool for cleaning the interior of the refrigerator. It has cut down the time required to do that job, and just makes this weekly task more effective in less time. It's an excellent investment and would have been worth the cost at twice the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dimensions incorrect","review":"This brush was misrepresented and is not 10.5 inches long, but 7 inches rather.

I must say first off, I don't know for sure, but I should check (too lazy) - the vocalist in this one seems to be a different guy (or a guy with less practice) than the other albums I received. Now, while he isn't terrible, he can get a bit pitchy in places and it sounds like someone is punching him in the gut now and then. But, that complaint aside, he is good enough not to ruin the extremely nice power metal going on here. Excellently written songs and nice melodies bring this album up to par with other metal albums and make it a good investment for any power metal fan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dana Pomfret's Soul Collage is soul-lifting!!","review":"I am a huge fan of anything this woman does.

However, the selection is slim, and I don't think you can even find these anymore. I did order the natural/ivory color, but they are not lined and don't keep out the light at night, when I want the bedroom to be DARK. I also have a pair in dark purple, which blocks the light better.

It's a majestic hymn with her talk/singing about happiness and love coming to her in disguise, but being able to find the happiness and leave behind the pain. It just sickens me this will never make it to radio and become a hit for everyone to hear. It puts everything else on the charts to shame. And Billy Corgan from Smashing Pumpkins helped her write it. This may be his best work ever as well. I could go and on about this one song, but the album is full of wonderful tracks--\\"Sex With Strangers\\" and \\"Wherever I Go\\" just two of them. I have loved Marianne for years and years and she just keeps getting better and better. Cheers, Marianne."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"This new one from Faithfull is amazing! Full of...passion, electricity, and unbridled acknowledgment of the past. Here, newbies such as Beck and Billy Corgan mix it up with one of rock's most legendary muses. The combination of fresh instrumentation/programming - and choice songwriting - blend perfectly the elements of the past and present - This disc is potent, world weary, strung out, but most importantly - a really satisfying listen - Faithfull telling stories as only a well traveled chanteuse can - Melodically on the mark with a slight haze of dissonant beauty -Mmmmmmmm get this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Full of Instant Classics","review":"This album is full of instant classics, of songs that could only be done by Marianne Faithfull. You may not care for the cover of \\"Something Good' but you will forever appreciate the sly bit of irony that it ends an album that begins with \\"Sex with Strangers\\" And then there are moments like the \\"Pleasure Song\\" where we almost think Marianne is begging her lover back to bed with \\"so much more love left to give\\". \\"Song for Nico\\" and \\"Sliding Through Life on Charm\\" make a perfect centerpiece. \\"Song for Nico\\" is one of those moments of beautiful complex simplicity while \\"Sliding Through Life on Charm\\" is a well written, well delivered rant on middle-class values. Who else but Marianne could cuss and swear so elegantly? \\"Nobody's Fault\\" and \\"Kissing Time\\" just add to the depth and range of this collection. Just keep listening to it over and over again, it does not disappoint...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kissin' Time","review":"Kissin' Time being Faitfull's 2002 release and is a collaborative effort with the likes of Beck, Billy Corgan, Dave Stewart and Blur. The sound is a mix between new wave, rock and experimental rock. All the lyrics are included in the booklet and some very modern art. For each track we also get info on whom plays what on the track.

I was really disappointed in the slower tempos, lack of vocal bounce and general feeling of tiredness coming through. I can see how people who like a more sedate and \\"mature\\" approach might like this, but I miss the energy and positive vibe of the old BNH.It's great when musicians \\"grow,\\" but it works best when they are able to discern the framework that got people to like them and develop that framework. This disc abandons the brightness that made BNH so refreshing in the past and replaces it with a kind of weariness that is unbecoming for this band."},{"rating":"1","title":"Feels underwhelming upon several listens","review":"A lot of the songs on the BNH's new release did not grab me. The best song on here is \\"All fired up\\" IMO. This cut is funky. I welcome and applaud the musicianship on here, but compared to \\"Shelter\\" this cd falls short of my expectations. I'm all for sticking with a formula, but they need to mix their signature sound with a more updated sound IMO. This cd lacks experimentation and artistic growth. Welcome back BNH, but please take risks on your next cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"just ok","review":"i use to really be digging this band back in the early to late 90's,but they just got stuck on a groove&now seem desperate to re-connect when if they had have kept things on point they would be ahead of the musical curve. bringing back N'Dea is a little too late now. a New producer&some new Songwriting ideas might do them some good. there first 3 albums were cool,but it's been a good minute since I felt anything by them. there are Grooves, Hooks&Runs in there music,but this ain't like it use to be. glad they are still around doing there thing,but I feel they need to up-date there sound&add some new writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not what I've got used to","review":"\\"Get Used to It\\" and \\"We won't stop\\" are TBNH releases that share the same category: boring music.Where's the energy?

The especially neat thing about this album is that its not a 'one trick pony' ... all these songs have very different grooves & styles and they are all equally good. If there's someone above, this should be huge.

But man was I surprised when I cranked this up on a 300 mile drive to New York last week! The range and genre changes (raggie,disco,jazz/r&b) is amazing. My favorite is \\"Sex God\\". It's a real \\"come-and-get-me\\" song that N'Dea Davenport pulls off at her sultry best! Got to see them at the Capitol Jazz festival in June. TBNH turned the joint out and in the rain no less!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Blast From The Past","review":"Like one of the previous reviewers added: this is a real group playing real instruments. This CD is a wholesome change from whats out there now musically. They bring back that natural funk flavor. Out of the 12 songs 9 are really solid (1,2,3,6,7,8,9,11,12). My favorites were \\"Get used to it\\" no.3 & \\"We won't stop\\" no.6. The 8th joint takes a thinly veiled shot at the techno enhanced music of the day. On the 7th cut they actually mention how they were attempting to bring funk back into music. N'dea returned with superb vocals after a long hiatus. She put icing on the cake, and she's still as seductive as ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"get the album","review":"im a beliver so i bought this (i got the album)and hey is it really worth it i think not 3 tracks on it album version and instrumental and another albums track get the album instead if you like dru down"},{"rating":"2","title":"good brush but but bristles are soft","review":"This is a really good brush but I was surprised at how soft the bristles ended up being.

Crystal, anyone? But...I don't have delicate items. I have lots of things like the coffee pot that frequently get built up residue that will only come out with a stiff bottle brush. This is not that kind of bottle brush. The bristles are very, very soft. You might be able to irritate the skin on your hand with it if you rubbed the brush on it about a thousand times.

It has a comfortable, long handle, two types of bristles, and is large enough to get the hard to reach spot under the \\"shoulder\\" of the pitcher (that can sometimes be a drag). It works perfectly for what I needed it for, but I would imagine if you just needed a brush for mugs or glasses, the handle could be considered a little long. Works for us!"},{"rating":"2","title":"For Where I Can't Reach","review":"I have always struggled cleaning my tea pot and my Nalgene water bottles. I would stuff washcloths into them and spin them around but I never felt like I was doing a good job. I saw this cheap little brush on amazon and figured I'd give it a go.

I am impressed with this brush and am very glad I found it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like it...somewhat.","review":"The bottom bristles while a little stiffer than the side ones, but still overall pretty soft.

The handle length seems adequate, and the actual handle is indeed comfortable to grip and has a non-slip surfaceIt will do for light jobs and has its place, but the softness of the bristles limits what I would call vigorous scrubbing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Throw all your others out this one will last for years!","review":"I have had this brush for over two years now and I use it constantly. The colored end bristles are a little stiffer then the white ones so it's great for the bottom of jars especially the ones you have to clean for recycling. Makes hard work a breeze. After extreme daily use it still looks brand new, I just put it in a glass with bleach and water every so often to keep it nice and fresh. I purchased two and the other one is still under the sink with the tag still on it because I just can't wear this thing out! I LOVE THIS BRUSH!

I use the dishwasher only. This brush is the perfect item to rinse the dishes off before sticking them in the dishwasher. It gets in the corners and crannies. I like doing this because I only run my dishwasher in the evenings only. Food never gets caked on. This little brush never scratches any dish or glass but is tough enough to clean out a pot or pan.

The good thing is that it fit through the small opening and the handle is long enough to reach the bottom of the 12 cup thermos, but the brush's bristles are so weak that virtually none of the brown coating from the coffee came off the sides and bottom of the thermos.

I use a meat grinder several times a week to make pet food for cats and make sausages for myself. This requires scrupulous attention to cleanliness. One of the parts was a little hard to clean on the inside, but this bottle brush makes the job a breeze. It is both flexible enough to easily clean the interior, while the bristles are soft enough not to scratch the metal. I also found it to be an excellent tool for cleaning the square glass containers that I use to store milk in the refrigerator. As you know square kitchen containers can be tricky to clean.

Worked fine at first, then after a couple of weeks the tank would no longer fill. Took the cap off and determined that the lever movement was impeded by the seal failing to seat itself correctly in the cap. Called customer support, the rep suggested that I could try picking up a replacement seal at the store. Keep in mind that the original fill valve in this toilet worked for 16 years without a problem. So I went to the store -- to return my purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mixed Results","review":"I am happy to see several content albeit not handyman customers. After installing a number of these 400A's, I would say you have a 50-50 chance getting a functional one. I just installed another one and the float doesn't float! Therefore the valve kept shooting more water every 30 seconds until it overflowed the tube. What should I expect, cheap product, cheap results.If you review the Korky Quietfill Valve here on Amazon, you'll find numerous Fluidmaster 400A being tossed for them. Much better construction and overall dependable function. Also, if you don't have a water descaler like found at www.stopwaterscale.com, then you will get scum build-up on the 400A in a couple years sufficient to require another replacement of the Fluidmaster. The sliding float gets caught if the center tube is slimmed with scale, which causes it to fail. The Korky Quietfill Valve has no such problems and should last as long as your water softener membrane, which is subject to city water chemicals."},{"rating":"2","title":"GReat product.","review":"I bought this to fix two toilets that would not quit running.

Take \\"Universal fit\\" items with some common sense, Do all research possible for your items and you'll be fine. Go out on a limb and get it for a brand or model not so commonplace and you'll be taking your chances unless it is specifically listed as a replacement for that brand/model. I had to download the instructions for my American Standard model from the internet as I had misfiled them. They called for this item by part number. Fixed the problem. Easy install not any problems. Only gave it 4 stars because I think float assemblies should last longer than they do in the first place. I'll be lucky to get 3-4 years out of this one just like the factory installed one or another replacement. Installed in an American Standard Champion 4 which is too new of a model to have any issues at all in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best ballcock on the market","review":"I have been a self-employed plumber for over twenty five years and have installed hundreds, if not thousands of fluidmaster #400 A ballcocks. In all that time, I have never had one that was defective, and I buy them 25 to the case. They are ,in fact, the least expensive most reliable unit on the market today. No offense to the other reviewer, but you have installed the unit incorrectly or there is something else wrong with your toilet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreliable rubber valve design won't last long","review":"Inside the unit, there is a rubber valve membrane. When the tank fills, and the float goes up, the membrane is pushed down by a tiny steel pin going through it. After some time, the pin won't push, it will just slide to and fro. And the valve won't close anymore. You have to replace either the whole head, or just the membrane (2-3 dollar). This is a design flaw, existing for long time. Anybody knows different make of toilet valves?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Garbage","review":"I never imagined that I would have a strong opinion about a plumbing component, but I hate this thing. Unfortunately, my apartment building only uses these fill valves. They're awful--I'm on my third one in about 6 years.The first two developed the same problem: the float often wouldn't push the lever up far enough to trigger the shut off. Even with the water level knob turned all the way to low water level (i.e. fast shut off), it was very unreliable. I frequently had to lift the back cover and raise the lever manually. The fluidmaster was so unreliable that I never left the apartment until I heard the toilet click off, because there was a good chance that it would leave the water running the entire time I was gone."},{"rating":"1","title":"New Valve, New Problem","review":"I bought a new American Standard with the Fluidmaster 400 Anti-Siphon Toilet Tank Fill Valve, because I couldn't find a flapper valve for my old the Crane toilet (apparently, the flapper valve I needed has become a rare commodity). The Crane ran and ran, which wasted a lot of water and drove me crazy at night. I thought newer would be better (and American Standard seemed like a good bet), but in short order (a month or less after the toilet installation) the Fluidmaster 400 began to run, but not because of the flapper valve. This time it was the tank fill valve. The lever attached to the arm that connects to the float would not close all the way. I saw a repair tip on YouTube to fix this issue--cleaning grit from the valve--but it turns out that the fix was not applicable to my brand new Fluidmaster 400. Anyway, I am still looking for the fix. I am someone who expects newer designs to be more robust, but sadly this has not been the case with the Fluidmaster 400."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage, don't buy","review":"I've gone through a few of these, it doesn't take long before the valve stops doing it's job. They leak and and won't shut the water off. I had to replace mine yet again just after a year. I brought the new one home, installed it and right away the valve was already bad. So I exchanged it and yet another brand new valve was bad. So I took it back and exchanged for the Corky brand instead.... perfect! No runs, no leaks and as a bonus the Corky is even quieter. I won't buy from FluidMaster again."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE: Wrong Parts & No Customer Service on Web","review":"Purchased 2 of the Fluidmaster 400A units at Home Depot for $8 - the plumbing rep there recommended the part and told me to read instructions twice before installing. Glad I did.The parts do not match the instructions included - the \\"angle adapter\\" is either missing or has been replaced with a plastic clip of a different design. Not really interested in making up my own design on the fly - I went to the Fluidmaster website. There's no Help for the Fluidmaster products - just a sales-oriented Flash site. I downloaded the PDF instructions available there, and found them to be the same as what came with the 2 units I purchased.The toll free number on the bottom of the packaging (800-631-2011) is not functioning; the toll number listed on the website only works M-F.This unit feels cheaply made, and the incorrect instructions combined with the lack of useful support has me heading back to the store for a better option."},{"rating":"1","title":"You will be replacing this annually!","review":"I made the big mistake of replacing a couple of toilets in my house with Briggs 4400's. They use the Fluidmaster 400 tank fill valve and I have problems with them every single year. I have city water that is a little hard and it causes the black float to bind on the gray tube after about 1 - 1.5 years. I have tried cleaning the parts but you can't clean inside the hole of the black float. So every year or so I have to replace the thing. Fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"missing parts could leave you high and (not) dry","review":"This assembly may not come with all the parts you need.

When you get to the instruction for attaching the water line, they say (paraphrasing): if you've got line type 1 or 2, use the included parts X and Y. If you've got type 3 or 4, we didn't give you an X or Y for that type, so reuse the old X and Y from your old assembly.

Gems like \\"Anthem\\" and \\"Purple\\" have already appeared on previous compilations (Pi soundtrack and Tranceport vol. 1, respectively).

It's a collection of boring house mixes. Little on here is actually fun to listen to, and they all lack the characteristic Gus Gus groove that (sadly ex-) members Daniel Agust and Hafdis Huld brought to the band because they had yet to join Biggi Veira and Herb Legowitz and make the Gus Gus most of us know.The album is doing well on the dance charts as I write this, and I agree that some of the songs here might make a good background for those looking for uninvolving techno, but those expecting a bona fide Gus Gus release are going to be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this even the same band that wrote polydistortion?","review":"Polydistortion is, in my opinion, one of the greatest albums in the last decade.

The basic idea is a good one, but it's hard to get the soap from the handle to penetrate the sponge.

The result is that you have to throw it out and buy a new one when the scrubber sponge is still in pretty good shape. I know they are \\"disposable\\" and that usually doesn't mean long term wear, but I would feel better about throwing it out and buying a new one when the sponge is worn out from washing dishes, than having to throw it out because of poor design or shoddy workmanship.

Despite using Arrow staples, in all sizes recommended for this model, I just couldn't get more than 3-4 staples in without it jamming again.Seems that others have had better luck, and that's good. Maybe my issue was just a fluke. Just be aware, there could be more out there with the same defect as mine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective","review":"Just adding to the chorus. I purchased one, with Arrow staples, used as directed, and the gun simply does not work. On the first 20 tries, it spit out about 5 staples, then it stopped working altogether. I was checking out the action and I think the way the gun is built, it fails to push the staples to a position that is square prior to contact with the firing pin. Unfortunately, I can see no way to get into the gun to remedy that defect. I'm amazed that, with so many reviews like this, stores still carry this product on their shelves. Perhaps you'll get lucky and buy one without this defect, but how can you trust a company that sells broken tools?"},{"rating":"1","title":"short lifespan","review":"I've owned a couple of these over the years and they work great for awhile.

After trying two of the guns I will not try another. The gun is very powerful and can flush drive a 9/16 staple into hard pine very nicely. However, I had a some problems with the gun. I had many miss-fires when shooting into all materials. I believe the weak spring used to advance the staples might be to blame here. My guns were also very hard to open and fill with staples. The release did not operate properly. Third was when shooting into hardboard with 1/2 staples some drove all the way in and some stood proud of the surface, making it necessary to use the hammer. The last thing was the firing handle would come out of the socket when using it and need to be relocated back in place. All time consuming and frustrating.I am still looking for a better solution. Maybe the Duo Fast CS-5000?"},{"rating":"1","title":"No longer heavy duty","review":"After light use (homeowner) for three years, a a ring broke and the clevis pin fell out, rendering the staple gun useless. Warranty? Two years. Parts available? Yes, for $1.00 plus $5.15 shipping from Arrow, for a total of $6.15 for a tiny steel ring that should have never broken. Obviously Arrow QA thought this was good enough. In sum, if you need a light-duty, not very comfortable stapler that is cheap at the outset but expensive to maintain, buy this stapler."},{"rating":"1","title":"Arrow T50P 1997","review":"Never worked well.

And I never ran any kind of staples through it other than Arrow.Picture this: As darkness was falling, I was trying frantically to staple down tar paper on a new roof in preparation for a predicted heavy downpour. So imagine how happy I was being forced to stop work every 5-10 minutes to take the whole front end of my Arrow stapler apart (snap rings and pins) so that I could pry out a jammed staple with needlenose pliers. When the roofing job was finished, I took a sledge hammer to that damned Arrow stapler. Never again will I buy an Arrow product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jams Contstantly","review":"I'm on Amazon looking for a new staple gun because the current one I've been using is an Arrow T50. I've spent more time trying to un-jam the gun and load new Arrow brand staples into the gun than one should ever have to do over the course of a lifetime.

Don't burn a lot of cash for \\"Midnight Oil,\\" but if you can find it cut-out like I did, it's a worthwhile investment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Interesting Album","review":"This is actually a very interesting album, Christmas aspect aside. Fahey, as always, is the master of tunes in standard and waltz time. (I actually believe he could not play a note out of tempo if he wanted to.) His affinity for waltzes is well evidenced here with \\"The Waltz you saved For Me\\" standing out as one of his all-time best efforts ever in this genre. Another jewel is his read of \\"I'll be Home for Christmas\\", which he transforms from the usually smalzy, maudlin treatment into an almost disturbing lament. This shift of sentiment is pure Fahey. Even when he plays the over commercialized \\"Chirstmas Time Is Here\\" he manages to get a little past the unavoidable echoes of the chipmunks to reveal the tune in it's more Germanic influences.On the whole I think Fahey gets well beyond the Chistmas genere on this disc, and that may explain its unpopularity. (I picked it up for four dollars recently in a cutout bin) Very under rated. Four bucks well spent."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Can't Lie - it's Kitsch","review":"But you can't blame the guy. He's got to eat just like the rest of us. Back in 1968 he noticed that Christmas records just sell and sell and sell, so he recorded one (\\"The New Possibility\\") and wouldn't you know, it became his best seller - not Blind Joe Death, not Railroad, not The Yellow Princess or any of those other masterpieces. So he put out more Christmas albums over the years (I think I count five) and this is the ickiest one of the lot - can you stand \\"The Skater's Waltz\\" or \\"Do You Hear what I Hear\\"? The music is mostly duets with Terry Robb, and most mellifluous they are too. And I guess guitarists will like the arrangements. But as a Fahey record, this is for completists."},{"rating":"2","title":"This was such a fun book I can see the movie potential","review":"I read in romantic times that they are possibly going to make this into a movie.

The rest is basic Irish music featuring a traditional Irish type of flute. It is an aquired taste. I found it to be high pitched and annoying. The music works well as the soundtrack of the movie which is love story set in the background of the IRA. But, the story is bleak and depressing, and so is the music. Out of the context of the movie, the music isn't that pleasant to listen to, and would be a real downer for a Sunday brunch or a dinner party. Someone calls it challenging. It is a challenge to sit through it.If you like the Titanic soundtrack, you would probably appreciate this.

The new design has an altered head shape and the bristles are much softer and splay apart quickly like the cheaper versions found at the large box stores. In the past I have gotten the pictured version at Ace Hardware for the price of about $8.00, exspensive but because of their bristle sturdiness well worth the price.

First, I would have a longer handle. With the short handle, it's definitely a hands-and-knees operation, and that wears thin when you have many square feet to clean. Second, I would make the bristles stiffer. I've used the brush to clean about 450 sguare feet of tile, and the bristles are already beginning to seem a bit mashed.

The rodents were one-dimentional, unemotional, and failed to establish their own identity. Animals sell, and that is what the producer is counting on.The plot was weak and lack any credibility. This was just another \\"animals being chased by the bad guys out to destroy the world\\" movie. Haven't there been enough of them made so far? Why another one? The plot lacked a single ounce of creativity.The graphics were terrible, and void of modern technological advances. The movie relied on hyped up music and singing animals to provide any semblance of entertainment value. Weak!Finally the humor was terrible. The \\"jokes\\" were the type your 80 year old dad told 60 years ago. A little originality would have been nice.I hate to give a poor review to a kid's movie, but this one was bad. Even the kids I watched the movie with were bored.Save your money, avoid this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"not a bad movie with really good 3d","review":"This movie won't win a oscar but it was entertaining.

But my children wanted to see it, so we rented it, and wow, was I taken back. This is actually a very funny movie. Starring mostly lesser name actors for the human characters, the guinea pigs are voiced by stars such as Steve Buscemi and Nicholas Cage. The story is quite a simple; two scientists develop technology that gives human intellect and speech to small animals such as flies, guinea pigs and moles. These upgraded animals are then used to fight international crime and terrorism. This movie is part action, part comedy, and part adventure. The special effects are kept low-key but they are effective, especially the movement of the animals. The dialog is quite engaging, with each of the animals having their own unique personalities, attitudes and slang. Best of all is the storyline, which keeps you guessing to the very last minutes of the movie. Overall, quite worth the watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Animation Domination","review":"I saw this in the theater,so I can honestly say the DVD is as clear and sound quality is excellent.The story has a message that all kids should hear.

The plot is simple: think of guinea pigs as James Bond-like spies, who are the real stars of this film) mix 'em up and you've got G-Force, a new comedic adventure from Disney teaming with Jerry Bruckheimeronce again. Trevor Rabin once again does a heroic music score, while the script, though rather goofy is done well by the director in his directing debut. The voices of the animals provide most of the comedy, while the people are just along for the ride, more or less. If you happen to be an animal lover, however, certain scenes may upset you, unless you acknowledge the fact that it is just a movie-some of the animals get hurt though, but only a little.Kids will love it the same as the parents/adults, check it out for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grandsons loved it.

Somehow, it works. The CGI critters blend seamlessly with the live actors and scenes, making it incredibly easy to suspend disbelief.As with any good kids' movie, there's enough wit to keep the paying grown-up amused.

Need, is a strong word...but I do like this now...The pre-cleaned and easy peel shrimp is much more espensive than just the shrimp in the shells...this does make it a bit easier.Once I *got* it, I think I am faster than I was. So since it doesn't take up much space and isn't expensive I think this was a good purchase.That said... its a bit like a grapefruit spoon or melon baller in that it can be very nice to have and extreamly convenient to have under the right circumstances...but as to really needing it..

I love the strings! They turn Wes's bare trio into something warmer and richer! The strings turn these old 'Sixties chestnuts into something transcendant. Don Sebesky's string arrangements are top-notch and I would like to buy up every album Sebesky ever did.But the star is Wes! Such heartfelt guitar! Great choice of songs!

The bristles are firm enough to get the dirt off mushrooms or potatoes, but not so firm that they damage the skins.It is a very useful little brush, doesn't take up much space in a drawer, and is easy to hold and use.

It was also defective with the metal rod for the pedal mechanism totally disassembled. I fixed it but then the other medal metal rod came apart as well.

It is written from a single view point which is limited in knowledge. The problem with this book is that people are just trying to pinpoint one thing for the teenagers troubles, but in fact the biggest problem would be lack of understanding on the part of people such as the author.

Her husband (Joe Pantoliano) looks after their young son when Mary is forcibly taken to a mental institution. As with many schizophrenics, they stop taking their medication when they feel well, and then they go downhill again. She eventually realizes that she needs to take her medication. She is close to her son, and very protective, to the point where it is embarrassing for him. The movie gives one a look into this family home, and you realize that there is a togetherness not found in many homes where all the family members are so called \\"normal\\". A very touching story."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVED IT!!!","review":"When I first picked it up, I thought I had been conned yet again into buying a book I wouldn't be interested in. But as soon as I got past the first page, it was immediately apparent to me that I would be drawn into the worlds of Elena and Georyn.

It was recommended to me by the school librarian when I was in 6th grade. I'm now 30 years old, and I've never forgotten it.It's not just sci-fi or fantasy.

Are you people deaf or something? Are you sad there's a lack of depressing songs on this album? There is real depth to their production sound on this album (And that has been lacking throughout their career) Just play Edges of Twilight for a few songs, then throw Seven Circles on, it will blow you away.This is truly an album you can listen to over & over again in the car without getting bored.I'm going to see them live next month on a Wednesday night and I cant wait..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the Tea?","review":"I have been a long time fan of The Tea Party. I have all the official releases and still listen to all of them up to now. I have come to expect a change in the music and feel of the band. What I wasn't prepared for was this. Of all the releases I have to say that this is the one I don't listen to. The only two tracks I do listen to are Writings on the Wall, and Seven Circles. It's not a lack of musical talent or substance, rather a lack of good quality sound. Although I am saddned by the news of the band breaking up, I take comfort in knowing that they will not continue if this is whats to be expected. For those of you who are new to TTP go and get The Edges of Twilight and Transmission. The others albums are great, but you must first become a fan to appreciate them"},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened?","review":"I can't express how let down I am by this album. I love the Tea Party and have seen them Live several times and its an awe inspiring experience. This Album however is not. I gotta say the alarm bells went off when I heard Bob Rock was producing, but I still went out and bought it thinking he couldn't do that much damage. How wrong I was! This album has no soul and every single song sounds the same. Gone is the magical dynamic and rich tapestrey where every Tea Party song sounded unique. I listened to this album several times hoping I would warm to it but I'm afraid it just annoyed me more to see such a talented and experimental band who are great songwriters put out an album like this. The only reason I give this album any stars is that its not possible with amazon ratings to give it a zero, otherwise I would have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sonic Fodder","review":"A lackluster effort that was shelved within a week.

Bob Rock was a cool choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmmm...","review":"I agree with Luke Magnus 100%.The Tea Party were a inovative, unique and powerful band. I was hooked the moment I first heard Splendor Solis and my admiration and appreciation grew with their next two albums. Seeing them play live was truly amazing.With all their releases up to and including Transmission, we were hearing beautifully crafted music unaffected by standard pop music parameters and ideology.My heart broke when I first heard Triptych and nothing since has helped to heal it. What indeed did happen? 7 Circles is another example of lazy lyrics and songs which seem to be born out of a desire for Radio airplay rather than the desire to stimulate the senses. It is as if the band has conceeded that they must appeal to a broader audience in order to sell records. What a shame.I live in hope that The Tea Party will one day return to form."},{"rating":"1","title":"The End","review":"Hindsight is 20/20, as they say.The fact that Jeff has left the band (amicably or not is a point of contention between him, JB and Stewart), should tell us that the efforts that were made in the creation of this album were mitigated by a decided lack of inspiration. Hence, we've got the weakest Tea Party album to date. And sadly, this is how we say goodbye to them.If you have been a fan for awhile, like myself, you are no doubt upset by the band's breakup. But, are you surprised it's AFTER this terrible offering? No, you're not. I've done myself a favor so as not to rub salt in the wound, and relegated this disc to the bottom of the pile. Because hearing this uninspired, ham-fisted pseudo-Tea Party music is a concrete documentation of the band breaking up.And this \\"tears me apart.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Signature Jean-Luc","review":"It was Jean-Luc-Ponty who solidified my appreciation of jazz fusion and helped me to forever turn my back on the tired and noisy heavy metal garbage of the late seventies. I liked it loud and fast but wanted quality. Seeing Jean-Luc do this album in concert in October, 1977 made me an all time fan. The Enigmatic Ocean suite (especially part 3) showcases Ponty's genius as each part builds in energy to a level of musical brilliance that leaves you in awe. All the musicians on this album perform at Ponty's level and take their turn making you play the air wid 'em. Check out Ralph and Allan on the last track! This is the best fusion album of all time and is \\"Signature Jean-Luc.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST fusion CD EVER!!","review":"I've waited a long, long time to write a review for this one. Actually, words are wholly inadequate to describe this recording. Imagine music that grabs all of your being, inside and out. Imagine music when music was not just product, but reflected the passion of outstanding musicians.EVERYONE I know who has heard Enigmatic Ocean LOVES it. If Ralphe Armstrong's second bass solo on \\"The Struggle of the Turtle of the Sea\\" doesn't light you up, then you're dead.I listen to this CD at least twice a week and will almost certainly continue to do so until I die or go deaf. BUY THIS CD!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Right where I left it...","review":"I experienced this music when I was 20, back when Enigmatic Ocean was originally released, while smoking pot with a group of friends. I've always disliked smoking pot, and never had a good experience with it EXCEPT for that night -- it felt so wonderful being tossed around in all that sound. I haven't heard EO again until tonight, and it's every bit as incredible as I remembered it to be... now THAT's what I call transcendental."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of His Best","review":"This album stands as one of Jean Luc's finest and most complex works. A woven sound tapestry that takes the listener on an incredible journey. It feels as uplifting and compelling as the baby sea turtle's struggle to reach the sea. The backup musicians collaborate to define the moods just as richly as Ponty's violin and piano/synthesizer. Allen Holdsworth's unique guitar is in peak form, both aggressive and subtle. The bass player is solid. Jean Luc Ponty composed something here which I believe he will never surpass."},{"rating":"2","title":"Listeners say \\"YES\\"!","review":"The reviews here show that people are passionate about this recording. Most feel this is not only JLP's finest but also one of fusion's best. I agree. What really sets this apart and gives it such lasting power are the musicians. Yes, the compostins are great but this would not have been the classic it is if JLP had gathered other players. After buying this you should check out the follow-up works by these briliiant artists...Drummer Steve Smith's Vital InformationGuitarist Allan Holdsworth (anything - he is truly a living legend)Allan Zavod - hard to find but worth it, the band New York MaryDaryl Stuermer's work with early Phil Collins, Daryl's the weakest on this date but he's still great.Ralphe Armstrong with Mahavishnu Orch.This recording introduced me to Holdsworth.

I only kept going, because the book has such a good reputation, I figured it must get better. I did have a hard time with the books writing style, however, the final chapter of the book, which masquerades as a \\"historical notes\\" appendix put everything into its proper perspective. I have seen a few people suggest that they didn't read this final section, and that is a huge shame. This final chapter is the thing that ties everything together. Suddenly, the book that I had felt was a little bit stilted came alive. In hindsight, it is an amazing read, and I have a feeling that I will give it another read through sometime in the future. Overall, a very interesting book, stylistically AND thematically."},{"rating":"1","title":"A long nap","review":"This book was an absolute bore. I kept waiting for the peak which just never came. Overall, such a disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Atwood was phenominial","review":"This book was wonderfully written, and lets your imagination take over, to create your own preception of Offred's future. However, the end leaves you unclear and with questions.......very very powerful reading. Could it be a warning?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Chilling but insightful.","review":"Just like a lot of other readers, I also have to read this book for my English class. I found it very chilling that women are no longer valuable unless they have \\"viable ovaries\\". I admire Atwood's imagination and the technique that she used in The Handmaid's Tale. There're a lot of flash-back to the 'before time'. I at first felt it's very difficult to read. But after I got used to it, I realized that this technique enhanced the book so much. They increase the choppiness, and the confusion of the story. I loved this book. And this book could be an alert too. Our society might become Republic of Gilead one day"},{"rating":"2","title":"it was really good in an unusual way","review":"This book starts off kind of confusing but after the first 100 pages it starts to pick up. It's not like most book because you don't read for the plot or action or because your attached to the character. Its just interesting to read. I was a little dissapointed with the ending, but not because of the loose ends, it's the kind of book you want to keep going and giving more information that not even revelant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rare in dystopia novels","review":"Of all of the novels about dystopia that I have read, The Handmaid's Tale is definitely one of the top few. There are very few that are written with a woman character as the first-person narrator, which heightens the sense of social commentary that leaks from each page. For years, women have been forced to identify with male first-person narrators and we've become quite good at it. I know that there are some otherwise intellectual people who have a hard time identifying with a main character unless he/she is of the same gender as the reader, and that may account for some of the negative reviews of this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"American Taliban","review":"One authors vision of a Taliban-like society certain televangelists and a small group of Congressmen would love to see implented in our country."},{"rating":"2","title":"war on women.","review":"The book shows how quickly women can be exploited, and abused. Controlled along with th population as a whole. It shows that it could be a reality by electronic means as a start.It also reveals that if your paying attention, just by observing those around you it is not science fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Creepy","review":"This book really made me feel upset a few times while reading it. The way the women were basically ousted from the adult world of actually having a job and family was crazy. I wouldn't have done well in such a place. I feel the lack of control would be the most difficult thing to deal with.My only real criticism is the ending was super abrupt, but other than that the story was interesting and scary to think if that were to really happen it would be hard to want to live like that as a woman."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good book but i did not enjoy reading it.","review":"I personally did not enjoy this novel. From the very beginning there was nothing to really keep me going. I did not even completely understand what was happening for several chapters. I give credit to the author as she came up with a radical story idea but it was not the type of book for me. I did not enjoy reading about what Offred was forced to do with the commander. There were also so many questions of mine that did not get answered. What ever happened to her husband Luke? what about her daughter? The Handmaid's Tale is interesting in the fact that it all revolves around what used to be the United States. I think that the way it was written was another reason why i did not enjoy the novel. Some of the sentence structure and language confused me. Overall i think it was a good book but i did not enjoy reading it. I would recommend it for older people who are interested in politics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing dystopian \\"satire\\"","review":"Very disappointing after such epics as Life Before Man. The plot was complicated and character development was minimal. Disjointed prose made it difficult to read, as did the never ending time shifts. Atwood's ideas, although possibly relevant when the book was published, are now outdated in this post-feminist era.Surely the theme, although horrific, is not as bad as it seems? When their is a choice between sufferance of the living and the quality of life of future generations (and if there is to be one), surely this makes the issue undebatable.If you want to read the book, then good luck. The film version is also Ok, if unfaithful to the actual text.PREPARE TO BE SHOCKED, CONFUSED (AND SOMETIMES BORED)IF YOU READ THIS BOOKER PRIZE NOMINATED TOME. OTHER DYSTOPIC NOVELS ARE BETTER.........."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of time","review":"If I could have given this book no stars I would have. What a waste of time - it was as boring and repetitive as anything I've ever read. I'm a woman and I suppose I should have identified more with the underlying message, but all I could see was the insult to my gender. I finished it ony because my daughter is taking a literature class in college, it was assigned reading for the class, and I promised her I would read all the books so we could discuss them. Had it not been for my promise, I would have stopped reading after the first 20 pages. Yuck! This is my first Margaret Atwood book, and if it's representative of her entire body of work, I'll never read another one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stilted Polemic","review":"When observing the puppet-characters of this novel, the strings are always visible, for they have but one reason for existing - to implant the attitudes of the author in a new generation. The far-fetched setting also has one reason for its creation - the same. Wherever the reader looks in this novel, he or she sees the uneffaced hand of the author, for this entire polemic exists exclusively as a pulpit for Margaret Atwood to pound out her bigotry against religious people. The Handmaid's Tale is the literary equivalent of Ayn Rand - but with hate instead of philosophy. As a piece of literature, it is stilted."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book could have been great, but wasn't.","review":"I had read the amazon reviews and was looking forward to this book, but after reading it I was really disappointed. The story was good, but it felt underdeveloped and immature -- by the end of the book I was more irritated with Offred than sympathetic. The characters were shallow, at best, and overall it just didn't seem to come together. The idea was certainly interesting and the book had all the potential to be really powerful, but it just ... wasn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Brilliant Literary Work","review":"This last year, I had to read this book for an \\"independent reading project\\" that my AP English teacher assigned. At first when I heard the title I was thinking about how dull the book would be, about some handmaid to some person... \\"How exciting...\\" However, being as how I'm interested in stories with a female protagonist, I was still willing to at least give the book a try. Instantly I was hooked with in the first few pages, already brewing questions as to what exactly is going on and why things are as they are portrayed. Margaret Atwood was able to set a great story with the perfect setting and a plot that twists in such ways that can leave you asking questions until the epilogue. Even then I found myself still asking questions. I highly recommended book."},{"rating":"1","title":"It just goes on and on","review":"This was a difficult book for me to get through. I felt like I had to read every page (waiting for something to happen that never did). I think it would have been great if it was a short story, but as a novel, it was just too longwinded. The descriptions of things just went on and on.I thought it would be more exciting. I have read numerous dystopian novels and enjoyed Hunger Games and Enclave. I think I was looking for something more like them, and this book is NOT. It is more like The Road but without anythign ever happening."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good, but okay","review":"Atwood deserves to be on the Wall. Just kidding, but basically, the book put me to sleep. I disliked the way she kept flashing back and forth between her memories and the present time.

The movie is better."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hated this book","review":"This book was flat and boring! I hated the character especially Offred. I don't know what message Atwood was trying to send and by the end of the book I didn't care."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous, unlikely, feminist paranoia","review":"Before reading this, you should know that this book is extremely anti-Christian, and full of nonsense. This is a future world where very few women are fertile, and \\"Christian\\" religious right men are in charge. Because so few women can have children, those who can are used as \\"handmaids\\"-essentially, they have babies for the men and their sterile wives. Now, there is no mention in this novel of why egg donors and implantation aren't used, or why fertility treatments aren't employed. There are also women used as prostitutes-those who are defiant about the existing order. This is a paranoid feminist novel, one completely unlikely to happen, and one that will piss you off to read. It isn't even a good story. I had to read this for school and hated every minute of it. There is no truth in it, just a rallying cry for NARAL. If you're conservative like me, skip it. It will only make you angry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tries too hard","review":"The story, IMO, tries too hard to gross out the reader. Plot is all over the place, and though I have read more than 60 percent of the novel on my Kindle Fire, that's the best I can do. I enjoyed the frequent wordplay in the novel, but that couldn't carry me through the whole novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was ok.","review":"For some reason I found this book kind of boring. I understand her life was boring, and that all she had to look forward to was a sneaky romance. The reality of this to ever happen in the future is unrealistic. It's a story to be easily forgotten."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inexplicably overrated","review":"Neither subtlety nor realism necessarily rank among the most important ingredients of a successful polemic, but one largely devoid of both cannot claim much merit. Having said that, it is just about possible to read Atwood's book against itself as a parody of a certain sort of contemporary American feminist writing.The saddest thing about 'The Handmaid's Tale' is that Atwood is clearly a highly intelligent, educated and cultured individual. She *must* know *herself* that 'HT' is ludicrously over the top. Why on earth she chose to offer it to a publisher remains a mystery to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"the handmaid's tale","review":"Could not get into this book and after the first chapter - I put it down. Rarely, do I not finish a book that I have started"},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute Rubbish","review":"This book took me 3 days to finish... over a one year period, that is how long it took to continuously muster the willpower to finish it. I don't know where to begin with what's wrong with this book, a much shorter list would be what is actually good about it and that is the few pages between Offred discovering the fate of her fellow handmaid Ofglen and discovering her own fate. But even this is problematic, much like the characters and the entire plot, this occurrence is underdeveloped and hurried. This book might as well have been a series of unrelated short stories, as each chapter is somewhat disjointed from the next. Simply put: Muddled use of flashback, rubbish ending with no closure to the preceding sequence of events and overall no perceivable plot. In addition to a painstakingly slow buildup to some sort of anti-climax at the very end of the book, with an abrupt ending leaving many unanswered questions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time to read,","review":"I read because of a book club that I am a member. The book had no positive themes within in it. Not realistic as a futuristic fantasy. Ending had no resolution, and so on,and so on!

(Copied from my Goodreads review)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a big fan","review":"I didn't think it was that great. Atwood is a good writer, and there are some beautifully written passages in the book. Overall it was hard for me to get through. Mostly, the lack of logic in the plot annoyed me. And I got really sick of the narrator character. Basically the whole book takes place inside her imagination, which is a place I would rather not be. She didn't seem very smart, and I thought she was a pretty boring and weak person. Also, I'm not a big fan of reading about racey infidelity.Also, I prefer stories about people attempting to fix their problems instead of just whining about them. I know that negative stories can often teach us things. But I don't feel I gained much more than a headache from reading this particular story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ignorant","review":"This book has been made into a cheesey \\"opera\\". That should tell you everything you need to know about this book.The plot follows. An extremist religious group gains control of the US military and overthrows our government. They then establish their own theocracy where women have no rights and they persecute members of other religious groups, not much unlike modern day Iran (2002). If you don't know why this is not very imaginative and laughably impossible you need to spend more time in reality and less time in fantasy land."},{"rating":"1","title":"Handmaid's Tale Disgusting Feminazi Propaganda","review":"Supposedly this book is about a male dominated society that is dominated by males. However this book actually reveals a thriving subculture of feminist underground revolt. In a way, I think, it parallels our own society. Seriously, how many female generals do YOU know? Oh, zero? Precisely. And I bet the male ones you know have mistresses. PRECISELY. The society depicted in this book is supposed to be an \\"extreme\\". But in reality it is happening here and now, right around us. Hell, just the other day my neighbor was shot by the government and his wife taken as a midwife. And a hotel used as brothel? Gee, that's never happened before."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"This boook was just horrid. I will admit that it was well written, but it is not meant for high school students to read. I am a Junior and I was required to read it for my Honors English class and it was just too crude. It talks a lot about sex and is just too harsh for young ears or for any ears really. It seems as if all our culture revolves around anymore is sex and having a Junior English class read it just validates that statement further. If you want to crowd your mind with pornography related scenes and just plain filth then read it, but I advise you not to and to not recommend it to anyone else."},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting dystopia","review":"The story is told from the perspective of a woman whose life utterly changed in her mid-twenties due to a gov't coup in the US that left the executive and legislative branches dead. A totalitarian regime is put in place that controls women as breeding resources. The only thing that really bothered me about the book was that I found the timeframe unbelievable, that in 5-10 years society could be completely upheaved to where people accept this new power structure and imposed religiousness. I kept feeling it'd make a better story if the main character was one generation removed from the coup, but so much of the story as delivered depends on the woman's experiences pre-coup. I, too, was disappointed in the open ending; though the fictional \\"historical notes\\" addendum gives you some indication of what happened after the story, you still don't get any specific indication of what eventually happened to the main character."},{"rating":"2","title":"A \\"1984\\" for America in the new millenium","review":"I wish this book could be dropped, like leaflets during wartime, on all of the 'red' states. I watched the excellent movie adaptation of this book a few years ago and finished reading the book for the first time this morning.All I can say is WOW! What's more amazing, and scary, is that this book was published 20 years ago! When Offred relates in a passage of how the President and half of Congress were killed and it was blamed on Islamic terrorists, my blood literally ran ice-cold.Many reviewers have cited similarities to the actions of the current Bush administration. My bigger fear is what will come next? With most of the media acting like lapdogs of the multi-national corporations that sign their paychecks, while they perform any trick that Karl Rove and company orders, the citizenry is being lulled into an increasingly deep complacency."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loved the premise but....","review":"Definitely an interesting concept however the manner in which this story is told just really isn't my cup of tea. I made myself finish although I wanted to set the book aside a quarter of the way through it. I found it to be cumbersome, at time difficult to follow and ultimately quite boring.I'm the first to admit that it looks like my opinion is in the minority. Different strokes for different folks, I guess."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sexism, classism, and public executions in the Christian Utopia of Tomorrow!","review":"The United States has become a Huckabee-meets-Palin Utopia, a WASP military dictatorship based on a racist Protestant reading of the Bible. Women are property, illiterate, and subservient.The white military elite engage in the erotics of Scrabble and dressing up in cheap costumes. Unfortunately, nobody seems to be happy, which is odd, since one would expect a little more glee and togetherness in the American Christian Republic. The public executions and rampant classism (Hello! Econowives!) also make it a not-so-nice place to live.Instead the reader is shown that this utopia is nothing more than a dark mirror to theocratic tyrannies like Saudi Arabia, Utah, and North Korea (with Kim Jong-il treated like a god).A highly recommended book to give to all your conservative Christian friends and co-workers."},{"rating":"2","title":"new twist on dystopias","review":"It's about time someone wrote a dystopia from a female perspective. Governments are usually run by men who don't think for a minute about being a woman, which causes law-making to be biased. If this situation would ever arise in our society, one can be sure of who would take over, and who would be left to obscurity. Atwood has taken writing to a form of the highest art, with her amazing word twists and mind games. Probably my favorite dystopian novel, in which the main character has not only a brain, but an imagination and a memory."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very interesting and relevant","review":"The story is intriguing. The way it unfolds makes it very thought provoking, especially in recent times where subjugation of women in India and the middle east is in the news everyday."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great and terrifying read","review":"I was so surprised at how truly horrifying this book was, considering that I'm a woman. Atwood weaves such a heart-rending tale that is both empowering and terrifying. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is a feminine pile of trash","review":"This book is the worst pile of feminist crap that I have ever had the misfortune to read. It belongs in a dumpster. It's the sort of book which lets one understand why some people burn books for fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anti-American undertones","review":"Why the author uses America as the evil totalitarian country is ludicrous. Anyone who truly believes that there are Christians out there that want to create a society of repressed women slaves is truly uneducated with the facts. Ms. Atwood would be far more intelligle using a story such as this in relation to an islamic takeover of a country. This book was ridiculous. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry to hear that Atwood sold out...","review":"I thought that she was a superb author until I found out about her acceptance of the Dan David award for $10 million at Tel Aviv University. I thought she was an anti-colonialist and anti-racists. The book is good, but it turns out the author is a bad person. You can't pick and choose which certain racisms, certain colonial-settler projects, are more acceptable than others. What a disappointment! Shame on you, Atwood!"},{"rating":"1","title":"extreamly boring","review":"the plot was never revealed, and you can get easily confused because the narrater switches back and forth between charecters. Also, she keeps remebering a lover of hers that was already married to another woman. i would defentally NOT recomend this book to ANYONE!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Firewood is cheaper","review":"As an undergrad in college I was required to read this novel for an English course--go figure. From what I remember the story is centered around a woman who is caught up in a theocratic regime which takes over the US, and she is forced to abhorrent things like have men in the administration sire children through her.Looking back now, the situation described in the novel reminds me more of the Stalin regime than any type of theocracy I can think of, even the kind they have in some muslim countries (Yevgeny Zamyatins \\"We\\" comes more to mind--Stalin admired that novel). In fact, the \\"abhorrent\\" situation I described above is not much unlike the \\"Lebensborn\\" program (a.k.a. \\"human stud farm\\") which Heinrich Himmler used to propagate the \\"Aryan\\" race during the Third Reich. And you youngsters who have been brainwashed into believing that Hitler's government was Christian, you ought to read up on the occult roots of Nazism (see e.g. Peter Levenda's book)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why I did not enjoy The Handmaid's Tale","review":"I am an average reader. I read The Handmaid's Tale as a school project. I found it to be poorly written and incredibly boring. The book doesn't have much of a plot, the character development is amazingly poor, and the author's use of sensationalism was really quite revolting. The author seems to say, \\"This is what will happen if we let those damn Republicans in office!!\\" Personally, I don't mind hearing the message once or twice, but it is repeated over and over throughout the 400 pages of this horrible book. I can see how a leftist feminist might enjoy this book, but I don't think it is possible for anyone else (including the entire male gender) to enjoy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of money and time!!","review":"I saw a recommendation for this book in one of the threads on the Kindle discussion board; my bad for buying based on the majority of good reviews and not even trying a sample first!Good grief, what a waste of time and money - I may have read a worse book, but if I did, it has blessedly left my memory. I struggled through 50% of this piece of garbage; really only kept reading that long hoping something would happen to give it some redeeming value since I'd paid for it - no such luck.Lesson learned."},{"rating":"1","title":"No","review":"I personally believe \\"Best Sellers\\" should be decided by how many people actually WANT the book.And just because a book is a classic doesnt mean its any good."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Handmaid's Tale: A Novel","review":"I found the writing style abrupt and rigid. I did not like the way information was given to the reader. It was difficult to follow at times.

This book was chosen for a book club read and though I did not like the book it will certainly make for a good book club discussion."},{"rating":"2","title":"are you there \\"eye\\" its me...Offred","review":"the first book in our Modern Novels class <ok ok ok so we've read two> that Ive actually liked. It made me think. something else I dont usually do..<haha>Im out of time.... any questions?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Review of the handmaid's tale","review":"According to my opinion the handmaid's tale by Margaret Atwood is not worth reading. The general idea of the novel is not bad at all, but the style of writing is very boring. For people who are not interested in depressing dystopias it's a waste of time to read it. The story is often confusing and incoherent. Also the fast changing time levels make it hard to read.Even though it was a torture for me to read it (at school), the topic of the book makes quite sense as we all live in a fragile society and it is not unrealistic that we might end in a world described in the book. So that's why i gave two stars of five."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ultimately flat and boring","review":"While I agree with many reviewers that the subject matter is interesting and perhaps relevant to today, where women are stripped of rights in some places in the world, I did not like this book. As a result of her situation, Offred's character holds herself distant from the world around her. While a reasonable response to a screwed-up world, her narrating is just as distant and flat and I found myself not really caring what happened to her. The plot moved very slowly, and I wound up reading the plot synopsis on Wikipedia just to see if anything better is coming. It doesn't appear so, and so I'm not sure if I'll even bother with the last few chapters of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"By the end, it was impossible to continue...","review":"When I first started reading, I enjoyed the beginning. It captivated me and I expected a really good, developed story. However, as I continued, the monotany and general boredom took over my thoughts and the book became a horrible chore to read. Margaret Atwood also drove me up the wall with her lack of astounding vocabulary. She never diversified her words. By the end of the novel, I was thoroughly disappointed and I refused to read the historical notes. I didn't feel like going through the epitomy of boredom for another 20 pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scary but not realistic","review":"If you're one of those people who gripe about how bad today's world is - read this book! It illustrates a society in which women are nothing but breeding machines. The government controls everything. Real love is unwanted. It is shocking to see how close many muslim countries are to this scenario. However, this would never happen in the U.S.A.. Why? Because personal freedom is a fundamental right every American believes in. We wouldn't let it get this far."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wake me when it's Over.","review":"I'm not wild about the book, because it scares me. I believe I've heard the type of situation such as the one in the book called a \\"distopia\\"I suppose our society turning so fanatical could happen.It happened in Afghanistan with the Talliban. Personally the thought is horrifying. All personal freedoms are limited. People who disagree are killed, all in the name of religion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fnord","review":"The first part just plain sucked. The thought that our world could degrade to such a point is simply pathetic. Suspend the constitution, Oh Puhleeeze! Afterm page 200 it gets better and things start to fall into place. But you have to read the historical notes for it to make any sense at all. \\"NO sir, I don't like it.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating but horrifying","review":"I finally read this after coming across several references to it. It's the scariest book I've ever read because 20 years later, I can still see it coming true. It was a bit confusing to read at first but the main plot was easy to grasp. This is one of my favorite books now."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Handmaid's Tale","review":"Margaret Atwood's The Handmaid's Tale discusses the role of women in a society called Gilead, that because of declining birthrates women are stripped of their freedoms and given distinct roles all of which surround the notion of boosting the population. The heroine, Offred, is portrayed through the stages of her life beginning from being raised in a feminist environment by her mother, to becoming an individual, to having all of her rights taken away during the time of Gilead. Offred's struggle and willingness to survive without an identity, but two ovaries and a womb, will open the reader's eyes to the changing roles of women in society."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different & disturbing","review":"A story that was very disturbing. Even though this scenario seems far fetched it is not far from the truth in some countries. Oppression of women is a reality in many countries and is usually rooted in religious traditions.

It all-around too much and really did not let you know what was going on. I found it very hard to follow most of the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cautionary Tale","review":"Atwood's classic masterpiece is a dystopic forecast from 1985 into a present time where religion and politics meet, merge, and birth the bastard Tea Party. Complex and complicated characters making their way through the first generation of that time turn her compelling political statement into a compelling story.One need only spend five minutes looking at the policies of the modern Republican Party in the United States to realize that it has taken this book for an instruction manual rather than a cautionary tale, a hand-guide to totalitarian theocracy to be cherished and craved rather than abhorred. This was America's future, before the rise of the 'None' began dragging it back from the brink of religious fervor, and it is not a wholly unrecognizable one."},{"rating":"2","title":"magnificant book to read","review":"I was assigned this book for summer year for my senior year but I didn't read it because I thought it woulfd be boring but when I heard all my classmates talking about how realistic and shocking this book was, I went ahead and got. When I got the book, I just can't put it down for one second, it kept you interested to know what happened next in the story. It's a book that I would recommend you read on your own because it gives you a clear picture of what the world might become in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good read","review":"I'm not going to give a run down of the whole book like others. I simply want to say that this book is a great book! While reading you get a since of what its really like to be in her shoes. There are no quotation marks to differentiate when she is speaking to somebody and when she is narrating, but that is explained in the end, which was a big twist and great surprise for me!

I had to read this novel for my English class in my final year of high school and I would sure feel sorry for the poor buggers that still have to read it. Im sorry Atwood, but you're a dreamer. Your day dreaming when you write hardly does your hypothesis any justice. My advice to readers is to read things that are presented that way you would like to read them.

As a Canadian who has an extensive knowledge of literature available in Canada, Ms Atwood should have had the decency to acknowledge the [similarities between] her novel [and] John Wyndham's novella \\"Consider Her Ways\\". The similarities between her book and the Wyndham book which predates it are too numerous to allow reviewers to use words like \\"original\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dull, unremarkable look at the future","review":"A very boring book that has some interesting ideas but unfortunately fails miserably in bringing those ideas together. Atwood may be a good writer but her writing talents are spent here. In Offred, she creates a very pathetic character that is too uninteresting for the readers to care about what happens to her. I could not wait for this book to end, although I applaud Atwood for her creativity. This book belongs in the 70s when the feminist movement was taking shape. In the 90s, it is outdated. If anything, this book is NOT timeless. \\"The Handmaid's Tale\\" is a waste of paper that should have been written by a better writer or as a better story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe I just don't get it.........","review":"First of all, this book was so difficult to get into that I almost gave up on it. But then again, I don't like science fiction.The only way to spice up this boring, ridiculous story was for me to pretend it was from a different world, such as a Star Trek episode. Then it just became funny.I was not moved in anyway with this book, except for possibly lightly humored. It was not disturbing because it was so laughable and unrealistic. The most disturbing thing was the bizarre nightclub scene, because it seemed to be just thrown in there to be provacative, which unfortunately, it wasn't.Just wasn't my cup of tea at all. Sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and derivative. I want my money back.","review":"Boring anti male story of a nazi like society in the US where women are forced birthing slaves. As if any man would ever want to live in Atwoods world. Very sloooow book. I cannot disagree more with the positve reviews. I want a refund. Totally derivative of Orwell with characters you wont care about. Many other near future sci fi books are much better. Dont waste your time with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply brilliant.","review":"You have to read this book. Period. I have now read it five times, and I have had the pleasure of seeing Ms. Atwood speak twice, and she is quite simply one of the best writers publishing today.

Hers is a voice that must be heard."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Atwood Novel","review":"One of the best novels I've ever read!!!!

This book in no way convinced me that American society would end up in the bizarre '1984'-like ripoff presented here. To even suggest this as the logical future is completely shortsighted and ignores all advances women have made towards equality in the past hundred years or so.The entire book reads as an extremely heavy-handed attack on sexism. It fails to conjure up a realistic society, its characters defy common sense and reason, and it even falls flat in illustrating an interesting love story. The themes presented here have been analyzed a dozen times in far more interesting and coherent books. Skip this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE HANDSMAID'S TALE","review":"A VERY INTERESTING READ.

I am sorry to say that I found it very slow and over written. The characters are shallow, the story line is far fetched and the nding is just downright unsatisfactory. And then, just when you think you've reached the end you discover 'Hisorical notes.' We are all aware that it is a story so why prolong our torture with 'Historical notes'? Its not real and the notes are irrelevant. Not only that, they pose the question of how Offred was able to record them. No-where in the novel does she relay any such detail as her difficulty in keeping records. And finally, my last moan, why are the notes at the end? They would provide a good basis and outline of the novel. They belong at the front. Though to be perfectly honest the whole thing belongs in the bin. Never agin should a student be subjected to such rubbish."},{"rating":"2","title":"it's good","review":"it's a good book. it's not the best but it's good. i love the author's style and creativity, and the silly way she presents what possibly happened to Offred and Nick and the Commander."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thinly-veiled Lefty Rant","review":"Thinly-veiled left rant disguised as Orwellian thriller.

I thought, \\"This book can't go all the way to the end without anything happening, can it?\\" But it did. It was quite a feat. You could summarize this book in about 45 seconds. And you'd likely want your 45 seconds back. Is this supposed to be 1984, Brave New World, or even Hunger Games? If you compare it to any of those books, it is utter fail. I guess it was supposed to be sad, but I didn't even care about anyone, or anything in the story. And there was this weird section at the end, where they try to pretend it was a true story, and they are having a meeting to discuss the historical facts about the book. It starts out talking about a planned luncheon of the historical group. Was that supposed to make it seem \\"authentic?\\" It was just bizarre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting but...","review":"It was very well written, with imagery so vivid that it was at times disturbing.

Doris Lessing once remarked that if you want to write literature in this day and age it has to be in the form of science fiction. Viewed in this light this is mrs Atwoods first attempt at writing literature and she shows here she does not (yet) have the writing ability. This book barely rises above the level of a feminist pamphlet, if that.For a properly written book on this theme see Suzette Haden Elgin's 'Native Tongue' (and sequels)."},{"rating":"1","title":"not for me.","review":"Bought this based off reviews and I think it was on sale for .99.

While many people acknowledge how subjective \\"normal is,\\" this book gives a first hand catharsis of this notion. In Offred’s retrospections of life before, nostalgia reigns. All of us have experienced nostalgia of different stages, or periods, in our lives. It’s really true that change is the only constant. “Ordinary, said Aunt Lydia, is what you are used to. This may not seem ordinary to you now, but after a time it will. It will become ordinary�?(Atwood 34). Change is only startling long after the fact, and it unnerved me how distant yet always present the past can be. Especially with emotions. “But who can remember pain, once it's over? All that remains of it is a shadow, not in the mind even, in the flesh. Pain marks you, but too deep to see. Out of sight, out of mind.�?Atwood reminds us that memories shape and accompany us in new phases of our life. Which, faster than we realize, become ordinary to us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Something to remember...","review":"I took the time to read this twice over the course of a year. The story is never dull and leaves you hanging everytime you close it.

I read it as a highschool senior and wouldnt recommend it to many youngsters due to the duties of the \\"handmaid\\". I will be purchasing this book the next time I place an order and surely will recommend this to the rest of my family and friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"Wow! What a story. A little confusing at first but after awhile the pieces started to slide together. Scary, a little too close to home but unbelievable all at the same time. You could sympathize with Olfred, you could be scared or angry at her. You could sympathize with all the women's choices or at least the choices they were given anyway.

Give it a chance and it will go on your to ten list for sure. Margaret Atwood is a genius in feminine writing! To make such a statement in story form is amazing. The end was both maddening and wonderful. She mocks her reader continually while drawing you in at the same time.

And well you should, when we've seen what the Taliban and Islamic fundamentalists have done to women and gays all over the world. Had your story been more mythical, as opposed to a poorly veiled attack on Christian fundamentalists (and I am not one so I have no particular dog in this fight) it could have been intriguing.

The editorial reviews promised a level of drama, mystery and intrigue, I did not experience in any chapter of this tale."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the most important books of the last centry","review":"This is one of the most important novels of the 20th century. Atwood has captured what happens when people of good conscience and liberal views do not safeguard or battle for their positions. Zealotry wins in such cases. There are many novels that talk about the price of freedom being eternal vigilance. This novel graphically and frighteningly shows us the result of not heeding this simple message. It is not a very far step from the current practices of many countries to the society of Gilead, and unfortunately there are many people who would regard the society described as a utopia, not a dystopia."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes im 17 but i am NOT a mindless idiot!","review":"In reply to our dear Derrek, i as many of my other class mates throughly enjoyed the novel, it is rare a book you have to study becomes something you would read yourself, this was a pleasent suprise yet to be told those who found the ending fantastic are mindless idiots is not so pleasent... BUT as for the book, engrosing, compelling, frightening, everything that other review-ees have said before. I read many varied novels although i do not consider myself a book worm i read different genres in order to find what i like. BUt i know a lot of other 17 year olds who have never gone beyond FHM or MORE magazine who were cultivated by Atwoods sheer brilliance. Thankyou Derrek, you made 2 period on a Thursday rather entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rambling Narrator","review":"Told in first person, the story strayed quite often with inner thinking that appeared to ramble and was sometimes random. Flashbacks came without transitioning or warning. It was an interesting idea for a novel; the plot was just a little slow moving for my taste. Most importantly though, the ending just left me hanging, which compels me to take away one more star. =("},{"rating":"2","title":"Santorum's vision of America","review":"This novel belongs within the pantheon of dystopian fiction, along with Orwell's 1984 and Huxley's Brave New World. Anyone curious about what kind of world Christian fundamentalists envision, or some of the reforms that social conservatives want to introduce to the United States need to read this book and imagine the slippery slope that can lead to world that Margaret Atwood depicts. It's no accident that Planned Parenthood and the funding of birth control is a major issue for the Republicans despite the fact that economics are clearly the most important issue for the next election. A brilliant novel that will make you think. If you have teenage daughter, encourage them to read it and then talk about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be wary - abridged and has bad review","review":"Not yet transferred to Ipod but depressed to find this is abridged - my error"},{"rating":"2","title":"Religion and politics gone awry","review":"Offred, a sexual slave, writes a memoir of her experiences in the repressive male dominated future of the United States. The US experiences a serious drop in reproductive levels due to environmental degradation, birth control, abortion, etc... As a result, a religious militant cult forces these women to be breeding vehicles and restore reproductive levels to it's former levels.What's most interesting is the perverse use of religion to justify its cruelty toward women and ironically many of the enforcers of this nightmare are also women. It's an easily read book and a dire warning to fight the current illogicality in religion in today's age"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not so far-fetched","review":"Already a dystopian classic, THE HANDMAID'S TALE is particularly impressive in the way that Atwood reveals the details of the repressive Christian theocracy of Gilead. Narrated from the point of view of Offred, the tale moves at a deliberate pace, allowing the reader to piece together from small details and events a nightmarish puzzle. Given that the author predicted an Islamic attack on the West and given the current predilections of the religious right, a coup by Christian fanatics is not out of the question today. If Obama wins a second term, some of these fanatics' heads are going to explode. The Old Testament subjugation of women in the novel is right in line with their thinking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Please get me, pregnant!!!","review":"How often do you hear that? NEVER! This book was so intensly facinating that you can't help but keep reading. Sure, it was perverted and there was a lot of swearing, but I think the author was just telling it like it is. Atwood kept the book and me going so strong, I kept thinking this was an actual journal I was reading! I may be 16 years old, and I may have been reading this for a school project, but the teacher suggested it to me. And I suggest it to anyone who has strong points of view of how a \\"Christiansociety\\" would work. Believe me, you won't take everything you have for granted any more! And if this book was \\"too grown up\\" for you, I suggest you read something else, along the lines of THE GIVER, if that isn't too perverted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enlightened Reading!","review":"In this novel the Handmaids are potentially fertile women assigned to Commanders, who are high level members of a right wing regime whose wives are infertile, you can guess the rest. This is in an era after the U.S. Congress and the President were murdered, and these right-wing bible followers form a society (called the Republic of Gilead) where women have no rights and are valued primarily for their reproductive ability, the Handmaids are'nt even allowed to read. Purges of political enemies are frequent. The primary character is portrayed through a diary she has written, it gives a moving personal account of her life as a Handmaid, very introspective. Overall, this novel seems to be a satiric expose' of where extreme right-wing religious and political thinking can lead us, and these elements do exist today in the United States of America, some actually even in power. A very interesting and well written novel, it kept my interest and should be appealing to most people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life Changing","review":"Rarely does a book fundamentally change your outlook on life.

Atwood's perception of what our society could very easily come to is frightening. If you think this could never happen, you are wrong. It is already staring to happen.

I have read Oryx and Crake, then it was about genetic engineering, corporate power, etc. This time it's about female rights and warning women to assert them to what I can engender. Now, I can handle a book with a weak and obvious message, however, Atwood decided to use Orwell's technique of boredom but throughout the entire book. It worked and I was incredibly bored. Oryx and Crake was at least enjoyable because of it's excitement and humour. Atwood's writing style and wit is so rare and I wish she would not waste it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Political Correctness at its shrillest","review":"I was forced to read this book in high school. It was boring and I could not relate to it at any level. Too much talk about emotions, feelings, etc and not enough action.

My brother gave me an autographed copy back in '86. Perhaps I'd see it differently now but I found it depressing and of no interest to me. I read it only because my brother gave it to me. I didn't even keep it. Don't know if I gave it to a thrift store or what.I was surprised this is a well known author. I prefer biographies or 'true life' stories so perhaps it just 'wasn't my cup of tea'. Kind of wished I'd have kept the book now."},{"rating":"1","title":"If i could give this 0 stars i would.","review":"First the kindle copy isn't perfect. Words are misspelled and abbreviated wrong. I'm not very picky about this and it bothered me so it's that bad.Secondly (Im not going into detail since I don't want ruin the story if you plan to read it)the story line is awful! The ending is awful. I wouldn't suggest this book to anyone. I read it after rereading the giver and that's a similar story line but this story jumps around but with no warning.

I'm not planning to watch the movie after the awful book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bonkers","review":"I had to read this book for school.

I stoped reading this book around page 200."},{"rating":"1","title":"How much do I HATE this book?","review":"This is one of those annoying books you are forced to read at school because there is so much to say about it. Well, I hated it the first time, finding it dull, repetitive and vague. After having to read it three times and taken an exam on it (in which I got an A by the way) I can honestly say I shiver at the sight of it and my copy was put to it's best use last summer... as something to burn on the barbecue. That really is the only place for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing, boring waste of time","review":"I never normally get around to writing reviews but this book was just so terrible I felt compelled to write something for once. Atwood seems to want to tease the reader by failing to explain any of what is going on directly, and instead wastes our time describing how things used to be, ie. the real world that we all still live in. The plot is implausible, the characters are dull and many of the events described are horrific. If you start reading nad get the urge to stop then do it - don't waste your time dragging yourself on - it doesn't get any better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A trop of Lustful characters","review":"I have found that people don't like to read negitive reviews, but I fear I must give one here. I did not like this book (this I am afraid is a grose understatment of my feelings towardes 'The Handmaids Tale') I read this book and was shocked and discusted by the sextual content and the vularity. The book in some way uses the characters sexual activitys and swearing as sings of rebelion. I do not think this is the best way. The plot might have been intresting to me had the characters not all been so sleezy, and lustful. they were always, it seemed, dreaming/doing sextual things. I felt like I was reading a book by an auther whos main influances were flowers for algernon and sience fiction storys, the kind you buy at shoppers drugmarte."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books ever written.","review":"This book should be required reading for every woman in America.

It will make you think!","review":"This book was very good but I wish it would have told what happened to Offred at the end. If she found her daughter or Luke. It made me think hard and long. I didn't understand some of it. Like the date. It sounded like a true story but the date was 2025 or something like that. Is this what she thinks the future will be like? I don't understand but it was very good. I couldn't put the book down. I wanted to read it forever. I would like to read some more like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great start but loses it at the end","review":"This is a great summer beach read because it isn't very challenging and definately holds your interest, but if you're looking for something more profound, this isn't your read. Atwood has some incredible ideas and keeps you engaged throughout the entire novel, but fails to produce in the end. However, I would definately recommend this book for its thought-provoking ideas and potential realism."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good start, dull end but it gets me thinking","review":"The Handmaid's Tale starts as a promising book. It got me reading up to page 100 in almost one time. However then it becomes more and more the same thing over and over again. To the end of the book it appeared to me that this was not a science fiction book but an alibi for the author to put down her own frustrations about the male part of the world. I read the book through the end but I was really glad it was finished another 20 pages of this I would not have read. On the other hand this book gave me the happy feeling being in Belgium far from the land where Moral Majorities and other Religieus fanatics try to get grip on society. I hope every Prime Minister of President reads this and bans every form of fanatical (religieus based) intolerance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tiresome","review":"I am not a fan of dystopia genre so that may be one of the reasons I disliked this book. Atwood writes with a conscious attempt to place this book neatly into the genre. Her language is overdone, her plot completely tiresome, the characters only create a mirage of being real characters. Atwood's book is a representation of ideas rather than a novel. She writes consciously with not enough innovative ideas. She doesn't let the novel create itself, it is as controlled as the style."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too tough to read...

Perhaps I'll re-visit it some day."},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing and thought provoking piece!","review":"I loved reading this book because, for the first time in a long time, I found something that I couldn't put down. The story makes readers wonder about the security in their lives and the control so many people have over us without our even knowing it. If you read any Atwood novel, as I have also read Cat's Eye and Surfacing and found them...lacking, read this one! It is unforgettable and amazing! Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nolite te bastardes carbonderium...","review":"This book leaves me speechless. Absolutely haunting, it left me dazed and slightly fearful of our present society, in which everything is controlled by computer.

It was creepy and it was very suspenseful. I was totally happy with the ending and I would definately recommend it to anyone. If you're a person who has problems with trust, this book will change your life. As soon as I was done reading it, I cried with joy for about an hour. It was very poetic, which maade the story so much better. It's a little hard to take in at first, but after the first 100 pages, I couldn't put it down. It was great."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent book that caused great contraversy.","review":"This book made me realize how many things we take for granted. In other countries there are women who are being treated the way Offred was being treated. Our society today could become another Handmaid's Tail tomorrow. Margaret Atwood did a good job demonstating how women were treated in our country not only 50 years ago, but still are being treated that way today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Book I've Read!","review":"This is a great book. That tells what could become of our society. It looks at womens role in a culture that sometimes demeans women. I hope that this is not what happens in the future.

This book was on my AP English summer reading list and happened to be the first one I decided to read. Once I started reading I was hooked. I loved the way that this society, although extremely different from the society that we live in, started out just like ours. The irony of it is, that Atwood based this book on historical fact. We could end up like the Republic of Gilead. Hopefully, that won't happen. This book was the most unique portrayal of the future that I've ever been exposed to. I would recommend it to anyone who likes to think about what the future holds. Read it, it really makes you think."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Helluva Introduction to Margaret Atwood.","review":"This book is a helluva introduction to Margaret Atwood. 'Handmaid's Tale' seems to me like a dystopian unbaby ofGeorge OrwellandVirginia Woolf. Very stylized, very provoking, spooky but at the same time not scary. I think for its punches to really land, you have to be a woman. I liked how the novel's narrative was structured, complete with the metafictional epilogue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disco fans loved to love this lady!","review":"There are many things to remember 1975 by. The Jeffersons,Jaws,Saturday Night Live,Welcome Back Kotter,the Silver Bullet Band,the birth of John & Yoko's son and of course,Donna Summer. But sadly,the good Lord took away Moe and Larry. Back in '75,with disco still in its infancy,Summer began to dominate the disco craze with her debut hit LOVE TO LOVE YOU BABY. Summer had competition though,with the Bee Gees' JIVE TALKIN',another '75 hit. The other songs on this album are great. Possibly,Summer was nominated for a Best New Artist of 1975 Grammy. She had no Song Of The Year,for in '75 it was Neil Sedaka's co-penned LOVE WILL KEEP US TOGETHER performed by The Captain & Tennille."},{"rating":"1","title":"wow, thanks for not selling us the 16 minute song!","review":"It's amazing that the extended play version of the song is not for sale. Looks like I won't be buying this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great U.S. Debut","review":"\\"Love to love you baby,\\" the album's title track is what actually launched the short-lived disco era. The song is 16 minutes and 48 seconds long, but it's known as being the \\"17 minute version.\\" It's filled with orgasmic yelps that hypnotically puts your body into a trance until the next song, \\"Full of Emptiness\\" begins. I gave the album 4 stars instead of 5 because there are only 6 songs, however, each of those 6 songs are special in their own right. When you hear \\"Full of Emptiness,\\" \\"Need-A-Man Blues,\\" \\"Whispering Waves,\\" Pandora's Box,\\" and \\"Full of Emptiness (Reprise)\\" you'll notice why Donna hasn't faded along with her fellow singers of the disco era; her voice and connections with her songs tell you she has the ability to stay for as long as she wants. These songs are a collection that would make any artist proud to have on their debut album; they truly are remarkable."},{"rating":"1","title":"It has historical value, but...","review":"this really is not Donna's best work. I can see why she cringes when she hears this now. While I dig the title track (hell, who doesen't?), this album is not very strong overall. You can tell Donna and her producers were still tweaking her sound (which would materialize on \\"A Love Trilogy\\" the following year) and trying to establish her as an artist. But \\"Need A Man Bules\\" is just unlistenable, while \\"Full of Emptiness\\" and \\"Whispering Waves\\" are just average. Her voice is high and lovely, but you can tell she holding back. I really liked \\"Pandora's Box\\" because you get to hear Donna flex those pipes the way she does on her later work. Since this is the album that really got the disco ball spinning, it is worth having in your collection, but as an album it is just average. For a better picture of Donna, check out \\"Four Seasons of Love,\\" \\"Live & More\\" or \\"Bad Girls,\\" among others."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS IS DONNA BEFORE COMMERCIALISM","review":"FIRST OF ALL, I WOULD LIKE TO CORRECT ANOTHER REVIEWER ABOUT ONE OF THE SONGS ON THE ALBUM. SEEMS HE DIDN'T LISTEN TO, OR UNDERSTAND THE LYRICS TO WHISPERING WAVES. IT IS NOT ABOUT HER IMAGINING THINGS ON THE BEACH, ITS ABOUT HER LONGING FOR A LOVER WHO ABANDONED HER SUDDENLY, WITH NO WARNING.WHEN THIS ALBUM WAS RELEASED, I WAS 16, AND AMAZED TO FIND THAT THE WHOLE ALBUM STOOD UP, NOT JUST THE TITLE CUT. GEORGIO MORODER USED TO PRODUCE MANY SONGS FOR DONNA, AND FOR DISCO EVEN, SOME OF THE MOVEMENTS WERE QUITE INTRICATE. SADLY, FOR ME AT LEAST, DONNA NEVER MATCHED THE INTENSITY, ARTISTRY AND DELIVERY FEATURED IN THIS DEBUT VINYL. SHE MADE A COUPLE MORE \\"O-K\\" SONGS, BUT THIS RELEASE IS THE FLAGSHIP. TAKE IT FROM A GUY WHO HAS BUMPED, BOOGIED, AND STEPPED TO THE SONGS ON THIS ALBUM IN CHICAGOLAND WITH HIS WIFE OF 25 YEARS, SINCE WE WERE TEENAGERS WHEN IT WAS RELEASED. NUFF SAID."},{"rating":"2","title":"A FIVE STAR SONG A TWO STAR ALBUM","review":"As many fellow reviewers assert, there's only one real reason to own this history-making CD: the nearly 17 minute version of LOVE TO LOVE YOU BABY.The irresistibly danceable disco-erotica features Donna's moans and groans but it's the structuring of the glorious music that makes this such an awesome track. Each section has its own unique feel, culminating in the choral climax (no pun intended!) and a return to the whispery sparse opening, and then another choral eruption. Probably the best disco recording ever!The rest of the album is basically boring pap...but Donna's voice prophesies her future vocal triumphs.The aforementioned 17 minutes makes this a must-have for discophiles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Before \\"When Harry Met Sally\\"...","review":"The aforementioned theatrical film is known for Meg Ryan's simulated \\"orgasm\\" but it pales in comparison to Donna Summer's sexually-charged moaning in the title cut from the 1975 release, the song that brought her international recognition. In its vinyl incarnation, the title track took up the entire \\"A-side\\" and the singer would have a similar format in her next two releases.But, it is this single song that stands as the spark that ignited the career of the singer that would define the \\"disco era\\".And for that, this reviewer loves Donna, baby."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love to love to you baby... and that's all","review":"When this album was first released (I'm talking about 1975),I was only a 15-year-old kid and I loved \\"Love to love you baby\\" the first time I heard it. What caught me was the melody in the song and the beautiful voice of Donna Summer. I missed the chance to buy the LP at the time and some time later I found out that, in fact, \\"Love to love you baby\\" filled out one complete side of the vynil record. Since then I've been looking for a chance to buy it in CD. I finally succeeded and I'm not disappointed: the almost 17-minute version of \\"Love to love you baby\\" is a true disco suite that took me back to my unforgettable teenage days. The rest of the songs were unknown to me until now, but the title song is worth the whole album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pastry Brush","review":"In 2008 I reviewed this item and raved on its quality...

I would highly recommend this book to someone who wants to learn Biblical Hebrew, even if you (as I did) already have some knowledge of the language. This is truly a profound book. I learned much more than I expected to learn when I bought this book. My only complaint, is that the meanings listed for words are in (abstract) english, such as the Hebrew word \\"chai\\" which Mr. Dobson says means \\"life\\" which it does, but the word actually means \\"stomach\\" and was a Hebrew sign of life.

I think this movie is a lot like Fireproof- a christian message around a couple in love.I don't want to give too much away, but the main character Craig is a christian young man that is looking for more in life than just the ordinary. He then meets the girl that will become the love of his life... the story evolves around them.

He makes her love God and believe in his eternal love. This story makes us feel emotinal and feel we are not alone and someone beyond all powers loves us and gave his life for us.

Having enjoyed 'Loveless', I was shocked to hear how dry the production is. This is not kind to ANY element of MBV, and shows why Shields dialed up the guitar and swept everything else under the rug on 'Loveless'. An act of sheer necessity. From the milk-carton snare to the absurdly morose vocals of Shields and Butcher, to the droning, insipidly downbeat drivel of the songs themselves, this is bad, bad stuff here, folks.

However, there was a romantic overtone and nice tunes that fascinated me at the same time and while I don't think it's 5-star good, this album sort of warmed me up to it.It's a pretty solid album throughout. It's not the overproduced experiment of \\"Loveless,\\" but rather, more them making pop songs in the vein of Jesus and Mary Chain. They still have their own identity though. Feedback rules over \\"All I Need.\\" My favorite two songs are \\"Soft as Snow (But Warm Inside)\\" and \\"No More Sorry,\\" which showed that they had genious in them before their highly praised swan song.

It was the first of Laymon's books I read and probably the last. I don't mind far-fetched story ideas, in fact I love Stephen King, but this was borderline ridiculous! Halfway through the book I couldn't wait for it to end, not because I really wanted to know what was going to happen, but because I felt I was wasting valuable time living! After reading it, I thought Laymon might be a new author still trying to find his style, but then I caught a glimpse of his picture and bio on the inside back cover and - oh my! If you're looking for some classic horror, I'd suggest Stephen King's PET SEMATARY, Richard Matheson's I AM LEGEND, or some newer authors like J.G. Passarella's WITHER and Ronald Damien Malfi's THE SPACE BETWEEN (more sci-fi, still a good book). Whatever you choose, I would not recommend this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"blah!","review":"this book wasn't all that great. and, that's being nice. i love horror, and it had mediocre reviews on here, so i thought i'd check it out. i was disappointed. it does have some good points. i enjoyed the sections with the young babysitter and the little girl she was watching. but, the rest just sorta sucked. the rape scene wasnt frightening. it was ignorant. and, it isnt all that gory of a novel. as for the political point, we get it. that factor is too simple, too cliched, and too trite to mention. also, the trying to overcome the racism aspect of the book makes the book racist in itself. as simple as it is to read, im having a hard time getting through to the end. and, the other reviewer on here was right, he uses the word \\"rump\\" about 117 times in the novel. buy another book, instead. or, do what i did, check it out at the library."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Dark Stormy Night...","review":"Rarely do I read more than one novel by the same author in a month. But after finishing Island by Richard Laymon, it was nearly impossible not to pick up another one of his novels. And while One Rainy Night doesn't match the achievement of Island, its still a great read.The premise of the novel is simple: after a racially motivated killing, a black rain begins to fall driving anyone exposed to it into a homicidal frenzy. Following a small collection of people, Laymon illustrates the effects of the black rain and the actions taken to stop it.Like Island, the characters are somewhat shallow but that's really not the point of his novels. Laymon writes to entertain and he's ridiculously successful. Above all, One Rainy Night is a lot of fun to read. Think of it as a low budget horror movie in novel form.Laymon writes a good book - they're entertaining, easy and quick yet thoroughly engaging. Definitely check this one out."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Least Favorite Laymon So Far","review":"I always try to keep my reviews short and sweet. Laymon is definitely not for everyone. LAymon always lived in his own world where common human psychology does not apply to his characters. (Example: a girl gets raped and an hour later she is ready to get it on with another character; or someone's boyfriend gets killed and later she is off having fun.) However, Laymon is usually an easy read that does not go very in-depth. This book was not as enjoyable as other books I have read by him. It was rather boring and very preposterous with too simple of an ending - even for Laymon. My recommendation: start with something different by Laymon."},{"rating":"1","title":"So bad I couldn't even finish it!","review":"This book was bad. Plain and simple. I've only read two of Laymon's other books, The Traveling Vampire Show and Among the Missing, and this book pales in comparison with those two. I got about 1/3 of the way through the book, and I totally lost interest and stopped reading. Even if you are a Laymon fan do yourself a favor and skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Night of the Living Dead Lite","review":"An intriguing premise--Romero's NOTLD and \\"The Crazies\\" combined with black magic--yields little of major interest. Characters are two-dimensional cutouts from B-Movie cloth, and, despite the previous reviewer's comments, tend to stick to assigned hero/villain roles in the narrative. Plot rules appear to change at a whim, with some psychotic characters conveniently able to \\"hold it together\\" when plot momentum requires them to do so. Furthermore, some possibly interesting themes, such as heroism versus safety, and anonymity versus altruism are never developed.Like old horror films, this ends in cliche fashion. The heroes and heroines embrace after the rather weak climax, while suffering no consequences--psychological or otherwise, for the actions taken in order to survive.For a simple, fun read, one could certainly do worse, but this was somewhat of a disappointing introduction to the author."},{"rating":"2","title":"The night the rain fell","review":"The rain was black, pleasantly warm and it fell heavily in the small, unremarkable town of Bixby. After the death of Maxwell Chidi, in a possible racial attack, it began to fall with the coming of the night and it did very \\"strange\\" things to all those caught in the rain.This book is classic Laymon and it tears along at a rip-roaring pace with little time to catch your breath between what have almost become his violent \\"set pieces\\". The premise is slightly odd but what else have we come to expect from what must be one of the modern masters of horror writing.One Rainy Night will grab you from the first paragraph and you will feel slightly cheated when it comes to an end; not because of the ending itself but because it has ended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fast-paced but unfulfilling.","review":"The plot of ONE RAINY NIGHT can be summed up easily: black rain falls, turns people into killers, and the unaffected few must try to stay alive. That's it.Granted this is my first Laymon novel, and I already have BITE so I will give that a chance, but if this lowest-common-denominator material is the sort of horror people are raving about, I feel sad for the future of the genre. This is b-movie stuff, and fit only for a short story or novella, if that. Like Bentley Little's UNIVERSITY, the author simply uses a device (in this case, the rain) as a vehicle for sex and violence, but there's even less to this particular story.ONE RAINY NIGHT is easy to breeze through, and if you're looking for something to read on the train or on the beach it may be perfect. I thought it was a disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gruesome, supernatural horror!","review":"Richard Laymon has outdone himself with \\"One Rainy Night.\\" A small California town falls victim to a viscous black rain that turns anyone who gets wet into a murderous maniac.

Be warned this novel contains rape and a great deal of graphic violence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Read It On A Dark & Stormy Night....","review":"This was a fun (but rather silly) gory adventure. It was a suspenseful read and certainly grisly with its violence, but definitely entertaining. The main vein of the plot - a black rain falls from the sky, transforming those who get wet - was certainly unique, and the opening scene was downright shocking. The explanation of the rain was not the high point in the book, but it didn't detract from the fun of this horrific read."},{"rating":"2","title":"There Be Pirates Ahead!","review":"Get this from the source - Film Score Monthly - and buy it for it's true price - $16.95.

I was greatly disappointed. The snippets are mainly tiny, especially for the better songs -- several are so short you do not even get a feel for the song. Others do not seem authentic and vary from other tab/music scores I have seen (Sunshine of Your Love for example varies from two other versions that I own and is inferior to both). For Layla I don't think they chose the best guitar part (the original has at least 4 guitars). My girl is just one measure/barr!!

It's great for people like me who have seen the movie a billion times. But, those who like horror books will also adore this book. The book also has a little bit of dialouge not heard in the film.

As a group facilitator, Hellinger's insight on the how the system balances and how to approach it from the practitioner's point of view reveals a lot of system thinking in family/group situation.

The original book was written in the 50's, so most of the pictures are in Black and White, (no color then) although there are many full color pictures of the little birds in the center. The information contained within is like having many shop manuals condensed into one book, but published in an interesting manner.It took me a full day to go through the book, but I took detailed notes for future use.I was hesitating on buying this book as the retail prices range between $38 to $59, depending where it is offered.

David Bowie, the Who, Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Paul McCartney and Elton John all played fantastic sets here. But I have a problem with some of the other music. Eric Clapton plays \\"I'm Your Hoochie Coochie Man,\\" totally unreated to 9/11. Jay-Z also had no business appearing at this show, especially if the only piece he can come up with is \\"H to the Izzo.\\" My other complaint is that this DVD is incomplete. Two Paul McCartney songs, one Eric Clapton song, one Goo Goo Dolls' first song, and a good cover of \\"With a Little Help From My Friends\\" are all missing. The entire 6-hour concert could've easily been released. But what's here, for the most part, is very good. So on the whole, this is a good buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get it for the music!","review":"It's been eleven years since I saw this concert live on television so it was great to revisit it by getting the DVD. Fortunately, there is also great option on the discs to play just the concert songs, so a lot of the emotional scenes which were appropriate for the time but hard to sit through now, are deleted. David Bowie sets the scene with a great opening, hitting all the notes, but for mine, it was The Who that stole the show. Absolutely outstanding. Sad to say that their performance in the recent Sandy Relief concert compares rather badly so this DVD catches them in their prime, or at least not far past it! Paul McCartney as usual ends the show in great style. Great value and I'll be watching it again for sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two OF the Great Vocalists Ever","review":"Sarah Vaughan&Billy Eckstine Sound Good on this set.at times the arrangements don't always do them Justice but overall their vocal Power can't be denied.it's a treat having Two OF THe Greatest Vocalist ever Singing TOgether.Worth a Checking into."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two of the best","review":"This is a feel-good album, sung by two of the best jazz singers that ever lived.

He makes a strong case for the film as a kind of happy accident in which a wild cast of characters--before and behind the camera--collided and created a masterpiece.

Indeed, after reading it a third time, I'm still amazed at the author's ability to write a work of fiction that encompasses such abstract concepts, while taking the reader on a ride down the highway of the soul. Dorchak must have faced many challenges during the writing of this novel, not the least of which was the fact that very little of this kind of fiction actually exists.

The polished steel is pretty soft and bent on me the first time I tried using it; the bent tip has now been more or less flattened. It also showed very visible scratches the first time I used it. Similar style/sized knives include the Dexter-Russell S121 (bent) and S126 (straight) as well as the Forschner [Swiss Army Brands] 44693 (bent) or 44692 (straight).

Not as expected from read the reviews. In comparison, my old one from local home improvement store is much easier to handle and faster in cleaning the floor. I realized that it had a wider head and lighter handle which you can use by one hand and have a great connection with the floor. It is almost parallel with the feeling on the steering wheel in cars.

The entire record preens and struts this multi-millionaire's moral superiority without a shred of irony concerning exactly who it is who's lecturing us. Undeniably, Henley has his share of talent, particularly as a singer. He chooses good collaborators to give his more popular songs a distinct sound, i.e. the Bruce Hornsby piano chord pattern echoing thru End of the Innocence. But it is ultimately shallow and uninspired. Henley wants to be Bob Dylan, but in the end he's closer to Barry \\"Eve of Destruction\\" McGuire."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the Don Henley of 'A New York Minute'?","review":"This was a very disappointing purchase.

Move to Uganda or Rwanda if you think your so tough then you'll come crying back to your fans and guitars and drugs and cars."},{"rating":"2","title":"sold out or not, he still rocks","review":"i bought this cd the day it came out and it hasn't left my cd player since. i used to be a 15 year old punk and worry about who was or wasn't selling out, but now i'm 25 and alls i want to do is to listen to some good music. and this cd does the job. i would've given it 5 stars but it doesn't live up to the expectations left by lars's first cd. if you can, i suggest you pick up the japanese relaese. it has 1 extra song called \\"road to hell\\" that kicks a**."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened Lars?","review":"Lars' side project appeals to me because it songs pretty much exactly like Rancid, and their first CD was pretty awesome, a solid punk album for all fans of Rancid. They were a safe haven from the transplants stuff and Skinhead Rob's rap. This record is not bad, in fact the music is actually really good and some of the tracks are legendary (1% and Skins, Punx, and DrunX).There is one problem, and it's BIG!The lyrics drive this album right into the ground. After the fifth or sixth song about prostitutes and how we're gonna screw them and then kill them, you're about ready to put this CD away for a long while. I agree with the guy who said that the album booklet was completely unneccessary, and even Tim Armstrong couldn't pull \\"My Life to Live\\" out of the fire.This is just mediocre, bottom line. I know punk lyrics are nothing deep, but c'mon guys, spend more than half of five minutes and write something at least decent."},{"rating":"1","title":"This could've been something","review":"Now it's official Rancid have not only turned their own albums into garbage but their side projects are starting to suck too. This album has a few decent songs but it doesn't even come close to their first album. Also Lars and Tim are talking about sex and prostitutes , how freaking macho they are. I thought they were supposed to be punk and above all that stuff. Sometimes with all the shout out and city droppin \\" Shout out to Oaktown\\", it just sounds like a transplants album especially with Rob Aston in the mix that guy could ruin Kurt Cobain coming back from the dead and recording a new Nirvana album. Overall there are some ok songs but nothing memorable and also their are some laughable songs in which Lars tells us how much of a thug he is, \\"Switchblade\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"whhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhy???","review":"were the hell are the negative stars on this site, because this is a sameful record....lets face, rancid finally realized that they are going down, so they had to, at the last second, reach out the mainstream with this bull about hookers and drugs. Punk is a mere house hold name thats thrown around and abused by sellouts like this pitiful excuses for musicians. Epitaph even pulled their fan review section, because those that were with punk rock to begin with slammed this piece of crap record and told something that rancid couldnt handle: THE TRUTH!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad","review":"8.5 STARS OUT OF 10I'm a huge Rancid fan. As you can imagine, I was pretty excited about a second Lars album coming out. Lar's first album surprised me in how good it was, and I was expecting more of the same with Viking.When I first cracked it open, I didn't care for it. It seemed all over the place. The first and last few songs had a Rancid 2000 feel to it. Throw in a couple of covers, a ballad, a few mainstream punk sounding songs and you had Viking. It wound up in my CD case after about a week.A few months later, I decided to pop it back out, and I can say the album really grew on me. It's sometimes hard, sometimes soft, but always catchy. As usual, Tim Armstrong is all over the album with his lyrics and even a guest appearence.Much better then 99% of the junk out these days."},{"rating":"2","title":"Noname","review":"I think a lot of you are being pretty hard on the beav. I have been listenting to punk/hardcore for almost 20 years and although Lars' toughguy lord of the punks attitude does get old after a while this is still a great punkrock album. Most of you are complaining about the musicianship. Since when has that been a concern in the punk world? If you want pretty punk go buy a blink disk. Punk is what it is and if you don't like it don't listen to it. THis is a great album and I would recomend it. Punk is not what it was and never will be again. It's all about $$$ now. Sad but true.

I have non stick pans and when I received these I was disappointed because they were metal. They are, however, VERY thin and pliable so, using an old fry pan, I gave them a try. I have been delighted. In six weeks I have zero scratches on my pans and they are so thin. I am thrilled with them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Flimsy","review":"I understand the need for a spatula to be thin and flexible, but this one is too flexible. It's as if someone cut the spatula out of an old coke can. It can hardly lift anything at all, and I find it just stays in the drawer unused."},{"rating":"1","title":"AVOID","review":"The metal in the flat part of the spatula is way too thin. If not careful you will end up with a crease in yours.The worst thing though, is the metal is the exact opposite of non-stick. Just about everything sticks to it, and it makes cleaning them very hard. I have had to clean them by hand, and 1 of the ones I bought I can't get the crap that stuck on it off.Expecting above an average spatula, any old plastic spatula would have been better."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have for cookie bakers..","review":"..and much much more. BUT, if you bake cookies a lot, this spatula is a must have! You can lift cookies off the sheet, right out of the oven *you know, when they're still in that baked, yet doughy stage*, onto the cooling rack, without them breaking! This saves so much time and messy cleanup, as I no longer have to use several pans to bake dozens of cookies. It will also gently lift up all kind of delicate foods without breaking them ..such as omelette's, fish etc. Buy this, you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fans of Stephanie Plumb books will LOVE Sierra!","review":"I first bought The Miracle Strip because I was going through a Stephanie Plumb withdrawl. At first, the missing dog plot didn't seem like it would be able to sustain an entire book, but the way Nancy Bartholomew weaves the story with mystery and humor, the plot actually works! The humor in this book is definately similar to that of Janet Evanovich and this series will keep Evanovich fans entertained between Plumb outings! Sierra is a rare character in the fact that she is unappolgetic about what her profession is. She likes being an exotic dancer (NOT a stripper! <G>) and takes pride in doing her job (and her sleuthing) well. Do yourself a favor and buy this excellent book. You won't be sorry. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap entertainment","review":"Fans of more skillful Florida mysteries such as those by John D. MacDonald or Carl Hiaasen will be left wanting by this tepid first novel by Nancy Bartholomew. Her Philly-born exotic dancer heroine, Sierra Lavotini, is a mass of contradictions, but for all the facets Bartholomew tries to build into her, she remains a warmed-over knock-off of Hiaasen's sleuthing stripper from <Strip Tease>. Sierra's poor English makes for a distracting narrative voice and, unfortunately, Panama City is never more than a flat backdrop for the plot, which could just as easily be set in Myrtle Beach, Padre Island, Daytona Beach, or any one of a number of other southern spring break venues."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Weak","review":"The concept of a stripper sleuth sounded promising, but this one seems too dumb to successfully investigate why milk should be refrigerated. There's not enough humor to make this book funny, and there's not enough plot or interesting characterizations or setting to make it compelling. I was inclined to like this book -- given the unusual sleuth and tried-and-true Florida setting -- but this book is so pedestrian and uninterestingly conventional it makes Dick and Jane look like Twin Peaks."},{"rating":"1","title":"A gift that disappointed","review":"A friend gave me this book for my birthday, and though I wouldn't tell my friend this, I found this novel dull. It's too bad that this writer felt it necessary to take a small story about one young woman's (Maya's) bad relationship choices and draw questionable parallels with political strife in Israel. The plotline that follows the lives of three women seemed to fall back on Israeli \\"types\\" of women rather well drawn characters. As one who's quite familiar with Israeli political history, I felt this to be a misguided attempt."},{"rating":"1","title":"SAVE YOUR MONEY! Flat, slow-moving novel.","review":"This novel was wearyingly melodramatic (especially Maya's relationship with Gil) and competently if blandly written. The author seemed to resort to broad dramatic strokes in lieu of interesting character development. It struck me as being a very typical coming-of-age novel, with a bit of half-baked political metaphor thrown in. Disappointing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing characters","review":"This book looked so promising and turned out to be such a disappointment because the three women are all such weak characters. I associate Israel and Judaism with strong people, both male and female, and I felt this story was very untrue to both the place it's set and the people. I was impatient and bored with the three central characters because they were so blandly rendered and so uninteresting.It's too bad the author didn't use some of the more interesting supporting characters in more important ways. I really can't recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting issue","review":"Simple. Ankerberg and Weldon in their continuing quest to bear false witness for profit. They've been busted on misusing Pike's work (antimasons never get around to quoting the preface, it utterly destroys their case), claiming false Masonic rank for their \\"experts\\" (this is know as lying) and quoting from rituals that were never used by any regular Masonic organization.Considering Revelation 22:15, I'd seriously wonder about these two gentlemen. If you start with Exodus 20:16 and follow through, the burden of proof falls on them to repent and be saved. Old and New Testament, failure to keep the 9th commandment almost invariably points to both a false salvation and other sins.Amazing how these guys make a profit for their \\"ministries\\", while most of the Masonic sources that blow them out of the water are freely available on the Net."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anti-Masonic Book","review":"Beware!

Having taken the Russian river cruise, I was looking for something visually impressive by which to remember the sights and the journey. Unfortunately, this was not it. I concur in everything in the previous reviews. The content is superficial at best and does no justice to the country or to the cruise. The folklore show to which so much of the DVD is devoted is actually only an optional tour on most of the cruises, one which we elected to pass up with no regrets, while many of the more important sights were completely omitted.

The video quality on this burned disk is just awful, nowhere near what you would expect from even a cheap commercially pressed DVD, and frankly not even as good as a high quality VHS tape in my opinion. Honestly, when I first put this disc in my Pioneer DVD player I thought there was something going wrong with my player, but a quick jump ahead through the chapters verified the poor video quality of the whole disc.

I've got a similar experience with the last Rod Stewart album and I have the same question, why do you even try?

It could be that sometimes I'm just in the mood for something this kinda' silly yet somehow soulful.I love a good twist on an old song, and in that I think there are a few successes for Karrin in this collection.

I wouldn't use this for pasta as it would overflow easily. It does have a great handle, and the opposing loop helps it sit in a sink. But I was hoping for something larger.

The label on the canister states \\"Extinguisher must be RECHARGED by a qualified fire equipment service company...\\" This leads one to believe that recharge is possible.

Everything was covered in white powder, and the pressure gauge indicated that the bottle was empty.I'm not sure if this is because of poor construction by Kidde, or if it is because of bad packaging. I can say that there was very little packaging material in the box, so it had plenty of room to jostle around.Just contacted Kidde customer support, and they directed me to Amazon.

At first things when went well and I was promised a replacement extinguisher. 2 months and several unreturned emails later, still no exinguisher and no comment from Kidde on where it might. I've even contacted their customer service manager directly and have not received a response.

It is supposed to last at least 12 years and the unit is already showing it needs to be replaced. Do not buy a plastic nozzle extinguisher!!! It is worth the cost to buy a steel or metal unit that will last and can be refilled.Since the seller of this item can't understand that extinguishers have a gauge with an arrow that tells you when it needs to be replaced, and since he continues to comment on my review, I am reiterating that when I said \\"It is already showing it needs to be replaced\\" I am referring to the gauge on the front of the unit. This gauge will show you when it needs to be replaced and it should not need replacement in 2009 when it was made in 2006. It's ok!

It is an Amerex and was highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"For our daycare","review":"One of the most affordable type 1A10BC fire extinguishers out there. Also easy to find in any hardware store. I bought one as a requirement for a home-daycare. Approved by the fire marshall without any problem. Came with its own plastic wall attachment accessory. Easy installation. I feel I have to reinforced the gypsum wall attachment with a double-sided tape to make sure it is secured.What does 1A10BC stands for?The number preceding the A multiplied is by 1.25 to give you the equivalent extinguishing capability in gallons of water. The number preceding the B indicates the size of fire in square feet that an ordinary user should be able to extinguish.A = ordinary combustible materials such as paper.B = flammable liquids and gasesC = energized electrical equipmentHopefully we would not have to use it in the future.Made in Mexico."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fire Safe","review":"The Kidde FA110 is a great extinguisher to have around the home for it's multiple uses.

The box I received was bigger then it needed to be with lots of padding inside and a big sticker that said \\"over pack\\" on the outside. I had none of the banged up, dinged, or damaged issues that previous reviewers experienced. The price was very good and it got here very fast in typical Amazon style.

All these reviews make it seem as if you're out $30 if it discharges in the box. This is not so, I confirmed it with Amazon. You can't ship it back because of HAZMAT shipping restrictions, it has NOTHING to do with Amazon's refund policy.In any case, mine came fully charged in the green portion of the arc. Haven't used it and hope to never have to, but it appears to be a quality product at a very reasonable price.

We never would have expected that; it was one of our fairly new and expensive halogen floor lamps. We unplugged the lamp but the smoldering continued and seemed to be getting worse. So I used our former small Kidde fire extinguisher to stop the smoldering - I was concerned that a fire might breakout. I never thought I've have to use the old fire extinguisher but I did, so this Kidde from Amazon is an in-kind replacement for the old one. They're small but can be very handy when something surpringly starts smoldering (or worse) in your apartment or house."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fire Extinguisher Discharged","review":"The item arrived on time but when I opened it, the fire extinguisher clearly discharged.

That's probably because it's about politics, one of my least favorite subjects. Richard Dreyfuss and Josh Brolin were the only actors I knew by name, but the movie still held my attention with all the punches 'George W. Bush' gave; that was what made the movie interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring Another Stone Distortion of Histroy","review":"Stone, ever the friend of Hugo Chavez, manages to make a boring movie about the first American President who virtually by his will alone manages to free millions of Iraqi's from a tyrant and his homocidal sons. Providing a chance for rule by the people (not okay with Stone or Chavez - unless the \\"people\\" are really socialist rulers) may be the most pernicious assault on the oppressive regimes of the arabic world. If freedom takes root, \\"W\\" may yet be born out by history. Meanwhile Oliver's boring little movie, which I struggled to get through, will go down as one of his least history rewriting films. Even Brolin's acting is weak. But no matter -- we await with breathless anticipation Stone's coming and glowing movies on \\"Chavez!\\" and \\"Che!\\" and \\"Ahmindinajad!\\" Count on them to get great reviews from the N.Y. Slimes -- errr N.Y. Times."},{"rating":"1","title":"As if there is not already enough of this crap in the news","review":"Needless to say, movie stinks, especially for a sitting president at the time of it's release. I think Stone should now make the movie \\"0\\" and show how Obama is paying off all his buddies, or make fun of how much of an idiot he looks like everytime he opens his mouth, or how inept he is at the job he worked so hard to win, that will never happen. You can go ahead an trust all the wonderful reviews of the drones on here that all seem to have some sort of unified thought pumped into their minds kinda like the borg in startrek, oh wait they do, it's called the news and hollywood, never mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!","review":"This movie will not tell you anything more about the Bush presidency than you don't know already. It glazes over Bush's life, and presidency, and most of it is probably NOT factual. It will not help you understand why decisions were made. Oliver Stone does not uncover any \\"plots\\". It is simply a silly movie that basically tests the actors to see who can do the best impersonations of the real-life characters they are imitating (The award goes to Richard Dreyfuss as Cheney). Do not buy this movie. It is the worst waste of money. I was sorry I spent money to see it in the theater. 1 Star is an OVER-rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"W\\" is a sham to Geo. Bush","review":"This is a mixture of some truth mixed with a liberal viewpoint. Oliver Stone made a statement to the movie world thru his own beliefs as usual. I found it cruel and unfair to our former president. The only good thing was I think the actors did a good job with accents. I bought this to give to my Dad (who is a Democrat) thinking he would like it, but I am too embarrased to give it to him now. People deserve their dignity, and I don't think it was given in this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Far from good","review":"I didn't need this boring, long winded movie to tell me just how insane, stupid and inbred that man really is. I was awake for the last eight years. Try to avoid this movie, unless you weren't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pitiful!!!","review":"I personally thought that Stone really dropped the ball on this film. \\"JFK\\" is one of the best political films ever, and \\"W\\" is more like a extra long version of a SNL skit. The portrayals of W's staff were more parodies than portrayals. Thandie Newton is a great actress ( NOT TO MENTION FINE), but her performance as Rice was pathetic. What was even worse than that one was the one of Powell, Keanu Reeves could have made a better Colin Powell. The rest were almost as bad. All Stone accomplished was taking good actors and making them play bad parts to try and destroy the image of a sitting President. That is obvious to even the most casual observer."},{"rating":"1","title":"W. didn't tell us anything we didn't already know.","review":"W. didn't tell us anything we didn't already know.

The movie, in my opinion, is totally slanted. Portraying W as weak and readily lead to decisions by any one. Tell me, those of you that think that you are so intelligent, what would you have done if you were president when the tragedy of 9/11 happened? How about having the worst hurricane season right after? No, the problems in New Orleans weren't W's fault after Katrina. Look to the governer and mayor (who was elected again although he let New Orleans go to hell during Katrina). At some point the people in the US have to start taking responsibility for themselves. Do I recommend the movie W? Only if you want to push your problems off on the government. Then again, if you want to do that, you have to go back many years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just for the history","review":"This movie is worth watching only if interested in some facts and history. The world's rotten politics is amazing. The politicians and analyst are worse.The acting is not worth mentioning.

Bush is depicted in his early years as a hard-drinking, opportunistic, ne'er-do-well who bumbles through life riding the coattails of his distant, disapproving father. Later on, after a moment of conversion, he is shown as a simplistic, religious fanatic who bulls his way to the presidency and who seeks nothing more than a kind word from George Sr. Each of the characters is instead a caricature and the movie is full of misrepresentations and giant leaps of assumption about the interactions and motivations of the major protagonists. \\"W\\" is depicted as a cowboy who jumps on his horse and rides it to the bitter end, insisting that he is always right and never makes a mistake. Oliver Stone's comment that this movie is not political is ridiculous and is only superseded by his assertion that he got \\"into the skin of George Bush\\". The sad truth is that he never even scratched the surface."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgusting","review":"This film is an awful insult to a GREAT president, I am unfathomably appalled by how the average American feels towards Bush. He was a vital asset to this country in very trying times, he had to make some extremely difficult decisions during his time in office and I think that he made nearly every single one of them correctly. This movie is merely a statement of the ignorance of the American public, primarily those in Hollywood. Do not support this propaganda!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One star for the heck of it and to annoy BDS patients","review":"I don't like Oliver Stone and his movies (except World Trade Center) and I think he's a stupid film maker.

((BDS stands for Bush Derangement Syndrome - I believe Oliver Stone suffers from BDS too))"},{"rating":"1","title":"Abysmal movie both directing and content or lack thereof)","review":"This is one of the worst made movies I have ever seen. It is a mess, tells the most confused view of Bush I have ever seen, suggests there was a little good a little bad in the man, nothing new and no insights either good or bad. What a waste of time (for reference Fahrenheit 911 I thought was brilliantly made - one either hated it or loved it, but it was well made and sure got its point across.) W gets nothing across other than the director had not a clue about what he was doing or even trying to do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow","review":"Not much needs to be said about this film, because the film didn't have much to say either--nothing new, at least. Any American who has been at least semi-conscious for the past eight years knows that Bush got us into an expensive war based on false information put forward as absolute fact; failed to capture and punish those responsible for 9/11, that Bush countenanced war crimes by Americans; that Bush violated the fourth amendment to the Constitution; that Bush had people held without charges, without legal representation, The list probably includes another list of things we don't yet know about.Oliver Stone's film covers the Bush administration, but so what? Tell us something we don't know. The acting is mostly okay but a little wooden at times. Brolin's Bush comes across as a buffoon, an ex-drunk who used religion as a cover for his sins. But everyone already knew that.I wouldn't recommend this film to people of any political stripe. It's just not worth one's time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"A let down...pretty boring.

Did the above 2-star reviewers actually see this movie???","review":"The only reason I gave this 2 stars and not one star is because of Josh Brolin. And did Chris Crocker write the script? Because this movie is too sympathetic. In fact, it should be called \\"Leave Bush alone!\\". Granted, Brolin's performance is great. It's almost like watching George W. himself play the role.I agree this movie had lots of potential. It's a look at George W. Bush's presidency, and I admire Stone for trying to do that. Howver, just because you did it with \\"JFK\\" (which is a fantastic movie IMO), doesn't mean you should do one for Bush. That said, this movie fails to reach its potential because the whole time it seems as if it's trying to get us to sympathize (sp?) for Bush.There are some good moments in the film and they do highlight some of the actual events in Bush's reign. But other than that, unless you actually do sympathize for Bush, this movie is a complete waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unless you like dull movies about bad presidents...","review":"I'm not going to lie. I did not like this movie. I am one of the suckers that bought this movie. I should have rented it. The Conda-LEEza Rice impression would have been worth three bucks, but not $25.I found it dull and didn't really discover anything new. The best recommendation I have for this movie is to go rent it if you really want to see it and then judge for yourself if you really want to buy it.The characterizations are funny, but don't carry this boring story.

I've seen George Bush interviews on TV many many times. I've read books about Bush from several different authors. (I read a lot of books about historical figures.) My Dad has interacted with George W Bush. The film fails to show the friendly compassionate Bush that so many talk about.

This movie is dreadful, it is as if Stone was picked on by some bully kid named W. in elementary school and has sworn revenge. He offers \\"insights' that he could not possibly know and plays the Bush family as a bunch of power mad zealots with George W. as a buffoon and George H.W. as a whiny weak man. Stone clearly has an agenda here, He shows Dick Cheney and Karl Rove as the puppetmasters controlling the BUsh administration and Condeleesa Rice as an Uncle Tom-ish character. This is a hatchet job if ever there was one. W. may not have been the most articulate of statesmen but he was never mean, this depiction is just plain mean spirited and unwarranted, and most importantly it isn't even good film making."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Project that Misfired","review":"As one who had read quite a bit about the Bush Family and about W himself, his life, childhood and personality, this movie was a big disappointment. Giving ample space for artistic license, which I actually encourage, this still was too much caricature and too little authentic truth to leave a credible impression of what \\"w\\" really was like.W's story, told with sensitivity and depth, and without rancor, is actually quite sufficient to carry a meaty if not a robust plot. However, this \\"cartoon of W\\" should have been beneath a filmmaker of Stone's caliber. This movie even casts a negative shadow over some of Stone's earlier work, which I actually thought was quite well done. However, in light of this \\"rush to judge\\" W badly, Stone screwed up.I left the movie thinking more about Stone than about \\"W\\" and that is a statement in itself.Two stars"},{"rating":"1","title":"Suprisingly dull","review":"You can usually expect intense, provocative movies from Oliver Stone.

There are no stinkers on this album and the musical performances are very well done. McCartney's \\"Wings of a Nightingale\\" and Jeff Lynne's \\"Story of Me\\" are great. This is not a reunion album that was just done for nostalgias sake, but is a well made album that really shows the Everly's growth as artists since their break up in the early 70's. The time apart gave them time to mature as brothers and artists and it really shows.This is the most satisfying Everly's album that I own (I have 8 Brothers albums and most are \\"spotty\\" with one good song followed by a \\"filler\\". I see that \\"EB 84\\" is quite expensive now here on Amazon since it is out of print. If you can't afford EB 84 get the follow up albums \\"Born Yesterday\\" and \\"Two Hearts\\".

This statement, of course, isn't the case for all tracks, such as \\"Auto-E,\\" which is the more lyrical of the tracks on Do Things.

I think this is a great buy if this is all you will need. If you will ultimately need a ricer anyway...consider getting that first and than see if you still need this"},{"rating":"1","title":"Handle dissambled","review":"Within four months one of the handle was dissembled.

It's alright, but I find the mashing head is a little too narrow, making it difficult to get an even mash quickly. The base where the metal arms connect to the head gets gunked up very quickly and it's really tough to clean thoroughly. I like the large, wide grip, but that's about it. I'm asking my grandmother if I can have her old potato masher from the 30's, which has a much wider head on it and mashes more evenly and more quickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasn't impressed","review":"I wasn't impressed with this item for one reason.

Stick to the music guys, and leave the politics to those who are more informed. It's funny how they grab on to the stereotypes perpetuated by the liberal left and just regurgitate it without fact checking at all. Reagan was probably one of our greatest presidents ever, and the left really, really hate that.The songs aren't bad, but I prefer \\"the seer\\" or \\"the crossing\\".

And even now, very few of the songs are available as MP3's or on compilation albums. So I was *thrilled* two days ago when I saw that amazon was selling the cd at an affordable price.Then I got the CD and played it. Words cannot express my disappointment. The sound quality is abysmal, there's weird background noises, and worst of all, the vocal tracks are so buried in the mix that you can barely hear them. I am having *serious* trouble believing that this a legitimate release, and not some 5th generation bootleg copy churned out in somebody's garage.My advice: spend the extra money to get an used \\"unremastered\\" copy somewhere. For myself, I am hoping that amazon will accept a return."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the best all time records from an underrated band.","review":"Stuart Adamson was right all along. The reviewers here pointing how the lyrics are paranoid and wrong are brainwashed by corporate media. The Flame of the West was with us here in the 80's. America saw him return here in the 2000's for eight loooonnnggg years. And look at us now.Sad economy, loss of jobs and the demise of the decent middle working class. If there is anytime for this gem to be revived, it is now. I rated this release a 5, but be forewarned, the sound on this remaster is ugly and we hope for a re-release soon.EDITSo still in 2012 no remaster, the Crossing gets a re-release, they hire a different singer and they go karaoke now. Very sad. My opinion is that the management has always stifled Big Country, that is clearly evident now. Great band but I'm putting Big Country at the back of my collection till this album gets fixed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Landmark Album, Terrible Remaster","review":"I waited along time to find a remaster of this record, one of my all-time favorites.

Though this delicacy has long been recognized as a favorite by mid-century minimalists such as Yves Klein and Josef Albers, Ashcraft proves the tortilla is a relevant medium for contemporary art as well. Her stirring arrangements of lettuce and shredded cheese display a keen sensitivity to color and emotion, and establish her as the unrivalled queen of postmodern cookery.Also, she demonstrates out that the tortilla can be used as a frisbee, a parachute for small pets, and--with a little creative hole-punching--a terrifying face-mask!

Different shape without the logo. I would know because I already have purchased two of them before as gifts. Very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Durable, but not very functional","review":"I ordered this one after my third aluminum keychain opener ate itself to death. This one is definitely much more durable, however the bottle notch is poorly formed. The pivot point is positioned too far away from the tooth and doesn't hit anywhere near the center on a typical bottle cap. The tooth is also too small, so it often fails to catch on the lip on the first few tries.It is hard enough to work with that you actually have to practice in order to be able to open bottles. I find if I hand my keys to someone to open a bottle at a party, they usually give up after 3 or 4 tries and I have to open it for them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not an actual Brewzkey","review":"Key Bottle OpenerThe item shipped to me is not a branded Brewzkey. It is sturdy, well constructed, hard, stainless steel. The bottom edges are not beveled like the brewzkey, simply rounded. It takes at least two attempts at different angles to pry to open a bottle -- the angle on the opening apparatus seems a bit too open. I do not know if an actual name brand brewzkey would function any better. I'd like to think that it wouldn't, if only because it means that I wasn't totally screwed over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Large and doesn't work well","review":"This resembles a key but it's larger than most keys. I though that that was so it would work better, but turns out the size didn't matter. It takes several tries to open a bottle. Still better than opening a bottle with actual keys (as I've had to do on occasion), but not that great a product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than pliers!","review":"I am a home-brewer and bought three of these, one for me and two for friends. We all agree they work perfectly for what I got them for, just to have on hand when our regular openers are not handy. Several people mention taking two times or more to open a bottle. That is true. However, if you find the sweet spot you can open it with one try. I will say using this beats using pliers, a pocket knife, screw driver, folded up paper or whatever else is handy!!! So sit back relax and have a cold beverage. Cheers!!Note: This item works much better when you actually have the key attached to a key chain with other keys on it. Otherwise there is almost no leverage and it is very difficult to use...but possible depending on how thirsty you are!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not useful","review":"The product looks great on my keychain but does not perform well at all.

However, as others have mentioned, even positive reviewers, the design is not optimal, and it almost always takes a minimum of 2 prying efforts to remove a cap. This item is highly over-rated. Go with a wider style or the church key style opener if you plan to use it with any frequency."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great quality!","review":"I was expecting something kind of chincy.

We both thought it looked awesome because it blended in with our other keys. alas, it is just about the worst bottle opener I've ever tried to use. The bottom part doesn't get a good hold of the cap of whatever you're trying to open, and then you start hurting yourself and it's just really inconvenient. usually it takes me 2-3 tries on different sections of the bottle cap to really get to my beer or whatever it is I'm drinking. but aesthetically it's awesome - I'll give it that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barely works","review":"Requires careful alignment of tooth to flute on beer cap, even then slips off 7 out of 10 tries. Most bottle caps are crimped on tight enough that you cannot catch the edge of the cap to even get started. If you are lucky enough to grab the edge of the cap, the fulcrum of the brewskey will dent the cap to the point of puncturing it. The whole operation requires a lot of force since this opener has no leverage at all. Hey, a church key is the simplest tool in existence, and to make a crappy one is simply unforgivable! You would do better with an old, rusty Boy Scout knife, since they all had a bottle opener blade!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Brewzkey Bottle Opener","review":"If I could, I would give this bottle opener zero stars. It doesn't work, at all, with any size bottle cap. It just doesn't get underneath the cap, the hook is to small and not long enough. Also, they must have started getting them mass produced or changed manufacturer because it didn't even come with the logo that they are shown with.

They responded that when that information became available then they would send it to me. That request was made about 4 years ago and I never received the information.

First of all, there is NO DRAWSTRING at the bottom, and that is an essential for the fit and warmth of a vest...the bottom just hangs open and the drape of the garment just doesn't work without that simple elastic drawstring.

I bought one copy and realized that it was more of an instructional manual with tips on where bridesmaid's stand in the processional etc. (information we will cover at the wedding rehersal).Other tips include a shower game called \\"The Clothespin Game,\\" which is so outdated my grandmother must've played it at showers when she was young. Mrs. Cleaver or Aunt Bee would be perfect hostesses for this type of game. I can't see anyone born post 1940 being entertained.Overall this book reads like an outdated Emily Post primer filled with information which is obvious. The title is cute, and had me expecting the book to be cute. The attempt at engaging the reader consists of a series of \\"war\\" metaphors.

NO ONE is \\"obligated\\" to hold a shower, since these are a gift to a bride, not something she is entitled to have and absolutely must get.A bridesmaid with sense should ask up front if she has to pay for her own dress, shoes, hair, etc, and a considerate bride will tell her anyway. Only a bridezilla would give this to her maids and say \\"this is your job.

When filling, use the notches throughout the center of the trays as max-fill markers. This will ensure the lid doesn't get \\"sealed\\" to the base of the tray when put in the freezer.The lids were a little tight putting on the first time, but after the first freeze, they slid easily and effortlessly. Only knock might be the width. I don't have a problem with it yet, but they are wider than my other trays, which could cause a problem depending on the freezer.Overall, I like them, the cubes come out a nice size for any glass, the lids prevent the trays from sticking to one another and it's easy to get the ice cubes out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly Product","review":"Yes, there is a cover, but no, it's not remotely snug and so does not keep water from spilling on the way to the freezer or keep odors out, which was the main point of my buying this. In fact, the ends of the tray curve down instead of up, virtually inviting water to pour out the ends of the tray as you walk it to the freezer. Then, if your freezer placement isn't perfectly flat, you have water pouring into the freezer while you adjust it. Then afterwards, you have extra ice mass in the freezer and substantially smaller cubes (from the water loss)than you intended! I kept using it b/c I couldn't find another great Tupperware covered ice tray and the lid eventually cracked along one edge after a couple of years (not so with the Tupperware one) so I've thrown it away. I agree with another reviewer - how on earth did this make it through OXO develolpment and quality control??"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy now, needs some work","review":"I had seen this in a magazine stating that it was a great product so I trusted and bought this because it looked so cool and is a great concept; unfortunately it needs some work. The good part is you don't have to fill each individual cube, you can just pour water in and it flows to the right part. The pushing each cube out sounds great but because ice expands and the bottom is flexible it gets stuck and you really can't get the cube out unless you let it melt a little before. The cube size is neat because it's oval but they are a little big for my taste. I would wait a while and see if they make improvements on the design, hopefully someday."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy if you like to water down your drinks.","review":"OXO normally makes wonderful products that feel solid, and this cheap plastic tray disappoints.I haven't had as many issues opening/closing the lid like others. However, i have to state something I feel is more aggravating- I hate putting the \\"cubes\\" in my drink and immediately hearing the ice crack, and then have it virtually disappear in a few minutes. The \\"cubes\\" have a very large surface area to volume, which is responsible for this.Instead I purchased Tovolo ice trays which offer real cubes, and ones with larger sizes that melt slower. The cubes keep their form, don't immediately dissolve, and still cooling a drink while providing a small desirable amount of dilution.I guess it depends on what you want from your ice... not for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"WATER SPILLS ALL OVER THE KITCHEN FLOOR!","review":"I was very exited to get this,as soon as they arrived i washed them and put some water in them and put the cover over them (which is hard to slide). When i was taking them to the freezer they spilled, it looks like the design does not work! I was very careful in taking the trays to the freezer and it just got me mad that the water was spilling everywhere: it was a small trip from sink---------to freezer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying piece of plastic","review":"Instead of a typical review, I urge you to read the one submitted by Blake Scholl above. He said basically everything that I was going to, and I feel it's a 100% accurate account of the product.I love OXO, but this ice cube tray is a pain in the arse. Its only redeeming quality is the fact that I can stack things on top of it because it is covered."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Fan","review":"I agree with another reviewer - I'm disappointed that this product came from OXO Good Grips. This tray is not suited to easy, mess-free ice cube making. The cubes are small to start with, and then with the amount of spilling that comes from having to push so hard to close the lid, you barely have any water left. I think I'll give mine to a new mom friend of mine - it seems like freezing baby food is the perfect use for these."},{"rating":"2","title":"Now these work great!","review":"Love these trays!

I decided to purchase these and I am very pleased. I made applesauce and carrots. I had to set the tray in a little water to loosen the food cubes but other than that, no problems. Just wish there were 1 ounces instead of 3/4 ounces but that's ok."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a mess...","review":"This is a disappointing Oxo product - and I'm a fan. Filling these results in water slopping all over the place - I have to dry the kichen floor after each attempt to put these in the freezer.

No problems with warping that I've heard about with trays designed for this purpose, and cubes easily fit in a narrow-neck bottle."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you follow the instructions, it works just fine.","review":"I see a lot of complaints about the lid sticking on this item. The instructions say to loosen the cubes first, then attempt to slide the lid. It works just fine if you do it that way. I'm pleased with this...no more fuzzy icecubes!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea, poor execution","review":"I purchased these trays because I liked the idea of the lid to make extracting the ice cubes easier. While the extraction is, indeed, quite easy, the mess I've made every time I've attempted to fill them has made them useless.The cubes themselves are rather shallow, and there little to no wall outside of the filling area. Water does not flow well from one cube to the next, instead spilling over the side. Most frustrating to me is the fact that the entire tray is somewhat convex in shape, so balancing it horizontally to prevent spilling is next to impossible; if one portion of the tray is horizontal, another portion will be at enough of an angle to pour its contents to the floor.I would definitely not recommend these to a friend, unless, perhaps, that friend has a particularly dirty kitchen floor that might benefit from an occasional soak."},{"rating":"1","title":"A poor wannabe","review":"I have four covered trays made by Tupperware, I was trying to save a buck, bought four of these because I have liked other Oxo products. It was a mistake. While these work, the cubes are small, the trays are difficult to fill and cap without spilling water, and they are clunky in the freezer compartment. All I did was compromise, buy and waste my money, and now I need to go pay the full price for the Tupperware trays that work and that I should have bought to start with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good concept poor design","review":"The idea of covering ice cubes so that they don't evaporate (a problem in frostless refrigerator/freezers) and don't pick up strange odors is a good one. However, the cube trays in Oxo's design are too shallow and the lid is very rigid. The lid does not slide closed at the outset and once frozen it doesn't slide open. It's a struggle to try to slide or clamp the lid onto the tray a good bit of water spills. After one use in the freezer, the lid seems to have warped a bit so that I have to force it as flat as I can while lining up the lid with the tray."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great item if you like spills and mopping up water","review":"I bought this tray on a Gold Box special as I needed new trays and this one sounded like it would solve a couple of problems with the lid feature. Well, the lid works to keep the ice from evaporating (subliming) and makes stacking easier, but filling the tray and getting it to the freezer makes a mess! The shape does not allow multiple ice pockets to fill, and the V-center makes a perfect ditch for water to run down, out and onto the counter, floor, and into the freezer. Luckily, the item was inexpensive as it went into the trash can following one use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chilly Fit","review":"I really wanted to like this product. It seemed like a good idea. You fill it full of water and slide the cover over and place it in the freezer. No it wasn't that easy. The cover is to snug and is jerky when closing and even more difficult when frozen. The ice that comes out is okay but no where big enough. I have a drawer freezer so placing the tray full of water always spills (no the lid is not water tight) This was a great idea just poorly executed. I would not recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"Not even worth the 4.99,When you put the water in the tray and put the top on - freeze it and then try to open it -good luck. Unless you make sure all the water is off the sizes before you put the top on the top freezes on. I have one I have banged and hit and the top still will not come off one end. Disgusted."},{"rating":"2","title":"does what i needed","review":"i got this item for freezing baby food in just right portions while keeping them freezer burn free. i have had this product now for over a month and am extremely satisfied with it. the tray is easily bendable to pop the food cubes out. it does an excellent job keeping freezer burn out up to about three weeks, which i usually pop them out by then anyway and store in ziploc freezer bags. i have no complaints really from this product other than the lid can sometimes be hard to maneuver on and off, although i think that is b/c i am using them to freeze food and not ice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Water, Water Everywhere!! I wanted to rate it 0 stars....","review":"I couldn't hate this product more. There is no way to fill tray or close the lid without sloshing water everywhere. Then the very short trip to the fridge usually results in more dripping.1. Make the lid watertight2. Make the lid removable by either sliding or popping off if the slide area is obstructed.3. Do something about that weird slant the trays have that doesn't allow the water to flow smoothly between cube spaces as you fill it. Usually resulting in overflow & spillage from the spaces you've already filled."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating!","review":"How hard is it to find a decent ice tray?

Be carefull with the slider as it may get frozen to the tray."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Ice Cube Trays Ever!","review":"I'm a huge fan of OXO, and own lots of their utensils, but these are terrible. The cube ports do not have a lip, so water spills constantly on the trip from the counter to the freezer (even if you fill well below the rim, which results in a very small cube). The plastic cover, supposedly designed to keep out odors, leaves a gap all the way around the tray, making it easy for odors to penetrate the cubes (and adding to the spilled water annoyance). Don't waste your money; you will only be frustrated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea but flawed","review":"Although the idea of these ice cube trays is great the actual use and operation of them is not. They can be very difficult to open up after they have frozen your ice cubes. Needless to say that is frustrating and it ends up making a mess all over with pieces of chipped ice and so on. The internal surface of the lid sticks to the ice cubes making opening up the tray very difficult if not impossible and leads to frustration and a mess in general.I would not recommend these to my friends or family."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"No tray releases the ice more easily than these OXO trays, and the shape of the ice is different, but the lids are difficult to use. The trays don't fit in the ice tray compartment, and there is much wasted space in the handle ends. The lids are nice for stacking outside of the compartment, and especially helpful for freezing ingredients like broth and tomato paste- but those lids are difficult to put on.If you like large cubes and have limited freezer space, I suggest you look at other brands."},{"rating":"2","title":"Use to freeze baby food","review":"I bought these trays to store homemade baby food.

Great product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value for the money","review":"I purchased the OXO Good Grips Ice Cube Trays, because the open trays took on the odor of the refrigerator.

I was so excited because this is a great way to keep things out of the water while it's freezing. I thought this was a fabulous idea.But the covers are difficult to get on and off. When you pull them off theyre stuck at first, so you pull harder, then I usually end up with a fast jerk, causing the water to spill everywhere, or cubes to fall out.The cube shapes themselves are half moons, so the water just falls out of them so easily and all over the floorEVERYDAY when I refill the trays with water and put the covers on I end up having to wipe water off the floor.I ended up throwing them away and getting normal deep cubed tray.This is an EXCELLENT idea, but I think they need to go back to the drawing board with this one.I hope they do because I'd love to buy an improved version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as I thought","review":"These trays are not spillproof.

They make some great products, unfortunatly they make some bad ones too. This is a bad one. I bought this so store leftover chicken stock in (I saw someone making leftover stock into stock cubes and saving it for another day).

They don't stack any better than regular trays. The tray is shaped in such a way that all extra water flows off the tray and onto the floor; rather than most trays where the extra water flows into the next cube.I've actually taken to filling the trays in the freezer with my brita pitcher to avoid carrying the trays across the kitchen. The cover sticks making it very difficult to slide it on without the water falling all over the floor. Once the ice cubes are actually made it performs well. You can serve the ice cubes one by one.

I do not find Mr. Talleur's style overly arrogant. I believe that this is a tightly targeted work, aimed, as it says in the title, for beginners.

It also doesn't stand up to any heat, I use it to lightly grease my griddle for pancakes and things (at about 375 degrees) becuase I don't like the residue left by Pam, and it shrinks and flakes bristle bits every time.

I have to physically turn it off at the switch to save power. Maybe I am missing something, but I guess I thought it would be smarter than that.

I am sure this movie's original title was nothing to the affect of \\"Rumble in Hong Kong\\" and this is just another marketing ploy to get people to buy some crap-o film that Jackie was in a looooong time ago.

The DVD includes a lengthy filmography for Chan, as well as a list of the injuries that he has suffered over the years in making his films.

Tell Me Why resonates this warmth in a good way. The chords, riffs, the beat, and the vocals combine to create one of the best tunes ever by Paul van Dyk. Anyone who classifies Paul van Dyk's music as trance should know something. Paul van Dyk doesn't consider his music as trance, and it shows in Tell Me Why. His music is simply \\"electronic dance music,\\" as Paul puts it. Tell Me Why is far from trance, yet it is very danceable. Also, it's danceable, but I could easily find myself just chilling out to such a tune, or listening to it on the road. Tell Me Why exemplifies his new album, Out There and Back.

The background dance mix on a few of the selections didn't add - but detracted from the song. It was liked listening to two differnt recordings playing at the same time.

The plastic parts on the Regal lasted about 2 years and I knew I needed to find one with steel parts. This one is awesome, not only does it have steel parts but it churns the best ice cream. I've made about 6 containers so far. Coworkers have bought their electric models and we have made ice cream side by side. Not only was mine creamerier but it was always firmer than any other. The only thing I found was that any 6 qt machine takes about 35-45 min. While a 4 qt takes less time. We have chilled the mixture hours ahead of time and other times have not.

I think we made ice cream once or twice Summer 2010, and then when I went to use it this summer (2011), it made a horrible screeching noise. I called customer service for a replacement (based on the stated 5 year warranty), and was told sorry, but I could take 15% off a new $100 motor today! Screw you.

Too bad, this is otherwise a seemingly-nice ice cream maker - the other parts work well.

I now have to go to the hassle of contacting White Mountain and securing service for a product that they did not sell to me. I anticipate issues.

She requested it after seeing one owned by our friends at a summer party. Their unit was 10+ years old and they made ice cream every Sunday, this was a well built American-made product. My wife was thrilled to open the ice cream maker on Christmas day.Now for the bad part. After pulling this unit out of the box, it did not look the same as the old one we saw this summer. It had \\"Made in China\\" labels on the motor, etc. I tested the motor under no load and it made a horrible grinding noise, then started a high picthed whine, then started to smoke.I have returned the product to Amazon for a full refund. I wish I had read the newest reviews of this product first. White Mountain sold their product to Rival and now the product is junk! It is a real shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good","review":"I had more problems with this unit then it was worth. It was really hard to close the latch, I had to use a hammer many times.

The winner has their ice cream produced by Purity Dairies for a year. Every year I try out different flavors and tweak my recipes to enter. I've won a couple of ribbons for my effort. A few years back I splurged and purchased a White Mountain Freezer because cheaper brands did not have a powerful enough motor to freeze ice creams containing lots of cream, chocolate, or eggs. The good news is that the White Mountain worked--initially. The bad news is that in only a few years, I have had to replace the motor three times and the replacement cost is almost as much as the original machine. Each time it fails more quickly than the time before. Do not rely on the overall rating for this machine as many reviews are written by new owners whose motors have not yet failed. It does make great ice cream, but only for a while."},{"rating":"1","title":"warning! bad motor on 6 qt freezer","review":"I am very disappointed with the rival White Mountain freezer. If I am lucky in 4-6 weeks I will receive a fed ex sticker to return my defective motor with.

Then they called me back and said, oops, bad info you need to send the bad one back. We know we have issues with bad motors but sorry, you need to send it back and we will try to repair it. After 2 weeks I called back and they said it will take 4-6 weeks just to send a sticker in the mail. Who knows how long before I get a repaired, defective motor back! Needless to say, I will not be purchasing anything from Rival in the future.I will be careful what I buy from Amazon at all. I was very disgusted by this shoddy service as well as the shoddy product I was sold.

The electric motor itself is fine but the gears in the transmission are made from substandard material. The first sprocket after the motor will wear on the shaft and will soon disengage from the motor. Before this happens you will hear the popping noises as the teeth of this secondary gear are whittled down. This has happened 2 times. In the summer of 2008 White Mountain replaced the failed motor of a unit we purchased in 2007. We used it the rest of the summer to make a batch of ice cream every 2 or 3 weeks. We used it in May of 2009 and the replacement motor failed in the same way. The freezer makes excellent ice cream but it just won't do it for very long.

The first time I was using the maker after about 30-35 minutes the maker started working real hard, the motor was slowing way down so before letting anything break I decided to stop and open it up. The ice cream was done to perfection. I am not exactly sure why people had motor problems but I do know if I ran it any longer I may have had a problem. So my point that new user should know, when the maker starts to slow down the ice cream may be done and you should turn off the machine. Any homemade ice cream taste better than store bought.

My father purchased one last year and so my wife and I decided it was time for us to purchase one also. This freezer makes the best tasting ice cream anywhere. It is very easy to use and the 6qt capacity is plenty for a small family gathering. Whats best is that it makes ice cream in 20-25 min and then you can rinse and make a second batch using the same brine solution in approx. another 20 min. The freezer turns faster and the stainless steel components are a life time investment. Don't let the high price drive you away. It cost but is well worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great purchase","review":"I purchased one of these several months ago after laboring over the price. I have no regrets. It's a top notch made in the USA appliance and gives me a lot of enjoyment. It also makes the best ice cream from a family recipe that I've been playing with and tweaking for about 30 years.The stainless steel can is a great feature and the motor has all kinds of power. I set mine in the kitchen sink in case I spill salt or brine water. When the ice cream gets stiff it gets loud. I usually put in ear plugs. Outdoors it probably wouldn't be as noticable.I was sceptical if the patented dasher would really make that much difference. Trust me It does. Several people who I have shared the ice cream with agree too.Everything about it says well made.

The sides of this beater are thin wooden slats connected onto the cast metal beater by a few, cheap metal screws. These screws get wiggled back and forth while the container spins around in the ice. When it finished I was scooping out the ice cream and I found black streaks in it. You had to look closely but they were there. I don't like the idea of aluminum.This was a very cheap and not well thought out way of connecting the wood to the metal. Poor workmanship.

My father had to replace his after 15 years for reasons that were not the manufacturers fault. I bought my first freezer a couple years later. These new freezers may carry the White Mountain name, but they are no way in the same class as the originals. Rival is the new owner of the White Mountain name. The new freezers are prone to break, IMO. After 2 years, the motor on my new freezer broke some teeth off the internal gears and became unusable. My father's new Rival White Mountain had almost the exact same problem. The support process with Rival is even worse. Getting a new replacement part is impossible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Feel decieved","review":"I researched for a new ice cream maker for months. I read reviews on all the major ones.

They told me to send them a copy of the receipt showing that it had been purchased within a 12 month period. I wrote them back stating that it says on the side of the bucket that it had a 5 year warranty. I received another email today telling me that the bucket and the container have a 5 year warranty and that the motor only contains a 1 year warranty.

They refused to just send a replacement that worked! Following an afternoon on the phone, going between Amazon and Josh at Beach Camera, Amazon finally made the situation right and is going to send out a replacement. I found out that Amazon can only control the customer service for items that were purchased and fullfilled from Amazon, not from a third party vendor like Beach Camera.

For a couple of times you can soak the tub but then the cheaply made metal bands stretch/rust and the tub simply begins to spread apart. The OLD White Mountain must be at least 30 years old and the tub still does not leak. Rival has ruined a good name.

This contrasts with the policy of such companies as Sigma & Samyang, who include a hood & pouch with every lens."},{"rating":"1","title":"FLT.93 FICTION SHOULD BE SHOT DOWN IN FLAMES!","review":"It would be so nice and comforting to think that there were HEROES on board Flight 93... but as any dedicated 9-11 researcher will tell you, the facts and the evidence don't support anything written in this book.Take the time... go on-line, do your own research.

The stories are generally interesting well thought out with surprising plot twists and ethical dilemmas for the characters.

The crew makes excellent use of the islands settings and the visual effects and editing are world class. The car stunts and driving are particularly impressive.The only thing that regularly annoys me is the removal of manufacturer emblems from cars.

The men of Five-o dressed in suits and were classy, these new guys dress like bums, like they just walked into a bar on a Friday night. The musical score in the new series is loud, over the top and often just out of place with the content of the scenes. The editing is fast in your face, made for a child with ADD.

The AC wiring has locking tabs that prying with a screewdriver will not release - and no instructions on how to disconnect are on the unit. The manufacturer should provide online documentation considering this a is a safety device. I am concerned that I will break the tab/wiring harness and have to wire in a new unit.

On top of that though, the battery compartment is UNDER the AC connector, and the AC connector is a stubborn little bastard that does not want to pull loose. What a pain in the tuckus. If I ever have the opportunity to install my own smoke detector it won't be one of these."},{"rating":"2","title":"KISS misses yet another opportunity......","review":"What a missed opportunity the members of KISS must be feeling now. I am sure that they had a chance to make this an official KISS book - but chose to discount the efforts to two enthusiastic fans simply wanting to document a band that they hold in such high regard. All the while, thinking of course that they could do it better. Only time will tell to see if \\"KISS\\" can produce a more thorough and well-documented history. The book is absolutely the \\"best collective history\\" of the band that I have read. The time and effort it took to research, check facts, compile and finally write this book is evident in the accuracy of the facts. The mere thank you and credits to people who assisted the authors in compiling the data - speaks to the accuracy itself. True KISS connoisseurs will recognize the value of the book - don't wait to add this book to your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"This KISS book ROCKS!","review":"I LOVE THIS BOOK. The photos are AWESOME! There are so many KISS books out now - I would put this on my top favorite KISS book..My top five favorites:1.) KISS Alive Forever2.)

We managed to followed most of the tours in the Bavaria region and picked up on some along the Romantic Road. These tours take you both on and off the beaten track, with recommended stops etc, whilst avoiding heavy traffic. I believe that without this guide we would have missed many of the smaller off the beaten track areas, which made the trip so much more enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a very reader-friendly, informative guide.","review":"My wife and I know Germany pretty well, but this guide was an excellent addition for our next trip there. It is very upbeat and informative, with just the right amount of detail."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as it appears","review":"Similar to another reviewer, from the appearance I expected this to be a right-angle driver that would allow me access screws in tight spaces by turning the end, without having to ratchet the driver side-to-side.

On this CD of pleasant satndards backed by a good jazz combo, Kelly whispers in her warbly Jeri Southern like voice(Jeri Southern has a good voice, but small), trying to be a jazz singer but talking her way through lyrics in-effectively. This CD is not recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tisdale","review":"Wayman Tisdale, who you might remember from his days as a forward for the Sacromento Kings and Phoenix Suns, just came out with another great album. It is good stuff from this excellent bass player."},{"rating":"2","title":"it is face to face","review":"This elbum is an exelent album and I would recomend it to any Face To Face fan out there. It is clasic Face To Face at its best and really catchy. If you haven't ever bought a Face To Face album start wit this and you WILL buy all of there other albums. So out of a 1-10 scale I would give this album a 9 because it is a good album and you will listen to it all the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Superb","review":"I have loved this Cd from the moment I purchased it years ago.

Watch this only if you want a good laugh."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Far Horizon","review":"We purchased this movie because it was based on the book \\"Sacajawea of the Shoshones\\" written by my grandmother Della Gould Emmons.The company did a good job digitizing the original Movie and it is wonderful to have a copy on DVD for our children and grandchildren.Thanks so much for offering this movie again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lewis and Clark romanticized....","review":"It is quite interesting to view an old Hollywood version of the corps of discovery.The historical truth is far from being respected, the Native Americans speak beautiful english, Lewis and Clark are rival lovers...still, the film is worth viewing if you want to compare the story line with that of the real trail blazer's story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical Hollywood nonsense","review":"Apparently, the screenwriters thought an expedition that resulted in no battle casualties and no real fights with the indians was not sufficiently dramatic. So they larded the story up with romantic nonsense between Clark and Sacajawea (and a non-existent love triangle among Lewis, Clark and Julia \\"Judith\\" Hancock). For good measure, they threw in two pitched battles with indians. None of this ever took place.I think the story of the Lewis and Clark expedition is exciting enough to be told accurately. Someone should develop a new movie of the Lewis and Clark expedition, one that tells the story straight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mr. piccolo","review":"This season in my own opinnion is the best one of all dragon ball z season.I can not wait for this one to come out, I love everything about this one, it has tons of action and the best part is the introduction of super saiyan 2."},{"rating":"2","title":"great boxset","review":"This was a great boxset, i did'nt really care if the complete cell games was'nt in here i saw them on tape uncut couple of years ago so it did'nt really matter to me, but this was great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I purchased the item as a christmas present for my younger brother (he asked me to do so).

But all the seasons were $16 on here when I first started buying them, closer to Christmas they went down to $13, then immediately after Christmas they went up to $25.

We have the newer DBZ series (seasons 1 thru 5), DBZ and DBZ GT. I am getting tired of paying more and getting less. Why are their discs with 3 episodes on them? As fans, I expect each disc series to finish the saga. This is utter BS and I'm tired of it. The producers of this series need to stop taking their fans for granted.Signed,Season 5 may be the last DBZ product I buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good season!","review":"It's hard to get me to say anything bad about any of the Dragonball or Dragonball Z series. My son and I can sit and watch them all day. If I could change anything about any of the Dragonball Z movies it would be the length of some of the fight scenes. It seems like some of them go on forever."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a damn good set....","review":"Dragon Ball Z season 5 has some of the greatest battles in DBZ history...Piccolo Vs Android 17 was bonecrushing, and very exciting to watchTien who is normally only a side character, made one of the greatest moments I have ever seen.

I think its one of the best animated cartoons ever. So when I saw that they are coming out on dvd in different seasons, I had to get it.

I recommand getting this dvd for all the dbz fans out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"husband loves it","review":"bought it for a present and my husband has been wanting these for awhile. he loves it and wants the rest"},{"rating":"2","title":"My favourite series","review":"The presentation of the Dragonball Z series is brilliant. It is well worth the money and I would suggest it to any DBZ fan.The remastering quality is good, just the cutting of the frames that really irritates me. Having been moved aspect ratios, the top and bottom have both been cut off leaving you with a lesser image. It would have been nice to have the opening scene like I remember it to, I'm not a big fan of the japanese version, and what the heck is the ending scene all about?!Other than that, the marathon feature is a brilliant idea if you plan watching a DVD in full. The casing and DVDs themselves look professional and good enough to sit on your DVD shelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME !!!!","review":"This is a great buy finally a cheap way to watch your favorite sagas. I was disappointed that this set didn't go through the Cell games though and also that they seemed to cheats us a little on this one. I say this because it is a six disk set cool huh, but wait on the 5th and 6th disk maybe the 4th too I can't remember any way they only put three episodes on them while the other disks have 5 or 6 episodes on them WTF ? sounds to me like they didn't want to stop the next saga mid way through or they wanted to screw us. Either way this is a great buy ! great quality and just plain awesome try picking up DBZ burst limit on Xbox 360 or Ps3 after watching this and give it a play both are fantastic and complement each other nicely.By the way the episode thing is why I gave it 4 stars not 5."},{"rating":"2","title":"What I was expecting.","review":"My biggest problem with this set is that they felt the need to spread 26 episodes over six discs. Five would have been enough. The last three discs only contain three episodes on each, which isn't really that big a deal, but it kind of puts a damper on marathon viewing.I was also a bit disappointed to see that, like season 4, the dub had barely been altered. I don't really have a problem with the voice-actors themselves, my main beef is the dialogue. To put it bluntly, it's terrible. Full of cringe-inducing lines that may amuse younger audiences, but not older fans.Those few minor grievances aside, this is another great installment in the series, and I can't wait for the next one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cell Saga (#5)","review":"This is the way I remember the DBZ Cell from my teenage years... I think this is how it should have been kept!

Some of the information is conjecture but there are also hard facts, its up to the reader to discern which is which most times, others it is pointed out. Facts are also repeated often, I'm not sure if its to make sure we remember them or what but the repetiveness (if thats a word) of some of them almost detracted from the book. Overall I enjoyed it and found it very interesting to think about."},{"rating":"1","title":"oh no, another anti-government book","review":"If you are a homeschooler with a deep distrust of your government, then this book is for you. I am a homeschooling mom. I do not deeply distrust my government. The basic premise of this book may have slight credibility, (yes, Stalin did kill more people than Hitler). Yet, \\"Uncle Eric\\" makes some pretty over-the-top claims. Claims such as, \\"The Jewish Holocaust gets the publicity because it is regarded as the justification for Jews to have a Jewish state (Israel) in the Mideast.\\",(pg 36), and in regards to Pearl Harbor, \\"Few are willing to face the possiblity that the President and his cronies planned it all.\\" (pg. 162).If you are looking for facts and the whys and wherefores of WWII, look elsewhere--it'll save you having to pay to ship this book back."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE LETTER","review":"Far from the bats released in his youth, this is a recording for die hard fans only. He starts off by stabbing the ivories in an unaccompanied version of WEST COUNTY GIRL off the BOATMAN'S CALL album. The next thing you hear is the lighting of an obligatory cigarette. Then Nick launches into two lectures covering the nature of the love song, God, and the act of creation.The lectures are interspersed with melancholy renderings from Cave's past, plus a gem of a new song called LOVE LETTER. His essays are moving at times,especially when he discusses the loss of his father. In other places, our lecturer gets self-consciously absurd, for instance, Cave's analysis of a Kylie Minogue song is a little over the top to take too seriously.Throughout, Cave is adamantly confessional, making no apology for his observations. It's the very attitude fans have come to expect. As always, he lays it on the line but the candid intimacy with which he does it is something rare, brave and new."},{"rating":"2","title":"definately amongst the best","review":"Saw this one when originally screened on television but could'nt remember what it was called. All I knew was that Charton Heston was featured. Now I have received a copy from Video Rarities. Not cheap but worth it. This riveting miniseries about a serial killer that manages to avoid capture over the period of decades while living in the fictional southern town of Delanor. Charlton Heston narrates the story at intervals as well as acting his role as a founding father of the town as he watches it grow unaware of the dark history of hidden graves and the young hitch hiking runaways that lay in them. The community has its other issues to add to the tension with racism. The title Chiefs relates to the different police chiefs appointed over the period with the last one a black man to add to the plot. A great ending to. I would rate this miniseries within the top half dozen ever produced."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful prayers to accompany saying the Rosary","review":"This book has excellent scriptural excepts to accompany the Rosary. Very easy to hold in one hand while holding the Rosary in the other. The brief prayers can easily and quietly be said in a public rosary setting while the first half of the Our Father or Hail Mary is being recited. These scriptural prayers are good meditation tools which combine a focus on the mystery of each decade in conjuction with the prayer for the Holy Souls. A great combination of prayers. The author also has a \\"Thirty-Day Devotion for the Holy Souls\\" which I recommend as a companion for daily prayer and meditation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice way to pray...","review":"I just received this little booklet it is quite niceI would have enjoyed a booklet that could lie flaton a kneeler, But this is alright ir is a five starwork...Thank you"},{"rating":"2","title":"the rosary for the holy souls in purgatory","review":"GREAT FOR ANYONE INTERESTED IN HELPING THE HOLY SOULS IN PURGATORY AS THEY PROGRESS TOWARD GOD.

Great for edge cleaning but not over wide surface areas like walls. Yup, it is truly a good corner and edges brush."},{"rating":"2","title":"Large Utility Scrub Brush - Useful for Shower Floor","review":"This brush has a wide rubber grip handle and firm bristles. What makes it a bit unique is its size - at 11.1\\" it is nearly a foot long. You can use it to clean a large area where a smaller brush would make the job tedious, and in some instances to avoid bending as much due to its reach.The bristles are synthetic and fairly heavy gauge. They can be used to clean corrosive acids and alkalis although this was made for use in bathrooms and kitchens. I tested it on the shower floor and it's perfect for that type of work.The instructions say this brush can be cleaned in the dishwasher. With most brushes, the high heat of a dishwasher would cause bristles to fall out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Mystery","review":"This is an Agatha Christie type mystery - one in a series by a prolific British author more well-known for her Regency romances.

(I certainly can not.)The only other mystery writer to approach this feat is Reginald Hill, who tells who the villain is in the first sentence of one of his books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very readable but otherwise unmemorable","review":"An old-fashioned murder mystery set in the days when life was simpler. I hardly ever figure out 'whodunit', and thus probably enjoy these types of books more than more discerning readers. But even I figured this one out fairly quickly. Maybe I've finally read enough to see the clues. Still, I recommend this as a lite-snack for the brain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still the best debunking I have read","review":"There are always going to be some folks who cling to fiction rather than accept fact. You'll see reviews that quote the supposed Flight 19 radio report that \\"even the ocean doesn't look right\\". If you do you own research you'll know that this is pure bunkum - and that's precisely what Larry Kusche did: his own research, and found the vast majority of reports to be pure bunkum.In the search for truth, some people go so far and no further. Thankfully for us, Kusche went all the way as often as he could, and his work here is a confirmation of the principle of Occam's Razor: all other things being equal, the simplest explanation tends to be the right one.I recommend this book as a reality check, especially in an age where the Internet has spawned an avalanche of conspiracy theories and misinformation, and educational systems have failed for years to give students the basic skills to investigate, analyse and draw sensible conclusions. Kusche shows you how."},{"rating":"1","title":"Intentionally deceptive","review":"This is one of the classic \\"debunking\\" books of all time.

Use the Imagination: pass through the triangle and never come back to disease, misery, unhappines, etc. (See Jung's work on Active Imagination and get going)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Visually appealing but not very informative!","review":"This was a beautifully done book with wonderful pictures! The major problem I found with it is that it only covered four or five of the major brands of collectible kitchen ceramics. I ordered it under the impression that it covered a vast range of kitchen ceramics. What proved to be even more disappointing was that there was no price guide! I guess if you're an experienced collector of yellowware, redware, ironstone, etc. this would be a great book. For a novice such as myself, it proved to be relatively useless."},{"rating":"2","title":"At last!!!","review":"Oh joy!! After all these years this fabulous recording is finally available on CD, and I just got my copy in the mail.

What is actually presented is a way too descriptive and subjective analysis of Newton's life and habits, with not much in depth discussion of Newton's mathematical and experimental innovations. Only until the appendix does the excellent 'Tour of Calculus' type of format make an appearance. A better outline of Newton's scientific methods can be found in Morris Kline's \\"Mathematics of the Physical World\\" from Dover books, and there are most certainly better Newton biographies out there. Disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Pretentious and Sloppily Written Book","review":"Berlinski attempts to cover up his lack of writing effort and his lack of anything to really say with flowery prose. It didn't work for this reader. I was very disappointed in the lack of useful information in the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very disappointing book.","review":"Unfortunately this book confuses most of the technical descriptions of Newton's work with florid, complex and ultimately meaningless prose. In trying to add intuitive meaning to the mathematical aspects of simple physics it utterly misses the mark while boring the reader to death. I can only assume that a lay person would be thoroughly confused by the meandering, 'poetic' and intangible descriptions used to pad these chapters. Some of the historical context and notes about Newton and his contemporaries are interesting but the chronology is often lost because the author jumps to different events, forward and back in time without bothering to make this clear to the reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Book in NOT a Gift","review":"Mr. Berlinski got 2 stars for teaching a little math and dropping hints on Newton's life. He also would like to have you understand that despite Newton's ability to read religious Greek, Latin, and Hebrew biblical sources, he was 'confused' about Christianity and embraced the Arian heresy. Was this a book on Newton's gifts, or Berlinski's religious beliefs? The book is mostly filler on a few biographical tidbits.
