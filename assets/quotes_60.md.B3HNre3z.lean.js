The biggest problem is the underwires which extend well past the closure and won't lay flat unless your shoulders are pulled so far back it is painful. I also had a problem with the straps, in that they were too far to the side and cut into my underarm.

It was very repetitive, which I guess was the purpose, but it didn't work out very well. The same scene replays over and over again, with only slight differences.

Apparently, the answer to that question is yes. The script and acting are so bad, I had to actually stop it at times and cleanse my palette while watching the Discovery Channel. Out of respect for gay cinema, I watched the whole movie. That's over an hour of my life that I will never get back. The acting wasn't even as good as an NYU student film and the places left in the script for a bit of improv ended up being stilted and awkward because the actors were terrible. The overt and awkward sexual references throughout the film became hard to watch. They were inappropriate at times and at others just plain stupid. Ugh.

The whole thing felt childish, and that is before considering the random cartoon animations they throw in throughout the movie. Though it was an indie flick and I didn't have high expectations, I was still disappointed. The acting felt phony, the chemistry was off, and the story was ridiculous. Lola keeps waking up from nightmares that her girlfriend finally dumped her because she was late to an important meeting (Lola is ALWAYS late for things). Every time she wakes up, she gets a do-over to try and make it on time, however, some zany plot ensues and she is too late. It felt repetitive and I felt silly watching it.

Also the thumb is poorly sewn on and not properly constructed. It should be sewn on to the palm but its just attached to the side of the glove. The result is that the glove does not close properly. Also the thumb itself is too short and half the size of the other digits. I contacted them about the quality concerns but they were totally unresponsive concerning quality issues.

I immediately noticed a significant drop in my average GPU temperature (7 to 10 degrees). I can hear the fan noise but it is fairly insignificant. This is a great little exhaust fan if you want to move some air out of the computer. The fan is inexpensive, small, simple to install, and fits easily in tight spots between PCI cards.

The first couple of uses take some getting used to. It takes some practice to place it on the can properly but once you get the hang of it, it's actually fun to use. It will tackle any normal can with no problem and it really does stop on the first pass around. The only disappointment is that it will not open a 2 1/2 pound coffee can.

This product is very attractive and ergonomic in its design. That is where B&D's reputation ends. The can opener must be placed a certain way in the base or it will not charge. It will not open a large can as the battery goes dead 3\\\\4 of the way around the lid. The cutter falls off when you raise the handle to remove the opener from the can.

Well, I did, ordered it, and it is being used a lot again!!! Of course, Christmas Eve and Day, I had to use a manual one! lol Anyway, it opens any size can, and it fits the hand very comfortably. I have had the smaller version of it, and it was not comfortable to use even though it said 'ergo'. I think that is the term. Anyway, this one is perfect to use.

I don't know what I was doing wrong but there were no instructions with it so I finally got so frustrated with it I gave it to the Salvation Army. I was really disappointed with it. I expected better from Black and Decker."},{"rating":"1","title":"READ THIS BEFORE PURCHASING!","review":"This battery does not hold a charge. It has to constantly stay in it's charging base. If it is left off the charger for an hour it will maybe cut half-way through a can, then you have to resort to a manual can opener. The charging base does not have any type of charge indicator light, so you can't tell if it's charging or not. It also fits loosely in the charging base and if it's not correctly seated it doesn't get a charge and you're back to the manual can opener. You're better off purchasing the regular corded can opener.

For a large family, this product is essentially a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak battery, won't open large cans","review":"This is the latest in a series of lousy electric can openers in my kitchen, and will probably be my last. The battery on this unit allows you to open about four cans before needing a recharge.

The blade assembly, like on many other units, can be placed in the dishwasher."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea -- poorly implemented","review":"Black and Decker has a long history, at least with me, of innovative product design that is poorly implemented. This item is yet another example. A cordless can opener that actually worked would be useful. This one doesn't. It's difficult to align properly in the charging unit, made worse by the fact that there's no light to indicate if the opener is charging. The result is that without great care, the batteries don't get recharged. Even when fully charged, the opener lacks power. As others have noted, it's difficult to fit on many cans and the cutting blade portion of the opener falls off very easily.

I have to agree with John Row who wrote a review on this thing. I wish I had read it before purchasing it. It is VERY hard to get the blade to line up with the can lid.

It doesn't pierce the cans reliably and often stops halfway around. It works, most of the time, but it's terribly annoying. And it's even difficult to get it straight in the base so it will recharge--plus the base is very light weight so it tips over. I had a different model of walk-around-the-can opener from GE (which became Black and Decker) before--it wore out eventually--which worked a whole lot better.

That's more than was paid for the new can opener.Seems like an electric cordless can opener should last more than one and a half year and that the battery replacement should be a little more reasonably priced. BTW, we also left the unit on the charging base when not in use, so the battery does not have a long life with even infrequent use. Looks like I'll go back to the old plug-in variety!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to Use","review":"This is the hardest can opener I have ever used.

I have packed it away for the next charity that calls."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Trash","review":"I wish I had my old B&D cordless Can Opener. It was 100 times better than this \\"newer\\" model. I hate the way it works--or rather fails to work.The unit is difficult to place securely in the charger. Sometimes one cannot tell if it's properly placed for recharging.The cutter blade falls out easily, not to mention how difficult it is to get it on a can. Also it is so slow in cutting that I think that it may be possible to go on an extended vacation before it's finished cutting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing, but don't press too hard","review":"I've owned two of these and love it! Amazing, except that if you forget to take your hand off of the detachable part, after a while you are pressing too hard and it ends up falling off after about a year, and no matter what you try, you can't glue it on.

In less than a yera, this opener broke, I super glued it back together, and now it broke again,and can't be repaired. The cutter is cheap and poorly designed. The battery is so weak I didn't think it would make it around 1 can before completly drained.

It needed constant cleaning of the part that wasn't removable, in addition to sharpening ... and no, I wasn't using it to cut steel or pouring syrup all over it - just opening cans. We ended up buying a replacement at a drug store for $8 that has worked exponentially better than this thing. I am quite comfortable saying that it is by far the worst appliance I have ever owned. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for awhile--but no reliability","review":"This was a terrific gadget--for a few months. It then died. While it seems to be charging OK (limitation: there's no charge light on the base, so you just hope for a positive mechanical connection), there just isn't enough oomph to get around even one can, at least most of the time, without major coaxing. The backup: open a drawer and use the old manual model. That appears the only reliable \\"cordless\\" device available.Black & Decker's quality on small appliances seems to have really gone down the tubes over the last few years.

They love that this one is cordless and can be taken to the stove, counter or whereever. When their first one died after 4 years or so, they bought the As Seen on TV hands free opener. It's a piece of junk. This on on Amazon is a good price (with free shipping) and Black and Decker is a good brand.Only flaw is that the little cutter part falls of sometimes. It's supposed to do so, but I don't know why. But still this is a winner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to use and no cords","review":"A can opener should be light and do the job right with ease and be easy and mobile and this thing does all of that and it's always fast and ready to use if you have it in the charger cradle all the time.Ergonomically it's very nice and make the job very simple for my wife so she loves it and I got one for my mom too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Old one was better","review":"I purchased this opener because 6-7 yrs ago I had bought the same thing...what I have noticed with this one is that they look the same but I noticed right away that it was lighter in weight.

I also have trouble using it on large cans...I would not recommend this opener."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cordless Can Opener with short lifespan","review":"My wife and I were happy with the idea of a cordless can opener. Initially the can opener worked fine for me. My wife had difficulty mounting the can opener correctly on the can and would have to resort to the old style hand model out of frustration on several occasions. This can opener is not \\"wife friendly.\\" I would not recomend buying this can opener for your wife.After a few months the unit began to run slower and slower. It finally died and would no longer accept a charge even after cleaning the charging contacts.Pros: Cordless convenience. Sharp blade opens cans easily when unit is fully charged and working. Attractive design.Cons: Is not well balanced. Can opener needs to be held in hand when opening 15oz cans and smaller. Uses outdated NiCad battery technology. Should have idiot light that monitors charging."},{"rating":"1","title":"A product that needs to be rolled back to the earlier model","review":"Th earlier model (KEC300) is what I wanted to replace since I couldn't find a rechargeable battery for it.

And I had about 6 years of experience using a B&W; cordless can opener before. Most of the cans we have are coconut milk cans that measure around 2.8\\" dia.A very ill-conceived design I would say. Why didn't they stick with the earlier model instead of trying to fix something that's not broke ???"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Finish The Job","review":"I worked for a hotel and relied on this thing to open large cans of food for the guests, and it worked wonderful for the first few days, then the weekend came, and it no longer worked."},{"rating":"1","title":"a piece of junk","review":"I BOUGHT THIS BECAUSE I HAVE A STROKE AND CAN ONLY USE ONE HAND.

It is almost the same as the original, can go anywhere you need to open cans and it can be hands-free."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best can opener ever!","review":"This is the best electric canopener I have ever owned. It took me a few tries to learn where to place the blade for it to work, but now that I know to lay the two white tabs on top of the can edge, it works on the first try every time!

I have tried many other models, but none of them could beat this one, at least not for me. It used to be sold at Target and many other stores but because of a reason unknown to mankind it disappeared from their shelves. First attempt of using it can be frustrating if you don't do it right. Just be patient and make sure both small ledges of the opener sit on top of a can. After you get it right you'll start enjoying it as I have been for all these years. If you want it to last, don't keep adapter plugged in all the time. There are nickel-cadmium batteries inside. They need to be completely discharged before recharging to last longer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well once started...","review":"I purchased this for my father, who suffered a stroke and lost much use of his right hand and arm.

In fact, I own a 18 year old K5 Kitchen Aid...that still makes bread and whips better egg-whites than this unit ever did.

I would definitely recommend for anyone needing low volume use and wants to save their money.The only CON: Sometimes it shoots 2 brads. That may not even be the nailer per se.

After a couple of nails though, my concerns totally disappeared.Just recently, a friend of mine was over with his Porter Cable nailer, and we were working on a project at my house. Comparing side-by-side, it seemed like my WEN was driving nails much straighter, and without jamming. (In fairness, take that with a huge grain of salt -- mine was fresh from the box, his had seen years of service).Would I want to go to a construction site with this? Probably not.

It would be an excellent book, except it has so many errors it is almost useless. I am working though the early chapters and examples as a refresher, since I am familiar already with this material, and have found errors in almost every section. Often the errors are subtle, an exponent missing here or an incorrect integration bound there, including in key equations, making them very difficult to find if you don't already know the material and are willing to work through it in detail. I have completely lost confidence in the book.

As an Engineer with formal classes in casting I was impressed with the information provided. Some of the information was great review for those classes taken so long ago. Addiitional technical information on how and why things are done bolstered my confidence this process can be done by the individual hobbyist.In my case I am turning a hobby into a retirement business, so the value of this small book will have long lasting value.

Like the other reviewer has commented this sealer really works. I am having no problems with it. It seals great. Besides if it didn't seal just right, check and do it again. It's easy and very effective. Get yourself a sealer and start saving money and hassles. You really can't freeze much without one because the best of ziplocs always seem to let in freezer burns. My only tip would be that when sealing something really juicy, freeze until juice is solid. If you do this you will find that you get a much better vacuum and more air removed more quickly from the bag. But the little trap inside is very easy to clean out drips. Also, stop the sealer quickly if juice is going inside before it has a chance to get inside the vacuum pump. Also has separate hose available and canisters like the pricier Tilia.

My ideal every morning begins with a cup of coffee made in this sleekly turned out coffee maker by Bosch.It's award winning design by F. A. Porsche is state-of-the-art rendered in an attractive brushed aluminum. No more hiding a stained glass maker! The water tank is removable, thus making it oh so easy to refill, and the level indicator is easy to read (no squinting here).After automatically shutting off when brewing is complete it keeps coffee warm for hours. I brew in the morning and with an 8 cup capacity have coffee for after dinner. It still tastes fresher than fresh.For us, this coffee maker is a perfect pairing of flawless design and topnotch performance. Great looks and a great cup of coffee from Bosch - what more could anyone ask?- Gail Cooke"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good marketing; Poor delivery","review":"I am very disappointed in this machine. I saw it on the Today Show and then purchased it from Amazon. I have had it about a month now and here's what's wrong: 1) metallic taste with each pot of coffee- now you'd think that this wouldn't happen with a high end machine, but no matter what I've tried it is still there-the literature that comes witht the machine mentions this may happen, but their cure doesn't work; 2) it leaks- although there is a water level indicator on the filling tank, go a little over and you have coffee all over the counter; you have thought that it would stay in the basket instead of running out over the counter; 3) coffee remains hot/warm maybe 3hrs tops even if you preheat thermal carafe with hot water; and 4) how could you forget to design a timer into the coffee pot- especially at this price--I'm going back to my Mr Coffee machine!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a porsche...","review":"This coffee maker has all the styling elegance that the name suggests. It is truly a beautiful appliance.Like its namesake, it is very fast, you have to be very careful with all that speed. Even if the carafe looks like it is in the groove, it may not be, and the result is hot coffee spinning out... oh, I mean spilling out across the counter. If you do everything right the coffee is great, but like every porsche I have ever dealt with this one leaks. Somebody needs to spend more time looking into the interface between the glass and the plastic on the carafe.

Great grounds and great coffee. HOWEVER...there are plastic parts that help hold the bean dispenser in place, and after 2 months they began breaking! When broken, the plastic piece joined the bins in the grinder and made a terrible racket, but didn't make it into the grounds. The motor got hot a few times. The 3rd and final fin broke about 3 weeks ago. The grinder works fine now (with the usual mess of flying coffee bean particles), but the coffee bean dispenser falls off if the grinder tips.

Tried it on the next piece (after the first was burned) and had to give it a big pull to get it to release. Bread popped out of the toaster and onto the counter, spilling crumbs everywhere.Come on guys, this is a pretty basic function and should be hard to mess up.

The design looks like it would contain the debris better than your average grinder. Obviously if you want a mill grinder, you need to accept the fact that it's going to make more of a mess than the normal blade grinder. So to be fair, the poor rating is not because it makes more of a mess...The poor rating came from its durability- ours broke after just two weeks of use (the motor burned out) so we returned it for a refund vs. trying a second one.I didn't notice an improvement in the coffee, but it could have been my coffee maker vs. the mill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing burr grinder","review":"I bought this grinder after reading about the superior performance of burr grinders, compared to the usual whirly blade style. The design looked promising, and the price was right so I bought it. Unfortuately, with burr grinders, as with almost everything, you get what you pay for. This grinder is of very poor quality. In the few months that I have owned it (and it's successive replacement after the first one broke), the plastic upper hopper has broken twice, during normal use. The grinding mechanism jams all the time, and produces an inconsistant grind, varying from big chunks to dust. Additionally, it is impossible to get this machine to grind fine enough for use with an expresso machine. Save your money for a better grinder, this one is a paperweight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't go here","review":"I bought this grinder in a store because I was desperate for a new grinder and I was trying to save money. First of all, the mess is incredible! I've had burr grinders before (Capresso and Melita) and they are neat as a pin compared to this. Mess was everywhere. I'd take the container into my sink and tap it there but then when I'd try to get all the grinds out of the container they'd fly around the coffee maker and onto the counter and attach to anything nearby. I was dealing with it since I save at least $30. Then yesterday (less than a month after purchasing the product), 2 little black plastic tabs that hold the bean storage in place broke when I took it off to clean it. No way to fix them. I should have spent the money in the first place because now I'm out $20."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grind Extra Beans","review":"I purchased this grinder becuase of the ability to accurately change grind settings. While it does that, it has a major flaw. After the grinding takes place, there is so much static electricity in the grounds that some of the grounds are stuck to the sides of the plastic cup. It takes a spoon to get the beans out of the cup and into the filter. Pouring the grounds into the filter is a mesy process. I was never able to grind beans and transfer them to the filter without leaving a dirty countertop behind. The static electricity ony made the process harder since charged coffee grounds want to stick to everything they touch. I got in the process of grinding extra beans to make up for the spilled grounds. I was able to put up with the mess for about 3 weeks before I got frustrated and replaced it with a cheap blade-type grinder. Now my Black & Decker is retired to the closet waiting for the next garage sale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay, but not for any real coffee lover","review":"It worked ok for a cheap burr grinder, but don't expect anything beyond that. Static build up is terrible. It takes longer to clean after each use (the chute for the coffee grounds clogs up) than it does to grind the beans. Considering all this I would recommend spending the money for a better grinder (Barista or Solis type class of grinder...) or if those are a bit pricey for your budget-- you might be better off with a simple blade grinder..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"Besides being the noiseiest grinder that I have ever had it is also the dirtiest. The lower container does not seal completely from the ground coffee coming from the upper \\"bean\\" container and coffee grounds are thrown out of the grinder during the grinding process, coating the grinder exterior and the surface the grinder sits on. It is also a \\"pain\\" to clean. To add to my frustration, this product only lasted a few months and then the motor burned out."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst coffee grinder ever made.","review":"My sister bought us this coffee grinder for Christmas this year. I would have better luck grinding the coffee beans with my teeth. This is the worst product I have ever seen.

My biggest complaint is that the size distribution of the resultant grind on any coarseness setting runs the gamut from superfine powder to large flakes. During the grind, I have to lay a towel over the seam between the unit and the grind collection cup to keep fine particles from flying out -- doesn't happen every time, and there's not a lot, but very noticeable against the white wall and countertop!I've had mine for about half a year now and use it 4 or 5 times a week. A crack has developed at the bottom of the whole bean cup (like that of the other reviewers here) and is slowly working its way up the side toward the lid. The final insult is that this device is LOUD: your neighbors will wonder why you're always doing small carpentry projects early in the morning..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like you need another irritant in the morning?","review":"I purchased this grinder to replace a Krups blade grinder that had finally stopped working after many years of service. Reading several other reviews that complained of the mess this thing makes should have prepared me for the daily explosion of ground coffee across my counter caused by the static buildup of the unit. Also, if you like dark oily coffee beans from Peets, Starbucks or Illy, you'll find yourself constantly patting the top of the machine to keep the beans flowing down to the grinding mechanism. I look foolish enough first thing in the morning, I certainly don't need the help of a crummy coffee grinder to make matters worse. Spend a few extra $ for a better burr grinder or stick with your old blade grinder."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so smart","review":"I chose a burr grinder to replace a blade grinder to get a more uniform grind and especially to avoid the mess of having to scoop out the grounds. But this disaster of a product cannot grind coarse enough for a French Press, and in general, doesn't grind uniformly at all. And the mess! Instead of grind-and-scoop, now I have to grind, scoop, clean the counter, clean the base, clean the sides, clean the canister, clean the sink from dumping out the grounds in the base... Most inexcusably, the grounds build up in the chute so the machine clogs regularly. I only realized this when the motor started smoking! But now, to use it, I have to spend five minutes with a toothpick getting the insides clean. The folks who made the product obviously never bothered using it themselves on actual coffee beans. Or else they're just shameless. I should have returned it the first time I used it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly designed, poorly made","review":"Within 2 weeks of purchase, the grinders top receptacle split in half with only normal use (one pot each day). Within another week the lower canister fit so poorly that the ground coffee kept shooting out the sides of the machine. It is the most poorly designed appliance I have purchased in many years. The poor material used in its fabrication is completely unacceptable. If you buy one, you'll have to buy a replacement within weeks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be called \\"DumbMess Deluxe Coffee Mill\\".","review":"Buyer beware! Yes it does grind the coffee but... the grinder easily clogs around the area where the grinds come out. When you pull the container out to get your ground coffee, the clogged coffee build-up makes it difficult to pull out. It does come with a cleaner type wand, but what a hassle to have to clean it throughly every time to be able to pull out the container! The other problem is, if you pick up the machine by the whole bean receptical, the receptical comes off in your hand and all of your beans spill everywhere!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass...","review":"The motor on my B&D grinder burned out after only 6 months of very light use (on average every two weeks), so needless to say, I won't be purchasing another B&D.

I do not recommend this grinder."},{"rating":"1","title":"Static buildup and big cracks.","review":"I got mine as an early father's day gift as a replacement for the Michael Graves blade grinder (also by B&D) and noticed that the grinds stick to the sides and lid of the cup. I assumed it was something that would subside over time but it hasn't really. The bean hopper developed a crack after a couple of months which expanded and now the entire section is kept intact by some packing tape. The little hump that keeps the beans flowing has broken off, probaly due to the constant tapping to try and keep the beans flowing into the grinder mechanism. Oh, and the lid for the grinds cup doesn't fit well resulting in a messy counter and a very annoyed wife."},{"rating":"1","title":"I received this as a gift, and still paid too much for it.","review":"Too bad there's not an option to give it zero stars, because that is what it deserves. This grinder does a very good job of uniformly grinding the coffee. Getting the ground coffee into the coffeemaker is another matter, however. Every time I use it the mess it leaves behind is incredible. Also, you have to jiggle it to get the beans to move down the hopper.

When researching all the different types of grinders on the market, the consensus was that the burr grinders were superior to the blade types. Being a poor student, I could not afford to purchase one of the top of the line types, so I thought I would take my chances and try this one out. I was pleasantly surprised.The grinds come out even and are fine enough to use in my cone-type drip coffee maker. Although you do see some larger flakes from the bean membranes, they do not affect the flavor any. I have not noticed any of the static that other people have experienced, so my countertops have remained clean after using this. The timer feature is nice since you don't have to sit there holding down the ON button the whole time. Plus, I think it looks nice, too.For those of you who want a burr grinder but can't afford one of the more expensive ones, I think this Black and Decker grinder is a good purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Static Mess","review":"I wish I could have my money back. Every day I clean up a huge mess on my countertops. The grinds come out statically charged. Rather than uniform pile in the bottom of the lower cup, I get a fine mist of ground coffee beans stuck to the sides. I must be of the same charge because once I put my hand near the grounds, they fly out of the cup....no lie! I don't live in a dry climate, I have a new house with updated electrical. There is a critical design flaw with this grinder. I also find that at its coarsest setting the beans are still too fine.Perhaps if the thing was made with glass or metal it would behave differently."},{"rating":"1","title":"B&D has a sence of humor","review":"In these troubled times it's good to see a big company like Black & Decker has a sence of humor. I can't see how these guys put the Smart Grind Delux on the market with a straight face, but they seemed to do it. (Those wacky comsumer electronic guys). By my observation,the YUGO and this \\"coffee mill\\" must have been designed by the same guy. I do have to admit the coffee tastes better, but the 10 minute clean up of grinds and \\"dust\\" after each unfortunate milling event, especially in the \\"caffine jones\\" morning just seem to grind me.

No matter how much I experimented with the grind adjustments, I could never get a cup of coffee with any better flavor than with the blade grinder I already had. 2. This thing is horribly noisy and even if the coffee had tasted better, I'd probably still taken it back due to the possibility of hearing damage from using it everyday. 3.

First thing first, we have only had it two months and the hopper has now cracked in three places. we grind an average of 1/2 hopper a day which is not that much for it to be cracked already. Second, the grinds go into the other holder container but does not do this without mess. Frequently there is grinds between the grinder hopper and the container which is a pain to clean up. Third, it jams a lot causing you to stop it remove the lid, use their special tool and start over."},{"rating":"1","title":"simply awful","review":"It's hard to add to the reviews already there, but I want to do my part to drive down the average :).

It's my first mill, and I like not having to guess if the coffee has been ground fine enough. Here, the coffee passes from the bean cup to the coffee cup, and you know it's perectly ground at your selected coarseness. If you want, you can even grind exactly the amount of coffee you need every time. I read many of the reviews on this mill saying that it's messy. All you need to do is tap it a bit after grinding, before removing the cup, and the most you'd have is a little coffee on the counter. That's a small nuisance compared to having a perfect cup every time."},{"rating":"1","title":"I usually like Black and Decker - but this was a waste","review":"This grinder was a waste of money.

I timed how long it took to grind and clean up for one pot of coffee today and it was 30 MINUTES. I can't imagine a person would do this every morning. I also had a plastic piece break off of the inside top by the press. I superglued it and it's held through one use since then.

(Of course, NOW i feel like hurling it around...) B&D has replaced the base twice, as it was covered by warranty, but very shortly after putting the new base on it, it too develops hairline cracks. Shoddy materials and design! So that's $20 wasted that I could have spent on a product that would not eat up my time attempting to obtain replacement parts, and would have a reasonable lifespan.

Started smelling burning plastic within the first couple of months, but used it sparingly so it took until last night before it spit out a bunch of plastic shreds and the nut holding the blade assembly together. The entire blade assembly has siezed and as far as I can tell, the plastic on the bottom of the assembly has welded itself to the plastic above it. The thing won't budge! Utter JUNK!

Amazon was extremely prompt and courteous in sending out a replacement even before I could ship the original unit back to them, but unfortunately, the repacement unit had much the same problem. There seem to be a fundamental engineering flaw in the blender. The only air vents for the motor are small slits in the bottom of the base, and the small feet on the bottom are so little that there is only a very thin venting space for the motor to suck in air to cool down.Anyway, I am returning mine and will be looking for a replacement at Amazon.

Modern Standard Arabic, or MSA, is the language of the Quran and is used for reading and writing and very occasionaly by university educated speakers. Then there are Colloquial dialects. Gulf Arabic, Egyptian Arabic, Levantine Arabic, Morrocan Arabic, etc. This is the SPOKEN language of the various regions, and it has very little (if anything!) to do with the written form of the language. To REALLY learn Arabic, you almost have to learn two seperate languages. One for reading and writing (MSA), another for speaking (one of the many Colloquial dialects)."},{"rating":"2","title":"gulf arabic","review":"Yes, the previous post is correct. There is barely any alphabet practice and most all words are transliterated into latin alphabet. However, the dialects of Arabic are rarely written. One would almost always use MSA in writting and reading something. The dialects have no standard way of writing them, and it is not therefore taught in schools. Most anything you read will be in MSA (newspapers, news, schoolbooks, and educated writings of various sorts). The dialects, if used in writing, will be in songs, comic books, cartoons, and some informal conversations (example: email between friends). Getting back on topic, the dialects are mostly spoken and therefore it would be of little use to waste your time trying to learn how to write them. You should rather focus on learning how to write MSA. This is probably why the authors of the \\"Teach Yourself Gulf Arabic\\" do not focus very much on the written form of the Gulf dialect.

And just so that it is perfectly clear this guy is the real deal on the instrument. Keep in mind that he also has a second disc (which is gorgeuos) of Acoustic Jazz out with his Quartet.

The left side toasts but it is uneven or just one side and somtimes burns corners of the toast. I am very unhappy with this purchase. I will never buy another Black & Decker toaster ever again."},{"rating":"1","title":"handles fall off","review":"I should have read reviews first. Within 4 months of buying this toaster, the push down lever handle fell off, then a couple months later the heating elements in one slot burned out and now about 2 months later the other handle fell off. I expect appliances to last more than 1 year. Very dissappointed. Do not recommend buying this toaster."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Built to Last","review":"I originally loved this toaster and rate it a 5. It broke about a year after I bought it. The pop-up feature on one side started to slip lower and lower so I couldn't easily retrieve the toast. I fiddled with the handle, which seemed to fix that problem but broke the handle off. Now it's got an ugly, broken handle and is slipping lower and lower again. This toaster is not built to last. How many years have people been making toasters? Shame on you Black & Decker for creating products of such poor quality that my review and others have to warn people away from buying them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unimpressed With Toaster's Abilities","review":"I read the other reviews on here. Debated on whom to listen to, and made the wrong choice. I am glad that I had a coupon and didnt pay more then 10.00 for it. Sometimes this toaster only toasts one side of the bread...even on the correct setting. If its perfect toast you long for...do yourself a favour and look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bravo!!","review":"I will admit when I went looking for a toaster it was dumb luck that I found this one. I had no idea what a difference it would make in my kitchen. My other toaster heated so unevenly I was just used to it. This toaster heats evenly and is sturdy enough to handle the little people in my house playing with it as I prepare breakfast. A great buy, you wont be disappointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Black & Decker should listen up","review":"Nice features (slide out crumb tray), but both handles fell off within 4 months of use (only used 12-20 times). Impossible to reattach handles."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Toaster is BAD NEWS","review":"I work in a Nursing Home in New York City and I purchased three of these toasters for use in our small pantries on each nursing floor. What a disappointment! Two of the three units self-destructed within three (3) weeks! In one case the elements lost power to one side of the bread. In the other unit not only did this happen but one of the sections got stuck in the 'on' position and wouldn't come up or turn off..a real safety issue. Then to top it off, the manufacturer's one year warranty does come into play BUT the company is slow as molasses in getting out a replacement. So, basically, one of three units is working properly after a month. That does NOT add up to a good purchase in my book. Anybody would have to be crazy to take a chance on one of these."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a Horrible Game","review":"I like Constantine.

It has a small footprint on the counter; I love the splatter guard, particularly while creaming butter & sugar or whipping cream/egg whites; and it's rather quiet for a mixer. I also have two of the attachments so far (with more on order), and I'm pleased with those. The Bosch should replace my ancient Cuisinart, because its overall convenience will mean I'll use it much more frequently.I gave it four stars instead of five because it's hard to scrape down the sides of the bowl while the mixer is running. That's not a big deal to me, but it would be an extra convenience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great mixer!","review":"I've been looking for a mixer for a couple of years and found this Bosch. I've looked at [other mixers]...The Bosch is large enough for a double batch of cookies. It mixes well. It's fairly easy to add eggs, flour, etc to the bowl. It's not very heavy and has suction cups to hold it to the counter. And the price is comparable to the KitchenAid mixer.I gave it 4 stars because when I lift the head and batter is stuck to the beater, the beater comes loose. It's not really a problem, but it is an irritant.Don't be afraid to buy this mixer...it's fun to use!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My 1983 machine is still working great","review":"I'm still using and loving the Bosch machine that I bought in 1983. It was a closeout item branded by West Bend and I'd never seen a machine like it, but I needed a mixer and the price was right. What a great investment. It still mixes super bread dough. I like not having to store several different appliances. We've ground a lot of venison with the grinder. Another great feature is that I can still find replacement parts if something breaks. How many other appliances have replacement parts available after 23 years?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy This Machine!","review":"I bought the Bosch compact mixer about a year ago. The salesman promised me it would perform just as well as the larger mixer, simply do smaller quantities. Well, I have now used it on almost every possible type of recipe and the only thing it mixes well is a packaged cake mix. Cookie dough takes forever to mix. Cheesecake never gets smooth. Likewise with mashed potatoes. My bread dough doesn't get kneaded properly and turns out heavy and coarse. When I called Bosch's customer service to complain, they told me they couldn't compensate me just because I don't \\"like\\" the machine. Do yourself a favor. Buy a KitchenAid or a Sunbeam instead. That's what I'm going to have to do."},{"rating":"2","title":"wow","review":"I bought this cd on a whim and WOW. I feel like this cd balances me when I listen to it.

Don't waste your money.If all you need are examples of the different forms this is your book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating","review":"Being fairly new to poetry, I purchased this book as an introduction to poetic forms, and it does not disappoint. The authors have cultivated a fantastic guide to many of the more popular forms of the modern era, and a few less popular forms. I found the chapters on the Villanelle and on Blank Verse to alone be worth the minimal price tag. The descriptions are terse but wholly concise. The choices the authors made for examples are so perfect that this book could work simply as an anthology of great poems. It is not, though, an all-around introduction to poetry, meter is barely touched upon, and some lesser forms are not given mention, but as books on important poetic forms go, I could hardly recommend another."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scanty Coverage","review":"These two poets rarely write in poetic form themselves, and it shows. The book is sketchy and often superficial in its treatments of the forms. For a much more thorough look at a much wider range of forms, check out the new book AN EXALTATION OF FORMS: CONTEMPORARY POETS CELEBRATE THE DIVERSITY OF THEIR ART."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth your money","review":"There is definitely a need for such books on poetic forms today, but this book does not fill that lacuna adequately. As has been noted, the editors are not poets of the first rank (despite the fact that Mark Strand was a poet laureate of the US) and are not unquestionable masters of form. So, while this book may serve a scant few beginners, there remain better other options.I would suggest checking out John Hollander's excellent short work \\"Rhyme's Reason\\". He goes over more forms and in a better style than in this book. If you are a poet yourself, definitely you should choose Hollander's book over this one. However, if you want an easy and light read, maybe this book is better, since it provides longer \\"readings\\" of certain poems. But if that's what you're after, you'd be better served by Harold Bloom's \\"How to Read and Why\\", a very good book written by a top scholar and yet readable by virtually anyone interested in literature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Husky Liners Tailgate","review":"The tailgate showed up in a timely manner via UPS.

Its a great alternative to chalky chewables or huge calcium pills."},{"rating":"1","title":"TRANS FATS","review":"I was really excited to get this product. Calcium + Vitamin D all in a fantastic piece of chocolate. What could be better? However, in looking at the nutrition information, I found that trans fat was not labeled. This told me right away that this product must be pretty old because requirements for labels were made at the beginning of last year. Scanning through the ingredients I found it. Hydrogenated oils. I felt so betrayed! A product that claims to be so healthy, while at the same time containing trivial amounts of trans fat! I suggest looking for other methods to obtain your calcium.

The only stand out tracks are Hypnotize and Soldier side which continues from the Soldier side intro on Mezmerize."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was expecting more","review":"After Mesmerize, well, mesmerized me, I was expecting its sister album to be equally gripping. Unfortunately, for me at least, this album is a \\"one hit wonder\\", and even that hit I cringe when I hear it (too many years of classical choir training make their attempts at a hard rock ballad painful). I've tried listening to the album several times, to see if it will grow on me ... it didn't.

They are capable of creating a far better album. A lot of people are criticizing Daron's vocals(which I can completely understand). I think Daron is a great singer..in his place,which is singing harmony for Serj. Daron is not a front man, and they shouldn't let him attempt it. How did Rick Rubin,with his esteemed reputation, let some of this material out? Hopefully they can fall back to their original sound ie.SOAD or Toxicity."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"This album along with mezmerize was the biggest dissapointment! Serj needs to sing and daron needs to stick to guitar and back up vocals. I hate to say this but I think there best has come and gone. Daron's voice sounds awful and if he sang as much back in self titled and toxicity they would not be as big as they are now. Horrible and they got two stars just because I love there old stuff so much."},{"rating":"1","title":"SOAD RIP thanx to Daron","review":"This album just like hypnotized is garbage and is a disgrace to the great early two albums. the songs are not as good , but basically the main reason is because serj is the man and daron sux. he is literally the worst singer i have ever heard. Serj did so great on the first two and even steal the album was good(it was better before the commercial release)but ever since then daron is slowly taken serj's place. i wont be surprised if serj isnt even on the next album. do yourself a favor and buy toxicity or their self titled album instead of this crap. that guys voice is like needles in my ears. let sej sing again or i think soad is already done."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING!","review":"This is simple the best album of the year and the best of SOAD:Attack: 10/10Dreaming: 11/10Kill Rock'n Roll: 11/10Hypnotize: 9.7/10Stealing Society: 9.7/10Tentative: 11/10U-FIG: 9.7/10Holy Mountains: 10/10Vicinity of Obscenity: 9.7/10She's Like Heroin: 9/10Lonely Day: 11/10Soldier Side: 11/10All songs of album are amazing, but my favourite tracks are Lonely Day, Soldier Side, Dreaming, Kill Rock'n Roll and Tentative ."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Kid's Review","review":"It was great! xoxo, Stucia You should like it too!

This is a good CD, but not as good as the earlier ones. A large reason for that is the singing of Daren... Sorry, he may be a nice guy, but he shouldn't be singing. Serj is a great vocalists, and I wouldn't mind it if Daren occationally joined in, but there's way too much of Daren's vocals here. Way too much."},{"rating":"2","title":"A newer System of a Down","review":"In this album continuing the previous Mezmerize mostly everything has changed from Toxicity. The meanings in the songs are much deeper and you CANNOT just listen to the album once. You will say it's crap and not pay attention to it, but if you play the whole thing over again, you will fall in love with it. The hard metal might have disappeal at first, but if you are human, you won't want to stop the music.The first half is Hard metal including Attack and Dreaming, and it continues to calm down into Lonely Day and Soldier SideI swear I can't hate any of these songs because they all have different amount of power with different tone and feel.Of all my albums (besides Toxicity), this is the one I can listen over and over and it won't get old!Coming in short with only 12 tracks, it's to be merged with Mezmerize creating a perfect sound.

As for lyrics, I'm sure there's some sort of message, if you care to listen through the dismal sessions... One has to ask, is it a message with any value? Some reviewers complain about a consistently trite political agenda throughout songs, yet objections such as this seem moot to me, as a band which subscribes to this kind of non-sensical sound would seem automatically incapable of any worthwhile message. A complete failure of music, in any case - don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am not hypnotized yet","review":"I was under the assumption that this is a software program that will allow the listener to become hypnotized.

This second half offers stranger and at times much more discordant tunes than Mesmerize. That is what is so good about it though. Hypnotize's themes are a little bit darker than Mesmerize's so the music is naturally darker. Many of the tracks are reminiscent of the older tracks of the original album. The sound, however, has evolved immensely with extremely complex guitar riffs, multiple layers of sound and amazing vocal harmony. The accompanying lyrics are also outstanding. You may find yourself headbanging and shedding tears in the same song. It's hard to describe everything that makes this album so awesome.

Instead of taking the \\"easy\\" route and returning to a fantasy setting, he steps into the real world, choosing a difficult premise, and delivers his best story yet.While his first two books showed off his ability to handle large casts of distinctive characters and their overlapping stories, he flips the script here by focusing on two characters, both of whom house large and distinctive casts IN THEIR HEADS.Describing the plot doesn't do the book justice as, like any worthwhile journey, half the pleasure is in getting there, and this book is a rare pleasure, indeed. In the end, Andy Gage and Penny Driver will be two people whose lives stick with you long after you reluctantly put the book down.Matt Ruff has done it again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes you think.","review":"Great literary work. While I know close to nothing about multiple personality disorder (MPD), this book is most illuminating, not in a medical sense, but as a thought provoking exercise.

How true it is to the reality I do not know, but it is not hard to see traits of the multiplicity in the everyday people, which is why it is a great book, for it makes you think.

I had ordered three of these batteries: one lost its charge completly in about a month, the second one shuts off the phone every 15 minutes or so consistantly, and the third one shuts the phone off randomly. The main problems are that they don't hold much of a charge and they don't fit on the phone properly. The battery slides a little on the phone and will shut the phone off if contact is lost. The best working battey of the three consistently shuts the phone off when I text since there is a high risk of moving the battery while texting. This is obnoxious because I will get 95% done writing a message and boom, the phone shuts off and I have to turn it back on and retype the entire message.

The big caveat is the IP range - you need to have access to your linksys router via a wire in order to connect in and change the range over to 192.168.1.XXX.

It self configures at 192.168.0.1 which is pretty ridiculous. This makes it necessary to configure the unit from a local device using something on this subnet or use their utility they provide. The utility which is for Windows only it appears is quick and dirty and works well but I'd love to forgo the utility altogether and just be able to configure it via the web interface right from the start with a DHCP assigned address.I suppose this would require finding the DHCP assigned address but that is usually quite simple and they could have still used the utility to configure the device when necessary.Great little box with no frills that simply works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast and Easy Set Up","review":"This is a great product to make any old parallel printer into a network printer.

(Updated 1/12/10)","review":"I have always used touch lamps by my bed for the ease of turning on/off the light before falling asleep and getting up in the middle of the night. The only problem I had with regular touch lamps is that on the occasions I fell asleep with the light on, the brightness from under the lamp would glare in my eyes when turning at night and wake me. This little uplight is perfect! There is no bright glare shining down. And it uses a regular light bulb, so it can be bright enough to light up the room or read with, yet the dim light is low enough for ambiance. It has a very nice appearance and was even larger than I expected it to be (to my liking).Very nice product!EDIT: This lamp stopped working about two months ago. I thought it was a bad light bulb so tried a few new ones. No success. Dropped 5 stars to 2 stars for short useful life. I think a year and a half is a little to short for a lamp. :( Too bad cuz it's such a pretty one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a touch lamp","review":"I gave this only 1 star because it is not a touch lamp, which is the reason why I was purchasing this lamp.

So while technically it is a 5.1 channel card and there is audio output through the optical port, you can't play 5.1 channel sound through the optical port.The card's manual demonstrates some questionable business practices on the part of Dynex. It says that you should return your card to the place of purchase if it breaks within the 1-year warranty. (This is, of course, impossible.) It also says that you should make sure your sound system not only has an optical port, but that the sound system's manual specifies compatibility with the exact model number of Dynex card. This is ridiculous, and in any case it should have been printed as a system requirement on the box rather than hidden in the manual."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother if you've updated to XP SP3","review":"This sound card is not compatible with XP's SP3 update.

In this monograph we can find many important ideas, such as income streams and net present value (Ch. I), Fisher equation (Ch. II), intertemporal choice of consumption (Ch. IV), rate of return over cost (Ch. VII), term structure of interest rates (Ch. IX), and many others. These ideas have laid the foundation of modern macroeconomics and financial theory. Besides, John Maynard Keynes had adopted Fisher's idea of the rate of return over cost (he called the marginal efficiency of capital (MEC) in his General Theory (Ch. 11)) to formulate his own theory of interest, though later misrepresented by John Hicks' IS-LM which oversimplified the idea of Keynes. All in all, after 83 years since its first publication in 1930, this book is still among the best books ever written on the subject of interest, and is very much worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Huge chunk of Punk!","review":"This is such an impressive bible of information, with a mind-boggling array of bands and artists - a book that can serve as a great resource but one that's easy to dip in and out of - you'll find yourself flicking through the pages reliving those lost years of musical youth.

Most of it follows De La Torre as he mopes and moons over Mori's character and tries to conquistarla although she's entirely not interested. Rather than coming off as sweet or funny, De La Torre just seems dorky (even more so than the suave \\"nerd\\" best friend, who is just skinny), annoying, and pathetic (and not that good-looking, although his character is supposed to be all that). None of his stunts to try to win her over are all that outrageous or comical either. In the ending, which defies believability, some cheap psychological mumbo-jumbo is supposed to win the girl over, although what she really ought to do is file a restraining order."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fullscreen Format ??","review":"This is a sweet little movie and I enjoyed it very much. That said, be warned that this DVD is not in it's original theatrical aspect ratio but in fullscreen format. The 16:9 ratio indicated on the disc is a misprint. This is not pan-and-scanned but apparently an open-matte version of the movie - not as bad as a pan-and-scan but still not the original aspect ratio which would have fit in nicely on a 16:9 TV."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Waste!","review":"Beware!

The jewelcase was nowhere to be found and I had no idea that I had found such a gem. All I knew at that point was that there was a neat image of a stick-shift on the cd itself. I decided to just throw it on the radio (during my show). I selected track 03 and was delighted with the heavy sounds of \\"Hog\\" coming from the studio monitors.

On many levels, this movie thrives and succeeds. The cinematography is brilliant for such a low budget flick, and the story telling is paced well. There are no lulls or dead spots, and no unnecessary scenes or dialogue. It is this bare bones story telling style that holds your attention, and ultimately carries Six Reasons Why into the realm of a memorable film. The one thing holding this film back from reaching its potential is acting. While the acting is often very serviceable, it often wavers on the over-dramatic side, and occasionally, albeit infrequently, crumbles into mediocrity. If you like King's Gunslinger, or are a fan of spaghetti westerns, Six Reasons Why is worth viewing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Strange Western","review":"I like this well enough to give it 4 stars but, like Sixth Sense, I'm going to have to watch it again to understand it a little better.Worth having."},{"rating":"1","title":"Six Reasons Why is a waste of time and money.","review":"Six Reasons Why is a waste of time.I could not get into the story, and the actors are amateurs (except for Colm Feore).The movie is being touted as an example of indie filmmaking in the tradition of the Coen brothers.The Coen brothers put out quality product from the start.Save your time and money for something worthwhile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seemed like it was filmed in slow motion","review":"This was the slowest most drawn out movie I've ever seen. The story is about a wandering desperado who, while riding a horse and carrying a six gun, is really living in the future. He's been given a quest by a preacher which is the hint that he's suppose to be a good guy out to get the bad guys in the bad lands. There wasn't any twist to that in mind. The film never grips you and the best thing that I can say is that since I rented this, I could turn it off without having to leave my seat. The acting is poor and the filming gives this movie more of an amateur feel than a indie film. If you want to do yourself a favor, skip this movie and rent a sleeper like In Bruges."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sizing","review":"I ordered an XL as a Christmas present and it was way too small.

YES! believe it or not, very touching, I was quite surprised when I read the first Cottington, and it has continued on with this latest release, but with special little seals, envelopes to open and read, such fun, and almost like you really are seeing into some other person personal past life.

The letters are hard to read, and don't tell a story.

The V330 is the culmination of the V300 and the V600. It has the sex appeal of the V300, along with the pimp appeal of the V600. Coupled with a bluetooth hands free head set, this phone surpasses most every expectations. Among the most notable qualities are voice dialing, mp3 ringtones (which can be transferred directly from your computer via Motorola's Mobile PhoneTools 3.0), video camera in 2 modes, VGA digital camera with 4x zoom and AIM with the quickness.The cons a few and far between:-Aim use is charged PER MESSAGE through T-Mobile. Unless you have the 500 SMS messages for 2.99, AIM can rack up a few extra dollars-The video camera is hard to configure to get the longest video/audio clips.

First, my Bluetooth became flaky - sometimes the person I was talking to would not hear me so I hung up and called without it. Not a big deal, but annoying. Then the battery life got bad. OK, I bought a new battery - fixed. Then, the kicker - the phone would magically just \\"lose\\" the network despite not moving the phone. Then, my signal was not as good at my house despite being perfect months earlier. So, I bought an aftermarket antenna - I got a small improvement. To this day, the phone still loses the network and drops calls like crazy; sometimes when showing 4 bars! This is my first time back to Moto since the old startacs and I probably won't be back.

It had all the features that were important to me -- namely a colour screen, bluetooth, and lots of contacts. The phone was an utter let down.As stated above the reception is HORRIBLE. It will drop calls with all the bars showing, people are constantly saying, \\"What?!? SPEAK UP?!?\\" and that's IF you can understand what they are saying. The simple act of moving your head will change the reception quality. What good is a cell phone if you need to stand completely still, and don't interrupt the speaker (because interrupting the speaker degrades their voice quality).Stay AWAY from this phone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't even try this phone","review":"This is the worst phone i ever used till now.

But, the menu system is completely outdated and non-user friendly (like all MOT phones). Do their software engineers even look at NOK phones to compare at all before they launch a new handset? They are light years behind in the interface. You still can't store several numbers for one person under one name (each has to be a seperate entry). The phone's green call button is on the right (should be on let like every other phone). The most annoying thing are the buttons on the side that constantly get pushed in your pocket and change the ring style and volume. Each time they change, it makes a loud beep. This phone is not worth getting, especially now (I had mine for a year and am looking for a better phone now as a replacement). MOT phones in general are to be avoided."},{"rating":"1","title":"Choose another phone","review":"This is a poorly designed phone. Battery life even in standby is less than 72 hours. The menu system is awkward, especially the phonebook menu. The phone is also on the heavy side. It's a shame that a company like Motorola with years of design experience can not design a decent phone.On top of all this, if your provider is T-Mobile, then good luck!Poor reception and lousy customer service is what you'll get."},{"rating":"1","title":"piece of crap","review":"Dont ever buy this instrument.

I never use any extra features in the phone except call receiving and talking. I have reported this issue to T-mobile but the issue is not solved yet. Other problem is, T-Mobile coverage is extremly poor in Orange County area(Sou. CA).

The v330 does have a couple problems with it well at least for me it did. After a couple months I had problems using the chargers. I switched out 4 chargers, and each one would work good for a couple weeks, then you would have to fiddle with them to charge the phone.One thing they didn't mention the review though, is the ability to listen to the radio on the phone. Thing is you need to buy a special headset, I haven't got the headset myself t-mobile wanted $50 for it. But my overall review of the phone is if you have the chance pass on this one. There's alot more models out, and ones that have less bugs then this phone has."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent cell","review":"I am extremly happy with this device and would definately recommend this phone to all who are thinking about getting one.First of all it has very nice reception capabities.Very nice options it apears to be an all around nice quality bang for your buck kinda cell.

It is hard to charge. And it breaks. The backlight on my first one broke, so I couldn't see the screen. When I got the warranty replacement, it worked fine for a while until the ear speaker started cutting out. I am still stuck with this phone until I can get a new one (which will not be a Motorola), but until then I have to deal with not being able to hear people. It is so embarrasing to answer the phone and have to say, \\"Hello? Hello? ... Hello?\\" and wiggle it around until I can hear them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre at best. Takes 6 hours to charge!","review":"The battery life is poor and it takes 6 hours to charge this monster.

If I had the choice again I would go with a nokia phone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great Matthew Hope Thriller","review":"Ed McBain has a wonderful way of weaving a thriller around a nursery ryme. Each chapter moving along the poem and introducing the characters. It doesn't matter that the cow with the crumpled horn is an elderly woman' this adaptation of the ryme is brilliant. The story begins with Matthew Hope being hired to represented a farmer (who grew the corn) accused of murdering his brother. As always Matthew is convinced his client is innocent and sets out (with the help of PI Warren Chambers) to prove it. As is often the case there are a number of little side plots which mostly come together to solve the crime."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent but not the best","review":"When compared to other Scott-Heron discs, this one falls just short.

I spoke to my friend, who is a mormon and he laughed and told me that was ridiculous. God had progressed to the state he is at now, all knowing, perfect and our Father in Heaven, he is not still progressing or learning. I have to say this makes sense to me and I have decided to investigate the LDS faith. I think we would all do better going to the source rather than those that do not believe, to investigate other religions. I at least owe my friend that.

On the contrary, they are remarkably well-versed, well-educated, and very knowledgable people. And even more interesting to me... I have yet to notice a Mormon publication that picks apart or bashes another faith. It is a shame that there are so many making a profit off of such slander."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who knows LDS doctrine better than the LDS?","review":"I have never been able to understand why someone wanting to understand LDS doctrine (a.k.a.

I have yet to read such a book that is accurate or that is not, in one way or another, repeating untrue beliefs or malicious lies about the LDS that are simply not accurate or factual. If you want to know the truth about what we LDS believe, simple contact the Church. They will send two of our 60,000 missionaries to your home to explain our doctrine to you. They do not charge for this, nor do they brainwash people. They simply explain the truth to you and let you decide for yourself.

The movie borders on creepy at times, in its portrayal of The Boy's 'independent' search for truth (i.e. not at all independent, but 100% decided for him by the mysterious narrator, for whom's benefit this whole charade was obviously concocted).I'm not speaking at all to the validity of any claims made in the movie (you can decide for yourself, and many of the other reviews cover those issues thoroughly), but the overall quality of film production is awful, and I hope the filmmakers seriously reconsider ever taking on a new project."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome documentary","review":"It is not only packed with useful and important information but, it exposes all these special interests douchebags like the FDA, all these Machevellian food manufacturers such as Monsanto.

Both operating systems confirm through queue managers that they have indeed sent stuff through the cable, but in the end there is nothing.This proves that it is one thing to make a cable with a USB plug on one end and a parallel plug on the other; but it is quite another trick entirely to make a parallel printer deal with information sent via USB.

I was happy when I hooked up the cable and printed a test page on my HP Laserjet 6P. Job done -- I thought. The next day (computer was never turned off) it wouldn't work, and never worked again. Spent several hours fussing with it, uninstalling, reinstalling, changing parameters, but all to no avail. Further research I did online seemed to indicate that using these cables is very hit or miss. I should have done more research before I bought the cable because I didn't know I would be gambling when I bought it, but I know now and I lost. Time to do what I should have done in the first place, buy a parallel port card and get all the parallel port standards. For an extra ten dollars, save yourself the hassle and get a parallel-port card.

Well, my investment was totally worthwhile. In less than ten minutes, I was printing on my old Canon from the new Vista PC.

Richard Thompson's Mingulay Boat Song is excellent, the scurrilous Good Ship Venus sung by Loudon Wainwright III is almost as raucous as the version I learned, and delivered in a simple melodic style. SAMPLE the tracks first, or you will be scratching your head, these are all over the sea lanes, with a few hanging out in the trees somewhere inland. I was impressed that Sting was doing some of these, his style is a bit overproduced (the presence of soft choral backup vocals with harmonies in major thirds!) but the main melodic line is generally straightforward, at least; much more authentic job on main line of Blood Red Roses than on Shallow Brown. There are gems on this album, just pick through."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Enjoyable Disc","review":"Overall this collection is quite enjoyable. I have read reviews that criticize it for not being true to historical sea chanteys, but I don't think that is necessarily what the artists were going for here. I think that it is their modern day interpretations. Most of the songs are very well performed. Some are haunting and some are beautiful, and some are both haunting and beautiful."},{"rating":"1","title":"It Blows, Boys, Blows","review":"Having listened to and sung chanties and sea tunes as a pirate reenactor for a few years, I had eagerly awaited this compilation for some time. What a disappointment. There are a few decent tracks, but by and large, the contemporary interpretations don't work at all. Some of the performances are just friggin' bizarre. The liner notes suggest a second 2-disc volume is forthcoming in 2007. Don't bother. Stick with Stan Hugill or Tom Lewis. Better yet, try the recordings of local and regional performers on the renfaire circuit, like The Pyrates Royale, The Corsairs, The Jolly Rogers, The Crimson Pirates, or The Brigands."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Collection of Pirate & Sea Chantey Tunes","review":"If you have an ounce of love for the sea, and a tad bit more interested in pirate tunes, you'll love this double cd collection.

It is not unusual to find shanties sung by people who have difficulty keeping perfect pitch, or tempo. But at least they understand what the music is about, and sing it with heart and enthusiasm and a love for the genre.Hal Wilner should stick to whatever genre it is that made him know enough to be approached by labels, because he clearly has no understanding, and less enthusiasm for *this* genre.If you love lively music from the maritime era, you can only be bitterly disappointed by this collection.

Enough to put you off for good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good music, but don't do this to chanties","review":"Good voices and music, but shanties are never meant to be modernized. Shanties were work songs sung aboard colonial and early 1800s working/military/pirate vessels.

When I first heard that there was a new recorded collection of traditional ballads and sea chanteys, I was excited enough to pre-order it. Huge mistake. This is a positively unlistenable collection. If you're looking for traditional sea songs, this is not the collection you want."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just didn't get it.","review":"Kudos to Johnny Depp for the idea, but if this album is to spark an interest in Sea Music, it has missed the boat. About 1/4 of the tracks are spectacular. That said, the remaining majority are given treatments ranging from boring to ridiculous. Most of the performers (and the producer) haven't trusted the material to carry its own weight. Too many times a gimmick or an \\"innovative\\" production value has been slapped on a piece instead of letting the songs (some of which have survived quite well on their own for over a century) speak for themselves. There are exceptions. Richard Thompson's track is a gem as are the tracks with Martin Carthy and Sting. In fact, all the selections done by musicians that have a connection to the world of Folk Music are terrific. When the artist is more concerned with \\"Let me show what I can do\\" is where this album falls apart. Too bad; great musicians and great material should combine for a spectacular product. This one barely limps into port."},{"rating":"1","title":"Despite the validity of artistic interpretation...","review":"...and the reputation of Hal Willner, neither can account for how well over half of this album is nigh-unlistenable. If it wasn't touted as being produced by two well known people who made a very traditional pirate movie, then I could accept the decidedly non-traditional nature of the majority of the songs.Traditionalists: Stay away, or find the handful of songs that are salvageable elsewhere.Non-traditionalists: Stop ragging on the traditionalists for griping about this badly mis-marketed album. That's fine if you like it. I and many others don't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Authentic, but disappointing","review":"Maybe I am too coddled by the commercial visual and aural aspects of pirates these days, but I was disappointed in this CD. Yes, it was authentic, and yes, I do appreciate the historical, but it was just not a fun listen. I purchased this CD for two reasons: 1, my 11-year-old daughter's pirate birthday party and 2, as oral rhetoric for my composition class and a section on pirate history. It was too salty for the first and only a little better for the second. I would guess that this was primarily my fault for not researching better before I bought, but it wasn't what I expected, regardless of my research or lack thereof."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keelhaul the marketing department...","review":"and break out the tar and feathers.

It is derivative and poorly produced and almost brutal and painful to listen to in several places.I too, like many, bought this CD and had to return it several times because the disks wouldn't play. I didn't give up though, as I have a tendency to sail myself over the deep end when I'm curious. In this instance, I expended much more energy than the journey was worth.It's a good sign that even when technology refuses to listen to it, you're probably better off. Sometimes the gods of technology trump the scallywags of yesteryear.I bought this because I love sailing movies and have listened to Chanteys and Sailing music for quite some time.Unfortunately, this is just corporate pooh - brought forward - hoping for you to happily smear it all over yourselves in exchange for cold, hard currency.Absolutely shameful, me hearties."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perhaps a victium of different expectations","review":"I found the album pretty good. It is very true these are, overwhelmingly, nothing along the lines of traditional chanteys. I suspect some are unfairly dinging the album because of specific expectations. I think the disappointment is warranted as the album title is misleading in this regard.But.This is not a 1 star album by any stretch, nor is it a 3 star album the aggregate has it pegged at. So, if you are looking for something genera pushing when it comes to chanties don't despair, most of negative reviews are approaching the album from specific disappointment. It is a rolling journey of interpretation, some good, some great, some mediocre, dependent on personal taste._LISTEN TO THE SAMPLES BEFORE PURCHASING_They are releasing a sequel next year and I am looking forward to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Conjures up glorious images of pirates singing chanties at sea!","review":"I purchased this CD for my son, who is a ship's captain down on the Osa Peninsula in Costa Rica. He takes tourists on tours of the bay for dinner cruises, snorkeling, scuba diving, fishing, wakeboarding, waterskiing, etc. I thought it would be a fun birthday gift for him and a CD he could play to \\"set the mood\\" for high adventure with his guests. Needless to say, he loved it! I'm thinking of buying one for myself just so that I can think of him everytime I play it! What a great idea to have all these fresh renditions by popular artists of old sea songs from the past."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a folk sea chanty record, but amazing","review":"Those familiar with Hal Wilner's mad genius won't expect a traditional set of sea songs from this compilation. Apologies to those who did; I see a lot of negative reviews from people who expected something more like the excellent Smithsonian/Folkways collection.Willner & company have done it again, though.

Not only will the pirate in your life enjoy this collection, the mermaid will too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great compilation","review":"I have heard several CD's with pirate and sea shanties, this album has a good compilation and use a lot of music, others are just the voice shanties (maybe as they use to be)but with music it makes them more friendly for general public. It is a great offer but it could be great if the lyrics were somewhere in the booklet."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment","review":"While the selection appears to be ok the actual songs were awful. Only one or two are worth listening to. The producer writes about how rushed the production was and it shows. Many of the artists seem to have no idea of how to sing these songs.

Save your money and buy Gordon Bock instead","review":"In a word: this album is awful. I actually had to fast forward past some of the cuts because the singing is so bad. I love sea chanteys. But I'm not sure what these things on this album are. There are so many better albums than this. This is just a way to make more money off of the Pirates of the Carib. movies. \\"What do you do with a drunken sailor?\\" is an abomination. Just as fake as the ride.

This is a fake collection of bad singers with a few, emphasis on few, good tunes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rogue's Gallery: Pirate Ballads...","review":"A snappy title and a great idea did not match up to the reality once listened to. The range of songs was odd - and most were rough - both in musicianship and lyrics.

The problem with most (the fault lies with the selector) is that the performers have no feel for the genre. It's like listening to a rock or R & B band trying to perform Christmas carols or Roseanne Barr singing the national anthem.For example, some chanteys are work songs, such as hauling songs, and need to be sung a tempo; when performed freely and romantically, they lose their meaning.Most of the selections which were not offensive were simply boring.All in all, very disappointing; a wasted opportunity to revive interest in a delightful subset of folk music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rogue's Gallery: Pirate Ballads, Sea Songs, and Chanteys","review":"I didn't like it at all.

The fact that the CD was been produced by Johnny Deep and Gore Verbinsky make me expect a collection full of joyfull salty sea chants, with the same spirit I saw in Pirates of the CaribbeanWhat a deception when the musics become slow paced, boring, sad songs. I can't trully imagine a sailor singing this songs without throwing himself in the sea after that.I'm not a speciallist like some people I readed here, but looks like i'm not soo wrong. With a few exceptions like \\"Cape Cod Girls\\" and \\"Bully in the Alley\\" the songs are terrible, bad singed and incredibly boring.With a great OST as Pirates of the Caribbean, I trully expected more from the producers.

It is taken from the perspective of someone who knows the field of Rhetoric well and because much of its content comes from the time of JFK and uses Dr. Silvestri's access to material from his time in Boston, it has an air of authenticity not found in other JFK volumes.

Will Amazon/Target refund my $? Doubt it. The flames began to shoot out of the top of the lamp, by the bulb. It seems to be an electrical problem as the light socket is fully burndt. Weird how it would work for almost 2 years and then cause a problem. I still have another one, and will not be using it. Does anyone know where I can get a refund for this defective item? I still have the burnt lamp I can send for proof! It seems to me by other replies, that there have been other fire problems with the same style lamp!

It wouldn't stay together right in the middle of the pole and was cocked at an angle.

The humor is apart of that, so is the bitterness, sadness, and pain. It was all there. It was there when you have to watch your parent slowly go away, it is there dealing with old crap with your siblings, it is there dealing with hospice, the white van, the box, and the things that you take for granted daily.This movie showed us what it is really like, it may be messy at points, it may be sad, difficult to watch at points, but it is true to life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two Weeks","review":"Best movie ever.

We've all been there before - dysfunctional family gathers at the bedside of a dying (choose 1: grandparent, parent, sibling, child). The actos do well with their roles, but can barely rise above the stereotypes. The poignancy in the film comes from the situation itself, not from any skill in the writing. Each scene follows a predictable inevitability (even the scattering of the ashes at the end), and the humor is forced and unnatural, with two completely superfluous scenes (a son trying to retrieve his bag at the airport; another son trying to get the store discount for orange juice at a grocery) added as intended humorous interludes to break up the sadness of the main story line. There have been many much better films about dying (Wit and One True Thing come to mind immediately), so don't bother with this one unless you're a die-hard Sally Fields fan.."},{"rating":"1","title":"2.5 stars for uneven production","review":"I wanted to provide the names of the songs on the soundtrack because they might be of interest to other viewers.

The 20/30 something children in this movie other than the daughter Emily seemed relatively self-centered. It was sad to think that their mother was leaving at a point when they really could have benefitted from some life lessons. And the poor step-dad got left out in the cold! As if he wasn't grieving as well!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"Sorry, but this film was a total waste of 2 hours of my life. There wasn't one character who was remotely likeable. Every one of the kids were completely unsympathetic. Sally Field's character was o.k. until her big line that each of her kids are amazing. Huh? All of them were self absorbed boors, with the possible exception of the daughter. She was just a boor - not self obsessed. She goes ahead and brings in a rabbi to speak to her mother, even though she wasn't a religious person. This is a fairly typical response when dealing with the imminent death of a loved one. Of course, as in many Hollywood productions, the rabbi or the priest or the minister, turns out to be the biggest idiot imagineable. I guess these guys have no experience in dealing with the dying or the grieving. What a piece of garbage this film was from begining to end. I can't believe it got so many 5 star ratings!"},{"rating":"1","title":"FILE 13","review":"Not even five minutes into the film and I was completely turned off!

It's nice that it's several short stories (versus a long movie) so that he can finish a tall tale in a short car ride. I just wish there were more stories for him!

If you pay the Amazon price, that's 50 cents per minute. To add insult to injury, most of the stories are pretty dumb, and the whole animation is too flashy and fast-paced for kids under the age 9 or 10.

Some are pretty well done. But it is short, didn't notice that before buying it. If you are a parent who wants your money's worth, this release will not provide that satisfaction. The show (a collection of shorts) will be finished before your kids finish their snacks. At $15 and up... pass on it.

Probably the most famous example recently is Mater's Tall Tales, which came out between the first and second Cars films. Comprised of several short episodes, they have Mater in the lead role with Lightning McQueen in a supporting role. The episodes cast Mater as the hero, often times saving the life of Lightning McQueen. They range from Mater being a fire truck, to a monster truck, to a stunt car, to even being a bull-fighter, except fighting tractors instead of bulls. Each episode is stand-alone, and all are equally good.

In addition to the screenwriter's comments and directions, you usually get several scenes that were cut from the finished movie as well as occasional odd little changes in dialogue sprinkled throughout and an overall peek at some aspects of the creative process that a film goes through from inception to completion. Unfortunately, that's not the case with this book, since the four \\"screenplays\\" included are merely transcriptions from the finished films. VCRs were generally available when this book was first published in '82, so even back then this book was a pointless rip-off. Watch the films, skip the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice speakers but can you actually get them from Amazon?","review":"These speakers are pretty nice. They are clean, attractive and yield very well defined sound. In fact, for the price that I paid for them, they are quite extraordinary speakers. However, beware purchasing them from Amazon especially with the \\"in stock soon\\" qualification. I ordered similar speakers from Amazon and they never got them in (after months of insisting that they would be available soon.) I ended up getting these speakers for much less elsewhere and, while I'm very happy with them, I'd be very hesitant about buying them here without guaranteed delivery. Basically, the speakers are nice, but Amazon has some delivery issues regarding this brand. Do NOT get in line unless you're prepared to be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you just need head phones","review":"The item did not work with my T-mobile MDA except in one ear bud.

The worst part is that once correctly installed it had resource conflicts with my display adapter and my printer. I was unable to resolve either of these conflicts with this card installed. When I had this card installed my display would only work at its lowest resolution size and on only 4 colors. The printer was also completely non-functional with this card installed. Once I removed this card and its drivers, I was able to restore my PC back to it's previous functionality, but a frustrating experience for sure.Since I was unable to use this card in my Windows PC, I thought I'd try it in my SUSE Linux machine, but was unable to get it installed and working in that system.

If I could, I would give it zero stars. A beautiful woman and a beautiful man fall in love. Been there, done that, too easy. I liked Michael when he said he usually didn't fall for a woman based on her looks, but the author kept harping on Emma's fabulous beauty. And, Michael fell for her beauty anyway. True beauty comes from within, and Emma was a pain in the you-know-where, no inner beauty. With her bad attitude I couldn't believe that Emma was the great teacher and writer that her creator claimed. The magic was boring and there wasn't much kissing, either. And the big build up to a love scene that never happened? That's okay, I didn't like Emma or Michael enough to care. I've read mystery novels that had better love stories than this. I'll stick to whodunnits."},{"rating":"1","title":"thoroughly disappointed","review":"I thought this book had a really great premise. But, I wasn't into the book very far when I began to jump ahead looking for the romance. I thought the idea of the Professors Lost and Found was tremendous, but, for me, it never panned out. Out heroine spent more time with her cat and more pages were devoted to it than to Michael. I realize Emma was afraid to risk kissing, but on the whole, I was really disappointed. I felt the book could have been a whole lot better. I just didn't like it. Of course, that is just my opinion, but I feel the author squandered a really good plot by not devoting a little more attention to the romance between the lead characters. I realize not every romance has to be filled with a lot of overt passion to be a good book, but after reading this, I sort of feel like I read a book about witches and magic with a little(very little!) romance thrown in."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad product","review":"did not and still does not work. changed batteries several times but still no life. do not waste your money/."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect, simple","review":"With Amazon Prime , I ordered a few of these just before a trip out of town to set a few lamps on timers.

The first one I bought died within a few months of purchase and Target would not replace it.

When it works, it gets the job done, but don't count on it if you're going away for an extended period of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some of Them Tend to Stop Working But...","review":"I purchased two of these at the same time 4 years ago. The irony is one of them stopped working after 1-2 years (as the other negative reviews state) but the other one is still working to this day.This timer uses an internal battery (which is why it keeps the time and your settings when you unplug it).It likely stops working because the internal battery has died. You can probably open the screws on the back and buy a replacement battery at Radio Shack or the Wal-Mart.OVERALL RECOMMENDATION: On the whole, I would recommend this timer simply because of its ease of use. The price is reasonable for 1-2 years or 4+ years of service. I have tried other brands and they are too complicated to use (change the time) on a daily bases. I really like the simplicity of this timer. It's as easy as setting an alarm clock."},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally EASY!","review":"I love things that simplify my hectic life and this great little timer does just that - plug it in, set the time you want power on, set the time you want power off and you are done in less than 2 minutes!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Timer","review":"Works great for turning a light off and on at exact times.

I ordered two and only one worked. Amazon accepted my return and shipped a new one and the new one worked great. Both are still working today. I use them for Xmas light timer. I love the simplified display and the fact that it doesn't overwhelm you with unnecessary options (like setting by day of the week or multiple activations in a single day, etc). If you are just looking to use this for something as straight forward as a timer for your Xmas lights, I would highly recommend.

I don't think I was asking this little timer to work very hard. One day, it just stopped working.

They all died within a few months of use.This is junk. Don't buy it.Instead, I recommend that you consider one of the Leviton Plug-in Timers, which do have batteries that allow you to program the unit without having to sit next to an outlet and which retains the time even when you unplug it.

Slowly, the problem got worse, to the point where it would freeze at least once a day. (Note: I have years of experience working with computers as a hardware guy for several companies...never have I had this many problems with a computer).When I contacted the company, they said I could ship it back to them at my expense, at it would take 3 to 4 weeks to get it back. Considering companies like Dell or Toshiba can fix their computers in under a week, this is wayyyy too long.Overall, the computer feels a little flimsy.

I use the bag to carry a B flat, a flugelhorn, and a piccolo with no difficulty at all. If you are hoping to carry, for example, a B flat, a C, and a flugelhorn, it might not work as well. A three mouthpiece pouch was included. Side and end pockets provide ample space for mouthpieces, spare lead pipe, valve oil, cleaning cloths, music and notes and other miscellaneous items. The mute bag is spacious and easily attaches and detaches. I use it for three mutes, plunger, and trumpet stand, with room to spare. The bag appears to be made of durable material, and the shoulder strap seems substantial. The bag is well padded. When loaded, the bag is bulky, but far less bulky than carrying three separate cases.

For one of us in the group, Chapter four \\"pulled everything together for him\\" though he had become a Christian many years before. I felt I was seeing the Spirit filling him completely in the group meeting after he read that chapter. No one had ever seen him so spirit-empowered before. The next day, his plane went down and he was killed. The Bible says that God knows the number of days in our lives.

The bowls with the simple green edge look really pretty. I just bought my second set on Amazon with a bonus set of 4 smaller bowls (plain white). It arrived in perfect condition.We debated initially whether to buy the heavier Corelle Ultra line, but I actually prefer the lightness of these dishes; unlike cookware, where heavier usually means better,I think light works fine for dinnerware.

The songs were composed with the bedroom in mind-- but alas, the lyrics fall far short of romanticism or eroticism. They are actually cringe-inducing at points. Valor's insistence in singing in the lower registers, a la Barry White, have his vocals out of his range. He ends up growling rather than singing many of the notes. His normal vocal style is lounge singer (Holiday Inn?) When co-vocalist Carol Williams comes on, her voice sounds so clear and her tone is so beautiful that the listener regrets what the album could have been. The instrumentation and arrangements are quite good at times-- \\"Love Has Come My Way\\" is actually a solid composition whose lyrics and male vocals spoil. \\"Dame Esa Cosa\\" is the other extended song, and because it is largely instrumental, it fares best. It is more jungle-oriented than the traditional orchestral disco of the other tracks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Room for improvement","review":"I also have this DVD set and think that too much time was spent on the interface.

In fact I'd almost NOT suggest letting little children read them. The stories are short and truely frightening. The only suggestion that I have is that you do actually read the books. I have yet to hear the audio CD but I intend to get it in the near future just to have on hand. The reason for this is the pictures. The drawings done for these books are utterly horrifying. In 15 years I STILL have trouble looking at some of them. And better yet, they are burned into my memory. If your a parent, I'd suggest flipping through the pages first to see if you're okay with the stories themselves...but the pictures as well (as the pictures can really pack a punch, nightmares all around)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ruined Without Gammell's Illustrations","review":"Who's wretched idea was it to remove the beautiful, terrifying artwork by Stephen Gammell and replace it with this bland, cutesy nonsense? Way to ruin the entire series. I grew up on these books, and Gammell's art literally MADE the tales. Even as an adult, there's no comparison between the original illustrations and Brett Helquist's dreadful new replacements. Gammell's work was and is terrifying, inhabited as it is by strange beings, sinister shadows, and weird tree roots. Helquist's work, on the other hand, looks like something off a cheap Halloween card.Go out of your way to buy the real, authentic \\"Scary Stories\\" with Gammell's classic illustrations, and avoid this horrible update like the plague. Maybe if enough people voice their displeasure the publishers will bring back the classic \\"Scary Stories\\" and quit trying to ruin a classic with their needless tampering."},{"rating":"2","title":"Original books but smaller sized copies","review":"I was relieved that these are actually the original books with original art work -but- the books are physically smaller than the originals I had a kid.

Get the Scary Stories Treasury instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"The artwork made it","review":"Whenever you mention Scary Stories, the consensus among anyone who has ever read them is that the art made everything. The stories were decent, but the art with them is what made the stories stick in your mind.Why the publishers would remove the most memorable part of a book makes no sense to me. The new art looks like Harry Potter artwork, which would be fine if Hogwarts was somehow terrifying."},{"rating":"1","title":"sad","review":"The original illustrations are why I sought these books out for my kids. When I read these growing up, they creeped me out even more by the artwork. Now it's as if I'm reading Harry Potter. Not to say that that's bad, but it's supposed to be \\"SCARY STORIES\\" PEOPLE!

My favorite stories are: \\"Room for One More,\\" \\"Harold,\\" the one where the lady steals a liver from a dead body to feed her husband--only to have the body pay a visit to find it's lost organ, and the story of the woman who dies of the plague while staying in a hotel. (This is not meant to slag any of the other stories) However, since I have yet to purchase this box set, I can only hope they're included.The \\"Scary Stories\\" series came to my mind a week ago when I was trying to sleep, and I had to turn the lights on when I remembered the details of the stories. Mind you, I'm 19! Nothing--not Stephen King or Dean Koontz--has ever scared me so much. \\"Harold\\" has to be my favorite story of all.These book taught me the power of words and to appreciate classic horror, at an early age.

My younger sisters, brother, and I would listen to it over and over again until we could recite the stories by heart. Sadly, we lost our cassette tape a few years ago. I have been looking for a replacement ever since and was more than happy to find all three books on audio CD read by the same man on Amazon. However, this product does not come as pictured with a gravestone on the cover, it will look like the customer-added picture instead.

Definitely not the case, in fact you sit there wondering how they could end these stories like they do. I mean you're waiting for the conclusion but it never comes. They start the next story and you're sitting there like what the heck? There were a couple of good stories but the group I was with ended up laughing because they couldn't believe we were actually listening to these. Get it for the children but spare the adults. The stories are just too shallow for adults to enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tales from the Crypt Scary","review":"These are great sitting around a campfire kind of stories (which is where I read them), but I can't say that I would actually just sit and read them.

I read them as a child and bought this boxed set for my kids. I thought they just had a random artist illustrate the box they put them in as you cannot see the books themselves. I didn't bother reading customer reviews because I knew it was the correct author and I never fathomed that they could alter a book in such an extreme downgraded fashion. I was very disappointed and had to purchase the original works on Ebay.Why on earth would they stop printing the originals?

The new art style is bland and lacks the unique flavor of Gammell's talent.Stay away from this set and find a copy of the originals!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If it isn't broke, don't fix it!","review":"These series of books have a classic collection of horror folk and urban legend stories and have been around for over a decade. I have fond memories from reading these stories as a child. But what put these books over the top was the original disturbing artwork by Steven Gammell, which is sadly no longer present in these new editions and needs to be brought back. Replacing the classic illustrations was a very dumb move on the part of the publisher. If you can, track down the older editions with Gammell's illustrations they are well worth it and vastly superior. They are no longer in print, but copies are still plentiful and not too hard to come by."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Gammell = No Sale.","review":"Stephen Gammell's original art was a large reason why these books were forever ingrained in the memories of readers. Replacing them with Brett Helquist's milquetoast revisions is yet another sad instance of tactless PC whiners tromping all over someone else's hard work. Don't waste a penny on this useless re-release."},{"rating":"1","title":"Epic Fail","review":"Just going to echo the sentiments of several reviewers here. Replacing Gammell's original haunting artwork with this super generic and quite childish style is a huge mistake by the publisher. Gammell's incredibly dark and often disturbing artwork made every story that much more effective. The good stories like Harold were amplified to a very high level, and the bland stories were still super effective simply because of Gammell's illustration. Now we have generic drawings with no soul or atmosphere coupled with mostly average stories. Go with the original set of books instead of this crap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scary Stories to Tell In The Dark Audio CD Collection Review","review":"These three CDs are fun to listen to.

But if I can find a good one, then I will read it. I read these as a child, and I still have nightmares about one of the illustrations.

So when I ordered the six-pack of them here, I expected them to taste just as good. That was not the case at all. The outside of each package was sticky but that didnt bother me much. What bothered me is that the actual product itself was stale. Each piece (in 4 of the 6 bags I opened) was rubbery. Chewing the Crunchies only compressed it into a solid wad of what then seemed like hard plastic. The result was something that simply could not be broken up and swallowed. I also noticed that the built-in ziplock seal didnt work on these bags. After 4 bags, I tossed out the rest and contacted the manufacturer via email (twice). I never received a reply. I think the Crunchies people are selling Amazon bad batches. Avoid these at all cost!"},{"rating":"2","title":"love them","review":"these are so good!

I opened the first bag and handed these out to my coworkers to ensure it was not just me, but there is unanimous agreement, terrible and NOT crunchie, as the namesake suggests. The texture is like rubbery styrofoam. The only thing I can say is these are yucky rubbery artificial-like taste. Maybe it is freeze-dried strawberries that just taste like this, but I will not be ordering freeze-dried strawberry anything after getting a taste of these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"I wanted to like these and was excited to get them at a good price here.

The consistency is very good and it is definitely crunchy. But to me, the flavor was a little bit off. I mean it didn't taste like natural pineapple. The package states that the only ingredient is \\"pineapple,\\" so I can't figure out why the taste is slightly off. I opened a second package and tried it, but it was the same.

There is a slow persistent tabla rhythm which is helpful in relaxing the thinking mind, with just enough zither to add interest without distracting.

As I said, I have three of these clocks, and none of them agree exactly on the indoor or outdoor temperature. Assuming that the clock with the median temperature is accurate, I have one clock that always shows temps about 1.0 degrees colder, and I have another clock that shows temps about 2.5 degrees warmer. Now, a 1.0 or 2.5 degree difference may not be much, but that means there's a 3.5 degree difference between two of my clocks.I still think these clocks are great for the average home user, and I would buy another one immediately if one broke, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone needing a truly accurate temperature reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"great idea if it worked","review":"piece of junk, save your money, outside temp sensor failed in a few months and still haven't heard from Lacrosse after repeated attempts, I'll try another brand as this was my second clock from Lacrosse with same problem, I should have learned my lesson when they didn't respond about the first clock."},{"rating":"1","title":"Temp sender failure","review":"The temperature sender failed within 2 months.

WAIT 12 HOURS for the system to set itself and synchronize.If the two temps are not within 0.5 degrees once the system synchronizes, you have a faulty remote sensor.

We had a good talk. She knows a lot about music and can play and sing really well. She had a little group of die hard fans. Back then she was doing just voice and piano. She was a little raw and a little like Tori Amos. Now she has a full band and the sound is more complex. I like songs like \\"Drip\\" and \\"Little Universe.\\" This album has hope and passion all through it. It is a little more experimental too. Charlotte Martin hasn't really been conservative at all.

I've seen them live, too. I'm suprised they realize their playing a rock show the way they strut the stage as if it were a runway.

I switched the Ethernet cable and tested it by visiting a few websites, printing to an appletalk laser printer, and copying files to and from a local Leopard server. I'm not going to run any benchmarks, but I will say I could use this as my everyday NIC if the built-in Ethernet port stopped working.

The PC was slimline and putting another internal NIC posed two problems: finding a low-profile one and finding someone in the office that was willing to install it. Therefore the USB NIC was a great choice.Being USB, it is very easy to install. Drivers also installed quickly. Knowing a little about networking does help, as we did have to program a static IP to this device. Once it was physically connected, I used a remote software to connect to the PC and was able to set the IP.The PC now runs on the internal NIC to our network and an external device plugs direct into the USB NIC. It works great and we have had no interrupt in connection.I would also recommend this product for home use as well. If your network card stops working, installing the USB is very user-friendly, definitely more than opening the computer itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product - Easy Install - Works Great!","review":"I originally ordered two of these (a long time ago) to use with my old Tivo Series 2 DVRs to network them since they didn't have a built-in ethernet port (crazy, I know).They worked GREAT for that, so recently when I needed one for a desktop computer with a fried ethernet port I came right back to the trendnet USB adapter.I hadn't used trendnet much befor these, but based on the quality and reliability of these adapters I'll definitely give them a shot in the future on other products.The adapter was easy to install with the computer -- simply put in the included driver disc and it installed the needed drivers and I was up and going within minutes!No problems, no failures so far -- it just worked!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not Work With HP Envy","review":"Bought it to replace lost HP Envy 'dongle' RJ to USB plug.

She had gotten a computer virus, so I decided to just restore to an earlier date. HP provides a 'Restore Client PC' CD for this. The problem was her computer has Vista 64 OS, and the restore software could not find the built-in Ethernet port. The restore CD is 32 bit, so the 64 bit drivers didn't work. I fussed with trying to locate 32bit drivers, to no avail.So, I bought this. Installed the drivers on a USB thumb drive, plugged it in and 5 minutes later I was restoring.

The author presents a compendium of Oriental terminology employed by Byron in his tales; he discusses rather skillfully the meanings, the Eastern literary significance, and Byron's use of Oriental terms related to Eastern sites, architecture, flora and funa, titles and names, customs and costumes, and themes.

I used both of these sets and there main drawback was the weight. I then found out about the V18 set by milwaukee. Its lighter than the other sets but plenty powerful. I have used the drill to hang sheetrock and drive lag screws into 4x6's. The trim saw will cut through 2x4's and never show sign of slowing down. The sawzall is the best cordless I've ever used.

I am hestiant to order things like this online becuase I have found that many times the quality of the product is not nearly as good as it is shown in the photo. This was a whole different experience. I found the skirt to be nice quality, no tatters, no strings hanging and the poodle and sequins were well adhered to the skirt. My daughter is extremely petite and I ordered a size xtra small. The shirt is a perfect fit and the skirt was a tiny bit too big in the waist, but I attribute that more to her being smaller than the average size 4-6. The shirts sequined collar and sleeves are well sewn and really added a little extra something! I think the scarf is probably better used and a neck scarf and not a head scarf due to the length. Overall, I am very pleased with the outfit and would recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"too small!","review":"The reviews I read were correct.. the top on this is so small, my daughter could barely get it on and it hurt her in the armholes because it was so tight.The poodle on the skirt was a felt piece that was falling off..

He is honest and believable in his story telling; however his American co-author's role as writter is average.What is so important to me is a perspective from a former and current resident of Iraq.

However, the title of his book is misleading in a sense that there are barely any secrets revealled. Moreover it was baddely written in the sense of the abcense of a line or story, let stay beggining or end! The main bulk of the book is spent bij the author on telling how great and wonderfull he thinks he was, and letting repeatidly know who the very best pilot in the Iraqi airforse was! the rest of the book was spent on re- repeating his interpretations and own jugments on the regime and juging other people in the regime, but facts and secrets I did not read."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to believe","review":"I really wanted to believe the information that an insider would share that others might not know, but I'm very disappointed. While General Sada is clearly a brave man, this book was 90% Jim Nelson Black and 10% General Sada. The language attributed to General Sada includes tons and tons of American language quirks, slang and idioms that are simply not used by anyone who has spent the majority of their life in the Mideast. This won't be recognized by the vast majority of people who have never travelled, many of which don't realize that there are very definite American language traits that are not understood by non-Americans. Unfortunately, this severely hurts the credibility of an otherwise excellent book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most are missing the obvious","review":"So far, other reviewers, including those who see through Sada's sham, seem to be missing the salient point. When I saw the interview on the Daly Show, I immediately thought, why isn't Fox News and, more importantly, the Bush administration all over this? His claim that WMD existed and were hidden in Syria is major news. Do you really think that Sada, who claims to be a top official in the new Iraqi government, would sit on information like this for three years waiting to reveal it in a book? Don't you think he would have long since revealed it to the Iraqi and U.S. governments. If there were anything to this, it would be all Bush would be talking about instead of blaming the lack of WMD on faulty intelligent.

You can make your own settings, but you'll have to read through the brochure for at least 15 minutes before you've really got an idea about what's going on.This thing has been pretty sturdy for me, no problems with reliability.

First of all I had trouble getting the batteries that are included with the speakers in (I also later discovered that regular AA batteries don't fit, you have to get ones that are shorter just for the speakers). The sound is OK, nothing marvelous but fair enough for the price.Then about 20 days after I got them, after I had only used them maybe 4 times, when I turned them on they produced hardly any sound at all. There is no volume adjustment on the speakers which was annoying as I had my CD player volume all the way up, which coming out of anything other than these speakers would be way too loud.Maybe my speakers were defective but I wasn't happy enough with them to get a replacement, I'm spending my money on something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible sound for the price; bad interior design","review":"I am really not impressed with this product, esp. when you factor in the price. The sound is highly distorted at high volume and at regular volume, it sounds like my old transistor radio. I get better sound out of my [cheaper] speakers.As another reviewer mentioned, parts of the interior are exposed, which doesn't make much sense, and the batteries are very tricky to get in (and shouldn't battery insertion be a no-brainer??) The batteries are also very susceptible to being knocked around, they do not sit securely in their sockets.Overall, considering this system is 2 to 3 times what I would have paid for other speakers, I'm returning these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Sound - No volume control","review":"I've been looking for a set of battery powered portable speakers for some time now.

It was the first album I had heard by Timewriter, and since then, I have listened to this rest. I still think this album is the best by far. Early on in this album, the mixture of different styles (seems like a mix of deep/tech/prog house) flow wonderfully and keep the energy up in the album. At about the 40 minute mark, he slows it down into some nice deep house with tracks like mary's wisdom and night train, two of my favorites on the album.

Dick Irvin is a kind, gentlemanly figure who avoids any attempt at contraversy in his writings. This book is on one hand a refreshing escape from the \\"tell all\\" books that aim to rip the halo from its heroes; on the other hand, it is a santitized look at the past which skirts a number of harsh issues and unsavoury incidents. As one who remembers as a lad watching the Rocket on tv, it is like sitting down with a friend as he reminisces about your youth and the people you knew.

It undertakes to provide the history of the herbs to include, but not limited to, historical occult practice application (i.e., Sage, St. John's Wort) of some of the herbs. The coverage of the supplemental herb segments is too generic rendering the information of limited practical value. The book's herb toxicological approach is very limited and a much better (albeit less expensive) text dedicated to herb information is to be found in the PDR specialty textbook on herbs. In addition, the textbook's approach to vitamins and minerals is found to be deficient falling far behind the available PDR textbook on vitamins, minerals, and supplements."},{"rating":"2","title":"review for HBR on Breakthrough Thinking","review":"Before reading this book, I thought I was very good at analyzing issues.

Many commercial gums that are advertised as containing xylitol also contain unnatural, chemical sweeteners. The flavor and soft texture lasts very well in the peppermint and fruit flavors. Another family member really enjoys the licorice one. The chocolate has a disappointing flavor, and the cinnamon, which to me tastes like almond at first, quickly gets hard and loses flavor.

I ended up throwing out the solar piece and leaving the resin insert in the bottom(in the winter, you can't use the solar panel when the temperature is below freezing)year round, to use as a regular bird bath. Whatever the inside of the bath was coated with, degraded and was floating in the water every time I cleaned it out, even though I followed manufacturer's guidelines for cleaning.

By the time they got back to me and apologized for not contacting me right away (because their web site was under construction!!!), the basin got cracked as well and started leaking water.

There's not enough truly indepth and 3d specific stuff that cant befound anywhere else. For example, Birn spends about two pages explaining how to fake global illumination through setting up extra lights that simulate the effect of lights bounced off surfaces. That alone should have been a whole chapter.

Having to navigate intersecting and overlapping sense of responsibility, justice, and commitment, Lafiel and Jinto discover what is truly important to them.Both the Crest of the Stars and Banner of the Stars series are, in my opinion, anime sci-fi gems.

It is impossible to permanently take out any of your opponents. Whether it's a security guard or a surveillance camera, you can only temporarily knock it out. After a couple minutes they wake up and sound an alarm. Tell me, exactly how does a video camera magically fix itself after you zap it out of commission? This makes for extremely frustrating gameplay as you try to figure out what to do and where to go. The enemies always \\"respawn\\" but your ammo does not. I enjoy puzzles, but not when you're constantly being bothered by enemies you already took out. This pretty much ruined the entire game for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"It stole minutes of my life","review":"Like all the other reviews said, this game is the worst covert game you can get.

Contrary to the blurb, Brendan Coyle does not appear in this season. Be prepared to feel disappointed. The high production standard is generally maintained but the writer and director were hamstrung by the BBCs desire to dump the show as soon as possible.

The music is pure Franky and Annette at the beach and the long shots of bikes riding through the hills of California are just beautiful. And how can you really ruin a cannibalism story.

There are a few downsides to the cd though I must admit. Because it swings back & forth its hard to get a general feel for the direction of the cd and a few songs kinda drivel after a while. But that doesnt make it any weaker of a cd. I was pleasently surprised to find it. Sadlythough it has no samples to listen to...Fans of electro/gothic music should check it out otherwise avoid it and try something more mainstream."},{"rating":"1","title":"rhythms and ballads of broadway johnny mathis","review":"This CD is a sheer waste of time and money.

Not enough is explained for those of us reformed Luddites who need to be hand-held in these matters. I shall try elsewhere.

I mean, sometimes he would bring up something tantalizing, something ripe for expansion and then let it drop. and then other times he would go into detail that had me wondering if even HE knew what he was saying.for a much better read with lots of great images, i highly recommend 'turbulent mirror' its a necessity for those curious is fractals and chaos."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated, mannerist singer","review":"Most of the tunes come from great films and / or the Great American Songbook. Andy's light hued voice is quite pleasant, but his terrible way with singing is not. Why does he have to put it on so? \\"Michelle\\" is plainly embarrassing, \\"Bye Bye Blues\\", an almost plaster cast from Bert Kaempfert's great recording, finds Williams swooping up the word \\"blues\\" for no apparent reason at all and so I could go on. I stopped buying Williams CDs after this one because of the irritating mannerisms that mar his singing to such an extent that most offerings become unlistenable. \\"Yesterday\\" is one fortunate exception, but not enough not to incur my wrath."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Treasure for Leonard Cohen Fans","review":"Aside from this soundtrack is the film which features most of these songs being performed at an Australian tribute concert. That unto itself may be a better buy when the time comes, as it hopefully will have extra performances available, not to mention the visual joy of watching Rufus and Martha Wainwright, Jarvis Cocker, Antony, Nick Cave and the rest dig into Cohen's brilliant and immensely poetic words. Like Bob Dylan, Cohen's canon is so great that a multitude of artists can recreate it's parts and reveal the depths of the song and themselves...I don't know why Rufus Wainwright's Hallelujah performance isn't here, and Famous Blue Raincoat, The Guests, and if memory serves, Bird on a Wire weren't in the theatrical release of the film. A great album, but I still hope for a fully loaded DVD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip This One","review":"Give this a pass and pick up Jennifer Warnes' Famous Blue Raincoat instead. One listen to Stevie Ray and Robben Ford on \\"First We'll Take Manhattan\\" and Warnes' exquisite rendition of the title song will make you forget this mish mash entirely."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a shame!","review":"Every rendition on this CD except the last one is horrible. It is a huge mistake on anyone's part to attempt to give new interpretations to these songs, because without Cohen's deep voice and boundless spirituality, these songs would be just words+melodies instead of poetry. Rufus Wainwright's voice is particularly disturbing."},{"rating":"1","title":"fine songs, not-so-fine singers","review":"This seems like the comic-book version of a classic. There is a handful of honest covers of Leonard Cohen's songs out there, but none of them is on this CD. If it's really necessary for you to hear an \\"interpretation\\" of the original reality, try Jeff Buckley's \\"Hallelujah,\\" Jennifer Warnes' \\"Joan of Arc,\\" or (yes!) Joe Cocker's \\"Bird on a Wire.\\" With one or two exceptions--like the McGarrigles--the singers here are bland, tuneless hacks hitching a ride on songs they don't even understand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cohen Fete","review":"I am a great fan of Cohen's music and voice (less so of the man) and have many of his albums. Despite that fact, after seeing the movie \\"I'm Your Man,\\" I had to have this album as well. Consisting of Cohen's songs sung by others, including several members of the Wainwright/McGarrigle family, the soundtrack was superb. I'd never heard of Antony before but am hooked on his version of \\"If It Be Your Will.\\" The only disappointment was that the album did not include the soul-melting rendition of \\"1000 Kisses Deep\\" that was in the movie. The least appealing song was \\"Tower of Song,\\" the only song sung by Cohen (w/ U2), but it is one of my least favorites."},{"rating":"1","title":"Key track missing","review":"Having watched the documentary, I purchased the CD. However the key track, 'Hallelujah' was not on it! I am very disappointed, as I regarded that as the peak of the experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Movie in uneven, so is music","review":"Just came home from seeing the movie. A little too long and some performances were painful (anthony for one) to watch. I agree with those who wish different performers had done the songs... tho I have always been a McGarrigle sisters fan.Strangely, Hallelujah is not on this cd, tho in the movie and one of the most moving performances I thought.. Wonder why it was omitted???Stiil over all, it is Leanard Cohen music and that is always special. I liked his closing number with U2 and I think he did too....The only drawback to the cd is that the film gives a context to nearly all songs and they flow out of a narrative. That won't be evident on the cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Listen to Cohen himself!","review":"It was irritating to hear the singers butcher Cohen's poetic songs. Like other reviewers I wonder why Bono had to be there? It was nice that the singers paid a tribute to the man but it's unfortunate that they took it one step further by singing his songs. Some of the renditions are simply BAD ... like Bird on a wire!

What a rare gem we have in Leonard Cohen and his incredible prose set to wonderful music. Whomever did the arrangements make all the songs sound as if they were just written. Only genius songs can posses this timelessness. Leonard Cohen's already powerful lyrics are further elevated by all the incredible artists that turned out to interpret some of his great works.The only flaw with this soundtrack is that it leaves out some of the songs in the DVD concert. And likewise there are gems on the soundtrack that were not on the DVD. Standouts are the showstopping \\"If It Be Your Will\\" by Antony, \\"Bird On A Wire\\", and \\"Ring The Bells\\". But the entire concert is a joy to discover if you aren't familiar with Mr. Cohen.

The foam is coated in a very slick, slippery coating that makes sitting up difficult for my daughter, and the dip in the back of the seat is very shallow.

He loves the toy. The tray is a must, it helps hold him in. I have tried to use the chair without the tray, but he is able to stretch himself out of the chair.

Her back is very curved, and she is looking at the floor all the time. She is also touching the floor all the time (what a mess!). It is difficult to feed her. Also, my baby felt very trapped and did not enjoy sitting in the bebepod. The only nice thing about this product is the toy that comes with it.

I found some parts of the build to be rather tricky, like soldering the rotary switches and 16-pin IC socket, but it was definitely worth the time and effort, and this is probably the cheapest function generator you can find anywhere - a whole order of magnitude less expensive than the simplest prefabricated one.

The story is fascinating, about a woman who has a rememberance of being a Cathar during the 1300's. Unfortunately, the writing style is so poor that the story is all but lost and the reader spends much time just trying to remember who all the characters are.

After about a month of cloudy water, (even with a filter rated at 100 gallons) I was ready to tear it down, get rid of the sand and start over. My wife suggested I take this filter off my tall tank and try it on the sand tank. I tried it and in 2 days the water was clear! I bought a second one on amazon for $60. (A bargin) The polishing filter is amazing! The best part is you can rinse it, soak it in some bleach water, rinse it REALLY well and reuse it!

My tank cannot be full enough to prevent this since it has turtles and not just fist. Also the inlet does not go low enough for my tastes. Once I walked into the room and my turtle had knocked the inlet cover off and was stuck to the tube. Luckly I found him. I am working on rigging something up to relieve these issues as I am unable to find offical extender tubes for either inlet or outlet. Over all it works great and does what it is designed for.

Unfortunately I found out the hard way, because I learned only after I've purchased one. After 2 hours of inspecting every single o-ring, and filter component and trying to get it to pump correctly I've given up.

This CD is in the wrong category if you a country fan don't be fooled. This CD is hip hop rap. Young night clubbers hate his music or else he'd be on the rap charts. People buy Country to stay clear of rap.If he had a nice voice, and actually sang country music I would might enjoy his music.He obviously isn't talented enough to make it in the rap world, so Country is his gimic, to be famous for being the only Country rapper.

Country rap? Come on, if this guy was put in a room with 50cent and P-Diddy he would be beaten lifeless for humiliating the rap industry. There is no room in American music for country rap and because of that Cowboy Troy will be all but forgotten by next year, or maybe next month. This C.D. is a joke. Don't waste your money, I already wasted 5 minutes of my life listening to this awful excuse for music. It is so hokey that you think you are listening to something on Sesame Street and you expect to hear Bert singing about his rubber ducky. Actually, I would prefer that. I only gave this one star because that's a low as I could go. It doesn't even deserve 1 star."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\u0010The Worst Thing I've Ever Heard","review":"This is by far the worst thing I've ever heard. The problem with this music is not that it mixes two opposing genres, but that it is horrible. The elements of rap are bad and so are those of country, so it isn't a surprise that Country Troy's hybrid is exponentially bad. The rap, at it's best, sounds like a dumbed-down sketch comedy version of L.L. Cool J if he were raised by white trash. Save your money and save your ears."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tiresome","review":"New? Kid Rock has been doing this for what, a decade?Now all of a sudden it's new? Why, because he's black?So what!

Seriously Troy, you sound like a cross between Sir Mix A-Lot and Vanilla Ice. Buddy, give it up, this album is total garbage. I listened to the first clip and could barely contain my laughter. It's sad that there are people out there who 1, actually bought this and 2, actually ENJOYED listening to it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A very appealing record","review":"Cowboy Troy does not try to stay true to either the traditional country motif, nor the traditional country norms. In fact, being black makes this very attempt a stray from the norm. This takes nothing from the quality, or genuiety of his music. Honestly Cowboy Troy just may be the symptom of a changing age when our past prejudices are disappearing. As a black man, and country music fan I find Troy's music good not because he is black, but because it is slick, different, and rip-roarin' fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"This is complete garbage. Who exactly are they trying to appeal to? No self-respecting hardcore country or rap fan would even consider this garbage.

Please do not buy this (...) and support anymore of this socalled music so that it will stop being made."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of my time","review":"I love Big n Rich, so when I saw that Cowboy Troy had a CD I was so excited. Well, thank goodness I decided to check it out from my library instead of shelling out the cash to buy it. This is without a doubt the worst country cd I have ever heard in my life! Troy seems to think that a heavy beat will distract people from the fact that his lyrics are pitifully weak. Do we really need an entire song about going to the bar and having a crick in your neck? Please. Most of the refrains were repeated to the point of teeth-on-edge inanity. The only song that was even close to being halfway decent was \\"If You Don't Wanna Love Me\\" with Sarah Buxton. Troy, either get yourself a decent song writer, or go back to guest starring on Big n Rich's stuff. For the rest of you, don't bother buying, rent it from somewhere or borrow it from a friend."},{"rating":"2","title":"A strong album; if you like it, you'll really like it!","review":"Cowboy Troy's CD is something I haven't heard in a good time - a strong record. Remember records? They had them before online downloads, back before every CD you bought had the single and 9 weak filler songs on it. There's a lot of cool, funky, interesting songs on this CD. They've got stories in 'em, and you might even want to hear again. What makes it a great record isn't that Cowboy Troy puts country, rap, and hard rock together, it's that he puts them all on top of songs that are, well, good. Some of the best songs on it are the laid back ones, like Sarah Buxton guesting on the country-Dido-esque \\"If you don't wanna love me\\" and \\"Automatic\\", but he can kick it up too, like on \\"Chicken with a Train\\" and \\"Beast on the Mic\\".If you're a purist or a hater you won't like it, but if you're not afraid to hit on the raver chick when you're wearing cowboy boots, you're gonna like it; hick hop is a lot of fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome for kids with tubes!","review":"Weather your kid had tubes in one ear or both, this product is awesome.

In addition, the cd that came with the book that had a 120 day free trial version required a 25 character id/password, which was not supplied by the book.

Unfortunately I cannot recommend it, as it was full of errors, which the accompanying website does nothing to correct. It simply skims over the surface of what you need to know as a DBA, omitting important details which a serious DBA should be aware of. A developer who's never used SQL Server might find this of passing interest to get an overview, but don't be lulled into thinking that you'll be even partly useful as a SQL Server DBA after reading this - you won't. It's way too lightweight to recommend as a serious publication - and why it covers triggers by part 3 is anyone's guess.I'd more strongly recommend something like the SAMS 'Teach Yourself SQL Server 2000 in 21 Days' book, which is definitely much better value for money if you're serious and much better than the online SQL Server documentation for beginners.

It does not specify the size, but great that they say it's 100% natural.So, it smells bad and looks very small, but my dog loves it! Maybe it's just small for my 100 lbs Cane Corso... On the back of the pack it says to give 2-3 stix a day for dogs that size. Each stick is about 5 in long and 1/2 in diameter. They are very hard, but my dog does not have any problems chewing it. It goes away in about 1 min. When he fells that he is going to get it, he starts \\"dancing\\".I cannot say anything about its function, my dog only got stix few times.

When the treats stopped coming, my dog whined and put on a show of such pitiable neediness, that I had to do something to quiet her down. I remembered that the ingredients in her Dental Stix were healthful and not likely to hurt her weight loss program a bit.

The voice-recognition software kept getting everything wrong, however, and when I performed a sound-quality check the Dragon software gave it an \\"unacceptable\\" rating. I am returning this to the store.However, it is lightweight and comfortable as compared to those big over-the-ear headphones. It also has a much more low-profile look than those larger headsets.

I work out of my home making phone calls, so it's important that I can be heard, and that the quality is good. The first day I used the headset, it worked fine. Today is the second day, and I could barely get the mike to pick up my voice. I could get it to a level where someone would have to strain to hear me, but only by actually touching the mike to my lips, and then you get the pops and crackles on your p's and s's.

When they work they work fine you just have to be smart enough to calibrate a microphone. But the first time you roll over the 20 foot cord, there done.

If you are looking for a headset for the purpose of on-line communication, I think you will be pleased with the value and functionality. The microphone is very good, and the headset is rather comfortable and light. However, if you plan on using this headset for gaming or listening to music, I would not recommend it.

However, after about two weeks, it started to act up, by this I mean it would stop working and start again.

I've been extremely pleased with both. The light weight makes them comfortable for several hours of use (I've gone a good five or six hours without taking them off -- and not feeling like I needed to) and the flexible boom mic stays out of the way, yet picks up my voice without me needing to talk any louder than a normal speaking volume. I've traveled with these with no problem, and the inline mute/volume has been a lifesaver on many podcasts.The foam earpieces are essential but have worn away and fallen off, after which the headphones are understandably no longer comfortable to wear. I'd like to buy replacement foam pads, but they're not available. That's truly my only negative to an excellent value and some comfortable, reliable tech."},{"rating":"1","title":"very uncomfortable","review":"I've owned this headset for about 3 years, it came free with a collectors edition of UT. It is HORRIBLY uncomfortable. The plastic piece that sits on top of your ear has a slot cut in it for the wires that run to the earpieces.

Famous drummers and how to get started. For those of us who cant read music I dont reccommend this book. I didnt even watch the DVD so maybe its worth it IDK just dont go with a seller that promises expedited shipping. My book took 12 days to get to me from Florida. I live in Washington.

The rest of the concert (which I have on the original 10\\" LP and a 12\\" LP reissue) is even better, even though Hamp is only on the first number--Stardust. However, it is that recording of Stardust that is perhaps the greatest version of the song ever recorded--especially Hamp's solo. But he's paired with such stars as Barney Kessel, Charlie Shavers, Slam Stewart, Willie Smith on alto, etc. (sort of a JATP sound) and the cross-inspiration of the stars is incredible. The other three long tracks are the All-Stars without Hamp, which are just as swinging--if I remember correctly the tracks are Lady Be Good and One O'Clock Jump (I can't remember the last one). Apparently this was issued on CD briefly, but it's out of print. Someone ought to put these two together as a 2-CD set and present the entire concert together--it will be an incredible evening recreated."},{"rating":"2","title":"looking back","review":"what more can be said, of the great lionel hampton, this cd takes me back to the 50s when music was great, i was lucky i suppose to have been around at the same time, but lets concentrate on the music,~~ i have this on the old vinal record along with others in my collection but sadly is almost worn out, the recordings are exactly the same , so i wonder if they were recorded off the original verve mastertape, but please take the time to listen to the tracks on this fantastic cd, i will guaretee you will like them but i do hope you will be as enthralled as i was listening to them after all those years, lets have more , i wish you good luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO FLOWERS","review":"Beware.

Unbelievably stupid Yukon miner starts out for a walk to somewhere, with only a dog, some matches, a knife, and a few biscuits. It's supposed to be -75 outside but he takes off anyway. Along the way, he treats the dog more like, well, a dog, than a useful friend. He's always slapping and kicking him and later tries to kill the dog, I guess to warm his hands a la Luke Skywalker but he can't even do that right. He seems amazed to discover that if you build a fire under a tree with snow-filled branches, the snow might melt and fall into the fire. What a moron. I came to actually hate the guy before the movie ends, he's so dumb and mean, and I'm thrilled when the dog leaves him to freeze to death and walks off on its own. Monotone Orson Wells narrative, annoying background music, poorly photographed.

The period dress and scenery was perfect, just as I had imagined it in my head all the years as I read the story. I watched it with my 14 year old son, and he loved it also.

The dog could have helped him live longer with his nature-like instinct. Although he built a couple of fires, they were not sufficient in temperatures that cold. The dog could have shared its body heat with the man by lying on the man's feet after he fell into the water. But the man's arrogance caused his own death in the end.

After watching the ammonia levels in my tank continuing to go up and up after about one week of ownership I decided to search Amazon for a better filter. This filter is by far the coolest thing ever! The tank water is actually filtered through like three layers of filtering agents and apparently the cleaning is very easy and hassle free although I haven't actually done that yet.The filter is aesthetically amazing, it is clear and you can see the water flowing up and through the filter. The best part of all is that my ammonia levels and PH dropped to the PERFECT levels.Very rarely do I feel like I should have paid more for a purchase but in this case I don't think you could pay enough for this filter. Excellent product, excellent value, and I can already tell my fish are notably more active."},{"rating":"1","title":"Motor died","review":"This was my second aquaclear 110 that I purchased.

Very Happy!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"All the advantages of a canister filter with the convenience of hang on back","review":"This is the ultimate power filter. I have used Aquaclear filters for over 15 years in my aquariums, and always come back to them. Durable, highly customizable, and low maintenance costs are the main reason I have stuck with Aquaclear filters. At one point I switched to Emperor Biowheel filters, but they don't have the same mechanical or chemical filtration capabilities as this filter and the biological component is overrated on Biowheels. On top of that, Penguins are far more expensive and the cartridges are expensive as well. I can fill the bags for my Aquaclear with my prefered activated carbon, and add another bag with biological media. Simply rinse out the mechanical sponge in aquarium water and you have all the biological capacity you would ever want.Don't waste your time with any other hang on back filter, none can ever come close to an Aquaclear."},{"rating":"2","title":"Filter","review":"I never did a write up for a product but since I am taking the time to write this up this filter must be good! Compared to other filters this is the only one i know of that has a very thick sponge as the mechanical filtration. All of the ones i had in the past has a thin sponge. Also, the amount of room into the device allows you to add more biomedia. This filter has soo much room, alot of NANO-Reefer modify it to use as a fuge. It also comes with large bag of Biomedia and carbon. No other HOB has this. Other other ones has some sort of filter cartiage that needs to be replacing every so often. This filter biomedia and sponge last much longer. If you don't want to spend money on a canister filter, is the next best thing. I have a smaller AC70 on my goldfish tank that is slightly overstock and it still keeps the water crystal clear. If i had any complaints,which is a minor one. I wish they update the color on the casing to something else, they have been using this color for years."},{"rating":"2","title":"The name says it all","review":"This filter is amazing.

Also love that even after a year i still havent bought one filter cartrige the one that came with it looks new still.

I was a little nervous to buy it after seeing a few poor reviews that claimed it was really noisy, but went ahead and ordered it anyway because it had so many good reviews. I think the people who claimed it was extremely loud must have forgotten to put the leveling piece on, it's a small little black plastic piece that snaps into the bottom of the filter and you adjust it to make your filter perfectly level. I almost threw the piece away when I opened up the box, but luckily I kept it! Anyway, this is my first filter with a media basket so I don't know much about customizing it yet, but it came with their recommended products and I put a water softening pouch in there as well so my fish are off to a great start. I would definitely recommend this filter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Filters","review":"I've used these filters for years and like their performance and large media capacity.

But even when I first put it in my tank, with a complete water change, within 3 days, the water was cloudy, and again the same with a second 100% cleaning.

It was fairly quiet and the power flow was just what we wanted. The problem is that within 60 days it started leaking at the bottom of the filter (this design has the filter OUTSIDE of the aquarium) and emptied about 5 gallons of water all over our wood floors before we noticed! Amazon and this seller only allow 30 days for returns (most local stores would of taken it back still). The clean up was a total mess but at least if we could send it back, I'd feel a little better than having to throw it away and buy another product. I will not buy another external filter system. It is a nice concept but not worth the risk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hagen: Extremely mediocre packaging skills","review":"I legitimately think that Hagen does not like to package their shipments correctly. All there was were three tiny little bags of air, they didn't even help fit the box inside snuggly so that it wouldn't get thrown around! My AquaClear 70 was severely cracked and I am getting my replacement. It's a great company, but they should learn not to skimp on the safety of their shipment to customers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good filtration but serious flaw in design","review":"My wife and I purchased this filtration system from PetSmart and were very pleased by how easy it was to setup and get running. For a while, the filter worked without a hitch. We replaced the carbon,bio, and sponge in cycles and even cleaned out the tubes, motor and reservoir too. Then the problems began only after a few months.Our problem with this is that because the sponge, is placed at the bottom of the filter basket, it seems to always want to float upwards. When it floats upwards, it tends to knock the lid off and in one extreme case, it floated almost completely out of the filtration system and started dumping gallons of water all over the place. You can only imagine what it feels like to come home one afternoon from work to find this has occurred.I think if this flaw in design can be corrected and made the suction tube a bit more easier to clean, this would be a superb product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great filter except for","review":"yea, great filter except that it does not retain suction very well. When the power goes off and comes back on and the water in your tank is a little low, it must be primed again. Next problem was somehow the filter guts floated up and because I did not cut the bio bag excess. The bag came out and acted as a wick then 6 gallons later (under my new hardwood floors) I realized what was happening.On the positive side, I think the filters are extrememly quiet. The reviewers who says they are noisy have never had a noisy filter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Used product for a new price.","review":"Was used!!! Advertised new. Box was scotched taped and looked to be sitting in someone's attic for years. Had directions for an aqua tech. No intake assembly. Cracked box with sharpie written beside it with the words cracked.

I now have 2 on my 55g tank. They work amazing. We had bought one first because the one that came with our tank kept stopping up and turning off due to a sand particle getting stuck in the jet. Since then we purchased another and have no problems using these filters with our sand substrate. Works as intended and our water quality has gone up as well. Great looking water, quiet filter, can't really ask for more from a non canister filter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great filter, no issues","review":"I have 2 of these filters. Both on 46 gallon bow-front tanks. One tank is set up for African Ciclids, the other freshwater schooling fish. Both of these NEW filters have had no issues.You will need to pull apart the filter media and wash it out once every other month or more, depending on how messy your fish are, and take a old toothbrush to the inside of the filter to clean it out.This newest order was to replace one that burned out. Same make and model, just older. It came with the tank, and the motor on the pump had probably been running for 6-7 years straight without much of a break. Pretty good for such an inexpensive item.You can only expect so much from an electrical device, and this device gets my nod of approval.I will buy again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeps my fish tank clean!","review":"My old filter broke so i bought this one to replace it, its kinda noisy but i think that's because i plugged it in without having water in it.

But its one of the pros of having a very quiet filter. It also helps with tank space."},{"rating":"2","title":"Somethings wrong!!!!!!!!!","review":"This is the best filter on the planet. I feel bad for the reviewer and his wife because something is wrong. They said the sponge keeps floating to the top. Thats impossible unless the media rack is broken or missing. The 3 sided media rack is the part that you must pull out of the filter with your thumb and index finger to get the media out. And when you stack the sponge and media bags in the rack and stand the sides of the rack up and hold tight with your thumb and index finger and push it back into the filter which locks the sponge and media in so that it is impossible to float. The media rack has spears that wont let it float. I hope that they shop around because its easy to find the replacement parts really cheep to fix it. They won't regret it because I won't use any other make filter anymore because no other filter ( including canister filters ) can hold a candle to Aquaclear power filters."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really wanted to like it...","review":"The reviews were good, it was highly recommended, I really wanted to like it. Out of the box the motor was a little loud, but it is a motor after all so you would expect some noise. I had the impeller out a couple of times to make sure it was aligned correctly. I decided that the motor hum was not a big deal. Then the lid rattled when I put it on all the way. Fine, I would just put it on in such a way that it won't rattle. Or, duct tape the edges that rattled. I decided I could deal with rattle somehow and that was okay, too. Then the water noise started. I like a silent running tank and this one was splashing water a lot more than I wanted. If I turned the flow all the way down it was better, but I got this filter because I wanted 200 gph, so turning down the flow was counterproductive. There was no way to get 200 gph without water noise. I finally gave in and decided this filter was not going to work for me and sent it back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best I've owned","review":"I've had a few fish for several years & have been through 2 or 3 other filters. The AquaClear 50 is half the size of my other filters, cheaper, better made, & just as powerful. Mine is really quiet with just a little fountain noise from the water moving through it. It comes apart & reassembles easily, with the foam filter & two bags sitting in a removable basket.

Recently started keeping a tank again, but decided to try for a planted tank. Had the same problem as another reviewer and thought that my filter died after an outage. Unplugged it and let it sit for a day and then plugged it back in to make sure it was really dead. Surprisingly it started right back up again without problems. A few months later a rogue plant was starting to clog the intake, so I unplugged the filter to clean the intake tube out. Plugged it back in and the filter didn't turn back on. Waited a day and plugged it back in to see if the miracle of waiting a day would work again... but it didn't. Jumped on Amazon to order a new one and read the review about gunk clogging the propeller and decided to give it one more shot before I ordered a new filter.

Other filters always require a \\"tune-up\\" which mean taking apart every few weeks to get them flowing properly again.Runs quiet considering the volume of water it pushes. Also has a tab underneath you can adjust to level it.The sponge can be re-used many times before replacing which saves money and restores proper flow.

The moment I pluged it in I knew that I would have problems...it was very loud and the rattle was beyond what the Aquaclear 30 was.I did some research and found out that it was an impeller issue, made worse by the hard plastic casing/cover. I tried Vaseline (a fix found online), I replaced the motor with my old 30 motor (they are interchangeable), and finally I ordered a new impeller. The new impeller even had problems and is still very loud (I have the aquarium in my bedroom and it is difficult to sleep)I have ordered a Fluval 406 to replace the 70 currently on my tank and plan to throw the 70 away. Very disappointed and expensive problems make for a decent filter, but a very loud one...Two stars for the filter but can't go higher because of the problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING FILTER","review":"This filter is truly amazing. This is my second filter that I've bought only to add it to my new 75 gallon tank. It worked amazingly in my 29 gallon tall. My water was always crystal clear as long as i did my normal weekly water changes. I love that you can customise how you want to filter your water. I personally do a sponge on bottom, bio media in middle and another sponge on top. I have not yet replaced any of the supplies that they give you because I dont believe they need to be replaced at their reccomended time frame. My aquarium is always crytal clear and my fish love it too. Great filter. Would reccomend to anyone for H.O.B. filter."},{"rating":"2","title":"great filter","review":"Ordered this filter, but was damaged bc amazon didnt put enough packaging material to cushion the item. it arrived cracked. amazon made it up by shipping a replacement overnight. this filter moves lot of water. it is quite quiet also. from other reviews, people said it was loud due to rattling noise caused by the cover. i think that is a case by case basis. mine didnt make any noise. i like the waterfall sound. it is very relaxing for me. this unit is huge. it measure 13 inches across and need 4-5 inches in depth behind the tank. overall, i like this filter for my reef tank."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Product","review":"I used to have a Aqueon Quietflow filter for my 10 gallon tank, but no matter what I did the Ammonia level will always spike. I finally figured out that it's the insufficient filtration, or the lack of filtration that the Aqueon provided. Anyways, long story short. I purchased this Aquaclear unit along with the ammonia remover unit and all is good in the neighborhood.There is a reason this product has stuck around unchanged for decades. It simply works."},{"rating":"2","title":"quiet and powerful","review":"Only been online for two days, but is settling in nicely. Creates currents clear across the 20 gal tank.

Came with a two suction tubes, but I had to purchase another tube to reach the bottom of my tank. The instructions tell you that you can slow the flow rate by moving the suction tube to the right or to the left, I find this questionable as I have seen no difference. This is a good product over all I recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy setup, very satisfied. Quiet filter system w/ strong flow","review":"The item arrived complete with everything needed to set up for my 60 Gallon tank. Directions (allthough were not necessary) were very easy to read and understand. Pictures as well as to each description of step by step setup. Item functions very well. It is a strong pump system and large flow rate into a cascading and smooth waterfall. Clear tank body so that you can physically \\"SEE\\" when it needs to be cleaned."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE THIS FILTER!!","review":"I bought this filter because i tried two others before both were tetra and they eventually just stopped working. this filter is quiet and really nice. i like that you can adjust the water flow, i have this one on my 10gallon tank and the flow from other filters was too powerful for my fish to swim through. i will be buying this filter for my 33 gallon tank when the current filter goes out. ive had no problems with this filter and would definately recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"For Crystal Clear Water","review":"Length:: 0:53 MinsI set up the Aqua Clear in water that was yellow and pretty cloudy. The Aqua Clear clear cleaned the water and diminished the yellow tint within a day.I was being told by my local pet store that the Fluval filter was the best filter for my turtles. Even with cloudy yellow water, my local pet store said it was natural and fine.It wasn't so fine with me. I could hardly see my turtles and had to change the filters every two weeks and use a turkey baster every day to pick up larger debris which that filter couldn't handle.Now I have very happy turtles that are enjoying the water more and getting out of their shells, I'll let my turtles speak for themselves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great filter, but not silent","review":"Like the other reviewer mentioned, this filter isn't exactly silent. The impeller makes noise. Not noticeable when there's activity in the same room, but when the room is quiet you can definitely hear it. That being said, the filtration that this unit provides is EXCELLENT. My water is so clear I can see the warm-water currents coming out of my heater. Performs wonderfully, and I appreciate being able to dial-down the force of the filter....I have this one in my 10 gallon aquarium, and my fish didn't like the current at full blast."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Filter","review":"This filter is great, but the biological part of this filter needs to be replaced (i believe 2-3 months), I don't know if the biomax will lose performance if you dont. Other than that it is a great mechanical filter. When compared to penguin's filters this filter wins in mechanical filtration, but the penguin in biological. They also make the same amount of noise, but this one makes alittle more because it requires a higher water level than the penguin filters. However, one thing in this filter that the penguin doesn't have is the flow control which is really nice b/c sometimes i will move filters around to smaller to bigger tanks. Oh and this option let's you reduce more impurities out of your water (if you want to). Other than that it still has the same restarting problems as the penguin filters."},{"rating":"2","title":"OUTSTANDING FILTER!","review":"I bought a 30 gallon tank a while back and thought I could run it on a couple small filters, but inevitably they failed to keep up and I was left with a very green tank that was a bear to clean each week. I bought this filter based on previous reviews and couldn't be happier! Here not even two weeks later my water is completely clear and my algae has disappeared. In fact I had algae that I thought had stained the silicon seal green, yet the seals themselves are almost perfectly clear again! The only one in the house who wouldn't give this a high rating is my plecostomus who now has to do detailed searches for food. And let me mention again that this filter is rated for up to 20 gallons, but I am running it in a 30 gallon tank and it works great!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST FILTER MONEY CAN BUY!!","review":"I have both the 30 and the Aquaclear 70! The 30 is silent! I have it next to my bed and I am a light sleeper. This is great if you want to customize what type of filter media you want to run.VERY CHEAP TO KEEP! The filter sponge never needs to be replaced, swish in discarded water (used tank water not TAP) in your water change bucket. Then plop it back in the filter, same with the biomax. I don't use the carbon, I have live plants. The only thing to watch is if you have nano fish, somehow I got a CPD (celestial Pearl Danio) sucked up my filter intake tube in the 30? Easy fix, use filter pad with rubber bands to cover it, panty hose, or sponge cover made for it.If the filter makes noise,fill tank with more wateruse the leveling key on the bottomreadjust the lid on the filter (will be snug)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Power Filter!","review":"This is obviously a high quality unit. I've owned aquariums for over 30 years. And unlike canister filters, determining whether your new power filter is junk is a very early determination. This unit is built from high qualiity acrylic unlike the competitors' which are typically built from paper thin black resin that crumbles under the slightest pressure. It has a very large filter media section. The included media, foam pre-filter, and activated carbon bag very rapidly brought my nitrate levels to negligible. There's obviously lots of end-user input into the design including the very cool leveling rig. The unit is noticibly high-volume and very quiet. The motor seems to be running efficiently. Obviously due to the large (versus most I've seen) impeller. The impeller was comparable in size to the Rena Filstar XP3 (now XPL) canister filter I have partnered with it. My LPS had it for $89.99 plus tax. Amazon had it for $72 plus change with shipping and tax. Sorry LPS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Filter..Ignore the Bad Reviews","review":"I have used this filter for over 5 years and finally had to replace it. I keep large goldfish (very messy) and would generally be late on my water changes due to work or family or general laziness. My water was always crystal clear, the unit never leaked, and was always virutally silent. For those who think this product doesn't work just plainly must not read the directions. When used properly this filter does an excellent job. I highly recommend this product, just be sure to buy one large enough for your tank. I use the AquaClear50 for my 36 gallon tank."},{"rating":"1","title":"becareful when buy from place k seller","review":"I bought a Dual Temp Infrared Thermometer from place-k and it said NEW.

In my opinion though, Gregg hasn't lived up to that promise at all. Her work at best fizzles and fails to reach its mark, and at worst insults the reader's intelligence with it vapid, self-centered pronouncements.One thing I cannot get away from as I read these poems is simply how false they all sound. In poem after poem, the poet seems to desperately try to be something she is not. Imitation for the sake of learning is fine, but at some point one expects a poet to find and have the courage follow her own voice. This particular book has gotten a number of bad reviews, and one can see why.It is really too bad because I think Gregg's early work showed some talent. Judging by this collection, it just never took root or gained substance. One wishes for and expects better."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the top poets of our age","review":"Human suffering exists on every level. Gregg's vision is subtle, complex, and multi-layered.

She is not completely without talent and there are some nice poems in this book, though I think most would agree that her best are to be found in her first book. But I am not her friend, I am a poet: and as a reader I have to say she is just not in the same league as poets such as C.D. Wright, Lucie Brock-Broido, or Carolyn Forche, or any one of a number of newer fresher voices who have recently published. She never discovered anything. She never broke new ground. She is a poet who has always promised much, but delivered little. This book is hands down her most mediocre. It suffers from aesthetic laziness, from default thinking and repetition, and I would say a lifelong lack of courage.

Playing a major theme throughout this story is survival, family, and individual accomplishments.

Written in a light but informative manner, Dunne is not afraid to tell stories on himself, such as accidentally stepping on a Sharp-tailed Grouse, and identifying a harrier at Hawk Mountain and the lesson's learned.

Using my simple logic, if they were okay, they would still be okay in the morning when the storm passed. And if they weren't okay, increasing the body count by 5 wan't going to help either.

It struck me as Les Mis, done in anime. The various faces of Julian are stark and narrowly drawn, with so little transition between faces and little insight into his being that one can scarcely reconcile one image with the other, let alone see some internal transition toward repentance. The narrator was little more than a cardboard cutout propped up by a few cursory claims of faith.Still, Wangerin's talent pops out sporadically, enough that I'd try another book of his. But with this one, I was left with the feeling that Wangerin simply did not take the time to write as he seems capable of writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lifeless and somewhat rote","review":"Wangerin's effort here seems lifeless and somewhat stock. It's hard to think that such a potentially captivating story could be made to sound bland, but it does come together that way. There are a few moments when we see into Julian's character, but his motivations are always lost and his faith seems second-hand to doing the right thing. This book is altogether lost in the facts and historical elements of the story rather than the human element.

There is enough re-enactment footage in the film to keep a youngster's interest. So I learned alot (at 48), and my 5 year old learned alot and it sparked his interest in history.

The usual topics are covered in addition - trees, shrubs, palms and cycads, flowering plants, and fragrant and fruit-bearing plants as well. There is a useful section on invasive plants, a short list of gardens to visit, as well as a bibliography and index.

There is enough ventilation to keep them cool during the hotter months, yet contained enough to keep the cold wind out during the cooler months. You do need to make sure the bottom latch is secure to prevent it from collapsing; it's sometimes too loose. Also, really young puppies should be watched since the bottom latches sometimes don't stick. My puppies escaped once. My only other complaint is the bag to transport it in: it's way too small.

I didn't expect them to be pretty, but at least cute. I was totally wrong, they are just ugly and my daughter says \\"ugly toy\\" every time she sees them around. Despite their appearance we went ahead and tried to play with them, but they were not that fun either and did not keep her attention for more than two minutes. I don't think I would even feel comfortable giving them as a gift to a boy, so I guess I just wasted the money I paid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plastic Carrying Case a Hazard for Toddlers and Babies","review":"The bowling game is moderately fun. The ball is fairly useless since it is not round, but the characters are cute and my three children are amused by them.My issue is with the soft plastic carrying case, which fits neatly over my toddler son's face and head. I'm concerned that the case could present a suffocation hazard to babies and small toddlers who may not be strong or coordinated enough to remove it from their faces. The clear plastic is attractive and fun for babies to look through and it can fit over their entire heads and even be at least partially zipped closed while on their heads, the prospect of which I find very frightening.I usually love Melissa & Doug products, but they have used this plastic material on a number of the toys they market to babies and toddlers (see my review of the fill and spill toolbox).

It was well constructed and the monsters were very cute. In fact, they even stood up well and were easy to handle. However, the \\"bowling ball\\" was not easy to use. It did not roll in a direct fashion due to assorted shapes on the ball. So, when the kids tried to use it, it did not reach its goal. If you are able to use another ball, it would be very functional.

I was the one who always suggested we play with the set only to watch him loose interest in a few seconds. And the ball is easier thrown at the pins than rolled because of its uneven shape.

Unless your child understands the concept of knocking down pins in the traditional bowling way, they'll likely just carry around the monsters and ball as the surprisingly soft, cuddly, funny stuffed toys that they are.

If I begin to go into detail, it will ruin it for you; however, it is about one Miss Emily Grierson, who is from a respectable family of which she is the sole remaining descendent. She remains shrouded in a cloud of private mystery with only the occasional entry or departure of her black servant to provide her with the basic necessites from the outside world. After a small accumulation of seemingly unconnected incidents, the story ends on a horrifying and ghastly note, which manages to leave the reader confident that he knows what the ending means, but at the same time is left hanging uncertainly.

I understand that the way the router deals with encryption is potentially the source of the issue, but I am not going to remove security from my network.Bottom line, pay $30 for a Belkin router and you are playing router roulette.

I had to call tech support for assistance during setup. (I am not a newbie.) Recently, it stopped working (I lost connection with my DSL modem) and I found out I had to update my firmware. That didn't work. I even tried to restore my settings in the browser-based setup, but that didn't work either. The router does not respond to anything at this point. I switched to Linksys based on recommendations from friends who are technology professionals---the setup of the Linksys Wireless-G router was a piece of cake.

Get a different router."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick, easy, reliable","review":"The router was extremely easy to setup, just like any other wired router, truly plug and play. The range is exceptionally good, with little sound interference and a constant broadcast of the full 54Mbps speed. The wired and wireless compatibility of this router makes it very versatile and convenient. The affordable price makes this router an excellent value. The only downside to the unit is the size, it seems unnecessarily bulky."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Disappointed","review":"AT first, like one of the other reviewers I also had some problems setting up the router with my Verizon DLS. But after looking it up online I found out that I needed to add \\"@verizon.net\\" to my user name after I did that the router connected and ran smoothly.The Wireless Signal strength and range are pretty good. Belkin has some good technical support both over the phone and online.Two things to suggest don't bother with the Easy Install Wizard CD that comes with the box it causes more headaches then it helps just use the Web-based Advanced User Interface. I know it says Advanced but it's pretty straightforward and simple, just read the manual of how to connect the router if you don't know.Also the router comes with most of it's security features disabled, just remember to Enable them.I highly recommend this router, works great, and it's pretty inexpensive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"I had Linksys \\"B\\" router and wanted to upgrade to \\"g\\". I got a good deal on a Belkin G router and tried installing it. After two nights and almost 6 hours on the phone with customer service, I gave up and returned it. My past experience with Belkin products has been very good. However, now having used their technical support, I think Belkin's customer service stinks. They kept trying to blame my pc, modem and Verizon DSL. Well, after I gave up with their router and plugged my Linksys back in I was fine. Belkin has a long way to go with improving its tech support.

The worst flaw is that it can't handle too many connections, otherwise internet applications like Internet Explorer won't be able to connect to ANY web site! The WAN (DSL) connection also disconnects several times during the day for some unknown reason. I ended up stacking the unit with a Linksys gateway for my DSL because the Belkin has too many quirks and issues. If you already have a wired DSL/cable router and need wireless ability, this is a good choice, otherwise you can find something better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Utterly Fantastic","review":"I've dealt with multiple routers, from companies D-Link and Linksys. NONE were as handy as this!This one was up and running in just minutes. The only issue I had wasn't even an issue (One of the lights on the front was blinking when it didnt have to, which worried me). An update to the firmware fixed this! Even the update was quick and painless! Just download the file from the site, go into the configuration and select the file, and you're done!Also, another thing, the Tech Support is WONDERFUL! They were able to guide me through the Firm Ware installation without any confusion.The only quarrel I had with this Gateway was its range, but that was fixed by simply adjusting the antennaes a bit. I can usually get a 50%+ signal 2 stories down! Its amazing."},{"rating":"1","title":"this thing will ruin your weekend","review":"Buy this router if:a. You are a network engineerb.

Finally, I could at least keep the internet to the pc but the laptop would not connect. Then after a week it started to work for five or six days. The connection would drop every 5 minutes. Then it would not work at all. Tech support was terrible. Total waste of time and when he sent me to the level two his only idea was to shut off the firewall.

It loses the connection every 2-3 minutes. That's ridiculous considering my pc is only about four feet (and with a clear path) from the thing. The router gets so hot after about 30 minutes, the base may actually burn you. Do not even conjure up the idea in head to consider buying this! Congrats, Belkin!

I don't like to use AC when the room temp is only 70 some degree. But this router doesn't like the temperature.

It has intermittent signal issues. At first I thought maybe it's the location so I moved it around.Then one day, I couldn't find it on the wireless network. Spoke to tech support and after 2 hrs, they decided to send a new one.Here's the thing. YOU, as the consumer, have to pay shipping cost for shipping back the defective unit. Tech support never mentioned a word about it. I got mad about it. Why am I responsible for paying to ship a defective product?After wasting much time with the customer service, they finally sent me a shipping label.Besides that this Belkin router lacks an information manual. It has a quick-start leaflet and that's about it. There are no information on how to change the internal settings using hard wiring and an IP address.Not buying Belkin ever again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frequent Lost Connections","review":"I've had this router for about six months, and about every other day, the router loses its connection, changing its flashing green lights to solid amber.

So to get the router working again, I pull its power brick from the wall, wait a few seconds, and plug it back. And it works for another day or two. This is a very frustrating experience.On the plus side, in my house of about 3,000 square feet, I generally have good reception."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't even bother if you want reliable wireless.","review":"I had this wireless router for several months and had nonstop connection problems.

Figured I would do my own security via MAC filtering. MAC filtering worked for 10 minutes and then it died. When I called Belkin I noticed that: 1) This model router has an option (#1) on their technical support line (that should tell you something), no other product has an option. 2) It took less than 10 minutes for me to establish that the products was dead with their techs but 30 minutes on hold with their returns department before I spoke to a human. As noted by other reviewers you have to pay for the shipping the dead router back to Belkin. This was an educational experience for me. Next time I'm going with another product."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT COMPATIBLE WITH APPLE","review":"I bought this since it was cheap and I figured I could save a few bucks over linksys or netgear, but that is about as good as it gets with this.

Also I tested this with my iBook g4 and my iPhone and neither worked.

I don't know what to think. I blame myself for buying the cheapest thing on the shelf but then for every person that raves about the Linksys there is another person that says its garbage. I think a company out there needs to be build a solid router and not really worry about price because if it'll work and continue to work I think we'll all pay the higher price.In short I wouldn't buy this router.

I unplugged it and didn't use it for awhile. After plugging it back in, the numbers were back to green and everything appeared to be fine.Then came yesterday.

I am using the Belkin wireless adapter that supposedly goes with it, either both or one is garbage.

I still use a linksys router to connect to my ISP and setup the Belkin just as an access point (to upgrade my network to G) and it is great! I haven't had any range problems in my loft and the security options are great with all my neighbors also having wireless networks. I highly recommend this router.I agree with others that the provided software sucks but the router also has a web interface which is a walk in the park to configure.

In addition, there would be random disconnects that could only be solved by disconnecting the power supply. How long it worked after that was a gamble. Sometimes it would be a few days, other times it would be disconnected again by the time I sat down from restarting the router.In location B, it was slightly better, but would randomly not assign an IP address to the computer.

Cycling the power is all that will clear it up, and in another day or two it happens again. As other reviewers have said, Support is no help, and firmware does nothing to help with the problem. Look around the internet and you'll see how many people can't get this router working well.Belkin makes good computer accessories, but do yourself a favor and spend a little extra up front on a wireless router with a name behind it like Linksys or D Link. The Linksys that replaced this Belkin has worked flawlessly, while the Belkin is collecting dust. I couldn't bring myself to give this headache to anyone else on Craigslist...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Router for Both Windows and Mac","review":"I bought this router in July when my Siemens Speedstream wireless router somehow fried. To date, I have only had to restart the router a handful of times (all during electrical storms)and since I upgraded the firmware in September, I have had no restarts.The router works seemlessly with my G4 Mac with a Belkin PCI wireless card running 10.2.8 and my Windows XP laptop using a D-Link PCMCIA wireless card. The mac address filtering feature included in the router software is a very useful security feature for apartment building living and setting it up is very easy.I highly reccommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very bad performance","review":"My belkin router often drops connection around 1:30am. Have no idea why it chooses this time. I had thought my ISP was doing daily maintenance at midnight. However, after I reset my belkin router, everythiing works fine.Another weird problem is that when you have multiple computers connected to the routers (wired/wireless), only a pair of them can reach each other. (Yes, I disabled firewall on the router and all the computers.) Therefore I can not share music, files, video and certain server applications among all of my computers. Big pain!!The security log is useless. Also, everytime you reset the router, historical log got lost forever, and the clock reset to Thu Jan 1 00:00:00 1970 again."},{"rating":"1","title":"do NOT buy","review":"has firmware issues, will NOT allow port forwarding because of buggy firmware that hasn't been fixed for 18 months! don't expect a firmware upgrade to fix it; furthermore, the new version v1444 has packet loss issues and will not be a good wireless bridge"},{"rating":"1","title":"Belkin wireless DSL/Cable router is the pits!","review":"I bought this router to hook into my broadband wireless network at home, because I wanted to be able to have my friends and family to be able to use their laptops via the BBW ISP. I have been using the Belkin for five months and it is a chronic pain in the you-know-what. The ISP technical folks I have consulted on several occasions have repeatedly told me that they absolutely do NOT recommend the Belkin -- it is unreliable and a constant problem.

It often drops my connection, which is only remedied by resetting the router. I'm also not able to set up a secure connection and am left open to others connecting without my permission.

The article walks through the reason why smart people can't (won't) learn and describes an approach for breaking through this mode of thinking.The basic premise is that people with high levels of education have learned to play the learning game. They can't or won't admit they don't know something because in essence they would have to admit failure. They often become defensive in the face of failure and displace (rationalize) the blame for failure rather then looking for the root cause and examining their own involvement in the failure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huh?","review":"There is nothing here.

There is a lot of good information stuffed into the Lonely Planet Hawaii guide. What is missing is the opinion to help you make informed decisions. Big Island Revealed offers up lots of opinions on restaurants, what you'll see when you get to waterfall|viewing area|beach|whatever. I have read and used them both for reference, but I still default to Big Island Revealed for their refreshingly honest opinions."},{"rating":"2","title":"My first choice in travel guides!","review":"I think Lonely Planet does a great job with their travel guides. The Hawaii, Big Island, is a great resource with it's colorful informative pages. The book is easy to use as it's divided into color coded sections by cities/areas of the Big Island.

After looking this book over, I'm all fired up to go!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Big Island well done","review":"This is a well written, beautiful book. It covers every part of Hawaii (The Big Island)in detail. Shows the best places to stop and look or where to find activities. It has nice pictures of some of the area's.

Overall a very well done guide book of Hawaii The Big Island."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful book","review":"Lonely Planet has an excellent reputation, and this book proves it is well-deserved. The book is small, but packed with information. The pages are high quality, filled with breath taking full color photos.

Even with that connection, in reading this book I still learned things about my ancestors that I didn't know. It is amazing how real these folks still are on the pages of Le Petit Paris, as if they'd just closed their storefront or doused their lantern for the night, not the century.

Maemuki Rocket-dan is only 3 tracks long (the original song, a karaoke version, and a funky techno remix), but it's definitely worth it. The music is so catchy, I can't help but dance along with it, and the message of positivity and optomism that our heroes sing about puts a smile on my face every time. The album also includes a sticker sheet and lots of cute pictures of Jessie, James, Meowth, and their pokemon. Highly recommended for anybody who loves Pokemon or Team Rocket!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, another Team Rocket CD!","review":"Maemuki Rocket Dan (roughly translating into \\"Forward-Looking Team Rocket\\") is the 11th ending theme for the Pocket Monsters series in Japan. There are three tracks on this single:1. Maemuki Rocket Dan; 2. Maemuki Rocket Dan Karaoke; 3. Maemuki Rocket Dan Remix. These are definetly the weirdest songs Team Rocket has ever sung. The first track is a long version of the TV ending theme, the second is an instrumental of the first track, and the third is a remix of the first track; many would call this the \\"Para Para Remix\\" for obvious reasons when you hear the song. Included in the first and third tracks are cameos by Sonans (Wobbuffet for English-speakers). This album is very entertaining and I would recommend it to every Team Rocket fan and any die-hard Pokemon fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tamrac quality","review":"Tamarac's stuff is usually a good buy compared to the competition, but the quality is no compromise. This very useful neck strap is no exception. It would be a real pain to have to remove the manufacuters strap for those times when it would just tangle, or worse get caught up on something causing your camera to fall. This is a slick and reliable way to have it both ways, in seconds. I've had this style strap on the cameras I've owed for the last twenty years... First thing I bought for my 5D after the memory card."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Strap","review":"Just received it and first impression is great, feels comfortable, looks of good construction and seems its gonna last, already attached it to my DSLR and perfect fit for messenger style which is what i was looking for, plus the quick release works perfect, i was afraid of the release buttons cause u never what to drop ur camera but i think i can trust this strap cause seems strong enough.

This unit installed easily, and works great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good, a couple of things...","review":"I like the strap, I will use it. It has a good range of adjustability and the quick release seems reliable. However the attachment system doesn't lay flat on my unit. I hope/suspect it will stretch to lay flat eventually. The other thing is that the padding is so minimal as to barely qualify as padded. It *DOES* feel good but if you were thinking it might be a good thick padding for a heavier camera, it's not that. As a counter-example, the padding in the black rapid straps are quit a bit thicker/softer. The padding in this strap reminds me of the collar of a suede jacket wrapped around the nylon strap. It's a bit nicer feeling than my stock Nikon strap, but only just.That said, I would recommend it for normal camera use as a more convenient and flexible neck strap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent value","review":"I purchased my first Tamrac strap back in the early 80's. It was of a similar design and has last the better part of 28 years of use. It still looks good and has help up well.Your equipment is only as good as the weakest link. The OEM straps are terrible. They are poorly designed, too small to carry the weight of most DSLRs, and worst of all, advertise what camera you have. Oh looky, looky a Canon EOS 5D, let's rob him.This strap is sturdy, comfortable, the pad is made of leather and will wear forever. It doesn't slip off your shoulder like synthetics do, and is inconspicuous. No big letters or model names, just a black camera strap. I've purchases a few of these over the years. In the 28 + years, the strap hasn't changed much. Model number has been changed, but the build quality is always been top notch.If you're looking for a good, solid camera strap that will out last the camera it's attached to, you've found your strap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Prop wash!","review":"Not being that literal minded, but having an understanding of tugs...I generally liked the book.

Streitenfeld also wrote good music that could be grouped in three independent compositions, but he opted for mixing parts and pieces from these three possible songs. I recognize and applaud Streitenfeld's ability to re-group the music in a way that resulted in three new compositions, that ended up having a certain identity, even though they were built out of three very different and distinctive themes. Perhaps, Streitenfeld wanted to do something more experimental and raise himself to the level of Harry Nilsson.

For some reason the continuity and artistic merit that were present in the original \\"Graveyard Shift\\" are completely lost. The story is a bizarre tale of the return of Baisez, the vampire who was introduced and supposedly destroyed in the original movie. Baisez is doomed to walk the earth as a ghost-like being until he can find a body he can posses. Sounds simple enough but the story jumps all over the place, taking place on a movie set. The thread of continuity completely unravels through the course of the movie and by the end you are left completely unclear as to what exactly happened.

Those are the only two things the hose did well. Any bend in the hose resulted in a kink and restricted (or no) water flow. I noticed water seeping out in many places. Then, when I was finished, it was nearly impossible to wind back onto the reel, because any water left in the hose takes up more space and all the hose won't fit onto the reel.Well, I finally got it sufficiently rolled up to send it back for a refund less postage and handling.Now I have a traditional hose and a large reel inside a lawn box which was purchased at one of the Do-It-Yourself type home improvement stores.

To prevent kinks from happening, you have to unroll the hose completely flat and pressurize it as it will stiffen up and not kink. This hose works from the same principle of that of a fire hose. Before the firemen charge the hose, they roll it out flat and un-kinked and the pressurize it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Happy with Product Quality issues","review":"The green wrap around material seperated from the hose material inside and is causing kinks. The kinks are causing water flow problems. I used the reel after each use and still had issues.

This in my opinion failed and I will not suggest or buy it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"always get the original","review":"I have been searching for a additional flat hose reel. this item looked acceptable, however when used the nylon sheath separated upon winding back into its real. so the last foot of the hose has a crumpled sheath that prevented the complete winding of the hose.

But I would note, that Grafton's commentary on Lincoln's composition of the Gettysburgh Address is in accord with the superb work of Gary Wills in his book, \\"Lincoln At Gettysburgh\\" where Wills thoroughly debunks the myth that Lincoln wrote the Address on the back of an envelope on his way up on the train.Anyone who has frequent need to reference some of the greatest and enduring documents in American History will find this book an invaluable reference tool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little reference","review":"It's small enough to take with you, yet inexpensive enough to buy several.

The powder doesn't melt fully and the image just wipes away, not being perm held there by melted powder.Could be user error, but hey, it's a heat gun. You point, and heat. How hard is that?Anyway, I wouldn't buy it again, and I'll probably end up replacing it.Also, the large circumference is annoying, both because it's harder to hold imho, but mostly because it won't fit nicely in my stamping drawer, which is just under 3\\" high, like most stamping drawers are usually not that deep."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it","review":"This cover is terrible.

I can bring them anywhere in a baggie or plastic container & they are the perfect snack. Kids on the playground are always trying to get at them & other moms are like, \\"What are those?\\" Love my peas! Cannot say enough about how great these crisps are!! Only downside is that I wish the bag was re-sealable.

Boy, was I wrong. The picture on the front of the bag is VERY misleading...when you actually get a look at the product inside the bag, there are no visible \\"pods\\" on the snapea crisps. The crisps are actually more like sad, green Cheetos. At this point, I'd rather eat some Cheetos...at least they have some flavor. These snapea crisps (original flavor) are on the bland side...even after adding salt to them, they still weren't very flavorful. They also left my hands greasy. I thought I might be able to keep a bag of these in my desk at work to eat as a healthy snack, but I have reconsidered. The crisps don't seem like much of a health food at all. If I want to eat something with 6g of fat per serving, I'd rather go with chips and salsa or a handful of pretzels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snapea Crisps use GMO's","review":"I bought these for the first time today.

The problem is I can almost eat a whole 3.3 oz bag myself which is 3 servings. They are really healthy though, so I wouldn't feel too guilty. They have a great crunch and light salty flavor, really satisfies my salt craving."},{"rating":"2","title":"Green, different, and completely yummy","review":"If you judge this snack by the packaging, you might never try them. Baked pea pods don't exactly sound like the most appetizing (or satisfying) snack, but these guys really deliver. As one of the other reviewers said, they are crunchy and light, with a texture similar to Cheetos, possibly a little more dense. They have the taste of lightly salted snow peas, only light and airy. While they might not be as healthy as a raw or steamed vegetable, they're a good alternative if you don't want all of the chemicals and sugars in most packaged snacks. These guys have no sugar at all and the ingredient list is wholly recognizable. I usually buy two bags at a time because they tend to go so fast. Both flavors are delicious, though I prefer the original.Since it appears that Amazon is no longer carrying them, you might try Wild Oats, Trader Joes or Whole Foods, if any of those are nearby."},{"rating":"1","title":"regret product","review":"I was disappointed in the product.

None of my friends like them either so I guess I'll just throw them out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What They Advertise","review":"When I bought this snack I was expecting dried snap peas, which is what they lead you to believe from the packaging. However, they are a far cry from this. They are really a smashed blend of many ingredients bent back into a pea shape. There are a few benefits like fiber and there is some sort of pea in it but overall there are still some poor ingredients in my opinion, especially when I was expecting dried snap peas. Also, the flavor was very bland. Almost like cheerios, or a stale corn puff. Somewhat overpriced too, although I bought them from the grocery store not Amazon. I wouldn't recommend them."},{"rating":"2","title":"A veggie my kid likes? No way....","review":"Okay, so I realize this isn't a real veggie... merely a veggie that's been pureed and turned into a pea pod shaped chip. But man they are GOOD.

If I could return the other 11 packages I would. Calbee whatever you've done, go back to the old recipe."},{"rating":"2","title":"MMMMM good","review":"I love Snapea Crisps. The Caesar more than the original, although they are both really yummy. My children and I eat them instead of cheeto's. They have that sort of consistency, crunchy and salty, but disolvable enough for my infant son. They do have fat in them, and the aforementioned salt, but they also have 5 grams of protein per serving, so I feel they are a justifiable snack, as long as they are in place of, rather than in addition to, other salty snacks like chips and french fries."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous Gluten-Free Snack!!","review":"My whole family loves these, right out of the bag no less, including my 8 year old son!

I picked up 1 bag to try...and now it's over, I'm completely hooked. These things really are that delicious.

What a shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leave a weird sensation","review":"These are a little salty, a little greasy, and a little 'powdery'. The taste is not bad, BUT, I did have the strangest sensation after eating a couple handfuls - I don't have any known allergies or 'texture issues' with food whatsoever, so it was really bizarre: they started to sort of taste prickly, like the outer part was sharp or rough, and it was unpleasant to continue eating them. The closest thing I can compare is imagine chewing on a mouthful of roasted peanut SHELLS. Very very weird. I wouldn't buy again, not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE","review":"Horrible. That is a word to describe these treats. To start, you pull one pea out of the greasy bag and you really can't distinguish which one is the pea and which one is the rice flour. Almost undistinguishable. Second, the pieces are SOAKED with corn oil, literally. Just leave the bag out at room temperature and you'll notice. The description of the product says it is OVEN made but there is no advantage if you soak them in oil!! Fake fake fake nutritional benefits. As described in the package, 9gms of fat in 1oz. it might be understated.Flavorwise is average. Taste like pan-fried tempura-texture like pea, pre-soaked in Mazola oil."},{"rating":"1","title":"These are not \\"veggies.\\"","review":"There's a slightly odd taste about this product that I can't figure out from the ingredients. These are not a substitute for veggies as some people reviewing seem to think. They're basically a potato chip replacement and just as unhealthy but slightly lower in fat. These are definitely \\"junk food\\" and should be eaten with that in mind in terms of frequency and quantity. The fact that they're called peas is only because they're molded to look like peas. Read the label!I won't order them again mainly because of the weird off-putting taste."},{"rating":"1","title":"blah--times 2","review":"To each his/her own. I was suckered into buying a case (and the regular ones) on a Friday sale. I'm now trying to give them away a package at a time. They are blended, pureed, formed into peapods, but NOT any remote resemblance of an actual green bean. I hate them (although one of my sister-in-laws and parents have ordered 3 more cases).

Slightly salty, crispy, with a nice delicate flavor similar to puffed rice."},{"rating":"2","title":"my son's favorite snack","review":"These are the best. I have gotten everyone I know to try these and they're all hooked, adults and children alike. I found these a couple years ago at Trader Joe's when I was looking for a healthy snack for my toddler and we all just loved them. Luckily, our local supermarket started stocking these so we always have them in stock at home. I bought these at Amazon with the subscribe and save option and got them a good bit cheaper than I can anywhere else. These are a great way to sneak veggies into your child's diet. The best way I can describe them is that they are similar in texture to cheese puffs, and even though they are only salted they have lots of flavor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I'd read the Details more closely","review":"It's not what I expected.

Now, we're told that a greasy little snack in a bag is \\"healthy.\\" But, while this isn't an apple or a cup of yogurt, Snapeas are a far cry from bright orange Doritas or Ding Dongs. They are baked (not fried), and perhaps there is merit to the pea foundation, as opposed to the potato or corn chip format. They are major addictive - full of unique flavor, a pleasantly crisp but foamy (as in styrofoamy) texture, a dash of saltiness, and just enough oilyness to satisfy. Try these and then spread the word."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for toddlers, too!","review":"Our whole family loves this snack.

Read along with the studies driven by reporting data it fleshes out some of the dynamics of street socialization. It appears street gangs derive from a sense of isolation and powerlessness, fueled by the sense of futility, the social conditions are delineated in this work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring for women of all ages","review":"Going through a difficult time in my life, this book has brought me wonderful, positive inspiration.

That's what Josephine Carlton has done in this pint sized inspirational and empowering book filled with casual interviews of women from varied walks of life.Getting through hard times with grace is often difficult to do -and hard to maintain. Yet, just knowing that others have succeeded with with little more than their weary spirit at times, is what makes us believe in life's possibilities. Let down your shoulders and relax...this book quietly reminds its reader that it's okay to sit still and rest your tired soul. You're among friends.This wonderful, chunky little book followed me around in my bag and now adorns my night table, where it is available and uplifting - and yet, intimately mine."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW","review":"Life messages was truly a revealing book for me. I found myself drawing comparisons and opening my mind, helping resolve issues in my own life. The messages in \\"Life Messages\\" also served as a reality checker for me.

My daughter hated this bassinet. It might as well have been a carboard box with a thin piece of foam. The mattress was terrible. She would fall asleep on my bed no problem, so it wasn't a sleeping issue. I had to buy a new mattress to get my daughter to sleep in it.

Aweek after we received it, it also collapsed. We had my father and my fiancee's brother look at it to see if we maybe put it together wrong. When they couldn't find the problem, I went and asked my neighbor. He said...after looking at it for over an hour...that it was a piece of junk and to just get our money back.

It came bend in on the sides in delivery and generally I am very dissatissfied and will not order again."},{"rating":"1","title":"It fell apart with my daughter in it","review":"This bassinet was a waste of money. After tax and shipping it cost over $100. I registered online and did not see it in person. From the moment I put it together it did not live up to my expectations. It does NOT have lights, sound, or vibrations. But the worst part was that it was falling apart from the beginning. It started with one wheel that always fell apart when it was moved, then another wheel. Then, a little while later it became very whobbly. Then, one night, with my 2 month old daughter inside, the frame completly fell to pieces. Thankfully, the top part where my daughter was sleeping is seperate and just fell flat on the ground. If you are looking for a crade or bassinet, I would not choose this one. I have seen countless other cradles that are cuter, and of better quality, and even cheaper, that I wish I could have gotten, but I've already wasted my money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay Away!","review":"A horrible bassinet that is not worth the money.

It continues the story of the Ballinger and Granger families with the return of Sloan Granger's sister, Roxanne, a supermodel, who comes home for Shelly & Sloan's wedding and decides to stay. I can't wait for another book in this line. I found it realistic, especially since I live in the area these two stories are based upon, and the characters are very much like many of the ranching families I know."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self indulgent","review":"Where was the editor? People were carried over from Return to Oak Valley with no explanation as to who they were. Lusty? Hah! There was a loose improbable plot.

You can swallow like a pill, or let it dissolve in your mouth for best heartburn relief if you are used to the non-taste of it. I only use 1 tablet at a time to avoid heartburn-acid-rebound. I also use it like \\"Prelief\\" powder by breaking up them and putting it in OJ or POM juice (7 tablets per half-gallon). I leave the cap bottle loose as pressure will build. Fun to watch it fizz.

I highly, highly, highly recommend it, for those of you in love with his voice the way that I am!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Multitalented Bakula \\"Quantum Leaps\\"over other \\"stars\\"","review":"Although I get quite a few disbeliving looks at the presence of this CD in my collection, the versatility of Scott Bakula far outweighs other considerations. The tunes compiled from the series show the extreme range of styles this talented performer is capable of. Just as he was able to believably play so many characters on the series, his ability to embrace a variety of musical styles brings to mind the stars of Hollywood's heyday who did it all. Too bad this is the only disc available to enjoy by this multitalented entertainer."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent books","review":"All of the Brambly Hedge books are wonderful. The stories are gentle and imaginative, and the illustrations are detailed and creative. I'd give all of them 5 stars except for one thing: the size of the books. On one hand their smaller size gives them a certain charm, but the first Brambly Hedge book I saw was one I took from the library in a \\"standard\\" picture book size, and you could just get lost in the illustrations. The smaller size of these books detracts from the loveliness of the pictures -- it's much more difficult to pick out the wonderful details, and the color is also a little less vibrant than the version I had seen, again making it hard to pick things out. What a disappointment, because the illustrations are half the charm of the books. If they had only made these books larger, they'd be perfect in every way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely but recommend for over 4 years","review":"This is a lovely book. The story is sweet with a twist, and the drawings are beautiful. Like another reviewer, I wish that the books were larger so that every detail of the illustrations could be seen well and lingered over. My grandson is 4 1/2 and I find that he is still a little too young for this book. He loved the illustrations and the story, but I did have to edit a bit, as it is rather wordy for his age, and his attention span isn't fabulous. He has an excellent vocabulary, but there were still some words that needed explaining, which broke the spell but which I considered a learning experience. The bottom line is that I read him to sleep with this book, and I enjoyed it, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Humorous","review":"Dr. Swanberg is a former pastor of First Baptist Church in West Monroe, Louisiana would you believe? Now he's a humorist who has made it big on the Christian circuit. This book is a collection of humorous occurences he's experienced and packaged.

Part of what makes his stories so effective is that most of us can relate to the incident he describes in the various episodes of his life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the back of a shampoo bottle instead.","review":"I'll admit that this was the first Leon Rooke novel I've read...and it will be the last. The only thing that kept me from chucking it into the nearest trash receptacle after the first few chapters was my tenacity and my quixotic belief that it just HAD to get better the more I read. Sadly, I was wrong. Upon finishing the last page, I stared into space, aghast that this book had actually been published. On a final note, I bought this novel at a used book store for $1.

It you try to put the top on without the dowels all the way in, they push out through the top or bottom of the unit and deface the unit.

When a new girl moves into town everyone loves her. She makes everyone feel like they are a part of something and she is never against anyone, but one day that loving and outgoing personality turns everyone against her. Everyone except Leo. This book made me think about not only what was happening to the characters in the book, but also how they related to me. The author does a fantastic job of making me want to read on. He ended lots of his chapters with unanswered questions or detailed plots. He also did a wonderful job of explaining each character in detail. Feeling like you know the characters always makes reading the novel more enjoyable. I would recomend this book to anyone who loves detailed, fun, positive books with a plot different from most others."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Different and Unique Girl","review":"Stargirl a girl that came from home schooler to High schooler at Mica High school.

She was sweet and kind, but she shouldn't stick up like that because her friends hammered her down. The only friend that she had at that time was Leo Borlock. The guy that felt in love with her, althought she was a totally different girl from the High School Girls, he felt in love with her.I recommed you this book, because the author Jerry Spinelli has write great books for kid and teenagers. He has a lot of stories that came from his experients with his wife and with his 7 Childrens. Jerry dedicates Stargirl to his Wife and childrens."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring...and hard to understand","review":"I thought this book wasn't very good. It was so boring to read. I could hardly understand it. Everything was just sort of mixed up! At some parts I didn't even know what was happening! It was kind of wierd and unusual. I didn't understand the book. I knew what it was about, but reading it just didn't sound like an interesting book. It was kind of scattered in all places. And it was wierd when the boy all of a sudden liked Stargirl. At first he was embarrassed by her and didn't want anything to do with her and all of a sudden he liked her. I really didn't understand the book at all. To tell the truth it wasn't a very realistic book. I'm more into books that have characters and events that happen in real life.

I read this book for one reason-to get a good grade in English.Jerry Spinelli has written good books, don't get me wrong, but Stargirl was basically taking the stereotypical idea of \\"the new kid in school\\" and twisting it in a way to which the girl was this odd person out of the blue.Never mind the fact that Leo, the narrator, and his best friend (whom I have forgotten the name of), sound very immature. They're supposed to be well into high school, but they sound like 7th graders.I was very disappointed when I read this book as I expected something more out of it than what I got."},{"rating":"1","title":"stargirl...the awful book of doom","review":"unimpressed. let down. i saved up my money and poof it was gone for a sucky book. unable to understand content. if you need firewood i will give you this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"huh? oh sorry, i fell asleep reading it","review":"This book was horrible and i never want to see the words Star and Girl in the same title. it was such a snoozefest it can burn in the deepest bowels of helllll for all i care. it was a waste of time and money, they should pay you to read it. i feel sorry for the tree that contributed to the making of this book.

It took me 3 months to get through this obnoxious and annoying story about this weird stalker named Stargirl. This book is very unrealistic, and most of the things in this book were just plain stupid. I cant believe my school made me read this tall tale about a alien girl and her pet rat. To make this book even the slightest bit better, I suggest that Mr. Spinelli should start completely over and write about a whole different subject.

Congratulations \\"Stargirl\\" on being the worst book ever written."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst book ever","review":"I can honestly say that this is the worst book I have ever read. The portrayal of homeschoolers as hippy love children who dress strange and act even stranger is appalling. I would strongly recommend this book to anyone who wants to read a book full of stereotypes, and strange endings. I would not read this book again if you paid me.

I love Harry Potter, too! ( I know a lot of peeps hate HP, but I think that the characters are far from fictional, the vividness of the discription is remarkable, and the amazingly unique story is truly inspiring.)

I did not like this book; it was very odd and didn't have a good story line. I enjoy stories when I can relate to them, but in this book there was nothing to relate to.This book wasn't good because the story line was horrible, and there was nothing normal about this book. If you like odd stories then you may like this book, but other than that I do not think you will like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a horrible book","review":"I normally love any book I read but this book was too weird. If I could give it a negative score I would. It's about a girlwho's really weird and a boy who collects porcupine neckties. Most people would say the girls unique but I say she goes beyond unique to just plain odd.Besides the book is too vaque, and is totally stupid.I really don't think anyone should waste their money on this book, so just don't buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't read this and waste your time","review":"It was stupid.....really boring (yawn)... very dramatic about highschool....star-girl was a werido...in life we would probably be friends...(yawn) Blah.

This isn't an adventure/action book, but rather a mellow, well written drama. Its very descriptive and could be made into a movie. The story is emotional, deals with issues that teens face regarding popularity, peer pressure, being kind to others and learning how to be yourself. This book will encourage you to be yourself, not to be afraid of what others think of you, and enjoy life to the fullest. Read it as a encouraging book, maybe for entertainment but it will help you like yourself and learn to change for the better."},{"rating":"2","title":"*good*","review":"this is a really good book and easy to read. its both happy and sad and really enjoyable. its about being yourself and not having to fit in all the time. read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Star Girl","review":"This book is a great book for all children in need of inspiration.

I agree that at times Stargirl seems too innocent and naive, but I love her all the more for it. I remember how it feels to be in high school clearly and this rings true.

I loved every second of it. Stargirl is the new girl at school. She's unique and doesn't care what other people think. She will just dance on the football field and she doesn't care if everyone is staring at her. The school haters her, than loves her, hates her, than loves her.

But it doesn't work becuase she chrees for other teams."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Touching book","review":"The book I read was Stargirl. I liked it because Stargirl teaches you not to care what people think about you. She is caring and does things for other people without someone asking her. The best part I liked was when Stargirl and Leo went to the mall and followed someone around for fifteen minutes and decided what kind of card that person got because she's always giving cards to people. I really liked the part when she showed Leo her wagon of marbles and how she was happy when there were a lot of marbles and when there were little marbles she was sad. I didn't understand why they talked about a cactus. But the book was really good"},{"rating":"2","title":"READ IT AND WEEP","review":"To be absolutely honest, I loved this book more than a lot of books I have read in a long time. It was beautiful but I found the end of it extremely sad. You will fall in love with Stargirl and want to be her best friend. You will cry when she does and feel passionate about everything she feels passionate about. You will long to make her feel happy. Not extremely descriptive, but wonderful."},{"rating":"1","title":"More contrived than creative","review":"I was looking forward to reading this book, but I felt that in a lot of ways it was very contrived. In a lot of instances, Spinelli will tell us something rather than demonstrating it, using flimsy characters and unlikely dialogue to back up his random assertions.His writing style is stilted and awkward and this book reads like someone who doesn't understand teens trying to write about them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Star Girl","review":"STAR GIRL is a great book about a young girl who moves to a new town and a new school. At first the kids think she is wierd, but soon enough she becomes popular. A boy named Leo(main character) seems to notice her more than anybody else. They devolope a relationship that Star Girl could have never shared with anyone. As they feel themselves getting closer together the kids at school are not very happy about their little relationship. Every day after school the retire to a magical place where nobody will bother them. Star Girl knows the ways of the earth and shares her discoveries with Leo.

One of my friends recommended this book to me because she says that I am just like Stargirl. I wanted to find out just the kind of person I am so I read the book! It was so great- touching, wonderful, inspiring, the best! In the story, Stargirl comes to a new school, and people don't know what to make of her- she is her own person and a great one she is. Stargirl doesn't fit in so Leo tries to change her so everyone else will like her and, well, I'll let you find out about Leo and everyone else if you want to read the book yourself. But if you do let me tell ya- you WON'T be disappointed. I normally get bored with a lot of books and forget about them, but this one I read from cover to cover. Stargirl showed me my real self. This book- and the girl in it are truly one in a million. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good","review":"This book is pretty good but at times can get long!!! I t does have some crude language.

Throughout the book Stargirl was loved, envied, and mistreated. When Stargirl leaves, everyone notices how important she really was, especially a boy named Leo Borlock.

In the case of this book, the term \\"young adult\\" refers to pre-teen and early teen. I (who am in my twenties) was almost embarrassed to read this book. Very childish, cliche at points, and shallow. I'm surprised I even got through it. Obviously for the target audience (which I say to be 10-14 or so), it's right on the money.

Every teacher of kids in 6th, 7-th and 8th grade ought to teach this book this year, as a way to head off the ogre of conformity that rises in those ranks. It's a story of compassion, of altruism and of eccentricity, a celebration of life. Stargirl is (in the words of george burns) happy to be anywhere. And it shows in her daily life, her lasting effects on the stodgy kids at mythical Mica High (brittle, useful but not very pretty). Read it with your kids.

Even though it wasnt meant to be said, at the end, I had a lump in my throat and my friend was crying. StarGirl has impressed all of us, not only Leo Borlock. The paragraph on the back is beautiful. Stargirl wins everyone over but this girl named Hillari ruins it for her and everybody hates her because she keeps cheering and helping the other team and embarasses people by singing Happy Birthday to them in the lunchroom.

Everybody should read it so that we are not fake. It teaches us to be ourselves.Stargirl, the new girl at school, is different from everyone else. At first she is popular but then they begin to hate her because she cheers for the other team in sports. She was always herself no matter what anyone thought or did.

I read it, and the next time I saw her we had a great conversation about it. Stargirl is a wonderful character who has all the flavor of childhood memory, the memory of first love, of comforting rain and the feeling of waking up. A character like this is both unreal and hyper- real. The lack of awareness that Stargirl shows towards her bullies is unreal; she doesn't protect herself at all. But the real message that you should do what you feel is right for your soul, regardless of the consequences is unsentimentally conveyed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Original","review":"I recieved this book from a friend for my birthday,I was reading a book then but when I got around to reading it I found it an excellent story and suggest it to everyone.I was really inspired by Stargirls lack of caring about what anyone thought of her.But ofcourse my being a typical person and not a GOOD person I couldn't change myself at all!Back to basics,I hope you read it and may I take the time to suggest Harry Potter?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stargirl","review":"SUMMERY:In this book the two main characters names are Leo and Stargirl.

I am an avid reader and read everything from historical fiction to modern fiction to future fiction to fantasy to mysteries to everything. There are only three books I can remember ever starting and not liking enough to finish. And you guessed it, Stargirl was one of them. I'm sure that some people would probably like this book, but I thought it was awful. I thought the characters and the plot were lousy and in fact the only thing I liked about it was the cover because they just put the pictures and not the title.

She's an individual, true, but the way she expresses it is just beyond the pale. It's like she either pretends everybody else isn't there or she's waaaaay in their faces.I'm a staunch individualist myself, but Stargirl simply goes beyond my idea of annoying.

The main focus of the story was describing how the other students reacted to Stargirl.I didn't like the book. It wasn't very realistic. Stargirl was too exotic to be real. The book didn't have a plot to keep you interested. It seemed to go on forever repeating the same thing over and over. It was an easy read for the age group that it is rated for. I probably would have liked it better when I was in fifth grade."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"My LA teacher made us read this book last year and we had to find all of these LA things in the book.

It is a very fun and interesting book. It's not too much toward young kids and it's not too much toward adults. It's more for kids going through adolescence. Stargirl can teach you things for later in life such as; you shouldn't change the way you are jus to be accepted. Personally, I wouldn't change myself for other people just to like me. I have my own way of things. That's what makes me an individual. Same as Stargirl. I don't think Stargirl should have changed her ways for other people. She's awesome just the way she is.

Spinelli tried to make this book very moving and inspirational...hmm...maybe that's why it's not an American classic? I have been more inspired by paintings in museums.The main character, Stargirl, was not believable at all. She was very immature for a high schooler and reminded me of a three-year old. Everything she did was random, also. She had her own special place in the Arizona Desert, which was supposed to be meaningful in the story, but it didn't make much sense. She also tried to go do nice things for people, which is sweet, but hard to believe.

Stargirl is queerer than what the other students are used to. Leo thinks Stargirl is weird at first, but is entranced by her. There is something about her that draws him to her and makes him feel great.Jerry Spinelli did an average job with Stargirl. The book wasn't horrible or great. It had its ups and downs. There was nothing special about Stargirl. The ending was dull. It had no meaning to it and just ended. Popularity isn't important to everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was a waste of my precious time.","review":"This book does not even deserve the star I am forced to give it. I was forced to read this book for summer homework. It was appalling. There was no plot to it. It was just \\"She's weird. The End\\". And her popularity goes up and down. What really creeped me out was hearing that Stargirl STALKED people, and Leo STILL had a crush on her. Also it seems to me that she was being weird for the sake of being weird. Pioneer dresses, for example, are impractical, uncomfortable, and by the standards of many, ugly. Which is why nobody wears them anymore. But Stargirl wore them to school anyway, which seems to me like being odd for the sake of it. And she's pretending to be a nonconformist. In conclusion, this book pads out the popularity of this fake nonconformist. If you like books with no plots, I reccomend this book, and a phone book would be of similar quality. If not, I reccomend you read a more enjoyable book."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's different but you can read it without taking a break!!!!!!!!","review":"Star girl is very different it is sort of hard to get into it at the beginning but when you do it is really good.

Jerry Spinelli adds a shocking twist and the end, which urges girls every age to read further. Spinelli also has flashbacks and dreams added to this book to make it one you will not want to put down! This book deals with friendship issues that most teenagers have. I read this book in a week! If you like The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants, than Stargirl is the book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Look Behind the Words","review":"Stargirl, an amazing book written by Jerry Spinelli is not an easy read though the words are simple. This book supplies your mind with many questions and quotes, similes and metaphors, and things that you don't understand. If you look behind the words and see the picture of the story, you will find love, happiness, sadness, anger, and fear. Together a story of an amazing girl, that's not shy and not afraid of anything. That girl is Stargirl Caraway. I think this book is good for kids ten and up because of the way that Jerry Spinelli wrote it. This book was fun and exciting to read. What I didn't really enjoy was how in one chapter the author put so much into your mind that sometimes you couldn't go on because you had to stop and think about what you just read to really understand the concept of the story.

People become pretty upset with this and then do not treat her with the respect she disserves. From then on her high school life is pretty difficult when it comes to her social life. Stargirl is a book for Fourth Grades, because at that stage of their lives they are becoming more social, and more aware of how they should be treating others.

The underlying moral of this book is that it is OKAY to be different...different can be fun, exciting and just downright hilarious.

You have found Stargirl, a freshman who dares to defy the normal order of her high school and goes out of her way to be nice to people. Everyone in Stargirl's high school, besides her boyfriend Leo, and her friend Dori, hates her. The story is told by Leo, who makes Stargirl sound so hopeless and pathetic that you'll want to rip the book to pieces. Although it is a fictional story, no \\"higher class\\" student treats their peers like the dirt they make Stargirl out to be. Incredibly dull and dreary, Stargirl is filled with boring details and similes that leave you depressed and unhappy. This is one book to leave at home."},{"rating":"2","title":"#1 star girl!","review":"Star Girl is probably the best book anyone could read.

It is a very unemotional book, very undesciptive, and strange. I've read almost all of Spinellis other books and when I came to this one, on page 50 where I was almost asleep, I decieded I just wouldn't finish it.

People rave that's it's inspirational and beautiful, but they only say that because it's different and they really don't know what they think of it. The truth is, it's totally out of whack. Stargirl is a very weak character, and Leo is weaker. All this book does is shows how awful and cruel people are today. Don't waste your money on this book. Read Harry Potter instead.

Stargirl was homed-schooled for most of her life, but then she went to Mica High. When she came to Mica High, everyone thought she was crazy. They thought she belong to an asylum. Rumors spread about her, but she kept on being herself, playing the ukulele, singing \`Happy Birthday', and caring about others. There were two guys named Leo and Kevin. They had a school TV show called \`Hot Seat'. Kevin thought it was a great idea to have Stargirl on the show. But after awhile of everything going great, karma struck. The TV show went all wrong. Find out what happen to Stargirl.In my opinion, this book was utterly stupid. It is a waste of time. The only reason I read it was because I was forced to, for a school-wide activity.

In Stargirl, Spinelli has introduced a character who is not afraid to be herself, who is unencumbered by others' opinions of her, and whose individuality of spirit is an inspiration.

Have you ever read a book, and once you finished, you didn't want to read anything else? Well, anyways, that's what happened to me with Stargirl. I felt conected to the characters while reading about their adventures. I liked all the small details that Jerry Spinelli added to the story (like Cinnimon the rat and the Moa birds) that made the book really come alive. I found the plot was a little bit predictable (thanks to the inside cover!), but I still liked it a lot. Jerry Spinelli has observed what teenage life is really like and incorporated it well into this story.

That is when she and Leo begin their friendship. They go out into the desert simply to watch, leave coins on the street, just for children to pick up, and they are kind to everyone, they are themselves. But when Leo is teased as \\"Starboy\\", he makes Stargirl change her ways, so she becomes Susan Caraway, a girl like anyone else, Leo likes her, but wonders if she will ever be herself again.

Also, I liked the part when Stargirl cheers for the other team, at the basketball and football games. I recommend Stargirl for girls. Boys would have a hard time understanding this book.

The only reasons I would have to say it was good is because it was well written and that it deals with the issues of feeling left out or feeling different at school.The reasons I did not like this book were because it was sort of boring and although it was well written it spent too long on one topic.

If I were to rate it on a scale from one to ten, I would have to give it a five for effort. While the moral of this story is a good one, I think that it is over used. Yes, unconditional love and acceptance are important, but this moral is played out in too many plots in books today. I also felt that Stargirl's character was a bit extreme. Her character did not seem realistic to me. She is overly individualistic, and in comparison to the people in the world today, I had a hard time taking her seriously.I felt like the characters were rapidly developed and more time could have been spent developing their personalities. I don't know that I would reccomend this book to a friend for any special reason. The book is not exactly unique in any particular way. The story is cute, but I think that this author would have much better success with a story line that is not so cliche."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stargirl Review","review":"I rate this book one star out of five. My reasoning for this rating is because it did not keep my attention. It really had no exciting areas. The book also lacked a decent climax, so it was really hard to follow the plot. Some of the characters (not Stargirl) were not very deep, and I found them quite shallow. For instance, I thought Hillary was not very deep at all; she was just portrayed as an evil person. One good thing about this book was that the details were not like any other book I have read.

Or should i say started it. I never got past page 30 or so. Why? I couldn't stand it! The character of Stargirl was simply annoying. The book was well written, yes, but when the character is so obnoxious that its difficult to function, the quality of the writing doesn't matter. I voiced my opinion to a friend, and she said, \\"Why is she annoying? Because she's herself and she doesn't care what other people think?\\" No, of course was my answer. Stargirl goes beyond individuality. She is different for the sake of being different. That message is passed on to preteens and teenagers like myself.

Seen through the eyes of a young man who must choose between the group and the individual, this story of school life should be an eye-opener for any who have not taken a close look at the effect of peer pressure (or any who have never felt its cruel sting). Spinelli does over play his hand a bit when portraying Stargirl as an individual who is overwhelmingly good; the deck is stacked so far in her favor that there is no balance. This does not dim the importance of Spinelli's message and STARGIRL sends an important message of tolerance to readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best I have read in a long time.","review":"I had been eyeing this book for weeks trying to deside if I was too old to read it.

She is a cheerleader who cheers for both teams. Even if the other team would make a basket she would start cheering because that was her personality, to be nice to other people. Her friend Leo who wants her to change into someone who is normal, is her best friend. She isn't normal because she dresses weird and acts very strange. She also changed her name to Stargirl from Susan. Leo ends up getting Stargirl to change by changing her into a normal person with normal clothes and changes her name back to Susan. I would recommend this book to anyone if they were trying to find a good book. It's a good book for anyone my age. I recommend that you read this book called Stargirl!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun to read...this stuff really happens","review":"This was a fun book to read about Stargirl. She was new at the high-school and she was a bit eccentric. She grew to be popular a few months after she arrived at the school, and a few months after that, was avoided in the halls. People stopped talking to her and this other boy, who were dating. You'll have to read the book to see how all of this came about, and it's really good. It has some good lessons for life, for example, not to care about what other people think about you. It was a fun book to read, and I loved the characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stargirl simply touching","review":"When I read Stargirl it was everyday at the book store after I had done my homework. And i could not turn the page quicly enough. The book is realy based on this girl but it's the guy telling the story. it's about a girl who is very special she plays ulekul or something like that. She wears long flowing dresses. She usses a canvas bag with a painted flower as a school bag. She is nothing but ordinary. She is special she dares to be real to be 100% herself i won't tell anymore of the story so I don't ruin it but it's one off those books that makes you think about where you stand and how you should realy B U. I stongly sugest you read this.!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!!","review":"I loved the book Star Girl. It had good morals and I couldn't put it down. I read it in 3 days and never wanted the book to end. It is about a boy named Leo and a girl named Star Girl. Stargirl is different from everybody else, but she doesn't care, until no one talks to her anymore and Leo says no one likes her. She tries to change to be liked. You will have to read the book to find out what happened with Star Girl and Leo. I recomend this book to all ages and hope you all love it to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Here's what I think.","review":"\\"Stargirl\\" by Jerry Spinelli was a very typical book. If I were to rate it on a scale from one to ten, I would have to give it a five for effort. While the moral of this story is a good one, I think that it is over used. Yes, unconditional love and acceptance are important, but this moral is played out in too many plots in books today. I also felt that Stargirl's character was a bit extreme. Her character did not seem realistic to me. She is overly individualistic, and in comparison to the people in the world today, I had a hard time taking her seriously.I felt like the characters were rapidly developed and more time could have been spent developing their personalities. I don't know that I would reccomend this book to a friend for any special reason. The book is not exactly unique in any particular way. The story is cute, but I think that this author would have much better success with a story line that is not so cliche."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Absolutely Loved This Book!!!","review":"I absolutely loved this book!!!

The reason I bought this single was for the unreleased track \\"Fly\\". In my opinion, it wasn't really worth it. \\"Fly\\" sounds sort of like a cross between the song \\"Everyday See You\\" (from \\"In This Skin\\") and early Mandy Moore songs from her \\"So Real\\" album.

How could Jessica destroy such a beautiful ballad that was sung so wonderfully by Terri Nunn of Berlin??? This is one if not the worse cover songs I've ever heard!Jessica has a decent voice and I'm not hating her but she needs to do something good. She's got the voice, she needs to stop letting the music industry do it all for her. Maybe if she wrote her own songs and produced her own music, she'd have a bigger fan base. Her songs are really boring if you ask me except for maybe \\"i think i'm in love with you\\" with help of John Mellancamp's beat. I wonder how Berlin feels about this remake. I bet they cringe when they hear it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This song was...","review":"Berlin was a cool band in the eighties. \\"The Metro\\" is still one of my favorite songs. \\"Take my breath away\\" finished them off as a group and was an overbearing, schmaltzy mess back \\"in the day\\". A remake by one of the cynical \\"buff gold\\" blonde pop queens of modern times is fitting. I don't have anything against pop music, but some songs are just too much. One aspect I did like was the warbley fretless [synth?] bass. The songs only redeeming feature."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE!!","review":"Don't even think about buying this, let alone listening to it!

Hopefully her career dies and she leaves us all in peace!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't Breathe Away","review":"I sometimes look at covers and older songs, just as a passing glance. Anyway, sometimes those older songs can be revealing then and now. Well, there sometimes can be a miss when it comes to a cover. Jessica Simpson really puts it out as a true and doubt reject. Her remake of Berlin's Take My Breath Away, is one of the worst covers I've ever heard right now in the music industry. It really sounds as bad as both Wynonna Judd's remake of Foreigner's I Want To Know What Love Is, and a mix of what is going on American Idol. The song is just not even close to as great a cover song, as other singers have mastered them. Unlike most of the other songs out right now, Jessica Simpson's Take My Breath Away is really bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting concept..","review":"\\"The Medusa Plague\\" is probably one of the most interesting Dragonlance books that is out there. Not simply because of the storyline, but for the characters as well. When I started this series, I had no idea whom the villians would progress to be. So, needless to say, in this book the actions of certain characters were a little suprising.Guarrand comes back to his hometown after finding out from his younger nephew that a mysterious plauge is decimating the village. Everyone who contracts this plauge gets the luxury of having their arms and legs turned into writhing snakes. They suffer for three days until finally turning to stone. (See the connection to Medusa?).Anyway, this book is good. I didn't like the series at first. But, with the addition of this book, it gets a little better. I can say by the end of this book I was enjoying this series much more than before. It is worth checking out. This book is probably the best out of the trilogy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as the first, but still worth reading","review":"OK, I admit, it's been awhile since I read it, but I remember fairly well my impression.

Weapons and equipment and insignia and decorations are also shown.The focus of the work is on the army, but other branches are also covered. This is an impressive volume and a must for collectors of militaria.

This is nothing compared to what she used to write. And Hugo is so boring. What happened to her deep brooding heroes who were scarred and afraid to love? Hugo is so thin he waves in the wind.She seems to be attempting to write something Dickensian with the 1850s setting, but it doesn't work. Plus the plot to kill Queen Victoria is just thrown in. Why not focus on Hugo having to prove who he is? And the claim that Victoria was seriously concerned with social reform is totally bogus!All together this book was a disappointment.

While keeping the 43 fables and fairy tales largely intact, James has done a bit of updating of pop culture references Stoopnagle may have used - certainly Stoopnagle never compared Beeping Sleuty to Spitney Brears and Rulia Joberts, as he'd bied before they were dorn. The book not only includes the fales and tables, but also appendices about Reverend Spooner, the Colonel, and Spoonerisms.

So, throughout the whole book, you will be reading about how Lucas hated himself for falling in love with his \\"enemy\\", how he had to deal with his own inferiority complex and whenever he felt guilty, he would lash out at Aislinn. *shrug*Give me a Judith Mcnaught anytime!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A GREAT BOOK...","review":"Sandra Brown's HONOR BOUND was a great book.

The design of the filter is mediocre at best. It took me about 4 hours to set up. I woke up the following morning and 5 gallons had leaked from the tank on to my carpet. I tried every possible trick to seal the canister (silicone glue and lubricant) with no luck. I tried contacting the company and it was nearly impossible. They have terrible customer service. After a week of dealing with the leaking filter, I returned the filter to Amazon (thankfully Amazon's return process is very simple). Subsequently I purchased a Fluval canister filter which has been running for about a week and seems to be working very well (no leaks, easy set up, quiet, crystal clear water)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great filter that has lasted 5 years now","review":"Still going after 5 years.

The book is jam packed with information on categories ranging from - Presidents, Geography, Cinema, War, Science, Language, Literature, and much much more.My copy has been through the 'wringer' going everywhere from my 7th grade classroom to my jeep to my bathroom to the kitchen. It's nice to have handy when you have a few minutes to kill and want to improve your knowledge base.I've read lots of trivia books and this one is great because it is simple to handle, has tons of information, and has few (if any) mistakes.Trivia Buffs get your copy now!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not good for games","review":"The book is attractive and organized nicely. I planned to use it as a source for trivia games. I thought it would work well because of the Q and A format. However, many questions do not have simple one word answers and most are very specific. Even an expert would not know most of these answers. If you are looking to simply read interesting trivia, then it would be good. But, if you are looking for a source for games, do not buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for a Quick Study of Mapping","review":"No, this is not an intense study of mapping, but if you're interested in gaining a quick overview of the concept so you can participate in a strategic mapping initiative, this article will help prepare you for the process. Also very useful as a visual reference aid while working through a more thorough publication such as \\"Strategy Maps\\" by Kaplan and Norton. For $7, I felt it a worthwhile purchase.However, there was a technical glitch. When I downloaded it, the article came up within IE6 and Adobe Acrobat. My printer was at the office and the File, Save menu options were greyed out. I didn't want to lose the article, so I clicked to Explorer in WinXP, located the LocalSettings folder and from there the TemporaryInternetFiles folder, sorted by size, and there it was - approx 3,500K. I copied and pasted into MyDocuments folder and it appeared with the proper name. I included this in my review in case you experience a similar problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful garden for each day of the year","review":"This book features lovely photographs of a wide variety of gardens from throughout the world -- one for every day of the year. The gardens vary quite a bit in their style, location and zone. The book is small -- 9.6 x 6.6 inches, but thick (2.1 inches) and heavy. Each two page spread is dated with a decription of the garden on the left page with the photograph on the right page. The book can serve as a perpetual calendar (as there are no years or days of the week, just months and days) with a different beautiful picture for each day or as an idea sourcebook for your own garden. Either way, the book is well worth the price given the large number of beautiful gardens that it features. I even discovered some public gardens of which I was unaware. So, the book can even serve as a guide to gardens (the public ones) that you might want to visit. This is a wonderful book for people who love gardens."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sheets leave alot to be desired","review":"I ordered two sets of these sheets because they were labeled \\"Sateen\\".

However, the way the documentary was filmed needed improvement."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Missed Opportunity","review":"How could a documentary about the beautiful Pere Lachaise cemetery ever go wrong? This filmmaker manages to make a botch of something that could have been quite stunning. She inexplicably spends most of the film on Marcel Proust and Frederic Chopin, and mostly ignores the other famous residents of this cemetery. There are some fine moments with everyday people as they tend the graves of their beloved family members--I wish the filmmaker had done more of this. I was really looking forward to this movie, but was extremely disappointed. Perhaps Ms.Honigmann should have entitled her film \\"Marcel Proust's Grave.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Eternity","review":"Every day since I bought this DVD last November, its enigmatic cover has been looking at me, waiting for the moment when it was best for me to watch the film behind it. Last night I unwrapped the face behind the plastic, and entered the Père-Lachaise cemetery through the magnificent eyes of Heddy Honigmann. In so doing I dunked the madeleine cookie into Proust's cup of tea, only this time the involuntary memories, longings, and painful appreciations came to me in slow motion and in inconsolable waves of joy. Everything I love about the French individual, their honesty, their words, their fatal attachment to beauty, their fearless insistence upon seeing an idea all the way to its end... all these things entered my heart against my will because of this exquisite film. I am more alive and grateful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy kindle version!","review":"The guide itself is a typical lonely planet, my only word of advice, DON\\"T BUY IT FOR KINDLE. Normally I would buy the paperback for a guide, but I live in Japan and its too expensive, so I chose Kindle. The formatting is horrible, you can't read any of the maps, none of the pictures display properly, and so on.On Lonely Planet's website they sell pdfs that are about the same price (or half the price if you catch them on sale) and the formatting and display is world's better.I really wish I could get money back on this and buy the Lonely Planet electronic version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good Info","review":"The book was very helpful for getting around Bali.

Every book up until this one provided little gold nuggets of information to help my investing. This book was so difficult to read it was like from another world. Here is an example of what you will find in the book:Data envelopment analysis, a mathematical programming approach, was first developed by Charnes, to measure the efficiency or performance of individual decision-making units (DMU's) in producing multiple outputs from multiple inputs. Unlike a parametric approach, which requires the researcher to make sometimes arbitrary assumptions about the functional... You get the drift.Anyway this book was a complete waste of money.

It may look like a full-sized CD album, but the disk actually contains only two tunes, for a total of less than eight minutes of music. The first tune is basically the opening music from Deep Space Nine with a drum going on in the background that does not fit with the music's beat at all. The second tune was one that I did not recognize.

There's a good mix of ballads and medium-tempo numbers, and every song is very, very (add your own superlative).

The DVD set which my wife purchased for me consisted of 10 short stories which could have been of any Western setting. Northwest Passage was supposed to be the forerunner to the Army Rangers, but these stories were basically frontiersmen facing adversity from Indians and Frenchmen, and not very exciting in the process. Probably due to the movie making skills of Hollywood that long ago."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Highlight of Peterson's Project","review":"I have never been a big fan of the Message translation of (commentary on) the Scriptures. As an X-er it seemed dated to me right off the press and I just didn't love what he did with some of my favorite texts. But when I saw the Peterson's attempt at the Psalms in a thrift store ($1) at the same time I was reading (and enjoying) his \`Christ Plays in 10,000 places,' I decided to pick it up. Bottom line: It would have been worth more than full price. Peterson's poetic style fits the Psalms much better than the narrative of the Gospels/Acts or Paul's analytical approach.

I think it may be of more interest to males due to the very gender specific content, but saying that women may well find it an interesting read for an insight into the male condition. I agree with an earlier review where it says this is a touch long winded and I have to say that after the superb 'Language of the Genes' by the same author, I've felt disappointed by every thing I've read of his since. This has plenty to say, but it could have been said so much better (hence the four stars).

I am a huge fan of the stage show - and actually just wrapped a series of sold-out performance back in May. I was ecstatic this was finally coming out and preordered it day one.Unfortunately, it's pretty awful. They for some reason felt like the show itself wasn't good enough so they added a bunch of terribly 1980's effects like bubbles, sparkles, and giant plungers. Quite possibly the biggest travesty is that they did not sing live, and some of the clips do not include the live audience. How can THIS show be done with LIP SYNCHING?And though it is cool that the original cast returns, a lot of them are on the tired sides of their careers, and just don't sound as good as they used to.Overall, this is an incredibly disappointing release.

I figured this book had more to it so I bought it instead. Although it's difficult to tell exactly what parts of some songs are because they flow together, the songs in the book are in the wrong order and this book seems incomplete at best. The only thing useful were the guitar chords. If you are buying this book for guitar it is not the one you wan't.

About every 2-4 days one of them keeps resetting to F or off and I move it back to countdown and it works for a while again. The second one usually remembers what to do for about a week. Not sure why they keep resetting themselves, its not rain, but it really makes them useless. I have one on a bug zapper and one on an exterior light. I tied swapping the locations thinking it was a ground fault or something? I got the same results on the same unit.

I enjoy reading books on mnemonic techniques, and can usually find one or two clever tricksin each, but in Cynthia Green's book I found only things that everybody already knows. And to compound the injury, her style is humorless and grossly overwritten.Picking a page at random, we find \\"What can you do to help yourself remember what was said?

There are pages that repeat themselves (for example, text on one page is repeated in a chart on a facing page), memory techniques that are not explained fully (mnemonics is not well presented) and no depth to offer the reader any new insight into improving one's memory.Kenneth Higbee (Your Memory) or Robert Goldman (Brain Fitness) offer two stellar alternatives to Green's somewhat boring and plodding book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excelent Book and Service","review":"Funny thing about this book.

Greenwood's style of writing - I typically thoroughly enjoy her books. However, I found myself becoming frustrated with \\"Nearer Than the Sky.\\" I wanted to learn more of the mother's relationship with her children, and what exactly she was doing to them and why. However, the book focused more on the main character's present-day life. What was revealed of the mother and the children, however, did pull at my heart - I felt for the characters.Also, my copy had several typos, including the misplacement of \\"the\\" several times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nearer Than Perfection","review":"Taking the title from an Emily Dickinson poem, it's a good example of Greenwood's beautiful prose, and how poetic she can write about something that is a very difficult subject to write about.Nearer Than The Sky is about Indie Brown, a grown woman, married and living far away from her family. Through very specific conditions and circumstances, Indie is thrown back into the world she grew up in and that means her family and her past. This lyrically beautiful book shows us Indie's past, present and future wrapped together so perfectly."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read","review":"As a parent I found this book terribly disturbing, there were passages that literally made my skin crawl.

Not highly recommended but somewhat interesting....","review":"I was excited to read this book because I knew it dealt with Munchausen by Proxy Syndrome (MBPS) and thought it would be fascinating. It was indeed somewhat interesting and certainly well-written, but I was hoping for more insight into the ways in which the mother and subsequently her daughter handled this disease and the ways in which it impacted on their own lives. I guess my only disappointment was that I was looking for more information and insight into the condition/disease itself and the ways in which the characters harmed their children and how they each of them dealt with it on an emotional level, than just how it impacted the family on a larger scale.While I don't highly recommend this book, I thought it was certainly interesting and a good overall book. It could make an interesting book club selection too."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book!","review":"Very rarely do you come across a book that you cannot put down- this is one of those books. T. Greenwood goes beyond the t.v. movie approach to the subject of Munchausen's by Proxy and artfully explores the story of the lasting effects it had on Indie and her family. This book is wonderfully written and crafted in such away that I was actually disapointed when I got to the last page- simply because it was over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow! This book is fantastic!","review":"I am not going to give a story summary - the rest of the reviewers have done a good job at that. What I will tell you is that this book is fantastic. I could not put it down. Lately I have had a hard time focusing on reading because my books have not grabbed at me very well. Nearer Than the Sky grabbed at me.

I bought this camera for my 7 year old daughter for Christmas. It says that it takes regular AA batteries, but the image was very poor and the sound was inaudible. I replaced the batteries with brand new rechargeable Energizers and the video was better but the sound was still garbled. I took this back to Toys R Us and was told that they do not take returns on electronic items that have been opened, even with a receipt and even if it's defected, you can only get an exchange (not even a store credit). They didn't have any more in stock, so I was stuck with it, or so I thought. Then I took it to another Toys R Us, the Customer Service person at that store said that it seemed that everyone they sold was being returned because it didn't work. That store refunded my money with no problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"A much needed up to date text book on Risk","review":"There has for some considerable time been a need for a compehesive and up to date text book covering the whole range of issues and techniques associated with risk and reliability in the process industries and Mark Tweeddale's book meets this need admirably.

I knew it was working and felt safe.The filters definately worked because after a few jobs they were done. I could see all the junk they saved from my lungs.I am on here buying replacement filters.

It is very lightweight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked very well for me","review":"I recently had a small amount of vinyl floor tile to remove, and it contained a small amount of asbestos. After talking with an abatement professional, I purchased this respirator and a good heat gun and carefully removed the tiles. I needed to have the windows open and work under negative air pressure, so it got very hot in the area where I was working (90 degree day in the south). The MSA respirator was comfortable throughout the removal. The MSA respirator is easy to adjust, and when you get the straps in place, the soft rubber surround forms well to your face for a good comfortable seal. The HEPA filter disks are easy to replace, and give you confidence in breathing clean air in most environments."},{"rating":"2","title":"Equipment for an affordable price","review":"I was amazed to be able to aquire this mask for so little.I've wanted one for years since my first one got too old and finding filters was a trip across the state.Thank You for helping me restore my eqipment items."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blue rubber mateial deteriorates quickly","review":"This mask truly is horrible in my opinion. We purchased two of them during different times of the year, and both started deteriorating. Instead of being cleanable, these start to chunk off like a really lousy pencil eraser. It's a gummy type of rubber not meant to last. We've only used them for dust, no fumes/solvents. Since the blue rubber doesn't stay intact, seals become nonexistent around the face where it counts.The other huge CON about this mask is that it causes pain when wearing glasses. Something to do with the position it forces the pads on the glasses upward. Most people wear these masks with hearing protection, and that further causes pain where the nose pads are. They could've streamlined this design much more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good fitting dust respirator","review":"I bought this for doing demotion on some walls in our house.

Best of all, you will find that ALL OF YOUR CLOTHES COORDINATE and flatter your natural coloring. In addition, you'll know the correct makeup colors to use as well as which hair color looks best on you. I just can't say enough good things about this book and color system. It's not some 80s phenomenon to be forgotten.

But I found this book immensely helpful in discerning subtle color issues I had been guessing at. Ms. Jackson speaks to the reader in a quiet yet directive way, guiding the decisions to find colors best suited in clothing, hair and make-up. This book exceeded my expectations in providing nonjudgmental guidance toward understanding my own coloration and to developing a \\"feel\\" for my true color nature. I recommend this book to anyone who feels challenged by all the palettes and textures and cuts available in today's world. Though written years ago, her sensibility toward style seems timeless. I got lost a couple of times in her wording, but realized I was just needing to reread to get her meaning. I felt very empowered by this book and believe other inexperienced girls like myself will be as well.Best wishes,paige"},{"rating":"2","title":"You can't get the colors","review":"This is an excellent book which I refer to often.

Skin tone determines your season more than anything else.If you want a book that will really be a big help in narrowing down your season, I highly recommend Bernice Kentner's Color Me A Season. It's much more descriptive, and you will have a much easier time figuring out which colors look best on you. One little secret:Everyone absolutely loves the colors that look the best on them. If you go clothes shopping, and stick with the colors you absolutely adore, you will always look fantastic.

Almost twenty years later, I still have the color swatches, and still rely on them for choosing what shades to wear.The book gives the information. Unfortunately, printing methods don't show the dramatic differences that holding the fabric sheets under a person's face does, as we did back in summer camp.I've seen (and agree with) the complaints here from women of color that this book doesn't meet their needs. I'd suggest \\"Women of Color\\" by Darlene Mathis as an alternate resource. It applies the seasonal system with darker skinned women in mind. Carol Jackson, who wrote this book, wrote an introduction to \\"Women of Color,\\" where she admitted the shortcomings in her book, and endorsed the new book as taking the next, needed step.Refreshing, to see an author recognize and endorse another author's correction for their own book's shortcomings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"I just loved this book!

Then think and process information the way your user will think and process, and design your application for them, not you! Easy concept to say and comprehend, but rather hard to actually do.

Go figure. Tog really does help you understand how most others will process, and that understanding makes you a better developer.My company makes these chapters on processing information a required reading for all new developers that join the company. It is that good. The Intuition quiz, the one that tries to help you see how your own brain stores and retrieves information, is an addiction for every new reader.

To me, the controversy over whether a 4-year-old painted these pictures in their entirety is not the issue. The bottom line is, someone painted these pictures, and they are remarkable! I don't care if the child painted a little or a lot or if her father helped a little or a lot, I still love the artwork. I know the price of the artwork has been affected (positively) by the uniqueness of a child being the artist. But the paintings are still beautiful. In fact, the pictures she painted on camera (Ocean, etc...) that were considered not as advanced as some of her previous works by her critics were actually some of my favorites.Anyway, the documentary is really interesting, and even my 8-year-old enjoyed it.

It appeared to me as if a good down payment from his publisher was his key motivation rather than literature (I saw Asimov do the same think with his later Foundation novels). The storyline was incredibly weak and finally fizzled into about 3 weaker non-endings. Characters were invisible to my mind's eye; twists generally turned into Moebius vortexes and the SF concepts were generally self-indulgent and verging on lifeless. Sorry, I was a huge fan until yesterday - hey Ian M. Banks, where's your Culture gone?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the price","review":"Let me be succinct. This is a four star novel with a 25 star price. Quite frankly, outrageous. I have stopped purchasing novels from the author for this reason.

His all-powerful Culture civilization has huge potential and that is what has kept me going. But I have grown to now detest them because of their immorality, their aloofness and their invincibility.I also find his academic style of writing annoying and a chore rather than enjoyable.Throughout the story there are many, many pages of complete waffle that add nothing to the story and appear to be an obvious, but failed attempt, to add some color and depth.Then two thirds of the way through this book, it becomes very obvious as to what the outcome will be. The problem is that Iain Banks has made the Culture so powerful that they are unbeatable and virtually immortal. So any clash with the Culture is destined to fail. So if the plot revolves around a clash with the Culture, as this does, then the outcome is predetermined and the reading boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Culture novel","review":"I'm about halfway through and so far I've really enjoyed the book. Bank's prose is excellent as always and the story builds up slowly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid book, HORRIBLE KINDLE EDITION","review":"First, let me say I'm a fan of Ian Banks' Culture novels. Look to Windward is solid and enjoyable, if not quite the pinnacle of Culture books. Others are better reviewers than I, so I'll leave it at that.What I really want to focus on is the inexcusably bad editing of the Kindle edition. Be warned that if you purchase the electronic edition of this book, you'll grit your teeth every time you encounter one of the DOZENS of typos in the text. I don't consider myself a perfectionist. I've encountered the occasional typo or two in printed books and not been upset. But this book quite literally as 10 times as many typos as any other book I've ever read, and I have read many hundreds of books.Whoever was responsible for the Kindle edition of this book should be ashamed of themselves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, poor kindle conversion","review":"It was truly a pleasure to once again be immersed in Bank's Culture setting, as well as to read a book on the kindle 2 for the first time. I was disappointed, however, in the quality of the kindle conversion. There were frequent typos in this version, and many regions in the text where a section break between plot lines was deleted so that these paragraphs ran together on the kindle, making it difficult at times to detect when a setting or scene had changed."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved it","review":"But I love the Culture series. Banks is having fun with this one, stowing his nicely disguised utopian communist ethics lessons into the text. There is a perfectly OK story too, but not as strong as his best. Some of the tricks have been used before. The plot needs more tension. And Banks salts the story with exotic episodes that aren't structurally related to the story line. That's my main complaint about his books, I guess. But just imagine what it must be like as a writer to have your mind so full of these bizarre scenes that they have to be tossed out to make space for other wild stuff. Banks is great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written and edited, but some good content","review":"An author with a master's degree has the writing skill of a sophomore in high school. He uses the passive voice extensively, which makes understanding his instructions and recommendations difficult. A writer of a technical instruction piece should never use the passive voice because it is imprecise.He pads sentences with unnecessary words, uses split infinitives, and uses adjectives such as \\"which\\" as sentence subjects.He buries important points in long-winded sentences.While some of the content is very good, its organization is poor, particularly the chapter on Introduction to Action Script.Some of his exercises are useless.

This is what Emmanual must have been refering to on a PBS special when he complained about how record companies expected him to play instead of how he wanted to play."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing!!!!","review":"I think Tommy Emmanuel is one of the top guitarists in the world. I'd rather listen to Only than any other CD. I also love the CD entitled just Tommy Emmanuel. This review is for an inported set of CDs. When he plays with other artists and plays \\"American music\\", it just buries his exquisite talent. When he plays his own compositions, it's magic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea, but not very durable","review":"I ordered this product because I liked the idea of it being antibacterial and anti-mildew. I'm not sure what I expected, but as I took it out of the box I thought to myself \\"this is just a corkboard\\" and wondered if it might have been cheaper to have gone to a home or tile store and bought a square of corkboard instead.I've had this cork bathroom mat for 6 months and it hasn't held up well at all. I put it outside the tub and after 2 or 3 months the corners started to curl up. Unfortunately I accidentally stepped on one of the curled up corners and it broke off. I still use it, but it looks pretty ratty and has gotten darker/grimy from use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works as advertised","review":"I do recommend this product and have no complaints.

It is not absorbent, which is supposed to be a good thing, but I'm not sure what the point is. So now, instead of standing on the floor when I get out of the shower, I stand on a piece of cork that then has puddles on it. I finally put the bathmat over it, so the bathmat sits on the cork and the floor never actually gets wet. I wouldn't recommend this because I'm not really sure what the purpose of this mat is."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get it.","review":"I've only had this thing for 1 day and it already curled up around the edges. The water takes forever to dry as there are small ridges all over the mat, so when you get out they fill up with water and it feels like you're standing on tiny puddles.

Unfortunately, he does not seem to have one, and his book is testament to this on a paragraph by paragraph basis. Filled with mangled phrases, bizarre digressions, lack of narrative coherence, dreadful historical generalizations, pointless personal anecdotes and sappy sentimentality of the most jarring kind. Imagine the worst kind of local history writing - complete with small town boosterism and infatuation with staggeringly boring local trivia. Now imagine it spread out over 330 pages. Avoid at all costs. Really."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 Stars for the 20% of the Book Worth Reading","review":"The first 70 pages, detailing the local history and the actual shark attacks, were interesting and engaging to this Jersey shore enthusiast. Afterward, the author lurches through a mind-numbing, ambling, confusing discussion of what kind(s) of shark might have been responsible for the attacks. I wondered at various points whether Dr. Fernicola might have been paid by the word. In any event, buy this book (if you must--I'll give you my copy for free!) for the history. Watch \\"Shark Week\\" on the Discovery Channel for a coherent analysis of shark behavior."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't End Your Book At Chapter 3","review":"The \\"definitive\\" history of the New Jersey shark attacks of 1916. And we get that in the first three chapters.And then we get endless speculation about what kind of shark orsharks did the attacking, why it happened, other shark attacks world wide, and author nit-picking with other shark experts opinions -- repetitive and long-lasting stuff.All in all, a good first draft effort. An editor would have had the author revise and restructure, cut the anecdotes, most of the speculation, and about a hundred pages, add some useful maps to show the scenes of action, and it really could have been something."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jaws was based on these events","review":"This is a riveting tale whose events led to the creation of Jaws. Fernicola clearly and brilliantly tells this historical tale such that the book must be read in 1 sitting. This book, unlike others which attempt to tell this story of actual events, is based upon the author's meticulous research which even included interviewing the last of the surviving witnesses. It is a must have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Read","review":"Once I started reading this book, I couldn't put it down. Instead of just giving facts about the attacks, the author really places you in the setting and you can vividly imagine life in New Jersey in 1916. I had read about these attacks before, but never in such detail. I also really like how the author gives you every opportunity to formulate your own theory on what shark or sharks were responsible, as well as his own theory at the end. I will read this book again and for a person that doesn't normally read, that's saying something."},{"rating":"2","title":"Twelve Days of Terror:A Definitive Investigation of the 1916 New Jersey Shark Attacks","review":"I really enjoyed this book.

It was almost as if the author was searching for something more to add to each subtopic but couldn't find anything and so just repeated himself. If you're intereted in sharks or shark attacks at all, you will definitely find this book interesting but beware, you will be reading the same information more than once! Out of sheer stubborness I finished the book but I was relieved when it was over! I'm very surprised that this book has such high reviews!"},{"rating":"2","title":"DEFINITIVE CASE STUDY","review":"Having recently finished \\"Close to Shore\\" - another book about the 1916 New Jersey shark attacks -I was keen to read Richard Fernicola's \\"Twelve Days of Terror\\". The respective writing styles are quite different with the former book adopting more of a novelistic approach while the latter offers a detailed scientific analysis of the attacks . For those who are new to the subject the first book will provide an excellent introduction to this extraordinary historical event. If you really want to get all the facts, however, you need to read Dr Fernicola's definitive case study but you should understand that there is alot of very detailed information which could prove to be a bit \\"Heavy Going\\" unless you are a serious student of shark research."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"Could not put it down. Read the entire book in 3 commutes to NYC. As a Jersey shore resident, I was totally taken by the true tales of the past. The depiction of the Jersey beach communities of that era made me want to be there. (Its kind of a cross between Somewhere in Time, Titanic and Jaws) The detective work made me feel like I was in the story. It'll be tough to swim in the ocean again......"},{"rating":"2","title":"First half is great","review":"The first half of the book is a good adventure story. I wanted to spend more time with the victims and onlookers and less time with the second half of the book.

Why?Because the Firewire reader requires a *powered* connector (the reader draws its power from the computer, it does not have an independent power supply). The device will connect to either a FireWire 800 9-pin connector or to a FireWire 400 6-pin connector, but NOT to a FireWire 400 4-pin *unpowered* connector, which is what most laptops have (Apple MacBooks excepted).That in itself is not the reason for the poor rating I gave this product.

They breathe well and don't bother me after wearing for a long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good headphones, poor quality","review":"Headphones fell apart after about 3 months of use. The plastic part that holds the 2 metal bars that go across your head crumbled, and they wound up touching the metal screw in the middle (which shorts it, since those wires around the top actually carry the signal to the right speaker). I figured I'd be clever and repair it with solder/epoxy... which worked after some trial/error. But another 4-5 months later, and I'm experiencing the same problems, which leads me to think it has something to do with the way the bars torque when the phones bend slightly. The product wasn't thrown about or abused, but got regular daily use. As far as sound quality, it was very good for open-air headphones. Very easy to hear people trying to talk to me while gaming (which is what I bought them for).

I bought these as a carry around pair of cans I could use with my iPhone. It fills that need quite well. Comfy fit, good sound, great value. The negatives are that the material of the pads can make you get a hot ear. I'm comparing it to my beyerdynamics 990. My 990 are super comfy and has a felt like finish leaving your ear pretty cool. Other negatives are the build quality being pretty cheap, and the bulky size.With all that in consideration, I would recommend this to anyone looking for cans in at under 100. At that price I think your top choices are Gredo and Sony and these. All good headphones for diff reasons, but I think this one gets the edge for comfort, sound, and value."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!!!!","review":"I just bought this headphones and i feel like I'm listening to two monitor speakers, they're awesome.You won't regret"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing.

If you're looking for crazy bumping bass, go somewhere else. These, when properly amped, are incredible, and for 100 bucks, you cant go wrong. The only issue is I have a hard seeing myself using these at school or out of the home. They are quite big, but sound awesome. Very clear, defined bass, mids and trebs are near perfect.

I know a screen would make it even better, but its a big win knowing that I don't have to make that investment right now. There are multiple inputs sockets of various types on the back and switching sources is easy. I'm projecting this at low power on a wall 13 feet away and getting an HDTV image nearly 10' diagonal.

I spent one hour trying to get a human being on the phone who could process my warranty. I spoke with five people and only one mentioned 3 months/500 hour warranty for the bulb. However, he was in commercial area not consumer and told me to call yet another number.The bulb is SUPPOSED to last around 3,000 hours but in my case it lasted six times less.If you plan on using this projector as your primary video output, don't waste your money and spend a little more for a plasma.at $1,999 this unit is a bargain until its real cost catches up - an additional $1,200 per year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tony Horton Has Changed My Life","review":"This is an amazing entry level program to build up your stamina, strength, and physical fitness.I started this program in July 2011 and after completing two rounds I am now onto P90X and almost done with my first round of that.The process that Power90 takes you through is amazing.

I thought I would start with Power 90. I had just finished a 30 day adventure boot camp so I thought this program would be a perfect follow up. I assumed the four phases meant four different workouts. Boy was I wrong.... You do the same workouts every other day for two weeks for phase 1 and phase 2 is the same just with additional weights. I was bored to death by the end of the first week!! Tony kept messing up on his reps and would do something with his right side and call it his left and then say his right two seconds later. I could feel the workouts working and the ab workout killed me, but after doing the SAME workout over and over and over I just couldn't do it anymore. The mistakes in the video drove me nuts! I should have just bought the P90X and sucked it up....."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful, Entertaining and Informative Book","review":"This book is delightful--I've bought 7 copies over the years for friends and family.

In the end I pushed a needle shaped inflator that is used for basket and footballs down the extremely teeny tiny fill valve and discovered the the very thick bottom was a flap that would only partially open to allow air to pass into the air bladder. This valve was designed by a cretin. It would take most of an hour to fill and all day to empty.Thank heavens for Amazon's liberal return policy. My UPS store is 2 minutes walk from my home and the product was on its way back about 12 hours after it arrived.

It is missing many safari package types that have become popular since the book was written and there are descriptions of countries that no longer exist. The sections on equipment, from clothing to firearms, are also quite dated.The story fill was a little boring, although the sections covering each game animal type had their entertaining moments and insights.

This book also goes over how to write an agenda, minutes, and committee reports. It goes over the duties of each member of the board. This book has become my Bible when presiding over my board.The best part about this book is that it is organized and written clearly. The problem with most books on Robert's Rules is they follow the original text -- which is written in formal, \\"contract\\" language -- too closely.

Because of this, you will have to pay 60 dollars or more for a great or out-of-print edition.

Pick this one up and use the glossaries from you other books (such as Teach Yourself Icelandic, Colloquial Icelandic, Icleandic, etc...) to supplement what this edition leaves out. The other reviewers seem to have alot of money, which explains their disdain for this cheap edition and absurdly expensive recommendations.

The wisdom found in these pages is sure to put any dating (again) boomer on track and well-equipped for an often frightening experience. Loved the author's humor and boomer bits. It took me back but also propelled me forward! Thanks Alpha Books and Dr. Helgoe for this clever guide. Definitely recommending to dating friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful desktop reference","review":"This book is very useful in my practice as a general practitioner and Travel Medicine Specialist.

I give him the answer. The USA was still a little paralyzed from the militarily-crippling antiwar demonstrations of the late 1960's early 70's. Those demonstrators made it hard for the USA to use the american army, navy, air force and marine corps in any kind of fight. True we used the military in Desert Storm but only till the Iraqis were out of Kuwait. Taking over Iraq in 1991 was too sure to bring heavy US civilian protesting movements. By 2003 the former 60's protester were too old or had passed away or were now too involved in their own lives to take such an active part in organizing effective demonstration movements."},{"rating":"1","title":"help!

I cannot imagine equating tolerance of evil with tolerance of a buddhist friend, or a non-christian friend, or a muslim friend etc. This book was ridiculous, but it was also scary.What would Jesus do? I try to think of that. He would invite everyone in to dine with him and love us all. After all God made all of us in his image, we are all here for a reason.

The movie excerpts are from clippings from old films and the clarity is beyond recognition. I find the excerpts very irritating. They were a lot of flickering (as if you are watching a movie or television show using an old television set or your set back to the 1950's when the frame of the TV screen keeps on flickering continuously until the screen stabilizes). The running time is actually more or less an hour and not 90 minutes as advertised. The special features are not really special anymore because they were just repeats of the main feature. You will realize that you will watching the same scenes a couple of times. Some scenes are shown more than five times just to stretch the time. Do not waste your money with this DVD. I wasted mine!

The quality of the silent movies are much better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Video For Learning about Gladiators","review":"As a high school teacher, I found that this video passes the basic test of an 'educational' video--it informs and entertains. My freshmen enjoyed it and stayed focused. The information is accurate and presented in an interesting and coherent manner. Good use is made of Hollywood archival footage as well as live shots from a school in northern Italy devoted to recreating the lives of gladiators down to the smallest detail. Backed by concise background information on the Roman Republic and Empire. It would also be of interest to anyone with an interest in the Roman Empire, and good background for such Hollywood films as Spartacus and Gladiator. Recommended. 4 and a half stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"The grim reality behind the Hollywood spectacle","review":"I thought this video was an excellent documentary, which should be viewed alongside the recent Academy Award winning movie.

This book keys into the ongoing debate about the validity of a dialogue between faith and reason. Ratzinger examines the unfolding of philosophical thought, its high points and pitfalls. He parallels this against an exploration of theology, properly exercised. As important as it is for philosophy to be properly articulated, it is even more important that theology have its proper sphere and be guided, lest it obliterate the use of reason, or not face the encounter with reason squarely. In this back and forth of faith and reason, Ratzinger explores many issues that are pertinent in today's world, such as the place of faith in the public square, the importance of pluralism and freedom.

Mimi sang in the group with her friends and her mother wanted to be a singer...this had to have left an impression upon her. As far as the New York characters of Lena and Vanessa, while somewhat interesting, Mimi at this point is still a \\"child\\"...hence her relationship with two \\"very worldly\\" women which appear to have almost every vice there is between them can only go in a predictable direction.In closing, while I find the information (of which I am sure the Ms. Kennedy has gathered from her own life in this world) about the \\"hip hop world\\" interesting...I can not recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bling?
