The rest of the book has the quality of downloads from the web and excerpts from pamphlets left over from museum visits.

I found this emotional passion to be very endearing and erotic.Each also seemed to really appreciate and savor the other's body. Although their erotic scene was shorter than Xana and Dax's, I felt like it had a better arc to the \\"story\\" (if one could call having sex a story).I would buy this again, and out of Tony Comstock's films I would probably recommend this film for a heterosexual couple's first.

The adult portion was stunning: well filmed, you can see their faces pretty much throughout, and the couple are obviously enjoying one another.Most \\"porn\\" leaves me cold, and doubly so my wife.

That series of VHS tapes included a great deal of foreplay in a loving and sophisticated way, with the couples talking and communicating during lovemaking.

I read Mother of Pearl, and for the most part liked it, but Willem's Field was much more to my taste. Set in 1970s Mississippi, this book is a study of very real people with very real issues, quirks, and afflictions.Small town life is perfectly portrayed, and the characters are nicely developed. The darkness and heartbreak that goes hand in hand with the real life struggles of this family is something that the author handled exceptionally well. I particularly enjoyed the way Willem's panic attacks were portrayed, and the humor (most of it dark) that balanced the hardships was great. The story was a little slow at times and there were a lot of sub-plots to follow, but once I got into the rhythm of the writing and how the story went from Willem's viewpoint to viewpoint of the Tills, I was pulled into the story in a very satisfying way.I recommend this book and will look forward to more from this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Book for Everyone","review":"Jennifer Gonnerman tells the story of Elaine Bartlett, a young mother of 4, sent to jail for 20 years to life for a first offense of transporting 4 ounces of cocaine.

Jennifer Gonnerman has woven Elaine Bartlett's personal story into the larger context of drug laws, prisons, rehabilitation or the lack of it, and the continual punishment of \\"life on the outside\\" that greet the 600,000 ex-cons that leave our prisons each year.

Not a word here about the roles that the slave trade and piracy by such delightful fellows as Drake and Morgan played in the growth of capitalism in Britain and North America. If free market capitalism brings freedom, then how come such tyrants as Pinochet, Francisco Franco and Somoza loved it? And why did the German capitalists finance Hitler? John D. Rockefeller and J.P.

The only thing that is strange to me is that the shape of the cone part seems different that the standard, so it feels a bit large, even though the nipple part fits fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked for Me!","review":"I have a history of difficulty with breastfeeding. After my 3rd child was born, because I am not working outside the home, I wanted to really make an effort to breastfeed as long as possible. I was using an Ameda hospital grade pump at home to help bring in my supply. When my son became sick and was hospitalized in another city, eventually requiring surgery, I used a Medela Symphony pump at the hospital. FINALLY - a breastshield that FIT comfortably and allowed me to double pump every time. I have NEVER had a problem using these - they fit perfectly and made my job so much easier! Because of them, I was able to keep up my milk supply and help my little man recuperate using my own expressed milk."},{"rating":"2","title":"So much better than the softfit shields","review":"I got the softfit shields with my Medela feeestyle pump and they rubbed so much and leaked badly if the fit wasnt perfect on my breast. I didnt pump for awhile necause it was so uncomfortable. I got these shields after reading the reviews and they are so much more comfortable! You wouldnt think they would be because they are hard, but they are."},{"rating":"2","title":"As described...","review":"Purchased these breastshields for use with my pump in style medela breast pump. The box contained two, hard plastic, breastshields which attach to connectors (sold separately). You will also need valves and membrames. I purchased because the shields that come with the pump in style were size M (24mm), which didn't fit. Good purchase and good price compared to other online and in-store products."},{"rating":"2","title":"great! better than soft fit breast shields!","review":"I bought the Medela Freestyle pump, which came with the Soft Fit breast shields. After a few uses, the shapes were getting a bit warped-looking and I needed an extra set of breast shields to take to work, so I bought these. I actually like these better than the Soft Fits! They do not bend like the Soft Fits do, and apparently I pump milk faster with these (probably because it doesn't yield like the Soft Fits do, and being rigid, applies more pressure to the breast). I liked these so much that I bought another set to keep at home as well. I also like the fact that these come in different sizes, while Soft Fits are only available as one size (24mm). I highly recommend these for anyone with the Medela Freestyle pump!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for C cup mommy, should be standard size","review":"I'm not \\"large\\", I'm a comfy C cup, but these are much more comfortable and seem to express more milk than the medium size that comes with the pump. I agree with other reviewers who say this should be the standard size."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too large for me","review":"I own the Medela Freestyle and tried to use the soft cup shields that came with it but it left me sore and swollen. I'm a full C cup normally and thought the 30mm would be a good fit, but after using once it didn't seem to be doing the job. I later purchased the 27mm and they are perfect. It makes all the difference in the world by having the right size...no soreness, no swelling, and very efficient! If you think the breast shields that came with your pump are too small, they probably are. No point in owning a good quality breast pump if it doesn't fit you. These are worth every penny!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Seller \\"MORE BABY STUFF\\" selling OPENED BOXES!","review":"The Amazon seller sold me an opened box. this is unsanitary as these are factory sealed for sanitary reasons and now I'm stuck repackaging and shipping it back. Ridiculous! Please don't buy from them! I have already reported them.The product itself I already owned and I can tell you that I'm finding them quite uncomfortable. I've tried the 24mm, 27mm and the 30mm and all have caused me problems with nipple damage. I'm now trying the Pumpinpals shields and while it takes me a couple minutes longer to letdown with them, they are far more comfortable. I recommend buying all sizes. I thought I might use the largest, but I used the middle. Cheers,"},{"rating":"1","title":"milk pools in long tunnel. canadian customer service unsypathetic","review":"we have the freestyle breast pump, and it comes with the 24mm breastshield. we tried-out the 27mm breast shield but the tunnel length (distance to the pump-head) is much longer than the 24mm breastshield, so the milk pools in the tunnel!!i think design doesn't work well for us, so i called the canadian medela customer service and they said too bad, that's the way it is. they should have tried some gesture to satisfy me as the customer over a 9$ product (we've spent hundreds of dollars on medela products) but i guess they don't really care about \\"customer service\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amen!","review":"Just received these larger size breast shields today and AHHHHH....what an improvement!! Wish I had known about these sooner, rather than suffering through pumping with my first baby and now 2 months into pumping with my second. Who knew such a simple and inexpensive adjustment could make such a difference? I exclusively pump (due to feeding issues)8-10 times per day. I assumed the redness and soreness were a product of frequent pumping, but I can already tell these larger shields will eliminate the discomfort. The medium shields (24mm) that came with the pump even LOOK small now, no wonder! Certainly worth the money :) And bonus, these shields fit with the standard flange ~ no special attachments needed. I'm a happy mom!"},{"rating":"2","title":"high quality precision product","review":"High quality, well made, safely packaged and reasonably priced. Shipping was VERY fast! As usaul, Amazon had the lowest listed price and stragely enough, another 3rd praty dealer on Amazon also had the highest price that I could find (almost double). Anyway, I would suggest two improvements: 1) a one page set up guide would have avoided several minutes of frutration for a new hobbyist in the Milling arena and 2) It would have been nice if there was some link to the accompanying collets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the worst movie I've seen...","review":"But far, far, from the best.Definitely preferred cannonball run and such. Movie was full of bad acting, bad directing, and incredibly contrived scenes. There were a few laughs, which is the only reason I gave it 2 stars rather than 1, but the whole movie was just overall a painful experience... Find a better way to spend some money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost...","review":"I had the unfortunate challenge of continuously comparing Million Dollar Mystery too much with my classic; 'It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World'. The plot is almost the same; a bunch of wanna-be rich people looking for money with disastrous and almost predictable consequences and in the end, (you guessed it right), none attaining the initial goal. The difference is that after looking at Million Dollar Mystery, I could not laugh as much as I should and was not excited by the script and acting either. Like some, it fails to take the 'It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World' plot to the 'next'-higher level."},{"rating":"1","title":"Miss Match","review":"Miss Match looks good but bored.

HATED IT!!!","review":"Well based on reviews I tried this book, and it was awful!! I really thought it was so supposed to be funny. The author attempted to be funny, but it was like she is trying to hard. It's like talking to someone who wants to fit in and tries to tell jokes. You can tell they are over doing it and instead of laughing you wish you could just shut them up. I kept trying to read on, but it was just over done. The idea of the book was good and I think if the author would have not tried so hard to be funny, it would have been good. I would not recommend this book to anybody who truly likes funny books. There are alot of great, funny books out there and this is not one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"better for a dollhouse then a play kitchen!","review":"I just received this today. I ordered it for my kids' play kitchen. It looked fine in the picture and i was excited but am returning it because there is not a brand of play food that would fit in this cookware. If you are going to use imaginary food it should be ok but not for a toy kitchen. You'd make pancakes the size of quarters.

However, if you are not going to Rosebud or Pine Ridge, Cheyenne River Reservations or Standing Rock, I would suggest that your listening and reading ability will pick up faster than your speaking ability."},{"rating":"2","title":"good","review":"Excellent shape and delivered on time.

I received this book/DVD as a gift; and they have been very helpful. One can study the dictionaries; but, at best, you can only guess how the words should sound. The accompanying DVD is very useful in this regard; but I sometimes find myself asking \\"where the heck are they in the book?\\" If you cannot get to the Black Hills and you want to learn Lakota. Get the New Lakota Dictionary 2nd edition and Lakhotiya Woglaka Po! Hoka hey! Akita mani yo!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lakhotiya Woglaka Po! - Speak Lakota! Level 1","review":"I picked this book & CD because I thought it would be easier to learn from since it is set up for elementary school students. In actuality, the set is for teachers of the Lakota language for that age level. It was not very helpful to me personally. Lakota is a very beautiful and complicated language and I realize one needs more than a book & CD to learn from."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book available for introducing 2-3 year olds to the fairytale classics","review":"I had this book when I was a kid and as soon as my son got old enough to listen to stories of a little bit more complexity, I looked for it on Amazon.Hard to believe it is out of print and only available in old used copies, but that's publishing for you. I've half tossed around the idea of trying to buy the rights for this and republish it, but not likely to be doable given that it was a Golden Book.Anyway: if you've got a 2-year old this one is a must-buy no matter how beaten up the copy! Awesome versions of Red Riding Hood, the Three Little Pigs, Musicians of Bremen, the Gingerbread Man, with beautiful illustrations. Hands down, my son's favorite book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly formatted","review":"Poorly formatted; missing large sections of text in the form of extended quotations. Is the history any good?

My subsequent research on the internet revealed that this player is known for this defect. Indescribably annoying. I don't even want to drag it in for repairs because even on the off-chance they do fix it, which in my experience is a rarity, I am quite confident the player will break again due to whatever the design defect is. Stay away! I will never again buy a Philips appliance, and they were formerly a name I trusted."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE BEFORE YOU BUY!!","review":"I've owned this unit for several years and, unfortunately, the cd technology has passed it by and made it OBSOLETE! If you want to burn blank cd's, it will only work with cd's of 16x speed or less! Tried to find a 16x or less cd lately? Good luck. Maybe you can find them online and maybe they'll work or maybe they want.I've spoken with Philips customer service and they were of NO HELP. They kept saying \\"it SHOULD work with any cd\\". It doesn't.If you want a cd player it works fine, but don't buy it if you want a burner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing more than a frustrating, expensive CD player","review":"If you like being frustrated, aggravated, and throwing your money away, this is the unit for you!I have had my last call to Philips customer support. I am done with them, their company and their products. I have given this unit every chance: I have unplugged this unit hundreds of times; I have tried to finalize CDs that the unit itself burned; and I can sing you the entire song from the Philips customer support hold queue.This unit worked great when I first got it, but it quickly deteriorated. I paid $165 to have it serviced, and that helped problems for a short while. Now, the recorder unit does not even read regular, store-bought CDs: \\"insert disc.\\"Do yourself a favor: stay away from this horrible piece of equipment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Philips cdr785 3-cd","review":"Stay away from this recorder, because Philips does not provide technical support.

Good bye Philips!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Monday or Tuesday: Eight Stories","review":"This book of eight stories by Virginia Woolf shows Virginia's mind at work demonstrating her \\"stream of consciousness.\\" Each story flows from one thought to another asking different questions about life. For example, \\"The Mark on the Wall\\" questions the meaning of life and existence. \\"An Unwritten Novel\\" is about what people hide and what you don't know about a person you seat next to on an \\"omnibus.\\" All these stories will make you look at life in a slightly different way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eight challenging pieces by a master prose stylist","review":"\\"Monday or Tuesday: Eight Stories,\\" by Virginia Woolf, is an intriguing collection that holds up to re-readings. The copyright page of the Dover Thrift edition notes that the book is an unabridged republication of the edition published in 1921.In many of these stories conventional notions of plot and character are apparently thrown out the window in favor of a dreamlike, experimental style. At times the stories in this book remind me of the work of Gertrude Stein. Woolf crafts some really memorable phrases and visual images.The longest of the 8 stories, \\"A Society\\" (pp. 3-16) is about a group of women who form a \\"society for asking questions\\" about male contributions to the world. This piece has a rich satirical flavor; in it Woolf raises questions about female creativity and procreativity, the nature of fiction, and the impact of female literary artists.Although at times I often found Woolf's writing obscure, I enjoyed her elegant prose style."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Woolf","review":"This volume of short stories is a good re-introduction to an author most of us probably haven't seen since High School. The stories are engaging and thought-provoking, and the length is manageable even to someone out of practice with the stream of conciousness style. I carried this book to read between classes one semester and enjoyed the challenge of reading something better than standard leisure fare. This book made me want to see more Virginia Woolf. Well recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"few japanese/okinawan karate masters, too much US","review":"This book provides little information about japanese and okinawan karate masters and is much to US oriented for a real encyclopedia."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"I am a brown belt in ASK.

The subtitle says it's \\"A Handbook for Lawyers,\\" but it's really a handbook for all writing.The book uses its own principles; it's short. You can read it in a couple of hours. Flesch shows passages of legalese, then rewrites each passage using the rules he lays out. The examples make it easy to learn the concepts quickly. This book will teach you to write so you can make your ideas easy-to-understand for virtually everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what we were hoping for","review":"Purchased these both for my car (4runner) and my wife's car (sienna). Taking extra care not to use the wipers when the windshield was dry or icy they started streaking after only a few weeks. On my wife's car the aerodynamics of the blade actually sucked water back onto the windshield on the return stroke, directly in front of the driver's view. I kept trying to remember if it did that before I installed these but wasn't sure. I have since returned to another brand and the problem is gone."},{"rating":"2","title":"good quality wiper","review":"fit my EX35 without issue. easy to put on. have been holding strong for several months now. Will probably get 1+ years use out of it. I also use rainX after every wash (to help easy the load/lessen the friction of the blades).

First pair were at the local auto parts store, but since they stopped carrying them I found them on Amazon for half the cost locally (no surprise there...should have checked sooner). These wipers are amazing. I have them on my 4Runner, and they last about twice as long as the similar \\"factory\\" wipers I've put on my wife's Jetta. Probably get 2+ years out of the set. Extremely quiet even when its dry (cleaning with washer fluid).As long as they make them for my current cars, these are the only type going on them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Wiper for the Hummer H3","review":"Over the years, we have tried several different wiperblades in order to resolve what appears to be a big issue of having wipers that can work with the Hummer H3's windshield.In the past, cold-weather wipers that did not allow snow and ice to get trapped in the wiper blades had helped with this problem, but did not resolve the issue.These blades have worked great through 2 snow storms and are without a doubt the best wipers to use on a Hummer H3. The wiper sizes are different for the \\"driver\\" and \\"passenger\\" sides so make sure you order a 16\\" and a 17\\" blade to make the pair."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bosch Icon","review":"The Bosch Icon works well if the glass is free of road grime tree sap and resin. With a windshield free of contaminates the wiper blades make much better contact with the windshield allowing better water removal.Under normal driving conditions i get 4 to 5 months. The same service life as many other blades in that price range. The best way to extend the life of the blades is keeping the windshield clean.In the end it's the best blade i have bought."},{"rating":"1","title":"DOES NOT FIT H3","review":"i bought this for my h3, it said it was for an H3 but it does not fit. dont buy for an h3."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well made for the price","review":"The hardware is reasonably well made for the price. I am using it on the magazine tube of a 12 ga shotgun and it seems to work pretty well. I rotated the assembly so that the laser is in line with the barrell and the light is slightly off to one side. The pressure switches seem pretty rugged, although they required surprisingly heavy pressure to activate. I have no basis for comparison, but you definitely need to press firmly. The laser seems to be of higher quality than the light, although both function adequately. The light (fixed beam) is the weakest part of the set, although I have not tested the long range effectiveness. It is satisfactory for short range and is better than a mag light. Not sure if a higher quality tactical light could be mounted in the same clamp, since both the light and laser are fairly small in diameter...about .75 in."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Nonsense Reviews","review":"As a parent, I found this series extremely helpful.

Very disappointed and not worth spending the money to send it back since it was so cheap...maybe that is why it doesn't work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for adding players.","review":"This product actually was more than I expected. It is almost exactly like the ps3 controller however it isn't wireless. The controller it self works completely and even though the R2 and L2 button aren't like the ps3's, it still works fine. However, there are some annoying parts. The controller is sort of hard to connect because it doesn't have a home/ps button in between the select and start but it should take less than 2-3 minutes to connect. That's only a problem if you need to switch to the 1rst player controller from the 2nd, 3rd, or 4th controller. I usually use this when a friend comes over and can play with it but this is NOT a replacement for your original ps3 controller which you should always have. Also, the sixaxis functionality wont work on this so you should use it for games that don't need it, which are most off the ps3 games.It's cheap, I works, and if you have a ps2 controller that you think you may never use, you might want to get this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Perfect with PS1 Namco Tekken Arcade Stick","review":"The one that Eforcity sells is fully compatible with my original Namco Tekken arcade stick that was for the original Playstation (PS1).

I bought it for the sole purpose of allowing me to play PS2 DDR on my PS3 (I have the old one that is completely backwards compatible). It would not recognize stepping on two arrows at the same time, which is essential for playing DDR. I checked the dance pad on a PS2, and it was not an issue with the dance pad so it had to be the adapter. I was hoping this would work, as another reviewer said it did, but somehow it just didn't completely work for me.Just a note that doesn't contribute to my rating of the product: I e-mailed the seller for a return, BargainCell in my case, but they never replied to me.

This seat has higher harness positions for older kids with a 5 point harness, but these were the only features we liked. The seat overall felt very flimsy, the arm rests feel like they could snap off very easily especially if a child were to sit on them. The removable seat pad makes it next to impossible for our daughter to sit up straight, she slides down until the buckle is tight against her crotch. The head rest, while it does adjust, doesn't provide adequate head support for kids who sleep in the car, our daughter was flopping all over the place.Maybe we feel this way because we started out with the Britax Roundabout(which we highly recommend!) I guess we should have just stuck with a trusted brand, we will be returning our Evenflo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only lasted a month with my toddler!","review":"I did a lot of comparison shopping. I tried out several boosters and decided on this one based on the comfort and safety features. I thought the armrests were neat and liked the recline feature. However, after not even a month with this seat, my toddler managed to completely remove one of the armrests!!! I looked back and he had it in his hand playing with it. I couldn't figure out how to reassemble it at all. Not only that, the pillow tore when my son played with the tags on it. I will say it did seem VERY comfortable for my son. He never squirmed or acted like anything was bothering him. But due to the items falling apart or tearing on it, I would definitely recommend you keep shopping if you want something that will withstand rough toddlers. I bought a different brand, but similar seat with NO armrests as a replacement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not fit","review":"I ordered this vehicle speed sensor for 1999 Mercury Villager.

Then I would answer a call to hear nothing. Next, my phone got the silly idea that my headset was connected. Which it very rarely is and the most recent time it was connected was 3 or 4 weeks before this! I replaced mine with a 3220 and am still having problems!

The phone itself is very small, smaller than the average Sony Ericcson small. It comes with a mobile internet browser, supports ICQ, AIM, and Y! instant messengers, and comes standard with a handful of java games. Aside from that, there is a vast array of Java applications you can buy to add to the phone. I switched to this phone from the Sidekick I color.

It perfectly blends her live acoustic feel with the studio. Cold Weather is a masterpiece of songwriting, as is the case with most of her albums. This is the first time though, the studio production lives up to the songwriting. Of course Brenda's gorgeous voice, which has only gotten better, still is the centerpiece of the album.

Cold Weather is required for any serious music collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful... again","review":"This disc is as amazing as the previous 4.

I have told all of my family and friends about her and have even taken measures to get her to come to St. Louis. Hopefully she will be here next Spring! You can bet I will be in the first row, as I fear Brenda is headed for great success and her future venues will be in football stadiums!! I highly recommend this CD to ALL of you out there. Buy it!

Bit of a lazy job if you ask me. Perhaps this has to do with the fact that LP insists on recruiting writers who have been 'slot machine repairmen', 'rodeo riders' and 'monkey keepers'. This probably to enforce the idea that a multi-media multinational company can still harbour and, moreover sell a hippy/backpacker image and that you and I may benefit from their 'bohemian' inclinations. Problem is that most 'rodeo riders' stay in the saddle for a couple of seconds only. The (co)-author of the 6th edition of the LP/Vietnam falls into this category. Notwithstanding the editors' attempts to portrait our wild west friend as 'quite a character', a gifted writer on Vietnam he is most certainly not. Disappointing and not worth the additional expense. Perhaps have a look at the Rough Guide on Vietnam first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not needed","review":"Great idea for a book but it really isn't needed.

The food was terrible, rats the size of dogs in the university, and were clearly unwelcome Americans. I have not travelled since, and would caution the reader that this guide is very unrealistic.

I will never buy Lonely Planet again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look somewhere else","review":"I travelled to Vietnam in Sept/99 and unfortunately was loaned this LP handbook so thought I would take advantage and use it. I was as usual disappointed with the type and presentation of the information provided. I grew tired of all the commentary in the book and so much so that it is difficult to select the facts. For example, instead of providing factual information on transport, hotels, etc., the book is filled with tidbits which are essentially useless for everyday travelling and end up being conversation between a bunch of backpackers in the travel cafe. This LP handbook has managed to dominate the minds of all travellers to Vietnam and, as in my case, I found everyone reading it and complaining, but they had no other option. I hope travellers to Vietnam can find some other guidebook so they do not follow the all to well beaten track through Vietnam as so many other backpackers do and perhaps may discover some things on their own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I travelled to Vietnam earlier this year with this guidebook, having been very favorably impressed with the Lonely Planet Guides to China and Turkey. This time, though, I found that I couldn't trust the information given on places to eat or places to stay. Eateries that were given excellent reviews turned out to be mediocre; some hotels which were barely mentioned turned out to be excellent, while others that were given very good reviews were non-descript. I wound up trusting the advice of the xi-clo drivers rather than relying on the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A victim of its own popularity","review":"LP Vietnam, as several others have mentioned, is misleading and out of date. But even worst, is that it tries to scare most travelers into following its suggested itinerary instead of venturing out on their own. I was going to outline some of the more glaring mistakes, but other reviews beat me to the punch.In defense of LP, who have produced decent guidebooks in the past, Vietnam may be changing at such a fast pace that as soon as it was published much of the information was already out of date. However, not all the mistakes can be blamed on a country in the throws of rapid changes and as such as easily dismissed.Hopefully the next edition will have greatly improved and won't be written in such an amateurish way.

This was a book I couldn't put down till I finished. While I enjoyed the characters wholeheartedly I was a bit disappointed with the ending. It was rushed and left some things unresolved to my thinking. I wished there had been some dialogue with our heroine and Dalton (The Imposter). If nothing else he owed her some big apolgies! Also, I would have like to have seen Collis given an honorary title and land. If no other reason (since I can't give away the ending) then for saving the Regent or many British soldiers lives.

Not to mention the heroine \\"throws\\" the hero on the ground at least, at least three times. I did not like it hardly at all and was not amused. I like a girl with a strong character as well as anyone, but when that strength overshadows everyone else what does she need the hero for?

The album itself start's of with a very mediocre track \\"urge\\" which really isn't promising at all the mixing of the track is all over the place, the instrumentals is loud and tend's to overshadow the lead vocals in pretty much the whole album from start to finish and to make it somewhat worse there are rarely any tracks that standout at all.

The album brooch can bring a little pleasure to the ears but tends too lack a lot of enthusiasm overall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Intriguing but unsatisfying","review":"At times reminiscent of the Throwing Muses' more jagged moments, with hints of prog, Pixies, and a milder Babes in Toyland. The album features sparse, raw production, with disconcerting tempo shifts and loud/soft dynamics. The songs are genuinely creative, and the lyrics - where decipherable - are intriguing, but overall the album suffers from weak vocals, unfocused songwriting and a lack of melodies.

The book covers all aspects of logistics, including food, water, firewood, cavalry horses, pack animals, metal, clothing, medical care, artillery, etc. Roth also clearly shows how innovative the Roman logistical system was and how its absolutely amazing efficiency was more than a little responsible for the army's successes. No state had ever developed the full-fledged logistical system that the Romans did, and no state would until modern times. This book is a must-read for anyone seriously interested in ancient Roman military history.My only complaint about this very expensive book is that the editing is terrible.

I own all of Keyes' books and have read (and reread and reread) them. She is an amazing author. I recommend her to everyone, but was so disappointed in this.

I would have gladly paid $2 for this story (rather that than $5 for whatever vapid \\"women's magazine\\" it might otherwise have been published in).

Worth the effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent but somewhat brief commentary of Philippians","review":"Moisés Silva's commentary on Philippians is roughly half the size of Fee's commentary, but Silva's commentary is much more reader-friendly. Silva also argues for Pauline authorship and Roman provenance. Silva provides his own translation, and although perhaps a handful of his conclusions are far-fetched, his scholarship leads him to many valuable insights of which Fee does not write.

The battles in the Underedark are breathtaking, and many old enemies come into play agin. The characters are anything but flat and change a lot. Many spectacular fights, and with salvatore's colorful writing, they're that much better. Also, humor sprinkled throught the book for a little comic releif (tactic vs. mind flayers: polymorph to switch brain and rear). Also, it spreads a bit from Mithril Hall and Icewind Dale, since they go on the sea voyage which leads to some awesome battles, but why am I writing this, just buy it, it's well worth it!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Have to agree with the other reviewer","review":"This book is not that great, but it will hold your attention. Pretty much the same stuff these characters have been doing the whole time, without much growth in their personality. Extreme predictability, including the obvious ending, really hurt the book as well. Time to retire the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cranked out garbage","review":"I barely managed to get thru this. For one thing, the first half of the first book in this volume seems dedicated to doing nothing more than respewing EVERYTHING the characters had done in all the prior novels. That's not only bad form, but its a bad sign right from the start. This is purely Salvatore milking the characters he developped a long time ago in a the mostly blatant and insulting way. If this is the first of the trilogies you've read in a long time, you will be completely put off by it. For those who've kept up, it may be worth it just to see what happens to the characters, but you should be just as insulted by the fact that in the end, you bought 3 books where in fact there was at LEAST one book's worth of stuff you already read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of fighting-needs more of a plot","review":"As much as I love Salvatore, I have to say that this book really needs more of a plot. The plot there is is very good, and I enjoyed it. But there were lots of fight scenes. While Salvatore is a great author, and he does fighting scenes very well, I think he needs to try adding a few not-so-sword-and-dagger scenes.It's got plenty of humor, too, though (a certain new dwarf character for example), and some strange goblin things. But there is also something to learn about our favorite characters, Regis in particular. If you want to know what I'm talking about, read the book!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not his best, but still some of thebest","review":"I will have to say that I am a huge fan of R.A.

I will have to say that it doesn't quite hold a candle to the previous two trilogy books, but I will have to say that overall it is still in the top 5 of my all time favorite books. His work is outstanding. I'll be reading the next set as soon as Amazon gets em to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awwww, good times... mostly","review":"The legend continues, as does the legacy. The next books in the series live up to the expectations laid by the others as the series of Drizzt continues. The only reason I gave this book four stars was for the numerous grammatical errors.

You find yourself missing the characters between releases, sharing their griefs and cheering their victories.And above all else, the words that the famous Drizzt writes in his logs are very inspirational, and allow for self-reflection.Legacy of the Drow contains wars that are described in only ways that Salvatore can do it. Don't forget to breath between chapters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Salvatore/Drizzt book series...","review":"The Legacy of the Drow is a great series and fantastic addition to the Drizzt legend (may it never end!). You may consider this review sided - I have loved all of the Salvatore-Drizzt books leading up to this - but this series is one of the best. Great surprises, great new characters, introduction of old characters you thought you might never see again, and overall superb storytelling and character development. I recommend reading the books leading up to this series (Homeland, Exile, Sojourn, The Crystal Shard, Streams of Silver, and The Halfling's Gem) so you can understand what's going on with all the characters, story-arcs, etc., but Salvatore does a nice job of explaining reintroduced characters and concepts enough that new readers would understand what's going on."},{"rating":"2","title":"The legacy of the drow","review":"This was the best series of books describing the adventures of Drizzt and his companions. There is great description, inovation and action in each of the four books in the series. My favourite book was the siege of darkness, the characters are all superb, the draven battles with the drows are great, and Jarlaxe uses his ussual guile to come out on top."},{"rating":"1","title":"Legacy of The Weak Drow!!!","review":"I am a fan of Salvatore, but Legacy of the Drow Collector's edition is not all that good to me. I was disappointed in how week he made the Drow in books one and two, so I decided not to read the next two. How in the nine hell's was Cattie able to survive in Menzobarranazan, she's good, but she is no Drow. The Drow are described as the fiercest and most evil creatures known in the Realms, but were defeated by Drizzt, Entrerie, and Cattie. Salvatore focuses too much on Drizzt and his accomplishments which begins to get boring after so long. If the Drow are as tough as Salvatore say's that they are, why do they always lose, and lose they always do."},{"rating":"1","title":"those scimitars just keep whirling!","review":"I want to like these books but it's page after page of wading through nearly identical descriptions of melee.

I do not essentially disagree with Dall--I just think his approach is that of a amatuer who is not fully there mentally--and for that reason his potentially good book falls short--rediculously short.He reminds me of the claptrap one used to hear in the old Barbershops of the 50's and before.

Control placement is fine and everything is quite accessible, even with one hand. The 10-1 mulcher works decently, and I don't think I would want the bag to be too much bigger. It would be nice to have more capacity, but weight would get to be a factor. It is loud, but I wear headphones that double as earplugs, so I'm not bothered by this.

The third year it started once after 20 min. of priming and pulling starting cord. There is a definite problem with the carb getting gas. I used this blower about 20 hours total. It cost $145.00 when I bought it. So I figure it cost $7.25 an hour until it would not start anymore. I will never buy a Troy-Built product again."},{"rating":"1","title":"engine seized on me","review":"After using the blower for about 2 years, the engine seized on me and I was not able to start the blower."},{"rating":"1","title":"Troy Bilt is Junk","review":"What ever reputation Troy Bilt once may have had is gone....this stuff is junk...worse than low end products you can buy at your local grocery store. Plus they will not back their product...if the engine blows they refer you to the engine manufacturer...who refers you back to Troy Bilt..etc. Yeah, now one is responsible anymore, just give us your money and so long sucker!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"tired of searching","review":"This is my fourth blower, yet this is my first troy-bilt. It blows wellenough for our needs. I will agree with the placement and size of the low-high control.. I don't have large hands, yet i tend to knock the speed down quite often. It is very loud, even with earplugs or noise cancelling earphones. I have had this less than a year, and it leaks gas from the carb. It is a bit heavy compared to other blowers its size and strength.I don't use it for vac/mulching, thats what the lawnmower is for. ;)"},{"rating":"1","title":"JUNK","review":"This blower lasted a little over 2 tanks of gas, got hot and quit - forever!! This was from the same can of gas that I use for my Homelite blower so is 32:1 rather then the 40:1 so has plenty of extra lubrication(25%). The easy start rope pull spring is shot and will only partially retract unless you let it snap back from full extension.While it worked, it did move lots of air - so that is a plus - but it still needs to run to move that air!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT buy this blower","review":"Right after I purchased this product in the fall, it ran ok first couple of times. However, I used it once this spring , took awhile to start and then took several minutes of running to get up to full power. Since then the blower will not restart (even followed troy-bilt's convoluted instructions on side of blower), took it to local Troy-bilt Service, who claims I didn't have the mix right so will not be covered on warranty. I used a 40:1 mix and the same fuel worked fine in my Ryobi 2-cycle engines with no problems.Bottom line: Blower is too bulky, throttle lever gets in the way, engine is poor quality, waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware","review":"I purchased my first TB320BV a couple years ago. After 9 months the motor basically burned up with black yuk coming out of the cylinder head. I didn't mis-treat it but I did expect the unit to be able to run 2-3 hours at a time during the Fall season. Anyway, I threw it away and purchased another one, yes, you read right. After less than a year this one burned up as well. The authorized repair shop said \\"not another one\\" and not to get my hopes up for a timely repair, he had 3 others in front of mine. I called \\"Troy Bilt customer service\\" who gave me the usual \\"what did I do wrong? Did I follow the manual?\\" etc. I asked them to call the authorized repair and help me get it repaired. They basically said \\"not my job mon.\\" So it's still at the repair shop for over a year. If you want a 20 minute blower/vac this may work for you, as for me, Never Ever Again will MTD get my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rotten Blower - warranty is worse","review":"Blower stopped working after about 30 days - less than 1 hour of use. Took to warranty repair facility shop and was told damage was my fault. Told the engine losing compression. I was told I did not properly lubricate. I used gas with the proper 40:1 ratio. I have a Troy Bilt trimmer using the same can of gas. So far all I am getting is excuses but no replacement. I would not buy one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Junk","review":"This is my second blower. It starts good for the first couple of times that you use it and after that it seems to stall and is difficult to start. I have not been impressed with Troybilts products; it seems that quality control is not something that they pride themselves in. Take a look at the Troybilt's home page, even the ratings on their own page tell the truth, save your money, buy a Stihl!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Built to Fail","review":"This blower has a plastic engine mount that is held on by 4 self tapping screws that are screwed into plastic. The screws back out and contact the impeller and eat through the platic wheel causing the catastrophic failure of the impeller. The two parts involved are about $30.00 but Troy Bilt would not send replacements because I did not have my original receipt. Even though the serial number proved it was manufactured in 2009 they would not stand behind this obvious defect in manufacturing when all I asked was for the replacement parts and nothing more. Don't waste your money on this product, it is designed for failure! I will never buy another Troy bilt product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"This Corelle teakettle rates one star for it's attractive exterior.

I have been perpetually fascinated by the endlessly changing storyline and characters, the style and the content.If you can handle being perpetually confused (or even actually enjoy complex (in this case quasi-linear) plotlines), then Vellum might be for you. Just set aside your qualms, keep reading, and see where Duncan takes you.You can feel confident that everything will not be as it seems.The only comparison I can come up with is that this book is like a verbal Art Film. Also, consider that the author works as a \\"part-time computer programmer\\", and it definitely shows.If you want a predictable, linear story and writing, then buy Harry Potter (not intended as an insult--they are meant as kids' books, after all ;) ). If you're up for being challenged and possibly fascinated, then definitely consider this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"i would have to agree...","review":"with everyone that posted a review saying that they disliked the book. like mostly everyone said, it was really good for the first 25 pages. It seemed original and interesting and well written. as soon as those first 25 pages were up, it just degenerated into really bad writing. and, like everyone else, i did try to keep going. i was hoping it would all be a sad mistake. but, alas, it was not. my opinion? don't even bother purchasing this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful fiction","review":"An unruly mess of bad ideas mashed together and wrapped in angst-ridden narration and meaningless dialogue.

I tried, but only made it about 200 pages in before tossing it. The authors idea's are strong but the execution is at best ponderous.

These words are to kind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious, boring, incoherent","review":"The characters are uninteresting, the plot is consvoluted to the point of incoherence.

I even read the first page in the store and it caught my interest. But I am sadly disappointed, this book quickly devolved into a mess I couldn't even figure out. I gave up trying to read it as well it just jumped around and made to little sense.It sounded great in concept, but the execution was just terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me","review":"I was utterly captivated by the first 25 pages of this book. Then something went horribly wrong, and I became quickly dissapointed. The premise is brilliant, but the characters didn't interest me in the slightest and the constant change of point of view was jarring. The writing itself was pretty good, but there was a frequent shifting between present to past tense which I found very difficult to adjust to. I just couldn't keep up with what was going on, and I didn't feel I knew enough about the characters to care much about them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time!","review":"The cover of this book caught my eye and it sounded interesting, about the end of days and angels and demons. Duncan writes in such a way that it is work to figure out which characters he is talking about at any given moment. He changes scenes within a paragraph. I got to page 100 and decided that I should be into the book by now and gave up. Aside from being all over the place, it takes place in different times and realities. It is also written with a British accent (I think), Irish accent, ancient language, but mostly swearwords. I am not opposed to sex and violence in books but I thought it was unneccesary. I was really disappointed that I bought this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A fine line","review":"Hal Duncan is living proof that there is a very fine line between genius and insanity. Unfortunately, this book proves good ol' Hal is more the latter than the former. This book reads like it was written by a complete maniac. Granted you can't help but be impressed by the genius of it all, but that doesn't make it a good, or even readable, story.I finished the book only because I forced myself to do so. This book is so easy to put down. There are many parts, when one of the oh-so-frequent changes between different characters (or perhaps the same character with a different name, or in a different time) would come along, where I'd find myself thinking \\"oh, I just can't do this right now.\\" I'd then put the book down, and go back to actually doing work at my job because that was more appealing than forcing my way through more of this mindless drivel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forcing Myself to Finish","review":"I'm about 375 pages into this book and have to confess that my compulsive tendency is the only thing driving me to finish it. I hate not finishing a book and only the dregs get thrown into the recycling pile before I've read the last word. This one is almost there. Purporting to be about the big idea of the battle for the Vellum between the angels etc, I find that it is mostly about nothing much and nothing much actually happens. Streams of boring prose are spewed forth page after page while nothing of substance advances the \\"BIG\\" idea. Characters ramble on forever. Advancement of the story is almost nil.If you like this sort of purposeless meandering, you probably would like Gravity's Rainbow by Pynchon, only Pynchon is a vastly better writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes reading way too much work","review":"I too started this book and threw it aside. Glad it was a library book and not something i paid for. Started off great like another reviewer said and then collapsed into chaos. It gave me whiplash trying to keep track of what was going on with who and when and where...and finally i just didn't care.It seems like there are 50 voices all going in different directions and different times, because the voices and time frame seems to change with every paragraph you have no idea where you are in the story and the original story line which begins the book (which was great) disappears entirely.This is self-indulgence at its worst, who could have possibly edited this thing?I'm always suspicious when most of the reviews are from other writers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious","review":"I am a fan of ambitious literature and welcome attempts at creating narrative through metaphoric imagery, however Duncan's writing is pretentious and tired. It's as if you can see him congratulating himself on being overtly witty. This renders the story quite boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"A sophomoric attempt to produce great literature.","review":"It starts off as if it will be a gripping story and then it compltely drops the ball. Frank Herbert's \\"Dune\\" series was able to tie in philosophical concepts with an engaging plot and captivating characters. Hal Duncan's novel loses all intrigue quickly, leaving the majority of the story stale.Don't get me wrong: I actually enjoyed a lot of Duncan's concepts and imagery, hence I gave him 2 stars instead of just 1. Yet it takes more than just interesting ideas and gratuitous prose to create a novel. I am a fan of cyber-punk, hard science fiction, as well as dark fantasies, but Vellum misses the mark.Bottom line: Hal Duncan is trying too hard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended","review":"Vellum was the most tedious book I have ever finished. Having read some very positive reviews, I continued on, constant in the hope it would amaze me. That never happened and I'm truly sorry I didn't put it aside after a hundred pages. Frankly, one would have to be much more pretentious than I am to enjoy this book. It's non-linear, buckshot writing that demands far too much of the reader without a valid return. If you want something overblown to bolster your literary ego, maybe this is for you. Those seeking an entertaining, thought-provoking story should look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Pope Bio on DVD","review":"This is the adaption of George Wiegel's monumental biography of Pope John Paul II. If you are looking for a well produced documentary on the life of Pope John Paul the Great, then get a hold of this DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific biography, accurrate and touching","review":"This particular video-bio is especially touching. George Weigel, writer of the book with the same title, does an amazing job with the information that he gathered. Touching, even humorous stories of the young Karol Wojtyla light up the video as well. From his birth in 1920 until before his death, the video highlights all major events in John Paul's life and his environment. I have been a long-time follower of Pope John Paul II, his writings, speeches and life in general. This video captures the essence of the delicate, humble, yet complex man that the world came to know for 26 years. I highly reccommend this for anyone who wishes to learn more about Karol Wojtyla, or who wants to further their collections of his life and works."},{"rating":"2","title":"I haven't a Clue to what this is:","review":"It's an Excellent Film for a Faithful person OR Faithful People to go watching.

The prologue was a classic example of obfuscation at its finest. I was at almost the last page (skimming I admit) before I had even a glimmer of what she was trying to set up at the beginning and once I understood I remained completely clueless as to why she chose to start the book with that scene. So from my perspective, the book started off badly, ended on a down note and contained nothing engaging, enlivening or even particularly interesting between the beginning and the end. A fact which I found particularly disappointing because it's clear that McGarry can write (which is something I can't say anymore about certain other well known fantasy authors). My advice is to read a few pages of the book and see how they strike you before you buy - if it doesn't click right away - based on my experience it won't get any better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spacy and overly artsy","review":"This book has a lot of good ideas behind it, but it's not very well written. Sure, the prose is clean and nice, but there's no passion behind it, no spark of genius or excitement, like comes through in Goodkind or Martin, or Jordan and Haydon, both of whom plugged it but whose work far surpasses it. Liath is a fairly interesting character but she degenerates into a predictable female role, when she could have been so much more. I recommend a read of this when you have a long weekend with nothing to do--it's hard to get through, but it does have some interesting passages. You might want to wait for the paperback, however."},{"rating":"2","title":"well put together, original ideas/plot","review":"I read the entire book in two nights. The plot is very involved throughout the whole book. Some of it doesn't make sense at first but all the ends are tied at the conclusion, I was very impressed.

Although he produced this great debut novel, the author seems to have faded into obscurity. I rarely even hear his name spoken, these days. Which is sad, for SLOB seemed to signal the arrival of a truly new and unique voice in horror and suspense literature. The book has its flaws, but they are minor ones. It's powerfully written, the lead character is original and quite frightening, and the book draws one in from the first line and holds you to the last.

After listening to Beyond Fear, I've come to the conclusion that this disk was not just a waiste on my part, but a total waiste for anyone involved in making this cd. The songwriting( just like the band name) is completely generic and unimaginative, and the lyrics are just plain terrible. The band members deserve to be stripped of their endorsements and dropped from their label for putting forth such an obvious lack of effort.

And if the entire Beyond Fear debut album had been like the opening cut \\"Scream Machine,\\" it would have gotten five stars. But this CD is a bit inconsistent, with most songs being rather average--and at least one cut, \\"Coming At You,\\" being quite weak. \\"Ripper\\" Owens has been on the vocal end of at least one CD that is superior to this one, namely Iced Earth's \\"The Glorious Burden\\" (which is a masterpiece!). Beyond Fear does contain some solid, aggressive power metal but overall it lacks consistency and the lyrical content is weak, too; for instance, the song \\"Telling Lies\\" seems to be a slam at President George W. Bush but no matter what you may think of why or how we got into the war in Iraq, Metal is not the musical genre to tackle political issues.

It took a Google search to prove that Ms. Duke actually wrote for the Washington Post. If you read this book, you might have the same doubts . . . but the Post did accept her byline. I hoped to read about recent trends in Africa. The title suggested I would get insight into Nelson Mandela, who overlooked 27 years in prison to rebuild South Africa, and Mobutu Sese Seko (Kuku wa za Banga), a ruthless despot whose plutocracy bled the resource rich nation of Congo dry. Instead it was a self-serving, egocentric view of an African-American woman as she tried to fit the paradigm of Africa politics into her own narrow prejudices.

Decided not to make a big deal out of it so I got the drivers side replaced and left the streaky passengers side. Worked again for about a week and while driving in a big rain storm the drivers side is streaking very poorly again.

This is not a book for the squimish, but is so important. Alicia has fulfilled her promise to her murdered family by acting as their voice. What an amazing woman!

Her bravery and compassion are an inspiration that we should take to our everyday lives. Reading her story is absolutely heartbreaking, but her spirit shines through. While each survivor's story I have read has been unique, this one was really different (to me) because she managed to survive outside the concentration camps.

It's easy to understand why. Polyethylene starts off as a quiet solo, then breaks into a loud rock song. Similar in energy to Electioneering. Pearly has a strange almost tango-like tone to the beat and guitar riff, but is another out-and-out rock song. These both appear on Airbag, although a different version of Pearly appears on the Running from Demons EP (it's the same version as this, but they appear to have re-dubbed the main guitar line as it sounds different, and comes to a cold stop at the end instead of fading out).

The rich use of vocabulary and perception literally paints the landscape on your mind. I had to have a copy of this book on my shelf to remind me of the Alaska I know and I have pre-ordered his new book based on his writing and introspective skills.

It's a beautiful story about love and friendships between man and nature, man and himself, and man and God, however one envisions Him. I could not put the book down once I started to read it.

I grew bored with it after about half of the book. While some of the writing is indeed superb, and some of the moments are unforgettable, the narrative wanders all over the place and seems to lose its focus. I learned virtually nothing about the glacier bear, which was disappointing, and very little about Michio Hoshino. Lynn Schooler, on the other hand, spends a lot of time talking about himself. I think the book's title should have been, \\"Man Runs Away From Life And Blue Bear Shows Up At the End\\". This doesn't come close to my favorite book about Alaska, Barry Lopez's intelligent and sensitive \\"Arctic Dreams\\". A big disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining, Interesting, Captivating","review":"What a wonderful book! Loved it.

Characters change, story lines and scenery. On this movie, I really liked it. I thought the actors had chemistry. Because of the Brother's story line it drew you in more, you wanted to find out along with the sister what really happened. Was the ex going to be able to control the family or was the drifter going to help them. I really love the actress who plays the mother. I would recommend this movie to anyone who loves romance novels/movies. The drifter is from the show High school Musical. I always said he would be a really good looking actor.

I have not seen any of her work previously but was not a fan of her now. This movie is also my first movie watching Zac and again. I am not a fan of him.What i did take away from the story itself was how he handled his situations. He manages to handle almost all of the things thrown at him with so much dignity. It made me thinking about how i can handle things better in my life. Her ex pushes him and at times i can't believe he doesn't' punch him. But he holds his emotions in check well.

He is also a hunk who just shows up in Louisiana with his dog. The locals are skeptical but leave it to Blythe Danner to start the ball rolling. This is a Lifetime type movie which is very watchable on a rainy Sunday. Keep some tissues handy. Zac could smile more but is quite good as an ex-Marine with PTSD. I watched it twice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved the Movie, Loved Efron, Hated Schilling","review":"I would have given this movie five stars, if the costume designer would have not allowed Taylor Schilling's hair to be in her face for 69% of the film!

Sparks set the bar pretty low (I know, I know...) with the book and somehow the movie goes lower. He has her picture. He found her. But can't give it to her. We're not really sure why other than if he does give it to her we have a short film on our hands. What plays out is a Lifetime Channel special. She doesn't like him, but does. She's got a jerky cliche of a husband who still thinks he's the boss of her - AND he certainly doesn't like this new guy hanging around. My oh my, would could possibly happen.

I purchased it recently on valentine's day of all days. I wanted something romantic and entertaining to watch and I'm very familiar with Nicholas Sparks books. I knew he wouldn't disappoint and he did not. \\"The Lucky One\\" has actually become my favorite of his books on film. Zac Efron is just wonderful in this film. He's very masculine and very sexy. And he's definitely not a teenager anymore. His chemistry with Taylor is just so natural and \\"real\\" as is his friendly chemistry with Blythe Danner as Ellie. There are several scenes in the film that either choke me up or amuse me but my favorite is when Beth asks Logan to recite one of his favorite quotes of philosopy and he gives her a zinger back by naming Dr. Seuss. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie","review":"I am a huge fan of Nicholas Sparks - and this movie did not disappoint.

Not so much!"},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible just horrible- would have given it a half star.","review":"Poorly acted.... very poorly. The war scenes were horribly done.

A story about a veteran suffering from ptsd who wonders why he was spared when so many others weren't. He finds a pic of a woman and when he comes home after trying to fit in at home and not succeeding he sets out on a journey to find the woman in the picture that he feels saved him from dying. Much drama and romance ensues, but it's a worthy story. Be sure to have a hanky on hand as there may be a couple of tearful moments.

I wouldn't suggest anyone watch this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I had high hopes for this film since the book was so great, but it was a let-down. The directing was sloppy; there were too many poor transitions. Not to mention that Zeus, the dog, disappears at the end of the film and never reappears again. How do you forget to include the dog in the ending? The chemistry between the two main characters wasn't great, and neither was Zac Efron's acting, although I know he's capable because I've seen him act well before. This leads me to question again whether it was just the poor directing, and not necessarily Efron's poor acting abilities.I feel like directors sometimes view Nicholas Sparks's stories as a guarantee for instant box-office success (and understandably so, since most of his novels are terrific), however in doing so they fail to actually put in a solid effort when creating the film, which is a shame because the story-lines have such potential."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheesy and miscast!","review":"I wasn't the lucky one since I actually rented this and watched it online. Zac Efron is believable as the leading man, but the leading lady wasn't his match. She looked too old and wasn't attractive enough to play the love interest of such a handsome leading man. The story was cheesy and predictable. The sex scenes looked awkward and I didn't see any chemistry between the lead actors. Efron's acting at times was as weird as Kirsten Stewart's acting in all of the Twilight movies. \\"The Lucky One\\" will appeal to hopeless romantics who enjoy a love story no matter what.

This is not a bad movie, understand. It is, in fact, a very conventional and (I have to say it) stereotypical chick flick. Impossibly gorgeous Taylor Schilling is recently divorced from a county Sheriff, and has an impossibly cute 8 year old son. Incredibly handsome Zac Efron is a Marine returning home after three deployments who seeks her out based upon a picture of her that he kept as a lucky talisman in combat. (Long story, but the film does tell it.) Guys will hope for the conclusive showdown between the Marine and the Sheriff, but, well, more would be telling. Suffice to say that this film is an easy way to pass 101 minutes, but that is about it.Taylor Schilling is very, very, easy on the eyes. By the way, the wise old grandmother (Ellie, played by Blythe Danner) is pretty easy on the eyes too.If you want a non-violent chick flick, this one is for you.

Why would an apologist allocate prescious resources to answer a retard babbling on a street corner shows lack of prudence not Christian mission. Montgomery loves to list his innumerable degrees and honors on the back of his book. His book is almost a defense of John Warwick Montgomery's intellectual status rather than Jesus Christ.

I could have got her a smaller, more modern-looking unit, but the retro style of these Crosleys drew us both in. The problem -- and a huge one -- was the the sound was unbearable. Instead of being just retro-styled in appearance, it was also retro in sound quality; it sounded like a poorly tuned in AM radio broadcast from 1935 ... but we were playing a good quality CD at the time! The other functions were just as bad, so it had to be the amp or speakers or wiring, but in any case, I just returned it.

It also, played too fast, closer to 35-36 RPMs.So I returned that one, and purchased the Crosley protable turntable in tan. It also, ran too fast.The jist of it? Crosley turntables are poorly made, with a total lack of concern for proper playing speeds.

What was a real problem was that one day i put a CD in the player and when i was finished listening to it, the player wouldn't eject. I fiddled with it for several hours but couldn't get it to work. Eventually i had to end up unscrewing the bottom and manually pushing out the CD tray. The same thing happened when i tried it again and i was very disappointed. I got rid of it after a while of it just sitting there. If you intend to use this item for CD and tape listening purposes i wouldn't recommend it (of course maybe that might just be my experience and won't happen to you, but i wouldn't take the chance).

My wife and I were home on delivery day and NO ONE delivered to our address.The U.P.S. site indicated PORCH as delivery site.It is now October 3rd and I STILL don't have the matching three clamps.What makes this TOTALLY luducrous is that there are some people on different woodworking forums that have received duplicate orders and in some cases have not been billed for their merchandise.To paraphrase an old airline commercial...\\"Is this anyway to run an E-merchandising site?You bet it aint!\\"I have not used this clamp because if I don't get the other three the big A can pay to pick this one up and I'll never do buisness with them agin."},{"rating":"2","title":"very nice clamps","review":"I like these clamps becasue they are sturdy and have solid wooden handles that allow for tight clamping procedures. I have used them many times and the only knock I have on them is that they are a little to bulky for my liking, but in some cases this may be a plus. I have had no problems with damage to wood after clamping and no difficulty with glue binding to the clamp. I definitely recommend buying these clamps versus the many other brands that are out there. Basically, they are a good purcahse for the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"These clamps are cheap for a reason","review":"I do a lot of glue-ups with panels of substantial size.

However, it's important to note up front in the initial album description, the x-tra effort required in acquiring the words and choreography, and extra cost, if you do not have a computer, or are not computer literate. I believe the promotion of this CD would be better served, if at least the words were included in the CD pamphlet insert, since most are interested in the words, and fewer interested in the choreography. For me, a trip to Kinko's was required to download both, although I was only interested in the words.

NO!!!","review":"This album isn't the worst thing I've ever heard, but it's trying hard to be. The arranger here is trying to make the songs into harder versions of how they're meant to be played and listened to, losing the spirit of Jack's music in the process - which call me crazy, I thought was the whole point of a tribute album in the first place. The result is a confusing mix of electric and acoustic jumble that seems more poised to try and convince metal fans of the wonder that is Jack, instead of adding those few subtle and personal touches to appeal to the millions of fans that appreciate Jack's music for what it is - if it ain't broke, don't fix it!! If you are a fan of hard rock, by all means check this out, it will be a good transition for you... however, if you're a die-hard Jack fan then I highly recomend \\"The Hawaiian Tribute To Jack Johnson\\" by Na Mele O Keaka (which literally means Jack's Music in Hawaiian).

Even though the book showed one person doing the project, some of the \\"big\\" jobs like installing a tile floor would probably need an extra pair of hands. I am a big fan of the Black and Decker repair books and this book reminded me a little of them because of the step-by-step instructions and the great pictures.I definitely try to use the K-I-S-S principle (Keep It Simple Sweetie) when it comes to repair kind of projects and this book does that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good pics, limited tile work possibilities","review":"This book is full of excellent how-to pix.

This cd is such a gem. It contains deliciously jazzy songs. Some with a positive beat, such as the fantastic 'dog's life' and 'everlasting no', some with a slightly gloomy touch, such as 'small black heart'.It's unpolished sound is completely in line with the music, and adds to the atmosphere.Kelly Flints voice is a delight, and fits with the change in moods. It reminded me of a Dutch singer-songwriter, Fay Lovsky.The only disappointment is the opening song, which is quite monotonous and, actually, boring.Still, I can easily forgive them for that, considering the enjoyment of the other songs.If you like this style, I strongly recommend trying Working Nights from Working Week, the absolute number one jazzy-pop albums ever produced."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dave's True Story: Their Best Yet","review":"More than any of their previous albums, Dave's True Story's latest, Nature, defies expectation. And that's saying something for a band that has made a career of bending musical genres to delightful and surprising effect. For me, the music hits deeper grooves, explores more pop-inflected melodies, and reveals new emotional depths without sacrificing the group's trademark subversive take on life and love.Dave Cantor's lyrics take a more imagistic turn on this disc, the humor more existential than on previous releases. Kelly Flint's voice is superb, as always, but her readings of the songs have found a new level of tenderness and soulfulness. Plus the album is recorded beautifully. If you're new to the band, this is the place to get to know them.

It's way, way, way below par. I knew something was amiss when the only track that grabbed me on the first listen turned out, on closer inspection, to be a Cat Stevens cover.True-blue believers will need to have it, but anyone unfamiliar with KH's genius should start somewhere--anywhere at all--else.

What saved her work from mediocrity in her time with the Throwing Muses was her fellow musicians, especially drumming legend David Narcizo.SKY MOTEL, her last (and third) solo album, was decent, because at least she brought in outside musicians and went heavy on the electric guitar, and almost learned real songwriting. Her first two solo albums were acoustic torture devices that I shelved permanently after the first listen. Guess which tradition Kristin follows in SUNNY BORDER BLUE?I hate to sound so harsh, but this is an artist who never really improves. Not only that, but 4AD is a selective label that only puts out a few releases a year, and it really annoys me to see one of those slots filled up by yet another Kristin Hersh album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Volume not loud enough","review":"I loved everything about this unit.

Replacement batteries cost half the price of the original purchase price, about $16. Not wanting to throw good money after bad, I tossed out the whole light. What a waste! Shame on Black and Decker.

One word of advice is these clamps do bent with they are over tightened. They do not need to be tighten so much to hold the pieces in place. Once should always use a scrap piece of wood to separate the clamp orange rubber and the finish wood. This increase the bearing area and protect the finish wood. I was a novice and found that while the orange rubber does not leave any marks on the finish wood, the contact areas stain differently.

The format of this book makes understanding the language difficult. Many concepts are left unexplained or poorly explained. I can not comment concerning its utility in a class room setting, but it fails miserably at self-instruction. I learned German through self-instruction so that when I visited Austria, I spoke only German. I had no difficulty with the language. Therefore I can comment from personal experience. I do not recommend this book for self-instruction. It should not be offered to the general reader without indicating that it is appropriate for class room instruction only."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very instructive or useful","review":"I was required to use this book for a community college Italian course that I took to improve my limited Italian. Now it has been quite some time since I was at university, but I was appalled by this book. First, it was expensive; but most significantly it appears to be written for use in middle school, certainly not college. If this represents \\"new thinking\\" in teaching language, that is, teaching adults as though they were children who need silly pictures and juvenile activities to keep their attention, our education system is in deep trouble."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly organized, confusing, relies too heavily on classroom instruction","review":"I am in a college class and this book stinks. It's set up so you can't really learn anything without a teacher or this online workbook program you have to pay extra for. It will say things like, \\"Ask your teacher how to say \\"Hello\\" in Italian.\\" Huh? What is the book for then? There is almost no vocabulary, only a small glossary in the back with the word \\"drug addict\\" but not \\"baby\\". Weird choices. 2/3 of the exercises depend on conversations with other Italian students. That's kind of dumb too. The textbook should facilitate independent study, but that's impossible. Overall, most of the content discusses Italian culture and when to use the formal vs. informal form of verbs. (not that it tells you what any of the verbs mean.)

I say attempted, because, despite my best efforts, I couldn't get through the entire book. It was slow, dull, and repetitive. It was simply a regurgitation of sermons I've heard from the time I was a child and Bible verses that I am more than familiar with. The portions where Ruth described how God's perfect love was demonstrated in her life were interesting, but she stopped short of revealing anything too personal and the stories lacked details that would have hooked me.

It is such a wonderful book on communicating God's love for us and also does a great job on explaining why so many of our struggles are from not understanding God's love (misconceptions). I went out and bought 10 copies of this book for friends/relatives as gifts. Ruth Myers \\"31 Days of Praise\\" is also an excellent book--I only use the Bible more (and that book is so full of Scripture anyway to lead us in praise of our Lord--but it also instructs on why praise is so important)."},{"rating":"2","title":"FROM THE MAN ON THE BEACH","review":"A wonderful book from a man that knows, that has been there, and is still there watching the people of Bikini cope and recover from the terrible atomic/nuclear bomb blasts.

I've lived in Micronesia for about twelve years and learned so much new about the Republic of the Marshall Islands.

YAWN...Of course, the little blonde girl is perky and cracks tiresome jokes even when the bad guys are pummeling her. And of course, she has \\"Daddy issues\\" - her father is an Interpol agent who is tracking down the bad chameleon-people too. \\"They hurt my Daddy, I'll show them (and Daddy)\\" - So instead of therapy, the main character chooses super-heroing.

First of all, the price of the ring is cheap, so I know that I can't complain too much, however, when I got the ring, it was for a Christmas stocking stuffer. The picture showed a nicely wrapped package with a bow. What I got was a tiny package that was wrapped so poorly with a generic computer printed label with no bow. I had to unwrap it to redo the wrapping, which was a good thing anyways because I wanted to check out the ring. The center diamond is very pretty, however, it is set crooked and looks like it is about to fall out. The side bands look much cheaper than the picture. I don't think the small amount of money that I spent on this ring was even worth it. The nice thing is that the center band can be removed and worn as a solitare.

Why was this book written?","review":"Imperial Earth seems like a book written to fulfill a contractual obligation. As I read this book I kept getting the feeling that Clarke had collected various notes he had written for ideas and tried to make a book out of them without much further effort. This is a very shallow book. Characters were poorly developed, and the story meandered with no purpose. At the end of the book I wondered why Clarke had introduced many (most?) of the characters and settings.Imperial Earth includes descriptions of Titan, where people live mostly underground but can go on the surface with oxygen and a thin thermosuit. The trip to Earth wasn't especially interesting. Descriptions of future Earth were given little historical background. Cultural changes were simply stated rather than explained.Way too many blanks were left for the reader to fill in. You might as well write your own book instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lackluster collection of notes about popular science seasoned with rudimentary human interest","review":"What happened to Arthur C. Clarke in 1975? The masterful author of short stories from the 1940s and 50s created a confused mess titled \\"Imperial Earth\\" in 1975. In this novel, Clarke displays his poorly-concealed desire to appear as something other than a science-fiction writer: namely, a mover-and-shaker of science and technology. This unfortunate tendency appears throughout Clarke's later work. Who cares that Clarke once spoke to Neil Armstrong (note to chapter 21)? I can't put my finger on when, exactly, Arthur Clarke digressed from the creation of superbly crafted fiction into the monotonous exposition of dull popular science, but \\"Imperial Earth\\" appears, to me, to be the epitome of this digression."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not his best but a fun yarn","review":"I don't think this is Arthur C. Clarke's best work. I like to see more of a grandiose, \\"future of civilization in thousands of years\\"--type story. This one is about a man named Duncan Makenzie who, in the year 2276, is on his first trip to Earth from the Saturnian moon of Titan. He discovers many things about Earth, himself, and humanity. Basically, it's a fun, quick read, but not as magnificent as 2001 or The City and the Stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plot Goes AWOL","review":"I loved the RAMA books, but I felt totally burned by this Clarke outing.Through the whole volume Clarke used the device of a mystery--raising motivational questions about the many underdeveloped characters (including the protagonist)--but then the book ended without resolving a single loose thread.If he was making some point about race (a theme so undeveloped that it baffled me every time a character's race was mentioned), I didn't get it.I didn't find the futurism especially novel, either (at least not as a reader in 2001--perhaps it was more exciting in 1976).The ending (and I use the term only because I ran out of pages) left me asking \\"What the &%? Am I missing some pages?\\"--reminiscent of the film ending of \\"2001 A Space Odyssey\\".Unlike that film (or the Philip K. Dick stories I've read), the interest of the ride didn't make up for the unresolved storyline. It's easily the poorest of the 7 or 8 Clarke novels I've read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting but not thrilling","review":"This book is rather boring. The futuristic images of Earth are quite interesting but a lot of the details about the characters are rather long and dull. I'd suggest you find a secon-hand copy of this book rather than buying a brand new one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Could not even finish it","review":"The only reason I got to page 157 was because Clarke was the author.

While as of this writing the movie has NOT released yet, the prospects are already looking brighter for it's success. When a soundtrack is good it bodes well for the entire movie.The original music is pretty great. The hallmark of the album is \\"So Long, And Thanks for All The Fish\\" (which, I believe will be played during the opening credits while we are treated to dancing dolphins) and it manages to create the essence of old musicals of ages past with it's swirling dance hall feel.The songs from other people are a bit more hit-and-miss... though, none are terrible. It'll be interesting to see how they fit into the film...however, the Perry Como track is excellent, as are the *essential* soundtrack-exclusive songs.My only disappointment was that the song from the teaser/trailer wasn't included,however, that is a minor complaint for a still remarkably strong soundtrack."},{"rating":"1","title":"A singular disappointment","review":"I thourougly enjoyed the movie, but these cuts remind you singularly forgettable the music sound track is (with the exception of one or two tunes such as \\"So Long and Thanks for All the Fish.\\" Save your money for the DVD, or better yet, look at the BBC video of the original TV production."},{"rating":"2","title":"A top notch read!","review":"A roller-coaster ride through an astonishing world. Jerry Jay Carroll effortlessly plants you in the middle of a breathtaking adventure -- completely implausible and yet thoroughly believable and engaging, thanks to his gifted writing. It reminded me of the opening moments of the film \\"The Fugitive\\" - you begin on the edge of your seat and never get off it through the rest of the book. Michael Crighton's (later) book TIMELINE borrows much of Carroll's theme: an unexpected trip to another era, where brutal reality is confronted and life and death decisions are commonplace. Couldn't put this one down. His sequel DOG EAT DOG is even better. INHUMAN BEINGS, while written in an entirely different genre, is also outstanding. I say, order everything Carroll's written and take them all on vacation with you. You won't be sorrow."},{"rating":"2","title":"An old story line, but well told","review":"I almost didn't complete this book. It started very slowly, and seemed to wander back and forth. When it finally got into the real meat of the story it became interesting and finished up fascinating. Bogey Ingersol not only had it all but had it all his way. Now he is caught up in the \\"never ending\\" battle of good and evil. He must must make a choice between his own selfish desire and what life and the true meaning of it is. The dog hears from both sides, and they present interesting points of view about what they represent. Will the dog be a \\"pointer\\" or \\"retriever\\". This was a much better book than I thought it would be, good job Jerry Jay Carroll."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really loved this book!","review":"This is a book that makes you step back and re-evaluate your priorities, while entertaining you at the same time. I enjoyed the mixture of fantasy and \\"real-world\\" settings, though the comparison made me wonder which world is in fact the more fantastic. For anyone who enjoys a little off-beat fantasy or even a morality tale, this is a worthwhile read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not quite there","review":"Although I found the premise of this book promising -- a human wakes up as a dog in a fantasy world -- I couldn't even finish it. The writing style was one of my least favorite, being terse with virtually no descriptions, and little emotion. The main character was unlikeable, shallow and predictable. From the beginning I was rather irritated as the behaviour of the animals, take the wolves for example, was not not realistic. It was frustrating as the book had such great potential, but didn't quite get there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sly, quirky tale--masterfully told.","review":"After reading (and very much enjoying) this author's book \\"Inhuman Beings\\", I had to go out and find more of his writings. This story, the prequel to his current \\"Dog Eat Dog\\", had me smiling and reading with a sense of glee. The story may be one we've heard before, but never quite told with the hero (anti-hero?) having such a unique perspective. And Jerry Jay Carroll is one of the most entertaining storytellers to come along in the past few years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting, but overly pompous and flowery wording","review":"Got this based on a \\"top books on the Carribean\\" review in one of the popular travel magazines. The book is old, so some of the word choice and writing style is very out of date. The descriptions of things, areas, and experiences are indeed very good and detailed, but the prose is so flowery that it comes across as very pompous and unnecessarilly wordy. I've never read a book with so many 4-5 syllable words strung together in almost every paragraph.If you're into interesting older books with flowery linguistics, this is a doosey. It does give you a clear sense of the experiences the authors had. So overall... it's a bit archaic, but gives an interesting sense of what it was like traveling in the Caribberan decades ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Basic Information","review":"While this book does contain many good rules of thumb for teachers to follow covering many aspects of the teaching experience, much of the information in this book is very basic and obvious. Most people who have had any experience in the classroom, even as a student teacher, would take many of the tips in this book for granted.

Many midlife couples today find that their nests get refilled with boomerang adult kids, aging parents, visits from kids and grandkids, or grandkids on a full time basis.I liked the section on how to learn about the danger signs of behaviors that can lead couples who have been married for decades to the divorce court.

It's my first experience with this trilogy, and I made an excellent choice.Granted, it is a biased account as Liardon wrote the narrative for each of these people - but he is honest enough to point out errors and mistakes each of these great men and women of God made. Still, do not be deterred from reading this wonderful compilation of their testimonies, for these leaders - Wigglesworth, Lake, Coe, Branham, Seymour, and others - were on FIRE for God, and the church would be much better today if we had more like them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Learning about Pentecostal pioneers!","review":"I loved this book!

The chain like hook is attached to the base with an extending bar that is crucial in keeping the hook with the bag sturdily on the table.

Many of the pictures are reversed negatives, making the shells \\"sinistral,\\" or reversed...a big oversight to shell collectors worth their weight in salt. Many of the specimens are ordinary, not intrinsically special in form or in color. It is as if the photographer simply took fairly nice photos of whatever happened to be at hand -- which is not acceptable. Where is Oliva porphyria? Conus dalli? (color/pattern) Malea ringens? Stellaria solaris? (form) My mind nearly boggles with the missed opportunities here! There are so many other existing shell books that are superior to this (The Shell, Abott, 1968, well worth owning, being a classic of the type) that I am speechless as to why this one was published.

I particularly liked Mr. Isaacson's shrewd assessments of Franklin and his motives.I did not find Mr. Isaacson's style as flowing as others but it was not pedantic. The book felt as though it was a larger book that had been scaled down in size. What it lacks, for the most part, is what Ron Chernow included in his biography of Alexander Hamilton.For example, descriptions of others around Franklin. Mr. Isaacson does have descriptions of those most germaine to Franklin's life, but Mr. Chernow has a number of portraits of others as well which gives depth to, and a fuller picture of, events often missing fron Mr.Issacson's book.Further Mr. Chernow writes at greater length and depth about the issues of the times. Mr. Isaacson seems to be less in depth and descriptive of the larger issues.I did like this book but would not put it in the same class as, say, Ron Chernow's \\"Alexander Hamilton\\" or David McCullough's \\"John Adams\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"I finally understand Ben","review":"This is the most insightful book on this significant icon of American history.

Franklin, but I never could make up my mind till I came across this book in the bookstore. What an inventor and American! Everytime I walk past the wood stove, sitting in the corner of our family room, I think of good ole Ben. Many times I had to laugh out loud at some of the things he came up with and invented, and especially when he wanted the turkey to be the national bird instead of the eagle. I prefer the eagle, but we know there are a lot of liberal buzzards flying around in Washington these days.This book is eduactional, informative and should be required for high school reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insightful, yes...entertaining, no.","review":"If you want to learn about Ben Franklin this is a fine read.

My main objection to the book is Isaacson's negativity regarding John Adams. I believe John Adams is one of the most underappreciated of our Founding Fathers. Isaacson did not miss an opportunity to add a negative adjective when discussing anything regarding John. These slurs were uncalled for and did not add to the book, unless to justify various aspects of Franklin's actions and behaviors. With this intensely negative bias against John Adams, I wonder what other opinions Isaacson interjected that, upon hearing a different perspective, I would find inappropriate and incorrect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lose 20 lbs. in one simple book!","review":"Don't learn how to lose weight by reading some overpaid TV personality, or learn confidence from an over-caffeinated yuppie.

Pain to read in general."},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterful book about Ben Franklin.","review":"When you finish this book you will feel like you know Benjamin Franklin. If you grew up in the United States, the legend of Benjamin Franklin has been shoved down your throat, but when a child is asked what Franklin did, few can tell you without mentioning a key during a lightning storm. This is a book that should be read by all those children, like me, who never really knew about what this man did for our country.Likely the epitome of the American character, Walter Isaacson takes his readers on a journey through the life of one of our first \\"self made\\" men. I'm sitting here staring at the book cover trying to think of something bad about this book and can't. Benjamin Franklin lived one of those lives that leaves you gasping for breath and the author did a fantastic job of allowing the reader come along on the Franklin-journey.I walked away from the book knowing more about Benjamin Franklin the man and feel that I'm a better person for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"In-Depth, Funny, Complete","review":"This book is funny because Franklin was funny. Maybe he wasn't funny - maybe it's that he's almost become a caricature of himself. Nevertheless, if you're a history buff, a founding father buff, a politics buff, etc. this book is worth the read. My only criticism is that this is a \\"everything you ever wanted to know and everything you didn't care about knowing about B. Franklin.\\" I almost felt as though I'd had my fill after about 2/3 of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazon.com is right - use your grocery money to buy this!","review":"The official Amazon.com review is right - this is indeed a book on which to spend your grocery money, and also an ideal book to give parents, grandparents, history major grandchildren, friends at work and whoever else for Christmas. How encouraging that a book as good as this is on the Amazon top 100 bestseller list.

I liked it even more than I had expected to, and I would certainly recommend it to others. It provides a great sense of both the man and his times. One of my favorite parts was the end, when Isaacson provides an overview of how people have responded to Franklin's views over time, including our time. Ben Franklin is such a central figure in American history, and this book is an engaging way to learn about him."},{"rating":"2","title":"The man is truly human...","review":"I think we all grow up hearing, reading and being told about the founding fathers but rarely do any of us really read about them as individuals. Every time I do I'm amazed at what I read and how far ahead of their time they really were. Benjamin Franklin epitomizes this; printer, scientist, inventor, diplomat, politician and above it all human. This book gets into some of that nitty-gritty; the women, the ruthless businessman, more women, questionable husband and father.The author does an amazing job walking us through Franklin's life and showing us the brilliance of the man and the fallibility at the same time.Wonderful read and would recommend it to everyone - just be prepared to devote some time to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Complicated, Talented Figure","review":"I didn't find this book as well written, -- or edited -- as the biographies of Chernow and McCollough about our Founding Fathers. But Franklin was such an incredibly talented, multi-faceted, totally original person OF HIS TIME. The author has most helpfully included at the end of this long book a list describing the major characters in Franklin's long life, as well as the important dates in his history. There is a lot to admire, such as Franklin's political savvy, and alot to be annoying, too, in his relationships with his family members. I most appreciated the parts about his dealings with the French government of Louis VI and the Treaty of Paris, which truly saved our necks. His blind spot was not foreseeing the French Revolution, duly noted by Isasacson"},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent biography","review":"Mr. Isaacson provides the reader with an immensely detailed history of Mr. Franklin's life. One of the most engaging books that I have read in the past several years, he provides tremendous detail on Ben's life. Mr. Isaacson, more than some biographers, ventures, at times, to provide analyses of his strategy. I cannot say enough good things about this book. He presents Mr. Franklin accurately. At times, I concluded, that he was a brilliant and humble person; at times, well, I was disappointed in some areas of his life, such as family, etc. I suppose that more might have been written about his early life, perhaps his years in England, France, the conflicts and compromises in 1776 and 1789 ... Of course, there are countless books on most of those topics, already... Wonderful resource!!! Well worth the purchase price, given all of the enjoyment that I obtained from it!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent popular history","review":"Walter Isaacson's biography follows the events of Franklin's life in a steady chronology, reiterating the themes that recurred through his life in a style that will make some readers impatient; personally, I found my way through with ease, as if I were reading a good novel.Even more appreciated is Isaacson's care in illuminating the themes that parallel current issues, strongly connecting our colonial history and the founding of our republic to contemporary politics. This is a great service to the reader, as well as the concluding essay on how individual opinions and cultural perspectives on Franklin have varied since he left us. It's a fine work on an American who has contributions to offer the republic yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"A very interesting book. I like the chronological time line with distinct chapters. While he was an amazing man in some respects, I was disappointed in his treatment of his family. I think the author did a great job of balancing the good and the not so good of Franklin's life. All in all, a very well rounded account."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous Book","review":"I learned so much about Franklin from this book. I realized that he wasn't really the person I had imagined him, but interesting and brillant none the less. He absolutely seemed to think 24/7 and certainly didn't waste time on idle things.I homeschool and my children will read this book. And others like it about our founding fathers. So much better than a textbook, which we avoid!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I can't put it down","review":"I read Benjamin Franklin's autobiography a few years ago and thought I would check out Walter Isaacson's book. I love it. It is written well and such an easy read. I am really enjoying his style and hate to put it down. I truly look forward to reading it every evening."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tremendous biography","review":"This is exactly what I look for in a biography -- it's about one of the most important people in the history of our country, and after I was about a chapter into the book, I could not put it down. I found myself reading it every time I had a free moment. It is easy to read and loaded with useful and interesting information about a fascinating man. I would recommend this to anyone, whether it be a history buff or just someone who enjoys a good read. On a side note, it's funny to me how differently the Franklin-John Adams relationship is portrayed by Isaacson compared to how David McCullough described it in his Adams book."},{"rating":"2","title":"decent","review":"I dont recommend the Cd verison, its a little boring. Franklin was an extraordinary individual who predicted americas expansian, negotiated our peace and set the basis for our way of life. At the same time he was a scientist and a brilliant businessman. AN important book about a man who was quintisentially American. Pulling himself up by his bootstraps."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intelligent and Balanced","review":"What can we say that hasn't already been said about this really worthwhile biography?This is a fascinating and seemingly thorough portrayal of a fascinating and complex man, including his flaws.Franklin was not perfect. In fact, had we known him, we might not have liked him (some did not). But we would have had to have understood that he was exceptional.I didn't know before that he was so unwilling to be affectionate with those expected to be closest to him.I didn't fully appreciate the genius of his scientific work.I had always understood that he was a \\"great compromiser\\" and that this had been instrumental to the success of our nation's early history. I did not understand how this was a culmination of his personality and philosophy - and how it was forshadowed from his earliest years.And why he has come to be seen as the prototypical American.I can recommend this book without reservation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book to learn about a Great Man","review":"I enjoyed this book. It took Ben Franklin out of that gray area between important founding founder and silly character that many people have in their heads. It wasn't afraid to show some of his faults, his family life left much to be desired. It is funny that while reading John Adams you would get a not too flattering view of Franklin and after reading this book you might not favor Adams.I recommed this book for anyone interested in Franklin. Even if you think you know Franklin, read the book to learn something new. From reading books such as this you understand the trial and tribulations of giving birth to not only a new but great nation."},{"rating":"2","title":"A highly recommended book and life.","review":"Benjamin Franklin is what I wish America was today-hard work mixed with good marketing. Unfortunately, to paraphrase Thomas Edison, Americans don't want real success today because it's hard work wrapped in overalls. Bubble this, bubble that. Get rich through the internet, get rich through real estate. The mythical instant success. Through Mr. Isaacson's fine book we are reminded that true success is built over a lifetime; through helping others we help ourselves. Marketing is fine, self-promotion, too-as long as it is supported by substance.A fine, easy-reading biography of one of America's true patriots."},{"rating":"1","title":"Underwhelming","review":"This biography had its moments, but Isaacson was far too enamored of Franklin, and did not present a balanced view. He was overly critical of Adams, but failed to be objectively critical of Franklin (or the other Founding Fathers) in return. Franklin is the Founding Father I'd most like to meet, but this biography is far too flattering, and really, rather dull. Isaacson is a serviceable writer, but does not make the story really come alive."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a pretty dull Biography","review":"The author tries hard to convince you that Franklin is this superstar world leader, but just doesn't sell it very well. I believe Franklin is everything that history makes him out to be, but this book is written in such a dull manner that you never really get it. I guarantee everyone who has read this book paused halfway through it and were relieved to discover that the last 50 pages are appendices and such ending the misery much earlier."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good...but not great.","review":"This was a very informative book. It is always hard to write a biography on such an important person, you could spend volumes writing about just one part. That being said, I feel that the latter half of Franklin's life got the short shrift, compared to the thoroughness the rest of his life recieved.Overall, a very good book, and any novice on the founding of our country should read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lighthouse","review":"This is a great book, extremely well written by W. Isaacson. I am a non-American citizen with a lot of respect and interest for the history of the USA. Now I am reading several books about the Colonial era and the Founding Fathers, and I've found this to be the best book I've read so far, and Benjamin Franklin, in my modest opinion, the best American ever. I learned a lot and I feel very close to B. Franklin. He is a great model of citizenship to follow. A lighthouse to all of us!I'd recommend this book to anybody who would like to know more about the life of Benjamin Franklin (schoolar or just curious), somebody interested in the history of the US of the XVIII century, and anybody who likes to read History or Biography in general. If you feel a lack of true leadership in the overall US politicians today, this book will give you tons of it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"History through the 1-dimensional, MSM-biased lense of the former head of CNN","review":"The book is generally good, albeit dull at times, but the author's tendency to play up the strengths and downplay the weaknesses of individuals he considers to be \\"liberal heroes\\" (e.g., Ben Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, etc.) and to slam those he considers to be \\"conservative villains\\" (e.g., John Adams, John Dickinson) is shallow and irritating, but not surprising from the former Managing Editor of TIME magazine and Chairman and CEO of CNN. The same lense through which both TIME and CNN spin, I mean, report current political news is the lense through which the author distorts the descriptions of certain historical figures at times in the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Franklin was a scientist, not a fool","review":"Contrary to urban legend he did not \\"discover\\" electricity nor did he fly a kite to capture electricity from lightening. He was a better scientist than that. Was this author careful with the research?"},{"rating":"1","title":"From the left","review":"Mr. Isaacson seems to come from the left. After reading John Adams by David McCullough, I considered Adams an American hero. McCullough did as well, having begun a biography on both Jefferson and Adams and continuing only with Adams, finding him a much fuller character. However, Isaacson has nothing but disparagement for Adams. He considers him a Puritannical figure who just made life difficult for Franklin, the most tolerant of men. He seems to much prefer Franklin's brand of morality to Adams'. There's either balance or good judment missing, I believe."},{"rating":"1","title":"a bit TOO biased","review":"I love biographies, however not when the facts are skewed in favor of the person being chronicled. Even at his worse, the author has managed to justify Franklin's actions. If you like rantings about every specific detail or want have your opinion about Franklin already made for you, then this book is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Other Side of Ben Franklin","review":"When I took US History in College, the various instructors took pot shots at Benjamin Franklin, not really giving the poor old guy a chance. This book give a more balanced look at Ben's whole life and the events that changed his outlook on life. I still take to heart his creed to never speak sharply or argue in anger with anyone, speak softly and use reason to convince your fellow man (woman). This advice alone has allowed my to make headway in places that I would have never been able to before. This book also gives the reader the sense of sadness regarding Franklin's family, especially the very long time periods that he was away from his wife. Tragically, his wife died without him while he was in France. Franklin gave much to this country, I appreciate his contributions to this day and I read this book years ago."},{"rating":"2","title":"benjamin franklin: an american life","review":"A very well written book about the man; Benjamin Franklin, and the newspaper industry he was a pioneer of. A must read for anyone who wants to focus on the communications media as a career.

Poor Richard lives on in all the various media of the current age. He discovered how to make money with a printing press without printing currency."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pricing for Kindle?","review":"Why is there such a huge difference in price between the printed book and the Kindle edition?

Brand's \\"The First American: The Life and Time of Benjamin Franklin\\", I was extremely disappointed in Isaacson's effort. Quite frankly, it reads much like one would expect to find not in a good biography, but in the pages of Time magazine - simple, uncomplicated, and very light on the facts (though Isaacson freely offers his and other historians opinions throughout the book). If you want a thorough and well written biography of Franklin, you'll much prefer Brand's book to this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"overexposed","review":"Isaacson ought to be embarrassed by the shameless hype this book got from his old cronies at Time and CNN.It's not a bad book but it's just not in the same league with HW Brands' \\"The First American,\\" which is both more scholarly and readable -- despite getting almost no notice in the general media.Take a pass on this and pick up Brands' book if you want a thorough review of Franklin's fascinating life."},{"rating":"2","title":"BFranklin","review":"I bought this book thinking I was going to learn some great insight from a great contributor to our society as Benjamin Franklin, but instead I find myself fascinated by the writing style of Walter Isaacson.

I recommend this book to those who not only want to know more about BF's life but also appreciate great writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"A decent protrayal, but not very interesting","review":"This reads like most history books: dry and boring. The only reason I actually finished the book, is because the author did do extensive research, which, despite the boring writing style, I was willing to suffer through to gain more knowledge and facts about B.F."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunately Disappointed","review":"If you're looking for an uplifting inspiring book about a great man this unfortunately is not it. I found it to be focused and even bent to show a faulty man who did some great things but seemed to dull the edge of what was a very sharp man. It had of course alot of good information, it just seemed to be directed in a somewhat negatively interpreted manner for the authors own purposes or personality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Franklin's life - every last detail of it!","review":"Isaacson seems to prove that editors need editors. This book is one tedious read. We are told about details of Franklin's life that provide absolutely no useful insights. Isaacson seems to want simply to show us how thorough was his research. Our founding fathers gave birth to a busy nation - we've got better things to do than labor through this tome. Franklin was a printer. Isaacson has wasted more ink on this book than Franklin probably used in his entire life. Spare us the details, Mr Isaacson!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Benjamin Franklin: An American Fraud","review":"What a Franklinfest this turned out to be. \\"Statesman, inventor, all-around-swell guy.\\" Well, I guess that's one way to look at Ben. But another way is to focus on his elitist attitude and absolute lack of respect for people of color in his manic push to establish this country. He was swell alright, if you were a white, British aristocrat, but a nightmare to everyone else. Arrogant, egotistical. He was never shy to tell others how to live their lives. As mentioned in this book, he even had the audacity to rewrite parts of the Constitution that Jefferson had painstakingly labored over. What a jerk.I loved the mention of the kite-flying incident, however."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worthy of your time","review":"This is a very boring book that is written in a way that will frustrate any reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly boring...","review":"This was one of the worst books that I have ever dragged myself through. Our bookclub decided to read this thing based on all of the rave reviews. It is a great example of why you shouldn't trust reviews. Perhaps if you are a history maniac, this book would entertain you. For the rest of us, it brought back memories of college history classes that we just wanted to 'get through'.Wow. This book was a total waste of time (lots of it) and money. My college-aged son said that he would drop a class if Benjamin Franklin was on the reading list. My daughter (senior in high school) loves history, but said that she would draw the line at a 500+ page book about Benjamin Franklin.I should have listened to my kids instead of the reviewers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Need to buy again","review":"The book was not in very good condition.

I found myself loving Ben Franklin then hating him and back and forth. At the end of the book my take on Ben Franklin was that he was amazingly talented but also a human being with the falts that come being human. More than any other biography I have read Ben came to life for me because of the multidimesional portrait Isaacson creates in his writing. This is what I wish we all learned about history. We are usally given the one sided story about great people and they seem as if they are not human. I highly recommend this book. Great work!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book.

They add \\"Greenshaw's Folly\\" from \\"Adventures of the Christmas Pudding\\". It also has additional material about Miss Marple novels. I enjoyed several of the stories, such as \\"Sanctuary\\", but found others to be absurd. The \\"Dressmaker's Doll\\" and \\"In a Mirror Darkly\\" where really about the supernatural, quite unlike what I come to expect from Agatha Christie, where the supernatural always ends up having a logical explanation. I was waiting in both cases for Poirot or Miss Marple to come in and explain it, but both stories end abruptly leaving many questions unanswered."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incorrect Information","review":"I'm sure the 7 short stories by Agatha Christie are excellent as usual. The problem is that if you are looking for the Audio Edition read by JOAN HICKSON, this is NOT read by her. Amazon is listing that she reads it, but this information is incorrect.

It is an awesome mix of cod, olive oil, tomato, feta cheese, etc. It tastes phenomenal and looks great plated.The best thing about these recipes is they almost all cook in twenty minutes. Twenty minutes is how long it takes for my rice cooker to cook the rice. It is also almost the same amount of time I cook my asparagus (I usually cook in the convection an use a rack to raise the seafood so I slip the asparagus under the rack to): simple and fast. Since the recipes are from restaurant cooking, they can be prepared ahead of time, ready to put in the oven after it preheats.

Robert Barefoot's science is sound. If people take the coral calcium and don't have a good response or any response it wouldn't take long for Mr. Barefoot to be out of business.

This book is just preying on the gullible, plain & simple. Besides--there are hundreds of ways a person can fulfill his or her RDA of calcium CHEAPLY & EASILY just by eating calium-rich foods like green, leafy vegatables, broccoli (1 c.=1 c. of absorbable calcium in milk), soy products, beans, cabbage, almonds & most nuts, sesame seeds, salmon, etc. And don't forget your daily multi-vitamin, & you'll be in good health.

He apparently wants to scare ignorant people into buying expensive \\"coral\\" calcium to maintain their health.In addition the implication is that this product comes from the coral beds in Okinawa..How can this be true when all the coral reefs are protected from predation.

Each time, they were supposed to have UPS pick up the old one- and each time, UPS did not come.The only reason I'm giving it 2 stars is because clearly, it works with some computers, and for those people it might be great.

This is a minor nitpick, I'm just not a big fan of McFarlane's recent trend of rats as toy accessories.

True, the film is old and grainy and sometimes slightly blurry. But it doesn't matter. The casting and vocals are unbeatable. I'm so glad to have seen Pavarotti in this role and in his prime, when he fully committed to everything with his whole being rather than just vocally doing so. He is superb (though he wobbles on the High C in \\"che gelida manina\\"), as is the rest of the cast. But the biggest revelation for me was Scotto. I grew up seeing her as Musetta on the other Met Boheme, and never really understood her following. Thank goodness I saw this. Her performance is something I cannot shake. It has an emotional depth to it that fits perfectly with her vocal choices - she crushed me. \\"Senza rancor\\" is the highlight of the night - I had to rewind it a few times.

The book's first couple of chapters is about their very interesting return to the U.S. and how they had to re-adapt to their former life, but the rest of the book is wholly about other left-behind parents' stories. Most of the book contains incessant \\"name dropping\\" and how Betty has dedicated her life to travelling the world speaking about the plight of left-behind parents all the while leaving the reader to wonder in who's care she would always be leaving her child Mahtob, especially since she repeatedly mentions the looming threat of the return of her husband, Moody. The book could be a bit boring especially the story about the \\"Mother of Algiers\\" and often she refers to people in which the reader does not recall because the stories were numerous, redundant and poorly developed for any hope of retention."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seemed Enough","review":"Personally I feel that this book was nothing more than a follow up of the first. It wasn't a good read in my estimation, nor was it interesting, as was the first book. The first book seemed enough for the story being told. The second seemed to negate many of my view about the first and didn't seem to help the woman's image.

Love has no limits, no boundaries and no issues of control. Loving a child means doing what is best for that child beyond your own issues and your own selfishness. Ripping a family apart instead of addressing the issues as an adult and then using those difficulties to make a living off of seem to be more control and selfishness than love for a child. The book seemed to exude satisfaction for the revenge and used love of a child as an excuse for that behavior."},{"rating":"1","title":"Riduculous","review":"Ridiculous to publish anything like this. Sounds as if a vengeful writer just can't let go of her mistake in life. How many marriages does it take to know you need help in relationships? How much control some women want. Even of their own children. Personally I saw the whole situation as a matter of control by both parties. A lot of people have custody battles. The Dr. did what he had to do to try to secure his parental rights too didn't he? Didn't he realize that if the writer filed for divorce that she would use the child as a leverage for alimony and support? After all he was a doctor and Betty was, well, what?

I am curious as to who will be answering for what when judgement comes. Someone will be very embarrassed in front of God and Mahtob.

It shoudl appeal to those who like the sound of bands like Van Halen, Judas Priest, or Alcatrazz, a sharp combination of pop and metal.Both the English version and Japanese version are excellent.

It's good for teens, being one.Applied Astrology - this chapter in the book talks all about the sun signs. It has different scents that are good for each sign to love, relationship, and future careers. It was one of my favorite sections -- but that's probably because I'm a horoscope junkie.Rules - the rule part is good, it isn't that strict, yet it gets the points across. And no, Wiccans do not have crazy rules like you must shave off all your hair and dance around every 15 seconds (if someone says there are such crazy rules don't listen please)Spellcraft -- this chapter has the rules for spell casting and spells like 'Heartbreak Healer' or 'Friendship Key' and they're fairly simple spells.I recommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"jammed","review":"These clamps jamb in the closed position.

(An average of 4). You already know about the movies and the sweet suffering of pain and all that. Let me tell about the package. It's a little disappointing. First, it comes in this giant size tin. Inside the tin is NOT 2 individual keepcases (Which would have been preferable) but 1 CD jewel case with both DVDsin it. It does come with two cool 5 x 7 theatrical poster replicas and a 48 page booklet with behind the scenes. The DVD's do have some extras like trailers, commentary by Clive Barker and Ashley Laurence and writer Peter Atkins, widescreen and a featurette for each film. BUT no deleted scenes, which is very upsetting!!! They have them in the still gallery but why not have them in a deleted scenes format. That would have been great. All in all a good buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe I wasted 3 hours of my life","review":"I don't get it. I've read the reviews on this site and I was looking for an incredible horror experience.Are you kidding me?Let's not discuss the third rate acting. This is a horror film. Let's talk about special effects. Close ups of flesh colored plastic being hooked. Plastic melting off a skeleton and being run backwards at high speed. Drooling costumes which leave slimey trails. This is gore? This is shocking? I ate dinner during this film!The plot is cute but a poor vehicle for the rest of the film. The cinobites or whatever die in awful Saturday morning cartoon graphics. Low budget is no excuse for bad special effects.If you want gore, get Dawn of the Dead. If you want low budget brilliance, see Dead Alive or the Evil Dead series. If you want to be scared, go to the theatre and watch the re-release of The Exorcist.If you want to waste your time and money, pick up Hellraiser."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movies but are we seeing all of them?","review":"This beautifully presented box set is a treat. Visually stunning the movies themselves do a great job of recreating the atmoshere of isolated dread that Clive Barker is so good at. My only issue with this edition is one of censorship. I have a strong feeling that there have been cuts made to the very end if the first movie. There was an \\"uncut\\" version of hellraiser on VHS floating around a few years back and that differed to the standard video edition. This DVD seems more like the trimmed version. I may be wrong but I have a strong suspicion about this one. Seeing as how this is not available in region 4 yet, this is as good as it gets so I've got no complaints and as I said, the presentation is sensational."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic piece","review":"I must say that irregardless of future attempts to revive this series, only two of them wholly stand out. Of these, the original Hellraiser comes second. With the release of this limited tin, we get a few goodies, decent sound, excellent picture quality, and a very original screenplay. Yet, it does lose a little towards the end. One must remember, though, that this movie was made in the middle 80's, and truly pioneered some of the shock horror we have become accomodated to today. Hellraiser 2 picks up where the first lets off, and the first 30 minutes are truly awesome. The story is filled with moments that can lead us to a truly scary movie. But after that first 30 minutes is up, the movie goes to hell, both literally and storywise. I would recommend buying this tin if you want the extras both discs offer, but if that does not interest you, buy the first and Bloodline, then rent the rest and laugh."},{"rating":"2","title":"everything you'd expect and then some","review":"i thought the authors provided a wonderfully comprehensive account of western europe. on those long train rides i found myself reading up on the political history of greece or the history of the plantaganets in great britain. i loved this book! there is so much to see in western europe, i'd like to ask those who don't like it exactly what they expect for a book which covers a couple dozen european countries. you buy a book about 20 different countries, and then don't like the fact that it covers them too quickly? what do you expect? anyway, lonely planet provided a good, concise guide to the most interesting countries in the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Always great for the beaten path.","review":"I have always been a Lonely Planet fan, and Western Europe is no exception, after reading this guide doesnt it inspire you to be a travel writer? Theese people though, know what they are doing. Europe is easy territory to cover. There are no tough issues to research nor would one have any trouble listing many a good hotels in First world Europe. The task is to remain fresh and inspiring, in a land that has been traveled and written on for centuries, and Lonely planet suceeds in Europe again and again. Each country has an introductory section that explains the history and cultural differences. Then each author goes onto cover the main cities and tiny towns in down to earth indepth coverage. They provide thorough updates and night life coverage, tour listings and landmark sights. It simply is a must for one who plans a cross country European trip."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice crib for the money","review":"Received this crib as a gift and it is wonderful! Very stlyish without a hefty price tag. Very easy to put together and extremely stable. Never had a problem with the side not dropping down to get my son in or out. Like the fact that it converts. The only 2 problems I have are that the crib doesnot convert to a toddler bed it converts to a daybed. Not a big deal right? Just by a bed safety rail and attach it to the crib. NO, none that I have found are compatable to use with a crib. Also, the conversion into a full size bed.. I was not told an additional piece was required to convert this bed. Went to BRU and was told the conversion kit is 60.00. Not a big deal however, that makes the price of the crib upwards of 300.00. Most of the cribs in that price range come with conversion kit. All in all it is a good crib for the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"As solid as an adult bed","review":"Great crib !! After checking on every possible website and consumer reports . Comparison in prices of cribs and toddler beds, multi stage beds such as this one . Cross referenceing opinons on BRU and consumer reports , etc this was the best bed for the buck. Color , make is great for a boy or girl . The only down side is the solid side (can not be lowered , like older styles). Changing wet sheets or even lowering the bed for the new crawler or walker is a feat unto itself . Other than that and a handy black and decker power drill to loosen and tighten when i need to do thats its a joy. PS Do not lose that piece supplied by the manufacturer to tighten the bolt or off to a hardware store with you"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it, I love it, I love it","review":"I absolutely love this crib. I have to admit that at first it was a little inconvenient leaning so far over to put my child in the crib, but I wouldn't exchange that for the fact that I feel that he was safe since the crib didn't have a drop down side on it. My son just turned 2 and I'm sad to say that he's moving on to a toddler bed. I'm expecting so our new son will be using the crib. My first son used this crib from day 1 after he came home from the hospital. He's jumped in it and it is extremely sturdy. As far as the safety issue that a child's limbs can get between the slats, well there's only so much one can do about that. This is within regulations and the only option is to have the slats really, really close together or have the cribs be solid. I just want to say that I'm extremely pleased with our purchase and would buy another if we were having twins."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality was disappointing","review":"Although we liked the look of the crib in the store, the one we received in the mail was of less quality. I was upset that the front of the crib had these jagged holes where the screws fit into. These holes were not smoothed out as they were on the store version. Rather there were these splinter-like edges that needed wood plugs, which the manufacturer refused to supply as they thought it to be a safety hazard. A BIG ALSO, if you want one of those musical crib toys, the edges of this crib are too wide to fit the toys properly and you will end up placing it either somewhere where the baby can hardly see it or where the baby can bump into it once he or she starts rolling around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Crib / day bed","review":"We used this bed for both our children. It's light weight and very durable, both kids have learned to climb in and out of it, jumped on the mattress inside over the years and it was still good as new.

We recommend it for other parents."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Dangerous Crib - Should be Recalled","review":"My 15 month old son's leg has gotten caught in the side rails (between the spindels). Very painful and hard to remove his leg. I just called the manufacturer and they said they have had three other complaints for the same thing. They warned that if I use a netting to close up the space, that the baby may be caught in the netting which can be dangerous. They did not give me any other solution but to make it into the toddler bed which I feel is a little too early for his age. Very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be Careful!","review":"It is true, this crib is very nice looking and durable for the money. However the ameriwood \\"lifetime\\" crib has not lasted a lifetime for us. In fact it didn't even make it through one child. This is because my daughter's leg got stuck between the slats resulting in numerous brusies to her knee and thigh and because we couldn't her leg back through we had to cut the one of the slats.

Some of the concepts resonate (although nothing new), but... it's poorly written, self-laudatory ad nauseam and, sadly, just leaves a very negative impression of Mr. Dyer (the \\"Dr.\\" title just doesn't seem to fit in this case).Soliciting money for his friend in Maui was in very poor taste, his name-dropping monotonous, and his self-righteous undertone throughout the book, a bit alarming.Doubtful I'll be spending any more of my hard earned money on Dyer propaganda and will advise my friend the same.

Although certain phrases in the first few chapters were truly remarkable, I thought that the whole read as a big love fest of Wayne Dyer himself. There were many times that I found it to be outright narcissistic. For example, when Dyer referred to himself as the reincarnation of St. Francis, I found that to be highly inappropriate. It is my opinion that this work is a wordy and uninteresting curriculum vitae of Wayne Dyer. It is an amassment of dropped names and quotations.

The recipes do not require too many ingredients and no hard-to-find ingredients like some other cookbooks. The recipes also have low fat or fast labels (or both) on them. This cookbook also has many pictures and nutritional breakdowns for every recipe. The only thing I do not like about this cookbook is some recipes often require lots of pots and pans and sometimes too many things going on at once (but I'm a beginner cook though).

Unfortunately, the amusing premise of a middle-aged, overweight and clean shaven (!) Fidel going on a covert operation in the rural byways of Ronald Reagan's America is wasted in a standard-issue, Cold War, anti-left plot. Hoyt's grip on politics is pretty pedestrian and, if memory serves, he seemed much more interested in Castro's youthful tryout with the New York Yankees.I was smiling writing the description above, but in remembering the actual experience of reading the book, I just honestly can't recommend it, no matter whether you're a leftist like me or a rock-ribbed, free-marketeer capitalist.

Why would you ever admit to getting your ass beat on a diss song?\\"If you was really callin shots round here/The homie Bad would never gotten jumped on round here\\"???It's not terrible, but it's a terribly disappointing effort. Especially after a great album like Personal Business."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mac User BEWARE!!!!","review":"First of all let me say that if you're a PC user, read all the other reviews of this unit. It really is a nice unit with all the features described. The reason I'm giving it two stars is because of what I feel is Canon's intentional misleading of the public when they claim that this is Mac compatible. From the box to the manual to the website, Canon uses the Mac logo to communicate that this unit is Mac compatible. This is only PARTIALLY true. This unit works ONLY as a printer and fax with the Macs - NOT A SCANNER. No where is this ever communicated. Even the printed manual and the Advanced Manual that is provided as a PDF on an included CD make any mention of the fact that you can not use this as a scanner on a Mac. Furthermore, Canon has no plans on ever making a driver so that you can do scans on a Mac. It's not bad that the unit can't do Mac scanning but I'd rather know about that BEFORE I purchase it and set it up at home."},{"rating":"2","title":"Missing some key functions","review":"Pros:- Small size- Fast printer- Ability to scan to network drives, email, and directly to a USB drive plugged into the front of the unit.- Duplexed printingCons:- Cannot scan direct to PC over network. However since you can scan directly to a PDF saved automatically to a shared network folder, this wasn't a big deal to me. You lose the ability to do WIA/Import functionality though.- Cannot print over network to the multipurpose tray. This is a big loser for me. Best workaround is to print to the preview mode, run up to printer, stick envelope in, then continue the print. A hassle.Overall this is a great printer for the price. However these two weaknesses make for some difficulties in use."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far so good !","review":"It has all the important features (duplex printing and networking)that I wanted in a laser MF for under $400.Copying, sending/receiving fax, scanning, and printing worked fine onWindows XP and Vista. Networked printing and faxing worked fine tooon Windows, just plug the printer to a hub/switch then configure thenetwork driver. Scanning can't be networked.It has power saver mode and printer toner saver too and it's fast andquiet for me.The only cons is that I wish that it has Linux printer driver"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good AIO printer with a few quirks","review":"This printer is pretty good general AIO. There are a few quirks that I encountered during my use that are probably specific to my printer/myself. The scanner is moderate resolution, so photos tended have some banding. Adequate for computer use, but not great for re-printing. The device has VERY limited capability for heavier than normal paper, and there is minimal/no option for custom paper sizes or envelopes. Because of its size, the cartridges are smaller and you will need to replace them more frequently than a normal size printer. I was never able to get the email feature to work, as I suspect I didn't have a server. As for networking, once connected to a wireless router and the drivers installed on each wireless computer, everything worked well. I had to power cycle the printer once a month, probably due to my router. But, in the end, I would buy this printer again, if I needed everything in a small package."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great printer - extremely satisfied","review":"I have been extremely pleased with this printer - a printer is something that one uses all the time and just wants it to work. I have been pleased that I can scan, fax, email and just plain print double sided copies effortlessly. The best testament is that I don't think about it, it's just there when I need it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreliable Fax Reception","review":"I need a reliable fax/copier that can copy/send legal-size as well as 8.5 * 11 pages. I have an excellent Fujitsu scanner and do not need a backup. Since replacing an old HP multifunction two months ago with the Canon MF4690, I have had nothing but trouble receiving faxes on my dedicated line, and some problems sending faxes. I've gone over the settings several times; no relief. As the HP received and sent without a hitch until the day it died, it is certainly not a case of anything else changing but the fax machine. The MF4690, in my humble opinion based on 4 decades of office automation consulting, is a piece of junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreliable machine...do not buy","review":"First MF4690 I bought, I had to return in 2 weeks as the roller for the fax autofeed was getting stuck resulting in a load creeky noise. And the fax stopped working. I sent it back and received a new one from Amazon. With in about 3 months the LCD display says \\"Toner not set\\". I paid $70 and bought a new toner and installed it. After printing the first page, I got the same \\"Toner not set\\" message. My business is getting affected. I regreat buying this machine. I hope some day Canaon makes their printers like they make their cameras."},{"rating":"1","title":"When it's working it's great","review":"Ok, first off, let's just admit straight upfront, we're using apple computers and an apple network, so at least part of my frustrations can be brushed off because of that. However, we've had this about a month and a half and it's been actually functioning about 1/2 the time. I've spent several weeks going back and forth with tech support. It was kind of a pain to setup initially, but once we got it hooked up with an IP address, it was working (at least printing), but then a power outage appeared to cause it to have stopped communicating again. I'm still going back and forth with Canon support (so far they've suggested all the obvious again)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Windows Yes, Mac No","review":"This is probably nearing the end of its product cycle. It is a fantastic Windows networked printer (wired), but even with the 1.8 version OSX drivers (that you download, no MAC drivers or documentation is enclosed), I cannot get it to print networked as a standalone printer. It is possible, however, to print over the network if it is \\"shared\\" by a windows computer. Scanning is to USB. It will work with a MAC if connected by USB, and it works very well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great machine. When working.","review":"I was very satisfied with it. Starts printing fast. Double-sided printing. Setting up on the network was easy and worked the first try. Great quality copying. Not as bulky as other brands/models.But after 2 months and a half of use and less than 1000 prints:- toner life is short- it broke. Seems to be the power supply. Took it to a local Canon service facility and it has been there for 2 weeks. They are not able to tell when it will be ready. They say Canon hasn't shipped them the needed part yet and there is no estimate of when the part will be shipped.So my rate is affected by the low reliability I experienced, slow warranty service and high cost of ownership based on the toner's life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be warned","review":"The product wasn't the version (shape) that was described. I didn't find the particular version a problem, I simply had to purchase alternate accessories, which was a Christmas morning bummer. The main problem was that a channel was blown (only one side was producing music.) I'm still in the process of returning it so I cannot comment on the return process.Be warned - your refurbished ipod may not be all you expect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warriors at work .... but some writing needed","review":"A story about a group of warriors in Vietnam - doing a job that most of us can barely fathom. I did not realize the HAL-3 (Seawolves) Squadron had such action during the Tet Offensive. Mr. Kelly does a decent job of chronicling some of the Seawolves' missions - but his writing lacks the finesse and skill that would have brought this book to another level. It was too much like Rambo using a typewriter. There is more to describing people than using the nicknames and telling us their favorite weapons.\\"Chickenhawk\\" is a much better helicopter chronicle of the Vietnam War, although it doe not involve the Seawolves or the US Navy."},{"rating":"2","title":"who knew?","review":"This is an excellent book on a little known unit created by the Navy during the Vietnam conflict. Two thumbs up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"HAL-3 reader","review":"Someone commented on Mr. Kelly's other Seawolves book, \\"First Choice\\", that it sounded like Navy propaganda. That's what I thought about this one. He really dumps on Army pilots in this book. And there's too much about the SEALs and not enough about the aircrew. It reads like fiction - I kept looking at the spine of the book to make sure that it was indeed a non-fiction book. I won't be buying \\"First Choice\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok, not great","review":"This is not Toni's Price's best.

I was surprised at the weight of the product. It was very heavy and solidly built.My only complaint was the mantel piece holes did not line up with the pegs on top of the shelf. My husband said he can drill out the holes a little bigger to make it fit. The color was great and looks fabulous in my kitchen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bookcases are great, mantel tops less so...","review":"I ordered two of these narrow folding bookcases, one wide one, and mantel tops for all three to complement my white kitchen cabinetry and make my cookbook and vintage Pyrex storage/display uniform, instead of the hodgepodge of shelves I'd made do with for years. The shelves and tops are all solid wood, crisply painted, and the shelves are idiot-proof when it comes to assembly: 1. Stand it upright. 2. Unfold it. That said, though they're from the same Home Decorators manufacturer, the little pre-drilled holes on the mantel tops don't align perfectly with the pegs on the bookcases; the wide one was fine, but the narrow ones were askew and I had to bow the bookcase frames outward slightly to get the top to fit on all four pegs.Once I lined up the shelves together, only an obsessive would notice the discrepancy. A more determined person than I could also drill out the holes a bit to better align them...but I'm lazy, and for my purposes these worked out fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wobbly - Defects","review":"First - the color. I agree it is a bit dark for Honey Oak, but not at all Cherry as some other reviewers have indicated.Second - the quality. I'm disappointed. There are dark defects in the wood and the shelves are wobbly. The only thing I can adjust are the braces in the back (with a hex wrench)so the shelves will have to remain a bit loose. There are also \\"mistake\\" holes near the hinge where clearly it was drilled wrong. Product like this should not be shipped. QC !!Third - the little connectors on top. I don't intend to stack mine and it has those little connectors sticking out of the top. They are dark and obvious. So far I have not been able to remove them.I have a very similar bookcase I bought several years ago that is constructed much better than this. Apparently it's true - they just don't make things the way they used to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Purchase","review":"I bought this bookcase for my college dorm room, though I can definitely see it being used in a house. One of the features I like the most is that the bookcase can be folded up when not in use, which makes it easy to store, transport, and assemble. It is also strong enough to actually hold all of my books (I have had bookcases collapse in the past). It has a nice, polished look to it. The color shown in the picture is accurate. It was delivered promptly. I love this bookcase, and plan to keep it when I am done with college."},{"rating":"2","title":"Honey Oak is more of a cherry...but overall fantastic","review":"I love the fact that you literally unfold the bookcase right out of the box... no assembly required. Fantastic. It is good wood, put together well, and the finish is smooth and even throughout. The only thing is that the color Honey Oak looks more like a cherry than the oak in the picture... but that is okay for my needs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value for the price","review":"This was my husband's purchase. Solid construction. Originally chose this one because it's the only one I found with \\"quick change\\" blades, however they use set screws just like every other one.

The interface is much different from iMovie. I looked around and discovered that everyone recommend the book \\"Final Cut Express 2 Editing Workshop\\" by Tom Wolsky ISBN:1578202566.

Here are three examples of the failings:1. Salsa is constantly referred to in various recipes though the book does not have a salsa recipe.2. There is no index to speak of. I could not lookup what page a salsa recipe was on, so rather flipped through the book twice not finding one.3. Various Mexican vegetables are described which will not be familiar to the layperson which was good, though pictures of the vegetables were not included. It is great to know that I need jicama, chayote, and serrano peppers, though it is a bit hard to go and buy them if I am only going by a verbal description.My recommendation is do not buy this book.

But it's not really. Sure, kids will get something out of the book, but a knowledge of the bible and scientific history are almost required. There are some fascinating truths revealed about the fossil record that weren't shared with us growing up being indoctrinated with the theory of evolution.

He is a natural storyteller and has something to say about deerhunting. He also has a no bull approach to the topic - just telling it like it is.

As a finish sander, these blades have a pretty acute angle to give a nice, clean surface (which they do very well). Planers made for hogging out more material have more obtuse bevels, which are less fragile, but produce a rougher surface. The reviewer who recommended taking lighter cuts was exactly on target; if you use a finish planer, you need to take light cuts. For short boards, you can also feed them at an angle to decrease the stress on the bevel edge, and get a slightly smoother cut."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really short lived blades","review":"Other reviewers have questioned if these blades are made from butter.

It's a classic from the 1960's when people looked forward to space, and it is still with us in 2000 when people are in space. The only thing that has changed is the look of the lava lamp--it has been updated to fit modern tastes and sensibilities.Enter the silver streak models of lava lamps which the 8621 is part of. While the classic angular shape of the lamp stays the same, the lamp base and top is made in brushed chrome for a sleek, sheek look resembling stainless steel cocktail shakers standing end-to-end, and with designer drinks suspended in between. it looks good as mood lighting in an art gallery, as well as sitting inside a dorm room.The 8621 model features passionate red colored globules floating in grape purple liquid. search for a pic of 8621 on the net to see what it looks like."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE BORING DOBERMANS","review":"The last of The Doberman Gang saga, is as boring and absurd as the first two are silly but entertaining and fun two watch on a sunday with large pop corn on your tv room sofa.

She did get nominated for the best Pop Vacal Album for a latin Grammy this year. The cd actually is pretty true to the original recording by Mecano. There is not too much change but still I feel that it is a good cd. The only songs that are \\"dancy\\" are Me Cole En Una Fiesta and Ay Que Pesado. These two tracks are probably the most \\"Fey\\" songs. As we all know she is not a teenager any more and she has to grow up so we see a more mature side of her. But the little electronic changes and her raspy voice add a twist to the songs that are pleasent. If you LOVE Mecano you might be a little bias towards this album since Ana Torroja has a higher pitched voice than Fey.

The sales for her cd Vertigo may had not been the best but to give us this \\"fuerza del destino\\" after that wonderful \\"Vertigo\\" experience is far beyond unreasonable. Her voice sounds v good on this new record but the lyrics sounds dumb and after all nobody can sing them like mecano (I respect their music but I dont enjoy it).

It has a length of 4.5\\" and a diameter of 0.75\\". To give you a better idea: It's about the thickness of my thumb. In fact, I think that my *small* Tantus butt plug has a slightly larger diameter in the middle then this dildo. That's how small it is. It would probably be a good size for first time anal users who would like to use a strap on and can't accommodate any more then the size of a small butt plug.

A substandard dystopic work that wears its less-than-profound philosphical ruminations on its sleeve, In the Country of Last Things is Auster's longest title and worst book ( the best would be Leviathan, in case you're wondering. ) Here, as in the New York Trilogy, his writing is far too Livres de Poche -- meaning spare and vague, like all Camus-influenced French fiction. Worse, he has no talent for imagery, which means that this book in no way approaches Riddley Walker as a post-holocaust vision, despite what the inside jacket says. ITCOLT isn't even as good as Martin Amis's sister novel Other People.

After a month and a half of searching, I found one on the shelves at Wal-Mart just after they'd put out their shipment. Finding one was a lot of trouble, but it was worth it! Mer-Man is very cool.

One arm has ball joint shoulder while the other has an action gimmick. Press the button on Mer-man's back and the right arm strikes forward...this gives him a rotating shoulder and elbow. His chest armor isn't very secure...it's flappin' in the breeze...and speaking of flapping in breezes, just take a loo-nah...I'll let you find that out for yourselves.

Go somewhere else and buy it for half the price. I did receive a refund on my purchase, but I was really hoping for the curved spine which I haven't been able to find anywhere.

The second time we set up the tent the other fly pole broke ( and I was being cautious because of what happened the last time). I do have to say that it poured the first night we used the tent and we stayed dry. It's cramped if you have a queen size blow-up mattress, so it then becomes a two person tent.

On the second trip out, the mesh tore at the seam, and one of the poles failed before we even started putting up the tent. I called Eureka directly, and they were happy to repair the tent for me... as long as I paid shipping both directions. I was not happy enough with the tent to go through that process.Amazon was terrific, and gave me a full refund.

I had attached all clips to the poles and the tent was fully staked except for one loop inside, which stabilized the door in the room divider. The two main fiberglass poles that supported the rain fly split lengthwise and then sheered in two. The tent collapsed to the ground and could not be righted without replacement parts.

I play this CD constantly.Yes, his voice sounds eerily like Stevie's,but so what? That's where the similarity ends, in my opinion. He was blessed with a gift and I find it hard to believe that he would \\"copy\\" Stevie's singing style.

Way too many slow songs for my taste. \\"Beautiful Eyes\\" was the only other track I really got into.

The knife is very useful to have especially for opening envelopes or deliveries. The other tools (nail file, tweezers, pen, toothpick) are especially nice to have when you need them. The problem with this is that the hinged cover for the scissors has a tendency to open while in your pocket and when it does, it weakens the hinge until it eventually snaps off. The spring on the scissors also did not last long and broke into two making the scissors difficult to use.If this product had lifetime warranty, I would give it 5 stars but since it only came with a 30-day warranty when I got mine, it gets 2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glimmers of Promise","review":"I found this book very \\"thin,\\" something I'm sure was due in part to the fact that this is an epistolary novel and one with very short epistles! I think, had Kun developed the book, and his character of Sid Straw, let him interact with others in scenes, the book might have had some substance. As it is, I got no real sense of Sid Straw as a person and I didn't care one bit about his plight. Everything in this book is so \\"on the surface\\" that it's almost impossible to care.And funny? There were one or two glimmers of potential humor, but that's as far as I'll go and even with that, I'm being generous. I got so sick of reading the phrase, \\"Eat Wheaties!\\" over and over and over again that I just began skipping it.I might try another novel of Michael Kun's but I'm returning this one to the store where I bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very disappointing read","review":"I don't believe this book deserved to be published. The protagonist is a whining loser who is dealt unfairly by life, mainly as a consequence of his own poor handling of relationships. He comes out well in the end through no major effort or change of his own.The story is told via the letters he writes to others, so half the dialogue is missing and is conveyed only by implication. Additional writings are offered, in the form of the main character's college paper columns and fiction writing trials, but the cleverness and wit displayed in those pieces seem out of sync with the lack of imagination he displays in dealing with his life problems.This uninteresting and somewhat unbelievable character lives in a world with no dramatic tension. In my view, the book works as a feebly humorous fantasy, if that's your taste."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fun, Fast, Fabulous Read","review":"At first glance, it's easy to characterize this book as a story about a man obsessed with Heather Locklear. But it's more about one man's quest to leave a good impression and the horrifically bad impression he apparently leaves while trying to do so. We've each been in that situation -- where we just want to be understood, but seem only to be misunderstood more and more, and can't stop trying to fix it. This book traces that downward spiral for its protagonist and letter-writer. And Mike Kun somehow manages to convey this poignancy with laugh-out-loud hilarity that will make you want to share every other page (and letter) with your nearest neighbor. A great read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great beach read!","review":"If you're looking for a quick read that will make you laugh out loud, this book's for you.

I am using it with an undersized compressor but it is still working fine and putting down a great finish. As some have already said, there are few if any instructions besides the obvious so get out a large piece of scrap wood or cardboard and practice before you do the job. I've only used Alkyd paint so far and have been thining it with 4oz Penetrol to 1Qt paint on a 2.0nozzle which is not the one that comes standard. With the right size compressor, you probably don't need the larger tip.

To get good results the gun should be held approx. 6 inches fron the surface and moved slowly and evenly. Also, latex paint should be thinned with 10% water. Water may raise the grain on wood so another round of sanding may be needed before the final coat. In addition, this spray gun uses a fair amount of compressed air. The owner's manual states that it requires 8.5 scfm @ 40 psi. My compressor is rated at 8.0 scfm @ 40 psi., so it runs constantly once I start spraying, just keeping up with the sprayer."},{"rating":"2","title":"almost perfect","review":"one sentence. the plastic cup should be metal.I spray poly and the cap to the cup broke at the seams.Besides that small faul it works perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent performer","review":"Bought it last week to finish a chiffarobe I've been restoring.

Richie explores the really dark and mysterious parts of sub-bass experiences, and creates a soundscape that should serve to send chills up and down your spine in a darkened room, late at night, or in similarly dark situations.I particularly like Disconnect... the lyrics are there to add to the ambience of the track, and really caught my attention the first time I heard it.

However, the tracks on \\"Closer\\" are too repetitive for my tastes, both within themselves and viewed in the context of each other; a lot of the tracks sound similar and lack a unique character, which pushed the envelope of monotony past my tolerence. The vocals, something new for a Plastikman release, were an annoyance: pretentious and ultimately a little trite.Sorry, I'm a fan of Plastikman but can't give this one very high marks.

Making history as baseball's first black player is making waves around the world, and with all of the hate mail that Jackie has received, it's Joe that stumbles into a racial plot to have the ballplayer assasinated on the field of the first game. The author has blended history with fiction very well, except that the coincidences that led Joe to the murder in the making was very contrived. Pushing that to the side, it wasn't so much a mystery as it was slightly lopsided action novel with a better view of how hate can manifest itself to take over one's life. Pretty good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great way to sample, Ingredients can be hard to find.","review":"I adore this book. It's a great way to sample each individual cookbook without having to splurge on the full text! For example, I like Chinese, Italian, and Mexican, but always wanted to try French and Greek. The directions are very clear, but a lot of the ingredients are hard to find. Luckily, I live in an area with a lot of little ethnic areas, so I can find most items. This could cause a problem if you don't (ordering the items from the internet would get really expensive). Yet, once you get a hold of this book, you know that maybe you can't find a lot of the items for say, Indian cooking, then at least you didn't waste your money on that full text, without being able to make anything. Once you have everything, though, you can cook like a pro!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Why is this book so hard to get?","review":"It took a while to find a used Slay & Rescue in my price range (I enjoyed Moore's similar \\"Heroics for Beginners\\" and \\"The Undhandsome Prince\\"), but now that I've read it I see that I would have paid quadruple the price & double the shipping. The excellent above reviews give a good idea of Moore's writing style, but I do have something to add. The plot is significantly more convoluted than I had expected, giving me surprises clear to the last pages. The characters are fun and engaging, the setting a deadpan exaggeration of the world of fairy tales and the plot is well-thought-out. What more can you ask from a used paperback?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully clever and funny","review":"I loved this!

Even the hat is scratchy. I'm going to try taking it to a seamstress and having a lining put in it because my daughter is obsessed with pretending to be a Dalmatian and was so disappointed in its discomfort.

On the one hand, Solaria along with the Spacer worlds in general makes you feel as if they are old and weary people, living in stagnant comfort under the constant pamperage of their millions of robots. And on the other, Earth and its colony worlds, so full of hope and life. In this universe we find R. Daneel Olivaw, still staggering from the death of his dearest friend Lije Baley, and his new robot friend R. Giskard Reventlov beginning to get strange new ideas about protecting humanity as a whole, while their other dearest human friend Gladia goes on a spiritual pilgrimage to Earth and its colonies and discovers much about the nature of life and happiness. Truly touching from a certain perspective."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book sucks.","review":"This is the worst Asimov book I've read. The idea that robots, which are supposed to operate on logic and reason, can reach such rediculous conclusions is disgusting. And to make matters worse, they turn out to be ABSOLUTELY CORRECT! I was rolling my eyes for half of this book.If you are already a fan of Asimov's books, then by all means buy this book. But make sure you've already read the entire robot series, or nothing in this book will make any sense.

O'Neill. These two, in particular, are also much better writers than Klerkx, and when you read their books, you can feel the optimistic passion that stands behind their vision. In comparison, Klerkx's book is a total dud.

Its sound has a harsh CD brassiness, and its clumsy mastering ruins the transistions between songs. The worst example of its lack of taste is the way it butchers the segue between \\"Afterglow\\" and \\"Long Agos and Worlds Apart\\". The seamless grace of the original is wrecked with a jarring and amateurish fadeout.Fortunately, a faithful reproduction of the original vinyl album is available on CD (complete with a fold-out insert that is a nearly perfect replica of the LP cover). It's an import released in 2001 by Sanctuary Records Group (actually the same company as Castle Communications).

Omitowoju, on the lines of other contenporary (mostly female) scholars demonstrates how the \\"private\\" material Menander deals with, mainly questions of sexual relations and marriage, was institutionalised as a civic concern and highly politicised, as it touched sensitive issues like citizenship, inheritance, enfranchisement and the legitimate reproduction of the household."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is a very bad movie","review":"this is a very bad movie allthe good stuff is removed if you want the unrated version you have to buy this one my advice do not buy thismovie"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid, cats don't need such loving care","review":"Cats don't need such loving care!

I've had mine for 15+ years and it works just as well as it did when I bought it, but admittedly I only used it for Star Fox and a few Street Fighter 2 bouts.

Contrary to the media and much of our society, there are many of us making a positive difference. Travis Hunter captures this true essense of most Black men. His characters are not perfect. In fact, he clearly shows their flaws in the mist of their qualities. Albeit, the messages of nurturing, mentoring, family and commitment ringe clear.

I laughed, I cried and never saw the ending coming.Why hasn't this been made into a movie yet?"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books I've ever read!","review":"I read this book about 4 years ago and I can still remember the details. After reading some books, I have a difficult time remembering who was who or what happened in the end, but not this book. To me,\\"Gone South\\" will be remembered. I wish Robert McCammon would continue to write more novels because I miss his creative style."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a mistake to kill off the dog!","review":"No doubt the author is brilliant, and I adore his work. Unfortunately, as a person who is very sensitive to animal welfare, I was unhappy with the extremely graphic and violent scene toward the end of this book, wherein the sweet companion canine is eaten by a beastly human character. It completely marred my reading experience. Mr. McCammon also terminates dogs in at least two of his other books: Boy's Life and Swan Song. Hmmmmm...makes me wonder what past experience(s) may have been responsible for his doggie death wish?!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to par","review":"McCammon's characters begin fairly well developed, although they all seem mostly defined by their various maladies/deformities. Once the protaganist is surrounded by the other characters, any meaningful inner dialogue seems to diappear, and the story plays itself out to a predictable, redemptive ending. The bounty hunters sailing off together is a bit trite."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gone south was a joy","review":"It's true that Gone South was not 'A Boy's Life' but it has a character and spirit all it's own. I love reading McCammon - and this was by far my faforite. It is different than his typical book. Give it a try."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utter trash!!","review":"McCammon was offensively off base when describing the way of life in south Louisiana. I live in La., not far from the area that Dan was forced to hide in when Flint was on his tail, and I have to say that I have travelled many bayous and was never shot at or threatened by any resident, permanent or visiting. We don't shoot people just because their boat passes our camp. We aren't ignorant, stupid or overly aggressive. Cajuns are known for their friendliness and hospitality. I resent McCammon for suggesting otherwise. Maybe if he tried researching his subject instead of guessing at it, he'd be a better writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"On THe Run All The Way To The Swamps Of Louisiana!!!","review":"Times are hard for Vietnam Veteran and carpenter Dan Lambert. He can't find any work and the bank wants to repossess his truck. In a moment of terror he accidently kills a loan officer and is on the run all the way to the backwood swamps of Louisiana where he is joined along the way by a girl named Arden Halliday who is seeking a miracle.Hot on their trails are two Bounty Hunters who will stop at nothing to bring Dan back to claim a $15,000 reward. This book is a roller coaster of a ride through a mostly overlooked part of America with many unexpected twists and turns. It seems that Robert R. McCammon is able to write well in any Genre wether it be Science Fiction, Horror or a Suspense Thriller. I loved this book and was lucky enough to read it in one sitting. Robert R. McCammon rocks!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyed this book","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book and have reread it several times.

I'm buying the rest, I've read the first and second, and I really get into this series. You have to like parodies and be open minded to get into this sort of thing, but this new twist on an old classic can really take you places!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother beaming this one up","review":"Taking shots at classic Star Trek & the Next Generation, \`Star Wreck' reads somewhat like a genre parody in the spirit of \`Airplane!' and \`The Naked Gun'. Plenty of sight-gags and dry one-liners abound here. Unfortunately, the quality of the humor is more on par with \`Police Academy'- a fair deal of it falls flat, or is just plain dumb.If you're looking for decent sci-fi parody, rent \`Spaceballs' or \`GalaxyQuest' on video, or dredge up the MAD Star Trek Special mag at your local comic books & collectibles shop. Heck, even \`Star Wars Episode I' grabs more laughs (especially when Jar Jar isn't in the scene) than this ridiculous little tome!\`Late"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not terribly funny; in fact, a real yawner","review":"The authors attempt here to parody not only the original Star Trek series, but \\"The Next Generation\\" as well. Both of these successful (and high quality) series are very deserving of satire, and have certainly received their share over the years.Star Wreck tries to follow in these footsteps, and falls flat. The jokes generate mild chuckles at best, but more often groans and even whimpers. The book, and its weak, lame, tepid humor, is easily flipped through in 15 minutes, then forgotten forever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't Beat this bazooka","review":"This is for BT1014 10 inch - Passive, no amp included.Pros:+Construction is solid.

Many of the tracks, such as Burnt Out Car and Stormtrooper In Drag, have the slightly poppy feel that Tiger Bay provided. On the downside, this is not really representative of Saint Etienne's best works.But deep within Continental you can hear the embryonic roots of Good Humour and their respective b-sides.All in all, if you're a Saint Etienne fan, you should own this CD. It encompasses the childhood-soundtrack feel (aka Pebble Mill) and is a good cross-section of the band's talent.Similar to previous albums like Foxbase Alpha and So Tough, it's all around good music (great for house-cleaning and parties), and is worth a try for anyone raised in the 70's and 80's that can appreciate the female voice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Saint Etienne - Continental","review":"Although CONTINENTAL, a Japan-only release, features tracks that appeared on Saint Etienne's remix album, CASINO CLASSICS, or on various singles, but most are exclusive to this album. It's a b-side dream, mixing the classy instrumental \\"Shad Thames\\" with songs led by Sarah Cracknell's increasingly controlled voice. \\"Sometimes in Winter,\\" even with its underlying guitar growl, still manages to be cool and confident. The same goes for \\"Star,\\" which pumps up the rock bombast. On the Gary Numan cover, \\"Stormtrooper in Drag,\\" they deliver Europop that rivals the Pet Shop Boys in catchiness. In a sharp compare-and-contrast move, the dreamy \\"Down by the Sea\\" is followed by its equally dreamy (but more rhythmically frenetic) remix from PFM."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but...","review":"I find that after about the first 8 tracks or so I never want to listen to the rest of the cd. Don't get me wrong, I think the cd is a definite must have, but I find that it starts out extremely strong, maintains for awhile, and then inexplicably fades at the end.Would recommend adding this to your collection only after you already have most of their other albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Peaceful Warrior","review":"This is a movie that addresses a common issue people have about what will make them happy. The main character, Dan, believes that winning an Olympic Gold Medal will make him feel fulfilled and happy. He is doing well in gymnastics, but still does not appear to enjoy his life. He meets a man he calls Socrates who asks many unexpected questions and who shows Dan an alternate view of the world in which paying attention to what is happening right this moment is relevant along with pursuing what you love rather than waiting for other people to approve of you. The movie requires that a viewer accept that some of the scenes are what is happening in Dan's mind rather than scenes that are actually happening. The movie is based on a true experience and is relevant to people whose dreams and hopes are challenged by adversity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly Inspiring","review":"Great movie. Based on true events. Gives you a different perspective on life and what is living. Share this with all your friends and family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome, well done!","review":"I was very pleased with how well the movie captured and conveyed the deep message of the book Way of the Peaceful Warrior. Very impressive how it all came together. For me, in addition to the entire book having a significant impact in my life, there were a couple of things that stood out extra and they were brought out in the movie as well. Meditate the move, be the action! Even though the time in the theater was short lived, hopefully many, many will find this movie and benefit from the great guidance it offers. I have been anxiously awaiting the arrival of the DVD because this is definitely a movie I will watch many times over and share with as many as I can!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful movie","review":"I'd recommend this to everyone - over 13.

Really well done."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite movie!","review":"I typically do not watch movies over again, thus I don't usually buy movies. However, this one is an exception. I have watched this movie several times and it resonates with me every time. It's not really the story, but rather the messages within the story that are so powerful. Finally I bought a copy (and returned the other one back to my sister)! Because I like the movie so well, I looked into Dan Millman's books. The Law of Spirit is very good as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite book, a very good movie","review":"I first read the book when it came out about 1980. I read it two other times, and loaned it a few. I found it at Blockbuster last night, and brought it home.The movie only covers about half the book, but does it very thoroughly. I found Nick Nolte a good selection, but some of the gymnasts a bit wimpy compared to real gymnasts.My wife and daughter really enjoyed the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Product Quality","review":"The video itself is amazing and highly recommended, however I was very disappointed with the product quality.The sound of the movie is about 30 seconds before the images all the way through the movie and find this not acceptable.You see the images of a conversation or other actions 30 seconds after you hear the sames conversations or actions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Acting from all actors","review":"I had read the book and was anxious to see the movie. The acting was just horrible and watched liked a low B grade movie. It would appear that looking at the ratings that I am in the minority but I think that the book is a hundred times better... YMMV"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I've read Dan Millman's books (Peaceful Warrior series) and found them inspirational. I was really looking forward to the same when I sat down to watch the movie last night. Unfortunately, there was a lot left out and too much added to make the movie more palatable to the mass market, I suspect. The movie is not about one man's spiritual quest as is the book, but about achieving top honors in an athletic event (and keeping your good buddies along the way), which has been done before, over and over again. The ending was really stupid and very disappointing. Also, though I love Nick Nolte, I think he was poorly cast in this role. He doesn't deliver spiritual truth with any crediblity and mumbles a lot.I've noticed that most of the good reviews seem to be from people who haven't read the book, so the one good thing I can say is that maybe this will inspire them to read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting movie","review":"The screenplay was given an interesting twist by putting a sort of mystical character in it played by Nick Nolte. An arrogant young man who thinks life is all about his own glory and completely self-absorbed is changed when he's in a motorcycle accident and can't compete at the Olympics. He meets an older man who is content to work at a gas station and seems to have deep insight to share with the stubborn athlete. The attendant seems more ghost than human, giving the movie a surreal flavor. I found the story motivating since it was inspired by true events, but it's easy to tell in some places that they twisted the truth for dramatic effect. I'll have to read the book as well.Chrissy K.

This is a wonderful movie about a young man who does just that - he walks down an unfamiliar path and gets lost before he can find himself again (I can relate). Socrates, the mystical mentor, imparts some powerful, invaluable life lessons that will likely speak to each person who watches this movie. It was a good reminder that all we really have is now, this moment.

I didn't read the book so I don't know how closely the movie followed it. In any event, it was powerful. The characters were well-developed and have credibility. The one thing that I found puzzling was athletes who don't eat or drink healthfully. Even when they're adolescents, they prize their bodies so the drinking and junk food binging didn't make sense. It's definitely the kind of movie that helps to raise people's consciousness above the realm of self-destructive Ego. It's just what the world needs most."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiration, Discipline and Love","review":"I absolutely loved this book, I never read a book so fast! It changed my outlook on life on how I choose to live and look at everything in my life. I can't believe how I got so caught up in my life and the world and forget all the beautiful treasures we have, i.e. listening to a bird song, looking at a tree and really seeing how beautiful it is.

Instead, he is a very bratty, mean spirited, closed minded individual, even towards the person that helps him on his journey \\"Socrates.\\" The characters are not very realistic for positive transformation to happen to and not much about this movie is great or inspirational.

In short, if you have ever been curious about the actual real life seventeenth century society and clothing decor worn by the women who actually lived during the time period of the movie the Last of the Mohicans this is the book for you. The embroidery in this book is absolutely beautiful and it captures the charm of the good simple living that was a integral part of colonial America. This is not another worthless embroidery coffee table book in which the professional artists show up those of us who enjoy our simple home needlearts. Plus this book gives some basic instruction and patterns for crewel embroidery. This book is a genuine work of art that not only connects the generations but that also inspires you to further appreciate the integrity of our country.

I'm sure Mr McDonald has had a successful career and photographic business and that transpires from his writings. But his cheesiness in words (only matched by his insufferable cheesiness in portraiture) makes the mere sifting through (let alone the reading) intolerable. If you like Avedon and Irving Penn, don't buy this book. Granted, it was never meant to be a monograph but a book that gave the clues on how to set up a business in photographic portraiture. But it would help, wouldn't it, and it would give some minor credibility if the pictures were at least interesting. and what about the lyrics? take a look at this suggestion for an advertisement of a studio: \\"BECAUSE YOU LOVE THEM.

I just wanted you to avoid my mistake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dated","review":"I thought this book was only ok overall. The topics that were discussed were all pretty vague and it seems like common sense would have taken you there anyway. The thing that turned me off most were the pictures themselves, they all seem quite dated and nothing really stands out, except for a few photos in the back of the book where profiles of other photographers around the world have shared their advice on how they run their studios. To me this section was more informative than the rest of the book put together. If you really want to get more ideas and advice, speak to professional photographers in your local or surrounding areas. I find that most photographers are really cool people who just love to talk about their jobs, so i find that more helpful. They will also give you specific tips, like what film they use, where they process, how to start off, who to contact etc. And they really motivate you to get started."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great","review":"It's okay; doesn't sound much like Squidward though.

What the heck, if my wife is getting XM for her car I should have a little treat...Worked as advertised! I got it out of the box, put the receiver in, turned it on, and enjoyed the music. The noise some people have talked about wasn't there, but the crisp CD quality that I enjoy in my car was.The only problem I had was with the antenna...the mount for it on the back of the radio isn't real secure, so my antenna can fall off (a little Velcro fixed that). I wish they had put the antenna connection on the outside rather than on the inside of the battery compartment (oh, well), but otherwise I enjoy the heck out of it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very annoying background buzz","review":"Very annoying background hum/buzz that comes from the unit, not the receiver. Others have commented on this, and it seems that this is a very basic engineering problem XM could have taken care of during design, but seems they'd rather rush out a piece of crap. Too bad there are no other real options out there for the office-- I have the box right next to me at my desk, so I can't turn up the volume enough to drown out the noise.Save your money for the next generation of boxes- I wish I had."},{"rating":"2","title":"Several years later","review":"This is by far my favorite Radio. A Delphi/XM Radio product, after several years of ownership, it remains on several hours a day at home while I enjoy many many channels, from Baseball to Classical Music to the BBC World Service, to World Cup Football, to NPR, to Old Time Radio, Drama, Jazz,and much more. The sound is great. I rarely have trouble picking up a clear signal.

However, once I get anywhere close to my front door, the signal dies. I just spent the last 3 hours aiming the antenna every which way (and them some), but no luck - I just get 'No signal' on the receiver. I guess that for the time being, some of us are going to be stuck with AM/FM until something better comes along."},{"rating":"1","title":"Digital Hype!","review":"I keep reading reviews and articles about XM having near CD quality sound.It simply is not true.Out of all the formats I have heard which include; SACD,CD,Minidisc,Cassette,VHS and FM,the SkyFi has got to be the least natural sounding.It has too many digital artifacts which make it unlistenable for any extended period of time.The concept is great but the audio quality is another step backwards for digital sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yep, there's a noise...","review":"After reading the reviews here and elsewhere I decided to roll the dice and hope for a boombox that didn't have the background noise. My gamble failed. As others have said, the noise can be heard at low to medium volume settings (which are likely the settings you'll be using in an office environment.)I promptly exchanged the unit for an Audiophase XM Skybox and I couldn't be happier.I love XM, but this product should be skipped for something better (such as the aforementioned Audiophase)."},{"rating":"1","title":"High pitched whine, defective design","review":"Don't buy one of these until they fix what must be a design flaw. As others have noted, there is a high pitched whine audible whenever the box is switched on. It's there regardless of whether any music is playing or not. This is almost certainly a design flaw. It could be aliasing noise, a leaky carrier tone, etc.XM is an interesting concept, but this boombox is poorly implemented."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not great for indoor use","review":"Purchased XM because radio stations in my area are poor, and wanted Fox Sports Radio. Unit works good outdoors as long as the antenna is facing South. Indoors, they are not kidding when they say the antenna must be in a South-facing clear glass window. Having to keep the antenna facing South can also cause some portability issues. Also, would have liked to use at the office. No chance. My cubicle has no South-facing windows, so I also have no XM at work."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Reception","review":"I purchased this to use at the office. I am unable to get the receiver to work. Being at a south facing window is not sufficient enough in the building to get the reception, and I can not mount it outdoors.Just a note of caution....we made sure we purchased our boombox from a place with no-questions-asked return policy. There are indoor situations where this will not work and you may need to return it!I'm just dissappointed that I can't have my XM while I work!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless","review":"I purchased A SKYFi2, and the boombox. The reciever works great in the car with the car kit. But when I take it in the house and pop it in the boombox, there is a high pitched buzzing. When I contacted XM, they told me (after days waiting for an e-mail response, got nothing back from their tech support line when I left a message as requested) to return it to where I bought it. I did so, and the second unit does the exact same thing. I even tried it outdoors with no improvement. I'd stay away from the boombox, seems XM is only for the car. I am returning everything, including the reciever and trying Sirius....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sturdy, stylish (sort of), and sporty.

It has put up with the abuse of other campers, counslers, dust on it, sand being kicked into it, and it still works great.The XM service itself is great (mainly because I can listen to all of my baseball games), and the subscription fee is only good if you are into that kind of pay style.As for the sound of the boombox, it's defintley not AMAZING, but is way above average, maybe B+ to A- range. If you live ina place with bad satlleite reception inside for whatever reason, you may need a more powerful antenna, longer cord, etc... Mine does cut out once in a while but it is only mildly disracting as it goes right back after a few seconds of blank sound.All in all this is a great little boombox that keeps your new SkyFi2 sexy and sleek and provides great sound too. Highly reccomend and would give to anyone looking to give their XM a lot of wear."},{"rating":"1","title":"I too hear the buzzing... :-(","review":"I bought this, and hear the buzzing as well...

Simply put, the service and the SkyFi were not bad (although I have a similar review posted on my experience with SkyFi tuning knobs), and I enjoyed both XM and the SkyFi immensely. Simply, this unit is certainly portable, but if you take it outdoors you probably won't hear it because the volume is so weak and limited. It's 4W per channel, so you're not going to hear much at full volume. Otherwise, it isn't a bad unit but without output, you're left to wonder."},{"rating":"1","title":"XM Boom Box","review":"I got this for my husband for Christmas, and it still isn't working. He wanted it to listen to baseball games on the XM in our bedroom. Well he's made every attempt to put the antenna in the right area outside of our house and we still can't get any reception.

This thing is great. We can listen to XM everywhere. It comes with a super long cord for the antenna so you don't have to keep it right next to the window.

It sounds like a cheap radio because that's what it is. The speakers are cheap. The casing is cheaply made and my unit did not work with batteries as promised. The design is great, but the sound quality is very poor.If you're thinking about getting one because you ALREADY have a Delphi XM Radio receiver, then it's not a bad investment.

Unless you are willing to put up with this and need the portability, you're better off buying a home adpater and running the receiver through your home audio setup."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful. Don't Waste Your Money On This Boombox","review":"This thing is a HUGE dissapointment. There is an awful high pitched tone that you can hear behind the music. The only way to avoid it is to turn up the music so loud that it drowns the buzz out. If you listen to classical or jazz forget about this boombox. If you don't like listening to your music super loud forget about this boombox. It will drive you crazy. Listening to talk on this is awful. The buzzing will drive you crazy. It is like listening to a distant am station. I can't believe this thing is being sold on the market. It needs to be recalled and the problem needs to be fixed. Many people have had problems with this box and Delphi refuses to acknowledge the problem even though they know about it and have received many complaints. Don't buy this boombox. It is a waste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hissing noise","review":"Please do not waste your money. The hissing noise from the boombox makes listening to your XMSR unbearable."},{"rating":"2","title":"This thing is great","review":"I bought this to use in my office, and it's great.

Definitely a great accessory."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product, lousy volume control","review":"Everything about this unit is great except for the volume control. As I turn it up, the volume number will usually go down, or not move at all. Sometimes I am lucky and it will go up. I've tried turning it slowly, one click at a time and still have problems. If you buy this unit, just be aware that the volume control has problems. Once you get it to the correct volume, everything else is perfect. It even runs on batteries, so you can take it out on the go. I usued this for my car stereo until I got the FM modulator."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow. I should have listened to the reviewers...","review":"I ususally put a lot of stock into reviews but I discredited the people complaining about the background noise on this unit. Boy was I wrong.

But it is a serious annoyance.(...)"},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE, Not made to last...","review":"Boombox was ok right of the box. The problem is the unit is poor quality. My unit has never even moved off my desk since its purchase. Here we are 7 months later and the sound has quit working. Delphi warranties the thing for a year, but its a big hassle. They should just exchange the unit right away. You just can't go turn another radio on when you using satellite."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Satisfaction","review":"I received the bell quickly, although the bell was sent in a plain mailing envelope with no packaging so the box was totally smashed inside the envelope.

Its a nice looking Media Storage Tower.Great price too!!!Would definitely reccommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the Price","review":"Searching on line for a CD shelf, I came across this one, which looked as good or better than most others for a much better price. That made me suspicious, of course, but since other reviewers seemed happy, I took the plunge. I'm glad I did. It looks good and stands stable, holding a couple hundred CDs and DVDs. Actually, I'm pleased enough that I'll probably get another. The weakest part is the back, which is cardboard, but it's not visible once you get stuff on the shelves. Also important to a klutz like me: it was very easy to assemble. One lesson I learned the hard way: Keep your dog (also probably small kids) away while you're assembling. I barely stopped my sweet lovable retriever from jumping through the cardboard back as I was nailing it in place. Anyway, my conclusion is, you won't beat this for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Laughable","review":"While the poetry in this anthology deserves note, the ILP (International Library of Poetry) is exploitative and preys on the novice/unpublished poet. They achieve this rather neatly by promising to publish almost anyone (those deserving and those not) just to secure 'pre-booked' orders for their works. Even at that, if one wants to be 'published', ILP will do it for you; however, be careful of what you do or purchase from them. Even paying for 2 copies of this title and fighting for months, I have yet to recieve my 'pre-paid' copies. They are certainly 'for-profit' and think little of the authors that place faith in them. I can't deny that some of the work is very good...but I can say I wouldn't fund them with a dime. If you have it, enjoy it...if not, do not justify them with your $'s.

The author was arrogant and selfish.The fighting between the author and she husband should have been left in her journal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing book","review":"This book is one of the most depressing books I've ever read. Jill and her husband are incredibly selfish immature people - I'm not even sure why they're together since they don't seem to like each other. I think it's sad that they adopted a child into such an unhealthy environment. If I could give this book zero stars, I would.I would not recommend this book to anyone, but especially adopting couples, as this book barely talks about adoption. It focuses on this couple's problems which I think reach far beyond the issue of to have or not have children (biological or otherwise)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disturbing","review":"I am so glad I got this book from the library and didn't buy it. This is all about Jill wanting a babeeeeee at any cost. Her husband clearly did not want a child, a Chinese one at that, so it became about Jill getting her way. It'll be interesting to see how things turn out-- especially since Joe did not want to keep her Chinese name and was worried about her hair color.

Not all adoptive parents are like this couple!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Muy recomendable","review":"Yo también leí la versión en español \\"El deseo de tener un hijo\\".

Jill Smolowe's immaturity and naricssism are only outdone by her husband's ... they are truly meant for each other! I do feel sorry for the author's little girl, who was ultimately adopted from China ... The author's marriage is highly dysfunctional, and it seems all but certain that Becky will grow up with only one parent. The chapters on the author's trip to China were mildly interesting and informative, and were the best part of this otherwise disappointing book. Jill Smolowe and her husband come across as loathsome and utterly selfish, and I wonder how in the world they ever were able to convince a social worker to approve their homestudy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh!","review":"I agree with the reviewer who found this couple \\"loathsome and selfish.\\" I am also struggling with infertility, and hoped to find some words of wisdom in this book. What I got was a picture of a marriage that the husband clearly didn't want to be in and that seemed incredibly dysfunctional. I admire Ms. Smolowe's honesty, but she clearly planned to bring a child into a marriage with an \\"absentee live-in father.\\" Why? I was also never fully convinced that she really wanted a baby, as opposed to feeling obligated to \\"have it all.\\" I was happy to see that it all seemed to work out in the end (the \\"baby-saves-marriage\\" theme) but I wonder if there isn't more to the story. It was most helpful and inspiring when she stuck to their attempts to make the adoption decisions, but the marriage was so troubling that I questioned the author's sense of responsibility."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Journey to Parenthood","review":"Jill Smolowe has written, not just a journey, but an odyssey as she courageously discloses the internal struggles she and her husband faced in their attempts at parenthood. Obviously her husband preferred to stay in an uncommitted lifestyle, but finally agreed to marriage, a home in the suburbs and a child. This is not always an easy tale to read, as the main characters, including the author, lay bare their true emotions and feelings. However, it would help any couple struggling through this journey face the realities of depression, failures, doubts, racism and ultimately joy. No issue is sugar-coated.I found the book compelling reading. I can't recommend it more highly."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor customer service","review":"The item itself was frayed around the knee area.

It made me feel like a superwoman for taking this on, affirmed my feeling that wow, it was *really* hard, and reminded me that I am not alone. Being a stepmom is amazing and wonderful, of course, but it has challenges and pitfalls unlike any other role, and frankly, most people dismiss that fact by saying \\"Well, that's what you chose when you got involved with a divorced guy.\\" Yeah? Well, I still need to vent, just like biological moms, so give me some support, sista! This book is where I found a lot of solace.

It is bizarre to read this and believe someone could find this amusing. That's the humor part that doesn't quite work. Grace? Forget about it. Whiny, childish, selfish, and pathetic are the words I would use. The only thing I can think of to explain this book is that many of the personal anecdotes to illustrate a point were fiction - if they are true, I'm horrified that anyone would allow themselves to be put through this just to land a man. And to experience these things - and then willingly expose them to the world.....is really inexplicable. I agree with another reviewer's point - that the observations and advice don't mesh with someone who is supposedly an overachieving popular person. Low self-esteem, perhaps? Whatever is truly backing these stories - fact or fiction - they are not graceful, nor humorous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eeeww....a case of TMI","review":"My friend enjoyed this book and thought I might as well, despite the fact I'm not a member of the step-parent club. I didn't. The author is willing to portray herself as self-absorbed and a big cry-baby who, having suffered through a rather non-existent sex life finally finds a man....but why would she want him if she is as popular and high-achieving as she claims she is? He sounds like a real loser and it's completely unclear why she would ever want him given the way he treats her....except of course that she was desperate to have sex. Yuck.

There were so many times when I found myself saying, \\"Oh my gosh- that is ME\\" while reading the book.

This book seems politically correct but doesn't delve into the stench of reality. I don't care how perfect you, as a new wife want to be, the kids and ex are often there to undermine you and sap you of any energy and motivation. I had \\"Humor and Grace\\" through gritted teeth and not one moment I spent, even with the step-kids who LOVED me, was worth the trouble of marrying a man with baggage. Even when the kids are great, the ex-wife is usually a problem 9 times out of 10. There's always some drama and it gets old really fast. Try the other book I mentioned at top of paragraph for a more realistic look. I'll add a review there too.

I remember thinking \\"This is what the future holds for me if I stay with my boyfriend?\\" The advice didn't seem to fit many of my situations while, at the same time, some of the stories hit too close to home. I also didn't like that the author seems comfortable in the idea that the second wife will always be \\"second\\". I have too much self respect for that manner of thinking.

I picked up this book as well as a few others, half out of curiosity for the path I did not take. This one rang true more so than others, which seemed to focus more on women who had been married before. I thoroughly enjoyed this book. So I was perfectly normal to panic - being a stepmother is indeed a major undertaking. But perhaps with a sense of humor, I could have done it? Wonder what would have happened if I had read this book when I was engaged. Perhaps I would have been married by now."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read.","review":"Maybe I am blessed or maybe I am naive, but my current boyfriend is supportive so some of this does not apply directly to me. It could be that my parents were divorced so some of the issues that the kids feel I can relate to first hand. This book is a great read. It offers a lot of tips on what to expect. How to handle the \\"You're not my mother\\" statement, setting household rules for your home & family. It is also nice to know that the feelings, frustrations and such are normal. I highly recommend this book to everyone that is facing this situation. If nothing more it may prepare you for the worst."},{"rating":"2","title":"We have a winner!","review":"The problem I've had with flasks in the past has been their proclivity to cross-thread when replacing the cap.

Six reformers are described in the book; (John Wycliffe, John Hus, Martin Luther, John Calvin, John Knox, and George Fox.) Any one who has a relationship with the Holy Spirit will be blessed dearly by this book. However, the religous and fake Christians will find this book offensive because, as described in the book, the purpose of the reformers was to point out fake Christianity and replace it with the true gospel."},{"rating":"1","title":"A book I'd rather borrow than buy","review":"This is an okay book, about Great MenThe people reviewed in this book are great men of God. The book itself is kind of awkward. The author presents biographical sketches, interlaced with comments like, '...I admire the sacrifices that Hus' mother must have made, because I also had a mother and a grandmother who taught me to pray and seek the Lord from my youth. I can relate to the dedication and love that Hus' mother gave to her son. The love of a mother remains the same, no matter what generation she lives in.'These kind of musings occur throughout the book, and distract from the content. The author also provides a lot of opinions about the characters of these people, rather than just telling their stories.Overall, a book I'd rather borrow than buy. But I'd rather borrow a better book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lies and points of view","review":"This book is full of lies and points of view to distract people from what they should really search for in God. This book has an obvious intent to mock the Catholic Church and place lies about the faith of the Church.For instance: page 123 \\"Because few in the Roman Catholic Church had a personal relationship with Jesus\\", and on the same page says that prayer to the dead saints \\"is not permissable according to scripture\\". Nowhere in scripture says \\"thou shall not pray to fallen saints\\"...This book obviously is intended to turn people to split Jesus' Church and create fights among Christians."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd hate to see the \\"beginner's\\" video","review":"This is NOT a video for anyone with any videography experience or formal training.

In other words, within these pages you'll find an architect of all it means to be young, alive, and both awestruck and troubled by one's consciousness. A definite must-have for any lover of poems!

The storage inserts are not even close to the size of the box and extremely flimsy beyond belief, They are shrink wrapped and then glued to the box so when you unwrap it there is no means by witch to secure the trays. they are too small to fit snugly and are about useless.

Not happy. :("},{"rating":"1","title":"another quality product from china","review":"20 years ago I owned the exact same set.

She can also be removed from the stand for play time.Here are the doll's bad qualities:1) The doll's clothes can not come off to be changed.2) The range of the doll's phrases is limited and you will find her repeating things very quickly.Despite it's downsides I think it still makes a good toy for fans of the Bratz.

My daughter was bored pretty fast with this toy.Also, it was shipped by a 3d party Amazon vendor and the package seemed as if it had been opened before. The package was pretty worm looking and the tape looked as if it had been resealed. It even had someone's gross hair under the tape.

Probably should have and gotten a more interesting (and brand new) toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Caveat Emptor Cloe","review":"This is not a complaint against Cloe herself; but a warning about dealing with MGA Entertainment who makes her. I purchased the Spanish-language version on clearance at a Toys R Us store, because I only wanted to display her, not play/talk with her. There were 2 identical dolls. It was only after unpacking her, looking at all the illustrations, and verifying the fact online that I realized she was missing her cute feathery vest & belt. BOTH dolls I looked at were the same in that respect; both were totally unopened. ( In fact these are HORRIBLE to unbox: you HAVE to destroy the packaging! ) I contacted the MGA \\"customer service\\" website ( the one that promises a reply within 24 hours! ) to ask whey they were like that.

Not necessarily that the kid will like them that early! (They may and they may not.)I bought a different set of 6 blocks for my daughter because *I* found them adorable. In the beginning, she just wasn't feeling them. Even when she was old enough to hold and examine them, I think I found them more interesting than she!BUT... after putting the blocks out of sight for a while, then pulling them back out, she's much more in love with them! Remember that kids develop at different stages, not to mention, they are little humans and simply have different tastes and interests!My advice: don't write these blocks off as not very good simply because your child doesn't like them. Start with one small set and (re)introduce it to your child at intervals.

I was sorely disappointed & upset when i received them & only had the animals pictured above. My son didnt even want to play with them on top of that. Like i said, maybe i didnt read the description very well, but will not purchase any other of these type blocks again. I had seen (around Christmas time 2009) at Target, an entire set of these peek-a-blocks (they were not the barnyard, but other types). i didnt purchase b/c i had already gotten my son's Christmas gifts so i was super excited to find them on here.

Featuring decent dancers and miscellaneous modern music, the choreographies use dry humor and cliched choreographic tricks to attempt at a portrayal of a vague story. In the Future is the most interesting of all the pieces, if only for its original, minimalistic costumes and scenery. To fans of Hans Van Manen, and perhaps die-hard fans of contemporary ballet, this would be an ideal pick; but for most balletomanes, I would say to avoid this DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"oh, god, no","review":"If there has been a single lowest point in my life as a reader, it must be the discovery that the Clarendon Press had published an essay with the title, 'The Body Encoded: Questions of Gender and the Electronic Text.'

You may be suprised to find you actually don't know how to pronounce many of the letters of the alphabet correctly. It is very important you teach them correctly to your children, especially if they have any speech difficulties. For example, 'D' is not pronounced 'duh'. Teach your child the wrong pronunciation and they may wind up having some difficulty sounding out words. The CD will model for you the difference between the voiced and unvoiced consonants, which will be invaluable.

He has also been using starfall for about a year, but it doesn't really seem to have done much. I think the computer game thing is a good, fun reinforcement, but it is no where near as effective as the one-on-one focused learning that this book advocates.UPDATE: My oldest is finishing this book this week, and he is now an avid reader!

As an adult I hardly remember the rules of reading I just do it, but this book adequately deconstructs the riddle of reading to help the child learn phonics rules and the parent to offer the best guidance possible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Desert Island Disc","review":"This is a perfect pairing and a perfect performance. All that I would say has been said in other reviews; but I feel compelled to add my praise. Notwithstanding that I'm not a musician myself I can generally imagine how almost anything I see or hear can be improved upon: these performances stun and enthrall me every time I listen to them (although I have a different, out-of-print issue); and I listen to them often. I have a considerable collection of classical music; yet if I am lying awake at night and wander over to my CD rack knowing that I won't get to sleep anytime soon, and so can select a disc that I am willing to pay close attention to even late at night rather than seeking to be lulled to sleep, this likely as not is the one I gravitate to. It was love at first hearing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strange beauty","review":"This is a wonderful symphony, comparable to the greatest symphonies of Sibelius or Tchaikovsky. It can even live in the company of Beethoven 6 and Mozart 40. I haven't listened to much Mahler, and dislike 1 and 6. But having recently listened to Szell 4, again, I feel I must explore. Where next with Mahler, to add to the Szell 4 experience and avoid the Szell 6 experience?"},{"rating":"1","title":"poor translation","review":"This was a third rate translation that never should have been printed.

And I recently saw Ringo Starr in concert, and he was much more charismatic than I thought he would be (and I'm a Beatles NUT, so I didn't think he'd be boring!). To think that such a lively performer, and a living legend, could have such a dull biography written about him, is a shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mr. Clayson, Tell Us About Ringo!","review":"This is the best book about Ringo Starr because it's the ONLY book, which is quite a shame. Ringo has led an incredibly interesting life, full of ups and downs, but this book somehow avoids those interesting stories. The author does appear to know a great deal about the music scene in England in the late 50's and early 60's, but he does not appear to know a great deal about the World's Greatest Drummer. For example, this book lists Ringo's drumming in the song \\"Birthday\\" as his only drum solo. What? Did he forget to buy and listen to Abbey Road and the drum solo from \\"The End\\"? This is a huge mistake. Mr. Clayson does not really seem to be very interested in Ringo, and he certainly does not appear to really respect him. Therefore, I think Beatles fans and Ringo fans will be disappointed by this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth your time","review":"This book is just hard to read -- period. One would think that a biography on Ringo would be like himself -- fun. Instead, Clayson wrote a book on an interesting subject and made it as much fun to read as the collected works of Milton. Maybe Clayson is embarrassed that a writer of his \\"caliber\\" is churning out books on Ringo, instead of writing the great British novel, and wants the reader to suffer along with him. God knows he seems more intent on showing the reader how smart he is, rather than informing and entertaining us.Clayson also seems focused on Pete Best, who I guess gave him an interview (Ringo would not). Finally, there are many sloppy factual errors in the book. The one error I found most ridiculous was Clayson's saying that there was trumpet on Helter Skelter. A trumpet? Is he sure there wasn't a fiddle and banjo on that one too?One of the few interesting things about the book is a picture of Ringo as Elton John tries to kiss him. His expression is priceless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written","review":"It's good that someone has written a biography of Ringo.

By the end of the first page you realize that you've walked into something that's hopelessly tangled and confused. You keep stumbling on in the vain hope that the whole nasty mess will EVENTUALLY \\"Straighten itself Out\\" . No such luck. Your persistence DOESN'T pay off. The endless twists and turns only get worse. I bought my copy for [money amount]at a local market. Boy, what a waste of Money!I started to read it late one evening.

For years I hoped a good, comprehensive biography of the world's most famous drummer would be published, so I naturally expected this book to fit the tab.Wrong! It is written in a rather pedantic, condescending tone and offers very little in the way of new information. Instead of treating Ringo with respect, the author appears to trivialize the major obstacles Ringo had to overcome to attain the level of success that he did.Although I was very disappointed by this book, I am glad to see that Ringo is getting more coverage.

The Sea Peoples show up in the reign of Ramses III, several hundred years after the action of these novels. Apart from the historical inaccuracies, the spellings reveal that no book less than 100 years old was used in the author's \\"research\\".) To reach such a low standard, I can only assume that Mr. Doherty found some 110-year volume and used that outdated information.

Besides her gift of prophecy and healing, she is able to write from within the realms of authentic experience. Her story is a stern and riveting account that makes it a delightful read for the coming season. The climax of the book isn't really the predictions that she makes for the future (she is known to have a 93% accuracy) in the last chapter, but rather the experiential exercises that she offers to elevate us from the \\"believeing\\" state to a state of \\"knowing\\". This is yet another path to exploring the often elusive wisdom that lies within, one that I believe can only be discovered through experience, rather than knowledge or understanding.

The rear brackets should be the same as the front brackets, in my opinion, for optimal support. Be aware, the frame bolts are not strong bolts whatsoever.

With that in mind, I had high hopes for these 8x22 Predators. I was disappointed. The exit pupil is so small, it's almost impossible to get a good clear view through the binoculars. Also, the edges of the field of view seemed slightly blurry. And last, once I adjusted the left eyepiece to give ma a decent picture at 100 yards, then used the center focus knob to focus for closer or farther distances, I would have to readjust the left eyepiece to get a clear picture at the new distance. The combination of these problems made the binoculars virtually unuseable.

These Steiners are arguably the best binoculars I have found for the money and will be on my person whenever I am outside the wire. The clarity is excellent and the brightness is better than I would expect for a compact optic. The specialized coating was designed to make game stand out against foliage but should be effective for spotting IED's, etc. The rubber armoring seems very tough although I am going to try not to drop-test my optics.

This book is awful!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun, light read, annoying name dropping","review":"We bought this book as my wife was recently diagnosised with sarcoidosis. The humor of the author pervades this book, and her positive attitude about her illness was enjoyable. However, the constant name dropping of who she was dating and where she was going out to gets real boring and annoying fast. A nice, very light enjoyable read, but seems more suited as a book for Duffy fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"A laugh-out loud inspiration","review":"What a wonderful book! I picked it up because I'm an oncology nurse and am always interested in seeing how people cope with life-threatening illness. Karen Duffy's book is both highly entertaining (downright hilarious at times)and a great inspiration to the power of positive thinking and making lemonade out of lemons. Some of her coping mechanisms are not what we normally recommend to our patients but it works for her and it's a perfectly valid way to go. I would recommend this to all my patients who are not too uptight or easily offended (sex,drugs and rock-and-roll)."},{"rating":"2","title":"She just might be crazy too...","review":"This book reads more like a personal letter than a autobiography. Its light and fun and sometimes outright hillarious. Although the subject of her living with a chronic debilitating disease is sobering, you get the feeling she'd punch you in the mouth if you dared try to console her or feel sorry for her in anyway. Her unquenchable thirst to extract as much fun out of life at every moment should be an inspiration to us all."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"100 Proof Duff\\"!!","review":"I'm a longtime fan of Duff, and finished reading this book the same day I got it. It's honest, laugh out loud funny, and full of her unique personal style. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that whoever proofread it did a ratty job - it's full of annoying little typos. Do yourself a favor: burn your copy of \\"Tuesdays With Morrie\\" (Duff's idea),and read this instead! You won't need a box of Kleenex (although it does go nicely with your favorite alcoholic beverage).

Its belt loop is also held shut with velcro (which seemed an odd design choice to me), and has room for a 2\\" wide belt.I've been using this holster for several weeks now, and have been happy thus far."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle edition is poor quality","review":"The other reviews have addressed the content in some detail.

And \\"go to beginning of book\\" in the index menu brings me to the same point. No introduction, table of contents, or introduction to Beethoven. I didn't know how to go to another symphony without paging through the whole book (search did not work very well).However, as I eventually discovered, if you press \\"previous page\\" at the beginning, you get the prior missing parts of the book. And \\"Table of Contents\\" in the index takes you to the Table of Contents, which is selectable so you can go right to the symphony you want.Once I figured out how to use the book I was pleased with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"symphony","review":"Good and easy to read review.

You'll spend half your time figuring out who's who and the insight into the world of punk (Guy Davis was a punk earlier in life) is fascinating.So yeah, recommended for the unique story and for historical value.

They are complex, especially \\"Kevin\\". He is a handsome hero, but has a ligitimate reason to want to be liked for more than his looks and a honest connection with the heroine. The romance is slow and builds. Although there is a spark, there is none of the \\"I saw her and I knew I would die for her\\" grandiose attraction.The plot also builds slowly. The characters lives a revealed in small glimpses into their pasts and action. The plot centers around a male prostitute, who is portrayed with stark reality.I love the contrast of a sweet, slow romance set against the unromantic, sometimes ugly life of a male prostitute."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not your typical romance.","review":"I was a bit skeptical about the book.

I read a ton of contemporary romances and the plot summary for \\"Fallen From Grace\\" was different from the rest. I didn't buy it right away, but I found I kept thinking about it and coming back to it. Finally I just gave in a got it and boy I am glad that I did. I loved it. I was totally drawn into Ryan's story. I do agree with another reviewer's assessment that his character and back story are more richly developed and frankly just more interesting than Sara's. I had wondered if I would be able to suspend judgement on Ryan for being a prostitute and if I would still find him desirable. No problems there, you can't help but sympathize with him and fall in love with him. I highly recommend this book. It was so much more than I thought it would be. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique and compelling!","review":"Kudos to Ms. Leone for having the courage to write a romance where the characters were forced to deal with a truly gritty conflict with no easy answers.

My friend highly recommended it, and said it was worth every cent. Ummm... NOT!Laura Leone aka Laura Resnick has promise, but she butchers the story. Her heroine is too stupid to live (ex. She completely forgives the hero for sleeping with other women on the job while going out with her, AND goes from being spitting mad one minute to complacent in the next minute). Her hero is a whiner (ex. He does his job and comes back saying that he HAD to do it. He owed it to his pimp for saving him). There is no heart in this story. I wouldn't even classify it as \\"romance\\" or \\"mainstream\\".

There is so much emotion in this music that it is overwhelming and not just music but a life experience. The album includes mostly vocal songs with a few great instrumentals that seem to take each song to the next level. When I first heard the tune NDE and the great chorus of \\"I don't want to come down\\", it was breathaking and an example of how BUH can also sound progressive as well as modern/alternative.

George Szell was well known and critized for his precision. When dealing with classical greats like Mozart and Haydn, George Szell is one of the first conductors I seek after. I recommend his recordings of Mozart's 39th, 40th, and 41st. But!!! George Szell's abilities as a Romantic Period conductor (Brahms!) are lacking in the highest degree. Listening to this recording is like having to look at van Gogh's \\"Starry Night\\" painted with nothing but straight lines. As for BOXED SETs of the Brahm's Symphonies, Otto Klemperer's recording comes with my highest recommendations. Otto Klemperer KNEW the work of Brahms like few else.

I was more impressed by how well the material off of the last two albums was recreated with a skill and intensity that is rare to find these days. Many bands would shy away from trying to recreate those sounds in a live setting but Radiohead suceeded and in my opinion, they did the closet thing to playing Sgt. Pepper live.That being said, I was looking forward to hearing this album and I must say that these recordings take me back to that perfect summer evening when Radiohead worked their magic. I give this album four stars only because of its length. If they are putting out a DVD of an entire performance, then I can forgive this but if not, I really do hope that they release more live material."},{"rating":"2","title":"Undoubtedly the world's greatest live band.","review":"I had tickets to see Radiohead last August at one of the Bull Run shows outside Washington, D.C. When both shows were cancelled due to weather, I was crushed because I had heard so much about the quality of Radiohead's live performances... not to mention the fact that I was missing my absolute favorite band.\\"I Might Be Wrong\\", in a way, almost makes up for missing them live. I can't stand live albums, but this album is truly amazing. Like Spinning Plates is the flat-out highlight of the album... it is by far one of Radiohead's most beautiful and powerful moments ever recorded, and it alone justifies this purchase. The versions of Idioteque and Morning Bell are also top notch though.If you like Radiohead immensely, or even if you don't, check this out. Radiohead has never really put out a bad album, and this is just as great as everything else they've done. And if you've never seen them live, this in some ways will suffice."},{"rating":"2","title":"TRUE LOVE WAITS..","review":"FIRST--if you have an open mind to music, disregard the reviews of PILPOL--He obviously doesn't understand that music isn't always about perfect pitch or tone. Sometimes portraying the emotion of the music and lyrics is more important. That is one thing that Radiohead excels at, and if you don't get it--you probably can't appreciate Radiohead--so stop trying...I'm not what I would call a DIE HARD Radiohead fan, but I do really enjoy them. I have listened to at least parts of all of their albums, and True Love Waits is a song that really surprised me. From the title you would assume that it's a love song, but it's really more of a codependent theme song.Live Thom Yorke's voice is definitely not perfect, but I tend to like the live tracks because I can almost feel the emotion that comes through his voice. There are many Radiohead songs that have brought me to tears more than a few times... It is multilayered music that never seems to get old. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Short, thin, and messy","review":"I didn't like this album much. I am, of course, a huge fan of radiohead but this album was so much less than I expected. The songs seemed to suffer from a lack of fullness (on the whole there are fewer instruments playing the songs than on the studio versions - not that that is necessarily a bad thing but I think in this case it is), and an excess of noise - both from the audience and all the crazy gadgets that radiohead like to use in their music (and this certainly isn't helped by the poor quality of the recording). The album, as other reviewers have pointed out, is also quite short. Well...., actually it isn't all that short - about 40 minutes - but there aren't many tracks on it which is disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Radiohead are the Greatest live band to come out of the 90's","review":"This EP is one of the best value Radiohead albums out there.

Who cares anymore?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Holy smelly socks, Batman!","review":"This album sure does suck. Usually I reserve words like \\"suck\\" for Pearl Jam and Tool, but wow.

If you missed out, then you can get a taste of what Radiohead is like in concert by taking this CD, getting some huge, very expensive speakers, turning it up to ear deafening levels (but to the point where it is loud and it surrounds you but actually causes you no pain)and just relaxing and you'll get the same effect as the concerts this summer. Obviously, nothing will replace those experiences, however, this is definitely not a bad alternative."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"Although I was somewhat familiar with their music, I was never interested in radiohead until seeing the \\"Paranoid Android\\" video back in '97. It peaked my interest, and on a lark, I bought OK Computer. I had read no reviews and really knew nothing of the band (other than \\"Creep\\" and \\"Fake Plastic Trees\\"). The first few spins of OK Computer were uneventful. Then I noticed that it didn't leave my CD player for over a week. I was hooked, but I wasn't sure why I was hooked. I'm still not sure, but I love it. It seems the same thing has happened with I Might Be Wrong. I can't seem to extricate it from the CD player in my car. The \\"popular\\" music scene hasn't been this stale since the late '80s. Radiohead is a breath of fresh air.

Radiohead are great, anyone who loves Kid A will love this album, although a little daunting at first this album has to be one of their best, but they have produced so many good albums I have to be careful how I say that. A live album, although not all recorded at the same time was a great idea, even if it was only thrown together, it works so well, many songs have been remastered and sound even better : national anthem, LIKE SPINNING PLATES sounds so good, its a piano version, sublime. Basically if you love radiohead this wont dissapoint."},{"rating":"2","title":"HTP 2 needs a few listens before it gets you","review":"The guitar playing is the best feature of this album. On first listen, the singers may be great but they seem to scream more than sing considering how talented Joe Lynn Turner is that shrouded the experience as disappointing. \\"Revelation\\" reminds me of a Cheap Trick style song just done on the power of crack and Glenn Hughes screaming - JLT's part is nice. Listening to it a second time, it sounds better than the first so it is probably one of those albums that grows on you too. \\"Going my way\\" is a great song that stands out. JLT just has such depth and power without screaming out. The guitar doesn't cover up the vocals and gives it a good rock rhythm. \\"Hold on\\" and \\"Lost Dreams\\" are also good solid rock songs. I think the couple of screamo songs just colored my initial listen as disappointing but subsequent ones the guitars and JLT bring out better responses."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious, Well Edited, and Deep","review":"This is an amazing DVD.

As a continuing series of documentaries, spanning intervals of seven years, it is of course necessarily repetitive - but even this somehow strengthens the message about the long evolution of individual lives. It is also absolutely brilliant. Most poignant of all is the life of Neil, derailed at age sixteen by the onset of mental illness. His life, at each interval through age 35, seemed on a straight and unavoidable line through homelessness toward early death. At age 42, Neil's eventual recovery of control over his own path (with the help of one of the most human, and humane subjects to emerge from this experiment in film-making)- this story alone moved me to tears (and I do not cry easily). The series is full of such moments.

For us as human beings we observe and formulate and make judgements based on our own present times and situations.

To see a child at 7 pour out his hopes and dreams, and then to see that same human being in the form of a 42 year old pouring out his hurts and loves and lows and highs and failures and victories in life!

I can feel many fine and familiar tunes in this album, you can listen through it all again and again with the outstanding tracks 'Carry me ohio' and 'Duk koo kim' it's close to compare to my fovourite RHP's tracks as 'Medecine bottle' and 'Katy song' that i've never found on 'Old ramon' or 'Song for...'.

However, when I saw this one in a kitchen shop a couple of years later, I bought it. It works GREAT for chopping up ground beef, which we consume weekly on taco night. The only disadvantages of the utensil are that it is yet another gadget we need to squeeze in our already full drawers, plus it is an extra dish to wash because I use it in addition to the spatula spoon that I would otherwise use to chop and serve.

The filmed concert quality is absolutely substandard -- particularly the sound. Film is grainy, but that is tolerable. What is NOT tolerable is the sound, which is extaordinarily poor. The vocals are almost indiscernable (even the speaking portions) -- the singing overwhelmed by a tinny instrumental back-up.

It performs well for the price and it's relatively easy to move around and use. The top opening for leaves/twigs is small, so you have to feed in a little at a time. It takes quite a while to shred a large amount of material. I have several pine trees and planned to use it shred their needles, but on that count it doesn't do well. The needles pass through pretty much as-is. I haven't used other shredders so don't know if others would do any better.The chipper handles smaller branches (up to around 1/2 inch) but the vibration and noise discourage me from using it for larger ones.Be careful not to get rocks or metal into it - seems to happen to me a couple of times an hour, and you have to unscrew the three wing-nuts around the base and lift off the cover to clear it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, but could do better","review":"My electric chipper/shredder arrived and was soon assembled (as some say--more by the photo than the instructions) and working.

I got the whole thing together in 1 hour. Usage time? One (1) minute and it no longer works. I saw other reviews where people said this happened to them but I guess I'm an optimist. Having seen this up close it is clear it is badly designed. Feeding tubes are way to small for anything but the smallest pieces so of course it clogged up right away and now won't start at all. This item should not be for sale and Amazon should remove it from it's inventory. Clearly the manufacturer knows this item is no good because it is not available anywhere except from on-line sellers. Stores won't carry it because they know it's no good. I will now begin the process of trying to get my money back from the manfacturer.

Cumbersome to use if you leave the top section on, works much better with it off but be sure to stand back a ways not right over the shoot as things can come flying back up. I stalled the unit with no problem just putting some tall grass ,20\\" long, in it. It all wraped aroud the blades and popped the breaker.

A dissappointment to say the least from Mccullough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a timesaver","review":"I've had this machine for 2 years. It is not good with greens of any sort. I've left things out for 4 weeks trying to dry them out enough to shred without jamming. Doesn't matter. Green or dry, I have to disassemble the hopper every 10 minutes of operation and clean out the debris from the blades. Takes 5 minutes to disassemble. I've tried putting very small amounts through and waiting til all appears to have cleared the blades before feeding in more. That helps but extends the time by three fold. For a square yard of brush, expect to spend 2 hours feeding it through, unjamming the blades, feeding more through, unjamming the blades, feeding more through, unjamming the blades, etc. and add tripping a circuit breaker a time or two into the mix. I got this as a gift, but if I had spent money on this, I would not be getting my money's worth out of it. The power cord on mine split in two after an hours use recently for no apparent reason.

It took me three hours to shred two dried up grass plants because it kept plugging up and required me to take the unit apart and unplug it only to have it plug up in the next two minutes. When shipping the unit back, I noticed the blades were already not sharp. I was totally disappointed. My learning lesson, read more reviews further down on the list of people who rated it poorly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chipper for home landscape uses.","review":"After reading the reviews I decided to take a chance. I've used the chipper only for one season now and it did what I needed it to do. Most of what I chipped was dead and dry from the previous growing season or limbs I had cut down several months ago. nothing larger than 1 inch diameter. The chipped did an excellent job on all of it. What has been a 5 or 6 lawn bag full job was cut down to about a half of bag and that was spread as mulch. The only negative was I tryed to shred some green vines and that got cought up in the blades and required that I take the shredder apart (not a big deal). That took about 15 mins and I was back up and running. For the price, and how it well it work, I'm happy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Chipper/Shredder","review":"Assembly was relatively easy, especially after having read the reviews of others.

Took it apart in case I did something wrong in assembly. Reassembled it. Still dead. Attempted to call McCulloch. Got a third party \\"support\\" line (eventually), who offered no support except the phone number of another third party vendor in my area (near Phoenix, AZ.)

I had my doubts about electric chipper/shredders until I finally ordered the McCulloch 14 Amp Chipper/Shredder.

I am completely satisfied with this product and highly recommend it to anyone looking for a superior chipper/shredder for use in and around the yard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wishful thinking doesn't make this product good!","review":"What a piece of junk! Not only was it difficult to put together (despite all the help given in Amazon reviews of this product) it was next to useless, taking about as long to crumble up leaves as I would have if I'd taken each one and done it by hand! The leaves and twigs I put in were dry but the machine jammed up constantly. The hopper must be for decoration only because in order to shred things you can only put in a handful of leaves at a time. After it jams (which is constantly), it takes about 5 minutes to disassemble and reassemble). If you had good luck with the McCulloch, you must be one of God's chosen few. About the best thing I could say about this product is that it's a sunny yellow color!"},{"rating":"1","title":"McCulloch 14 Amp Electric Chipper/Shredder #24B-404A777","review":"The device did not work! I assembled thanks to my son. The limited directions could have been more explicit. The motor would not engage. The circut breaker would pop after a short duration of humming. We think it was dropped in transit because the foam protection was crushed. Given the reviews, we are trying again with the #24A-404A900 version. Hope that one works!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works for years","review":"We didn't purchase this chipper at Amazon, but thought it worth mentioning that we've used it for over 10 years and are very satisfied with it. We use it mainly for chipping fruit tree prunings and for leaves in the fall. The chute opening for leaves is small so it takes a while to shred a lot of leaves. But as long as they're dry, it does a great job. We've never needed to replace the blades. The outflow chute can get clogged, which can stop the machine. Opening the cover and un-clogging it is easy, but we just keep an eye on the output as we work and keep the outflow going. We use a twig to loosen the clog whenever it stops producing chips, which is quite easy and safe. And did I mention that we've used this same machine for over 10 years?"},{"rating":"2","title":"good initial impression","review":"After researching several yard shredders, I bought the McCulloch MCS2001. I was leery about assembly, but everything went together well--I used the photo on the box as well as the written instructions. I used it to shred lawn debris from last fall and, after some practice, found a method of putting a small amount of debris into the chute opening and using the supplied \\"paddle\\" to push it into the shredder. I was able to shred a large wheelbarrow of old grass, vines and stalks in about 10 minutes. The machine is quiet and easy to move about if care is taken to balance the weight over the wheels. Just be sure to keep the pile of shredded material cleared away from the outlet. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard Work!","review":"I bought this as a present for my husband. It has virtually caused a divorce as he gets so angry with it. As long as you have plenty of time to feed in garden material very very slowly it works reasonably well. Useless for leaves as small stones cause sparks off the blade. Normally the machine cuts out but on occassions we have had smoking material discharged. As mentioned in most other reviews it cuts out frequently which is frustrating. Probably for the price though not much more can be expected."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless.","review":"I had great hopes for this machine--at least my wife did when she purchsed it. We are avid gardeners who wanted to add substantial composting to our arsenal. This McCullough machine is not designed to mulch 1)large twigs 2) rose canes 3) ornamental grass stalks, 4) any garden waste that is not bone dry. It can shred dry, very dry, leaves. Honestly, that's about it. Another devoted gardening friend also regrets purchasing this machine. In her words, \\"it's good if for some inscrutable reason you want to chip chopsticks, one at a time.\\" I wish I had the money back in our pocket and I'd put it towards a real chipper shredder which, alas, will cost many hundreds of dollars. This machine is worthless. Did I mention it frequently jams? If jamming was a step in creating compost, this machine would be a champ. Bottom line: frustrating waste of time, space and money. DO NOT BUY if you need more than chopped dry leaves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works as advertised but one big drawback","review":"I purchased this chipper because I live in a suburban residential area and have a half acre with trees. I want to chip the tree branches and leaves that come down every year, but I wanted something compact that would not take up a lot of room in the garage, require the maintenance of a gas engine, and be really loud to disturb the neighbors. This unit arrived and was easy to assemble, and delivered as promised. The quality of chipping is good as advertised, it has no problem shredding leaves and larger branches. I ended up returning the unit however because the hopper is restricted to a small envelope sized opening and you need to spoon feed in leaves. It could take 15-20 minutes to shred the equivalent of one lawn bag of leaves. I just didn't have the patience for this tedious requirement. Will be looking for a larger open hopper chipper that you can just throw a bunch of leaves at a time through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Instructions do count","review":"Hope to use the little chopper for backyard clean up. Putting the machine together was made so much easier by the nice person who rewrote the instructions which I printed out. Using the instructions which came with the shredder was like reading Chinese. Finally able to get to the backyard for some cleanup since garden cuttings and twigs had dried out. This machine jammed the very first time I tried to put a twig in the twig shoot. I called the number given for \\"service\\" and was told to take it to a local repairman. Well, $21.80 later I have been told that products of this nature coming from China are junk. It is little more than a glorified food processor. Of course, waiting for the right time to do the yardwork means that the product is no longer returnable. I hope Goodwill can find someone to recycle it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks great but didn't work","review":"The product looked great on-line and, using the comments by other reviewers, I had no problem at all with assembly. Unfortunately, the thing did not work. After navigating the very frustrating resolution process with McCulloch and its designated warranty company (a separate entity), I finally took it to the local authorized repair tech. He found that the motor was missing key parts, which could only be obtained directly from the foreign manufacturer, not through McCulloch. After three months waiting for the promised part, I reluctantly contacted Amazon, and they gratiously agreed to refund the entire cost, including free return shipping. While disappointed with the product and McCulloch support, I'm once again pleased with Amazon's great customer service.Bottom line, while the product seems otherwise to be a good design (hence my 2-star rating), I guess it was just my bad luck to get a \\"lemon.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"don't waste your money","review":"This is the second season I have tried to use this shredder, which is basically a garbage disposal unit, without the clearing ability. It might be ok to mix my grass clippings and sawdust from the shop, but heaven forbid trying to grind anything as tough as half decomposed corn stalks. It has two great safety features, since you are often taking it appart to clear it, you cannot start it unless the top is securly screwed down onto the base the other is that it clogs up so often you cannot work up a sweat so heart attacks or heat stroke are avoided. However, if are prone to high blood pressure or have anger managment issues, this is not the tool for you. Actually, it is not for anyone.

The small throat or opening requires lots of effort to feed leaves and other yard material into the unit. The unit continually clogs and then you have to turn unit off and then unscrew the top and remove the shredded material. I would not recommend purchasing this chipper shredder."},{"rating":"1","title":"Underpowered. Jams more often than it runs.","review":"I've had one of these for almost two years now, and it continues to disappoint. It can handle only very small branches - not more than 3/4\\" in diameter - and really can't continuous feed anything greater than 1/2\\". It also is very prone to clogging - in particular if the material is at all green. If you are trimming a bush, better let the branches dry for a week before putting them through this. Upon clogging, you need to remove the top, clear the jam, and reassemble. Once you get good at it, it's about three minutes to do. You will need to do it roughly every two minutes of use, so you will get good at it quickly. This machine was a complete waste of money for me. I hate it more every time I use it."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of time and money","review":"Anything thicker than half an inch - the machine stalls, even if you try to feed it in short bursts. Once it stalls, you have to unscrew three nuts, and the main one (with a safety power-off) is located so close to the body of the machine that you can only make a quarter of a turn at a time, otherwise your fingers get caught between the nut and the machine. Once you unscrew all the nuts and lift the top, you do not see anything wrong there, no bits of wood stuck between the knives or anything, so you replace the top, screw the nuts, start it - and then you go through the whole procedure two minutes later, for no apparent reason.Waste of time and money if you want to chip branches, even small ones. OK for twigs - but even then you do not produce real chips, you mostly get torn pieces of twigs 3-5 inches long."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chipper doesn't chip","review":"The chipper simply didn't perform as advertised. Instead of chipping, it stripped bark, even from drier material.It had no prayer of chipping 1-1/2 inch branches. Half-inch material stalled it out even when using a 25' #14 power cord. (Much less electrical resistance than the maximum reccomended by McCullough.)Instead of shredding leaveas and small branches, it wound them around the central cutter and prevented further chipping.It was returned to the supplier at significant cost. Shipping both ways to California cost almost as much as the chipper."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Real Disappointment!","review":"This machine had to be returned because its motor was shorted out. After making several calls to a company designated in the product's literature for repairs, I learned that the company no longer is in business and the availability of repairs is extremely limited. This was most disappointing and actually set me back two weeks in my fall cleanup efforts. However, I must say that Amazon.com was extremely cooperative in dealing with the product's return and refund of the purchase monies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for suburban yard","review":"I concur with other reviewers that a few more picture details in the instructions would've sped up the assembly, but I did have it put together by myself in less than an hour.It is disappointing when a jam occurs and you have to open it up to clear the jam, but after awhile you get the hang of how to reduce the frequency of jams.Overall this performs to my expectations of keeping leaves, twigs and branches out of the landfill and using it in the yard.Cost effective solution to recycling garden trimmings in a suburban home with a medium size yard.This would definitely not be suitable for use on acreage where you're trying to recycle mass amounts of tree and shrub pruning."},{"rating":"2","title":"McCulloch MCS2001 14-Amp Electric Chipper/Shredder","review":"Very pleased with the operation.

Jams often, especially when the cutting blades get dull. Blades need to be sharpened every 8 or so hours of use. Dull blades turn wood into shreds and not chips. CHIPS fly right out, but SHREDS get stuck in the exhaust shoot and eventually backup until the blades will not spin.This tool is only useful for someone who wants to chip about a small pickup truck full of branches every now and then. And (with lots of practice) that will likely take a good 45 minutes.Tip: Do not use a bag, just let the chips fall to the ground.

In Maine, nothing is local, but fortunately this shop was only about 35 miles away.

They gave me two agencies in my area. I phoned both, and no, they are no longer associated with McCulloch products. I fianlly got back to the 800 number, they referred me to another source about 60 miles from me. They said they would take care of this. Let's hope so.

If you throw away the instructions and you're mechanically inclined (know how cotter pins and locking washers work) you should be able to assemble the unit.I hoped this $220 unit would be an economical alternative to $600 units, so long as I had light-duty use.

It will take branches up to about an inch in diameter, but that depends on whether it is hard or soft wood. You must feed the larger branches *very* slowly to keep it from choking, but it is easy to clear when it chokes. I have used it for about six hours total, about an hour a day. I really like it. However, after two weeks it suddenly stopped working. Under warranty, I took it to my local authorized service center; they said some of the wiring had come loose. They fixed it, no charge to me, said it wasn't anything I had caused. It was tricky to find an authorized service center - look on the net for Poulan rather than McCulloch.I have mostly used it for chipping, have done only a little shredding. Seems to work great for both.Neat little machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"junk!!!! warning!!!!!","review":"It was almost too good to be true.

McCulloch now owned maybe by Huskvarna but who knows for certain. Parts available only through Parts Tree. Obtained from overseas. The machine is an incredible machine for the price and for what it does, And is ELECTRIC which makes it quiet, and not generating of local pollution but the fact that there is/ has been NO SUPPORT for the machine which makes it a piece of crap.

Poor video, not every episode, bare bones edition. If you don't care about the bells and whistles, at least put out all the episodes of the season in the package.

We were going to exchange but we checked on Target's site and found many reviews of similar problems for it also when my husband went to the store the response he got was \\"oh, another one\\" (and this was not the same store it was bought at, so not just a damaged shipment). I feel sorry for those who bought it as a Christmas gift and will have some friend or family member disappointed because they can't return it and get a better brand without paying a lot more.

To escape from them for a spell, she takes a bus-tour west to see America. While out west she literally bumps into Duke Hudkins (John Wayne) at a rodeo. They end up spending the rest of the day together and most of the evening and Molly ends up missing her bus. Duke takes her to the city where she can catch it for the ride home.Though this is a pretty typical boy-meets-girl movie, there are a lot of elequant touches that make it stand out above the rest. Besides, it's enjoyable watching the Duke play a role so different from the ones he was to become famous for. Jean Arthur is just adorable and makes a grand lady that is at first pursued, but then becomes the pursuer. As a bonus, Phil Silvers has a small role as the bus tour guide. Not only will Wayne fans and oldies fans like this movie, but it makes for a great date picture."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible print","review":"We love John Wayne movies. He made a few delightful romantic comedies, and this is one of them. A Lady Takes A Chance is charming, but we are sorry we bought this video. It hurts towatch this movie, because sometimes you can't make out their faces due to to the poor lighting. The corners of the picture are black, and the rest of the film is grainy.

The filter kit was a cool added benefit since I only needed the brackets and never really thought about having filters for the light, and I'm just waiting for a reason to throw on the red one (low-light conditions) sometime, and a reason to use the blue one (fog)...though I'm skeptical that I'll ever have a \\"real\\" use for them...fortunately for me I'm good at making up reasons to use cool toys like this!

The red lens is useful to preserve night vision. It was impossible to get the red lens into one of my MagLites but the second one I tried offered little resistance.The brackets are strong enough to support two flashlights but you really have to make sure they are level. It is nice to know exactly where to find a flashlight when the power goes out."},{"rating":"2","title":"WELL WELL worth it.","review":"Fantastic kit.Shop smart; with the free shipping on orders over $25, this kit is basically $9 delivered.

Keep the spare clear lens (another very useful little bonus!) someplace safe for when yours gets scratched up and needs replacing, then just throw the red and blue \\"gimmick\\" lenses in the junk drawer, or the trash.As with Maglite products in general, you do get more than you pay for with this kit.

Well I figured I could live without it, but whenever i went to put the light down, it would roll away!I quickly purchased this kit and solved the problem!I used the mount on the seat bracket of my Jeep and it holds it nice and snug, On a 2 cell Maglite you can probably get away with using just one mount since it holds the light so snugly.The lenses you can use with the anti-roll device, you dont have to take the head apart on the maglite to put them in, like everyone else I will probably never use them."},{"rating":"2","title":"The lenses are great","review":"They are easy to use, & the red comes in handy for night vision. A clear, unscratched lens is always nice. The mounts are handy for storing & quick access. Anyone who uses a mag lite should have these extras."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mounting clips were useful.","review":"The bezel and mounting clips are useful. If you have D cell Mag-lites on a boat or vehicle that moves, this keeps your flashlight from rolling around. The mounting clips are made well and hold the flashlight in place. The plastic red clear and blue covers are not the greatest though. The red is not very red, the blue is not very blue and the white is not able to diffuse light much at all. Better to get a blue or red LED light if you need colored light and just use the clear filter already on the light. The clear one seems to have no purpose as it doesn't diffuse light enough. Better to just get the mounting clips yourself. The rubber bezel is good for keeping the light from rolling around, but will discolor and dirt will stick to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not yet shipped","review":"Funny thing is the product will work great, but the product has not been shipped yet after 9 days of being purchased."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect accesory","review":"I got the 3d cell maglite with LED as a gift and the anti-roll attachment perfects the military look. I tried all the lenses, and the blue one has the highest energy and cuts through fog really well. I mounted the flashlight brackets on the rear roof column in my truck, but the plastic trim will not stand up to the abuse so I still need to drill into the frame. When mounting, make sure you have a solid base. I knew what i was getting and was a great buy; no complaints so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent product in original packaging","review":"This is the original maglite product in original packaging.

Empty space at the back of the case is designed to allow the drive to remain cool. Because I switch drives weekly, the plastic mounts failed after about 7 months and the drives slide backward in the case - making it very difficult to connect - and defeats the cooling feature.What it needs:Side mounting screws to hold the drive securly in place - metal to metal not plastic.I am replacing all three."},{"rating":"2","title":"Carlito delivers the goods.","review":"This is a really great film collection.

After leaving Geffen Records PMM decided to go it alone in the end, and it shows, their sound is still unmistakable, but it has matured, and so have the lyrics. Looking Through has all the PMM trademarks, heavy riffs, atmospheric sampling and keyboards, and lead singer Roman Marisak sounds as good as ever. The opening song Something New kicks things off nicely, and As It's Fading has a very powerful and melodic chorus which is begging for airplay. These guys don't get the recognition they deserve, and scaling things down and releasing the album themselves won't help, so get out there and buy this album. You won't be disappointed. The only reason I give it 4 stars is that there's only 10 songs instead of the usual 12."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as their debut","review":"Not nearly as musically interesting as their debut, self-titled, disc. On Looking Through, the tracks seem to blend together with no amazing standout tracks. I suppose you can give them props for not trying to hard to produce a single, but it feels like they didn't try to hard to produce any truly great songs.If you're new to PMM, get their self-titled disc.

The book is 15 years old so it is also getting dated since the book is referencing a lot of research. Still worh reading if you are interested in the subject.With psychological perspective I mean that the book is somewhat narrow. It does not deal with social networks and how a network can lift an individual. It does not deal with luck or interaction between personal traits and situation. This is a major weakness to understand greatness, but one book cannot cover it all. Still I would have been more comfortable if the author himsel was aware of these limitations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbled","review":"This book is tenuously outdated. Several arguments in here are completely invalid thanks to studies done since the book was written. As a side step to this, the author proves a point with generally enough data and then shows the other side to the argument. But, by doing this he realizes that there isn't enough data or by showing both sides to the argument he has just made the argument invalid. He also does not distribute enough empirical data about the assumptions he has made about psychology.Overall I thought this was an OK text book, but I don't agree with a lot of the things said."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must have","review":"I installed these on the wall of my bedroom because my GF kept loosing my Min Maglite LED flashlight under and behind things when she used it.

Its explanations are readable and focus on musical values.Dallin offers the student numerous pathways to depart from or expand upon common practice theory while maintaining coherence and expressivity. The important issues of developing ideas and creating cohesive forms are addressed in later chapters.Along with a steady diet of score study and compositional exercises, this book can be a valuable tool for the student composer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy!","review":"This is a well organized and well written book for both the student and the professional composer.

However, let me be the first to tell you that this cable conducts an electrical signal like it was made out of woven horse hair; though I doubt horse hair would display such horrible ghosting (aka double imaging).

I have a couple of negative comments: the graphics aren't all the great and it is rather two dimensional. It's also annoying that the game has no manual save feature, so when the game is over you have to start over at the beginning of the level you last played.

Szell's take on Mozart was very specific: intelligent, clear, elegant, with a glint of steel where necessary(such on the exciting #24 in this set). Contrary to naysayers who can't hear it, there is plenty of light, warmth and spirit to go around. The orchestra is magnificent.Where this set is lacking at times is Casadesus, who is too restrained, too simple, and at times, even routine. More expressive pianists made better partners with Szell/Cleveland/Columbia (Fleisher, Serkin, etc.).You may find warmer, more sensitive and emotional interpretations from more recent Mozart piano concerto sets, such as Alfred Brendel/Neville Marriner/St Martin in Fields or Murray Perahia/English Chamber Orchestra, but this is still a worthy set with a distinctive personality and superb musicianship.Note: this entire set will be available in a US version in late March 2011."},{"rating":"1","title":"i hate these kid toys","review":"these things are meant for kids. they hold almost no music and almost no videos. my 30 gb video ipod doesnt even suit all my music. and every single little kid that buys this will break it becuase if you find other reviews from other sites, these break realllllly easily.do not buy, save your money and go to the electronics section instead of the toy section at target."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow, doesn't hover well on land, sank after 15 mn of play","review":"My son's best friend got one of those for christmas and we went to the lake to test it against my son's regular RC boat. The hovercraft was very slow and not quite that maneuverable. It hovered OK on water, but couldn't handle sand or concrete. The \\"skirt\\" slipped out of its track a couple times (despite our being careful fitting it as best as we could), filling with water - the foam inside it didn't prevent the boat from being swamped by the smallest wave (even in good shape it couldn't handle waves like the other boat.) The thin skirt finally ripped and the boat is pretty much unusable now. Big disapointment. It was somewhat fun while it worked, the concept was intriguing for the gearhead boys, but once the novelty wore off the regular boat was a lot more exciting and all the kids prefered taking turns running that one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Dissapointing","review":"We purchased this item for our five year old for Christmas. Although it does work OK in the house on wooden floors, the battery seems to be very short lived (maybe 15 minutes).

It is unfortunate they discontinued this perfume, but luckily I can always count on Amazon whenever I'm running low. :) I LOVE the scent. It's soooooo fresh and captivating. It's one of those smell that leaves you wanting to take another whiff. I can't get enough of it. I love the fact that it's fresh, without being too girly or fruity (at all) and it's sexy enough without being too overpowering or heavy. This is one of those perfume you can wear day and night.The first time I bought this bottle (back in 2003-4), I was a little disappointed the smell didn't last long, but when I repurchased it again in 2010, I was proven wrong. This spray may not last the whole day, but it lasts long enough. Even when I try out other perfumes, I find myself coming back to this one. It's definitely a keeper!"},{"rating":"2","title":"simply awesome!","review":"Kenneth Cole has always been well-known in classy clothing, accessories, watches and many more.

It's one of my favorite scents. Sometimes perfumes start to smell terrible as the day progresses, but that is not the case with this one. This is a perfume that you can wear for formal events and more casual ones. What I love about this perfume is that the scent isn't very noticeable unless the person is very close to you. So its for you and your significant other to enjoy (as well as anyone who hugs you). I personally don't like perfumes that are so strong that people can smell it when sitting next to me, much sitting/standing several feet from me. I understand if you prefer it, and if that's your thing then this perfume is not for you.Highly recommended.

Numbers II and III are largely retreads of the first with the third, courtesy of The Learning Channel, insultingly dumbed down. The power of Burke's original series was in his apparently meandering narratives that came together at stunning points to create a teachable moment. TLC apparently believes that its audience is idiots because they have forced Burke, in his videotaped remake (the first series was shot on film) to pause every few minutes to recap. I'm glad they paid him for the work, but not how they made him earn it. (This is also why one should be very discerning when buying videos from TLC or its sister company, The Discovery Channel).

This book starts in tenth gear and still manages to pick up speed and the horror gets kicked up a few notches.It is very rare to see a horror novel so well executed especially one that involves a monster. But even with a monster as a plot device, Owl Goingback does not skimp on the suspense and the settings.One of the best horror novels of the year (maybe THE best, but there are a few I didn't read).

Writers like Richard Matheson, Graham Masterton, Peter Straub and Stephen King can really enchant a reader in horror.

I was referred to this series from a review about Bill Bryson's \\"A Short History of Nearly Everything.\\" (I highly recommend Bill Bryson's book).Made in the late 1970's, this series has turned out to be very disappointing for me. The material is presented in a dense and non-interesting way... It's like watching a series with old Star Trek acting but without the old Star Trek charms and messages...Even more important, trying to trace the causation of anything requires a true expert. Anyone can trace and path a path in a web of causations and claim a revelation (hence the existence of so many conspiracy theories!). A true guide can trace the important and less revealed paths and take you on a insightful and revealing journey. Unfortunately, James is no such a guide."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most Authoritative Book Yet on Tull","review":"Scott Nollen did a fabulous job on this history of Jethro Tull. He provides the reader with the inside scoop from the band: Why band members joined and departed, why songs were written and what the lyrics really mean, plus recollections and stories from band members that you won't read anywhere else. Vivid descriptions are offered of each album, how it was produced, and the accompanying concert tour. I also enjoyed reading about the dry British humour and zany \\"behind-the-scenes\\" antics of John Evans, Jeffrey Hammond, David Pegg, Doane Perry, and Glenn Cornick. This light-hearted, back stage humour provided a great counterpoint to Ian Anderson's disciplined, stern, highly professional expectations of the band. I bought this book 3 weeks ago and I still can't put it down -- a fascinating read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a biography at all","review":"If you don't know a thing about Tull, you'll be lost in the first few pages. If you know a little, you'll still be lost in the first few pages. Even if you know a bunch about Tull, this thing becomes a tedious, plodding through the mind of an avid fan, all too eager to wave his back-stage pass in your face. I do hope one day someone will write a real biography on Tull; indeed, one of the great rock bands to emerge from the 60's. Perhaps Mr Anderson could get someone like Peter Guralnick or David Ritz to do a real biography. Until then, don't waste your money on this. You'll get much the same information by investing in one of the box sets (plus, you'll get something to listen to)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful CD and misrepresents Brecker's involvement","review":"From looking at the cover, you'd think that Michael was one on every track, or at least most of them. In fact, he plays on maybe 4 of the 16 tracks, one of which is entirely EWI with no soloing. The tunes are all original by a German composer and all sound very very dated. It sounds much more like a smooth jazz album (complete with bell piano!). Many of the songs barely have a solo section (including the ones with Brecker). The label or composer basically gathered some of the world's greatest soloists at the top of their game and then refused to let them do what they do best. The mixing of the album is not stellar. If you like anything by Michael Brecker, Mike Stern or Peter Erskine, you'll most likely not like anything about this album. There's a reason that no songs on the album can be previewed before purchase. if I could return it, I would."},{"rating":"1","title":"piece of junk","review":"The third time I tried to use this, the vacuum stopped working and a chunk of rubber gasket protruded from the pump.

However, I thought this book failed everywhere. The characters were unsympathetic, the mystery non-existant, the ending unbelievable. The most outrageous part was Kate telling her husband that she wanted to become a professional reporter because she felt she had done a good job of solving the murder in this book. I thought she was so inept that her efforts had to be a parody of the amateur detective. However, since the book was rarely funny, I don't think this was Ms. Weiner's intention.

She's been done before: An educated thirtyish woman who feels she is trapped with her kids in the suburbs. Add to this a really obnoxious,loudmouthed friend and three toddlers (including a four year old who acts forty) and you have the makings of a so-so story that's been done many times before.I found Kate to be an extreme busybody and wouldn't blame her husband for leaving her.

While I am always ready to suspend reality while reading fiction, not a thing rang true about the characters in this book or the situations they were faced with. I was particularly disappointed with how completely unlikeable the main character was, which I'm assuming was unintentionally done by the author and the lack of resolution of the main character's relationships at the end of the book. The best way to describe this book is hollow, although if you are looking for an easy read, with only ocassional entertainment value, this might work."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T LOSE ANY SLEEP","review":"This book could have been one of those that is in essence written by a computer. Take (1) part Stepford Wives, add (1) part Desperate Housewives, toss in a dash of Stephanie Plum and maybe a pinch of Archy McNally....shake well and pour out Goodnight Nobody.What was Weiner thinking? Did she have a 4 book contract to fulfill so she threw this together? The murder in the picture perfect Connecticut town being investigated and solved by Kate Klein, a mother of three who barely has time to bathe and wash her hair stretches credibility. (Actually the story doesn't even make it as a farce....if that is indeed what it was supposed to be). After reading her previous three books, this one was a sad disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"nothing special","review":"I really wanted to like this book, especially after reading her first three books and loving them.

But the books seem to get stupider each time, and Goodnight Nobody was a new low.The story of New Yorker Kate Klein trying to fit into her new suburban surroundings was unoriginal and plodding. Some scenes seemed straight out of Tom Perotta's Little Children; at other times, Weiner seemed to be challenging Susan Isaac's Compromising Positions. Except, the problem for Weiner is both those books are better.I'm sure Weiner has it in her to write another great book. But her faithful and adoring readers are going to lose interest if she writes another Goodnight Nobody.I read the book quickly; it was written in her wry, observant style and she has a certain flair. But overall, it was a disappointing effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Need Closure!","review":"I really enjoyed this book (obviously, since I read it in less than 2 days, and I'm a 4th year college student who doesn't have a ton of time!)! I recommend that if you're even thinking about getting this book, get it...it's great. But, like the previous reviewer, I really wish the last couple of loose ends had been wrapped up. Still a GREAT read, and I also hope that the loose ends mean that there's another book about Kate coming up :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"What Was She Thinking? So disappointed!","review":"I just finished this book and my first thought was: what????There was not enough resolution for me. Some of the \\"mystery\\" was solved, but not the personal conflict that Kate had.

I almost stopped reading it after 2 pages, but stuck it through. Then I stopped near the end. I didn't even care who done-it, because the book was so poorly written. (Is this REALLY a Jennifer Weiner book?)Anything good? The protagonist and her best friend are great characters that you care about.What was the Bad that outweighed the Good?1. IT WAS NOT FUNNY. Jennifer Weiner books are funny!2. The \\"Mystery\\" part of it was so poorly written that you don't enjoy reading it. For example, the protagonist jumps from suspect to suspect dozens of times and pretty soon you don't even care anymore. AND she loves to confront these dozens of \\"suspects\\" and gets herself into life threatening trouble at every turn. (If this were well written, it would have been palatable.)At the end, you don't care if she dies, since she has been so stupid."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was disappointed","review":"This was the first time I read a novel by Jennifer Weiner. I was expecting a laugh a minute but didn't get it. Sure there was plenty of humorous dialog and funny situations. I did laugh! But I tired of the descriptions of baggy pants and XL sweaters midway through. Kate was defined by her poor fashion sense and her inability to cook. None of the characters had enough guts to them to keep me interested. And the end was so dark and disturbing it made me wonder what the point was.One Clown Short"},{"rating":"2","title":"I really liked it.","review":"I read this after I finished Then Came You, which I loved and was pleasantly surprised by the humor.

I am not a mystery reader at all, but found that I could not put this book down. The mystery of it combined with the drama and love story roped me in and I finished the book in a day and a half.

The book was great. The story line was a little silly but her characters had such personality. I felt like they were MY neighbors!

Definitely a must read if you're looking for a light story."},{"rating":"2","title":"mystery and laughter combined","review":"Jennifer Weiner's wit has been visible in all her books, but this is a new dimension----a really good mystery.

I loved the whole beginning and I felt I could identify with her, moving to a small town and the attitudes in a small town. I loved her finding the body and trying to solve the murder. I don't however like to read books about wifes and husbands not really having a marriage or anything meaningful.I do think this book is worth reading, but maybe from the library. I hope the next one keeps me more entertained!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very enjoyable!","review":"This book is a joy to read. I am about half way through and pretty often, I catch myself laughing out loud! Jennifer Weiner is a very witty writer and her characters are very personable. Don't hesitate to buy this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Moronic Heroine","review":"Kate, a Columbia grad, is nonetheless unbearably stupid: 1. When the neighbor she's been crushing on makes a drunken pass at her, then retreats in embarrassment and apologies, she takes this as a terrible betrayal, flees the country and harbors illwill toward him for years. Huh? 2) She marries someone because he is \\"appropriate\\". 3) She gets pregnant again when her firstborn is 3 months old. 4. Instead of hiring a nanny and getting a job, she mopes through life as a suburban mommy, bemoaning her wasted days, as if her old life writing gossip for a tabloid was in any way meaningful. What a tedious woman."},{"rating":"1","title":"Goodnight No Thanks","review":"I have to agree that this is a somewhat lackluster book. The protagonist, Kate Klein, is the prototypical Jennifer Weiner main character: thirtyish, Jewish, overweight, inappropriately (verging on annoyingly) clownish, and caught between the professional world and domestic concerns.The book is basically a chick-lit murder mystery. As with other Weiner stories, it conflates the fantastical and outlandish with the mundane, a formula that doesn't feel natural to me at all (e.g., when put on the spot at Kitty's funeral, Kate ends up singing \\"If You're Happy and You Know It, Clap Your Hands\\" during a misguided eulogy--so over-the-top and not very funny).I find most of Weiner's characters to be uneven and underdeveloped, and Goodnight Nobody's are no exception. I am done with Weiner, and I am still trying to understand her overwhelming commercial success and critical appeal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not terrible...","review":"I'm not sure what to say about this book. I went in with very low expectations (just wanted something light to read when I was in bed with the flu) and I guess \\"Goodnight, Nobody\\" met those low expectations. The characters weren't particularly interesting and the whole murder mystery was so far-fetched it was almost unbelievable but, on the other hand, I did keep turning the pages, and I smiled once or twice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deja Vu","review":"If you've read Susan Isaac's \\"Compromising Positions,\\" you've read this book. Not sure whether it was deliberately done but if felt like entire scenes were lifted intact. I was surprised and disappointed. I've enjoyed this writer's other books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Jennifer Weiner's best work","review":"I have enjoyed Ms. Weiner's previous novels, but this book was not what I have come to expect from her writing. The characters were boring. The plot did not keep me intrigued. The brief bits of humor felt forced.I don't recommend this book. I'm sorry that I spent my money on it.Don't buy this book expecting it to be like her previous ones, because you'll be disappointed like I was!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terribly disappointing...","review":"I liked the book... up until the ending. Why? Because it didn't end! It just sort of drifted away and you were left wondering what happened.It won't stop me from reading any new Jennifer Weiner novels when they come out. But, it will stop me from recommending this particular book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"First disapointment with Weiner","review":"Typically a huge fan of Jennifer Weiner's writing, I snapped up this book the day it came out. This book, while well-written, reminded me why I am not interested in crime or who-done-it novels. I thoroughly enjoyed the parts of Kate Klein's life that was predictable - kids, not fitting into her suburb, a workaholic husband. I could have done without the dozens of \\"interviews\\" she performed in order to solve Kitty's murder. I simply lost interest in who killed Kitty and frankly, wanted the book to veer back to the preschool politics that made me laugh. I was also frustrated by the storyline of Evan being left open - there was no closure to that situation at all, which was disapointing.Weiner should stick to dependable chick-lit and leave the murder mysteries to another aisle at the bookstore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book - I'd actually rate it 4 1/2 stars!","review":"I really enjoyed this book. I'm very surprised at some of the other reviews. I too was disappointed that we didn't get an ending with a solution to her love life, but hopefully, that leaves room for another \\"murder mystery\\" book featuring Kate, her husband, her lost love and her best friend. I thought it was charmingly funny, and I liked the closeness with her best friend, however, not Janie's interference in Kate's love life. Too devious and over the top. All in all, though, a book I would definitely recommend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's A Great Book!","review":"While Jennifer Weiner has a tendency to rotate characters from one novel to the next, I applaud her ability to change the themes of her novels. I thought Good In Bed was good. . In Her Shoes wasn't as good. . .Little Earthquakes was better . . . But I think I enjoyed this book most because it's most unlike any of the other books she published before . . .a whole different genre, and yet, you could still recognize it as being something she would write. This is a suspense novel which is in some way is supposed to be dark and gloomy, but she managed to infuse humor in it and that's the best part of it all. I must say however, that I am not impressed with the way she ends her books . . ."},{"rating":"1","title":"not appealing as her others","review":"I have read some of her other books and I believe this one was not up to the others. I found the character very \\"whiney\\" and not very redeeming. This book seemed more \\"cookie cutter\\" and not as funny and/or clever as her others. I was disappointed-especially in the ending and her choices."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glad I did not buy it","review":"I LOVED Jennifer Weiner's other books so when i heard that she had another book coming out, I was excited. This book was disappointing in contrast to In Her Shoes, Good in Bed and Little Earthquakes. Those were the kinds of books that you want to recommend to a friend and make sure that you have copy of on the shelf. I'm glad that i rented this one from the library and spent my money on the latest Diana Gabaldon and Robert Jordan instead. However while it was a fun read, her characters were not as interesting as the characters in her other books. Almost felt like she was somehow trying to badly put a Desperate Housewives twist into the literary world. I would not recommend this book but I would reccomend ANY of her other books. Fans of hers would also like Lorna Landvik and Sophie Kinsella"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"A good friend recommended this book to me, so I was really surprised to find it predictable and sitcommy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Very Real","review":"As a mother of three kids aged 1-4, I thought this wasn't real about the stuggle I have every day.

I had a difficult time getting through it and finally gave up and skimmed through to the end. None of the characters were fully developed. The plot was completely unrealistic. It was not at all funny. I was shocked that so many professional reviewers seemed to love such a flat, poorly written story. I won't buy another of this author's novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Goodnight, Period.","review":"I am a little confused as to why Weiner, one of the hottest writers today, felt it necessary to try her hand at a mystery. After the raucous success of \\"In Her Shoes,\\" \\"Good In Bed,\\" and \\"Little Earthquakes,\\" I expected her to keep moving on the same vein -- and I was excited about it.But this book doesn't make the grade set by her previous three best-sellers. The mystery is clunky, the characters annoying, and the plot disjointed. This was a strange attempt at a new genre. Let's hope Weiner returns to her familiar -- and lush -- territory and leaves the mystery writing to others."},{"rating":"1","title":"painful - I'm sorry I wasted my time...","review":"I borrowed this from the library and am upset over the $1.00 fine I incurred trying to get through this horrible book. I just wanted to get to the end which was painful. The writing was choppy, the characters were not developed, and I didn't like Kate. I felt bad for her kids and husband. The ending was the worst of all very rushed and unbelievable.I liked Good in Bed, I thought I'd enjoy a mystery - this is the last Weiner book I'll read. I'll stick to the pink covered books as Weiner reffered to them somewhere in this mess, at least I don't feel reading them is a waste of my time."},{"rating":"2","title":"a winner by Weiner","review":"the product came as advertised and it's proven to be a winner by Weiner - thanks much to the vendor"},{"rating":"1","title":"An unfortunate occurrence","review":"Like many readers here, I'm a big fan of this author, however, her latest books have been very disappointing. I wish she would stick to her original writing style and format and not try to recreate the wheel - it's not necessary. I will continue reading any forthcoming books from Ms. Weiner, but will only get them either from the library or as a free Kindle. I hate giving this 2 stars because she is such a talented writer, but reviews should be honest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't caare for this one.","review":"This is my first Jennifer Weiner novel and it may well be my last. I really did not care for this book at all, mainly due to a central character who was completely unsympathetic and unlikeable. I did not like Kate Klein at all, and found her an unbelievable character, amongst a host of unbelievable people who populate this novel. I was very disappointed, as I can see that Weiner is a talented writer, but this novel just fell flat for me, and the ending was terrible. It read like a rushed contractual obligation that she had to churn out to satisfy her publisher. Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Susan Isaacs should sue (no pun intended)","review":"This is such a rip-off of Isaac's 'Compromising Positions.'Intelligent, educated woman who loves her kids but feels unchallenged? Check.Beautiful, sexy BFF who gets into dicey situations? Check.Satiric depictions of suburban mommies? Check.Obsession with a local murder that provides a diversion in a humdrum life?Check.Distant husband who denigrates his wife and orders her not to get involved? Check.Add in that the book is much less well written, the ending is rushed and implausible and you keep wishing that Kate would stop whining about how bored she was and get a part-time job or volunteer. At least Isaac's lead character made peace with her domestic life and planned to finish her doctorate."},{"rating":"1","title":"a disappointment","review":"I loved Jennifer Weiner's books Good in Bed and Little Earthquakes, so I couldn't wait to open this book. The first chapter didn't get my attention, but I trudged on, waiting for it to get entertaining...on the last page I was still waiting. I wouldn't even have finished the book had it been written by someone else, but I wanted to give it a fair chance. I might be biased because I have never been a big fan of murder mysteries, which is what this book turns out to be. I highly suggest you pass on this one if you're looking for some good chick lit, because this belongs more in a category with Dean Koontz."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh.","review":"I'm still not sure what to think of this book. It wasn't horrible, but it wasn't really good. I wish it would have focused more on Kate--what a great character. I could have done without the flashbacks while growing up, because it really didn't serve much purpose since the story wsn't really focused on Kate. Just left me feeling wierd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lot to be desired","review":"I am a huge Jennifer Weiner fan, but this one left me a bit disppointed. I found the \\"crime-solving\\" Kate to be unbelievable. I understand wanting to find out who the killer is in a small town, but she went to great lengths to uncover the truth. It just all seemed too far-fetched for me. Thankfully, Kate had her friend Janie to get us through. Stick to Chick Lit, Jennifer, and leave the crime solving/mysteries to someone else."},{"rating":"1","title":"where is she going with this?","review":"I am completely with Anne.

I was extremely disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hysterical","review":"I have read all of Jennifer Weiner's previous novels. This one by far is the funniest. As a suburban mother, I found myself laughing out loud. I related very well to the main character. The only reason this book does not earn 5 stars, is because the ending is so disappointing. But if you want to laugh out loud with a book that reminds you of Desperate Housewives, this book is for you (for the first 300 pages at least)."},{"rating":"1","title":"funny at first - slow in the middle - and just dragged in the end","review":"Kate Klein got me from the getgo with her humor and zaney mommy-life. I am always on the hunt for mommmy-lit but this book fell short for me. The story played out instantly in my head as an episode on Desperate Housewives. I love that show but rather not have it in a book format. Kate goes to her friend, not so close if at all! friend's house and finds her dead. A who-dunnit ensues but not without playground banter and perfect mommy bashing (which was hilarious) but it was still grasping. I think Weiner would do better to leave mystery out of her novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was a light, easy read for me...","review":"I will admit that I figured out the ending before I was halfway through the book, which is why I only gave it 4 stars. But I did find the book a fast read and I really enjoyed it. This was my first book from Jennifer Weiner, and I just requested all of her other books from the library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Weiner writes a good mystery","review":"I enjoyed this book much more than her last one (\\"Little Earthquakes\\"). Weiner has written a book full of humor and a bit of suspense. She fleshes out her main character, Kate Klein, very well. We read of her early days in NYC (and her first love) and her current life in suburban Connecticut (with her husband and three kids).As far as the ending being unresolved, as some reviewers have said, I like the open ending. I don't want to ruin the ending, so I won't say any more than that. If you are a Jennifer Weiner fan, this is a must-read. It isn't a life-changing work, but it is a great way to spend a weekend."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Little Disappointed","review":"I was a little disappointed with this book. Jennifer Weiner is one of my favorite authors but it was hard for me to get past the liberal bias and conservative critisim in this book. Had she left the politics out of the book I would have given it 4 or possibly even 5 stars. I hope in the future she does not incorporate politics into her books....I enjoy reading them but that was a big turn off for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This book was disappointing. I have read all of Jennifer Weiner's prior books in 2-3 days, tops. This one took me 3 weeks and I wound up with a late fine at the library.I was very surprised to find myself immersed in a mystery novel - it's as if Mrs. Weiner is attempting a genre hop. I say stick to chick lit and leave murder mysteries alone!Overall the book felt like a flat cola - you still get the caffeine but none of the fizz."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snoozer...","review":"I am a fan of JW's other writing, but I read through the first part/section of \\"Goodnight Nobody\\" and decided to stop - way too \\"Desperate Housewives\\" for my taste.

I have a growing list of books that I want to read and this one was not worth my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very entertaining!","review":"I had heard good things about the author but was very disappointed in Goodnight, Nobody.

Although, parts of the book were interesting, they were too few and far between."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Ending Ever!","review":"Goodnight Nobody is the first novel that I've read by Jennifer Weiner, and most likely will be the last. It was somewhat entertaining but the ending was so bad that I regreted wasting my time reading it. I was thinking of several different endings that would have been more intriging."},{"rating":"2","title":"Trying something new","review":"My favorite Weiner novel? No.My favorite mystery book? Heck no.Good, light, comedic reading? Yes.The above sort of says it all. Overall I thought it was a pretty entertaining and fun read. I liked the plot, although the ending lacked. But, I think what Weiner is trying to do is to keep her novels fresh and not get stuck in a rut of writing the same sort of romance novel over & over again. So give her some credit for that. I know a lot of writers that I've read who churn out a book every year and it's the same regurgitated storyline over & over.I think it's worth the read."},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty good","review":"Not totally stellar but I got into it...

These concertos each attempt some kind of con fuoco/appasionato profundity, but, like much of Mendelssohn, they to lack any depth. Of course these concertos suffer when placed next the greats (e.g., Mozart, Beethoven, Brahms, etc) but I owuld even rank them below those by unknown composers such as Reinecke, Moscheles, and Field.

I couldn't put it down and I've already read it twice.Where else will you read about a dinner with God, learn about Government \\"conspiracies\\" and how sometimes problems can be solved with large powerful handguns all in one book?Fabulous fantasy adventures with realistic, not rehashed, characters. Tales of gritty intergalactic warfare and mystery. All the while exuding a cutting and witty repartee' that would make Dumas (of \\"The Three Musketeers\\" fame) proud...Buy the book! You won't be sorry you did!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T SPEND MONEY ON THIS","review":"I don't know why they put this poor quality stuff on the market, the quality is so poor it is hard to listen to. It is hard to hear the instruments or vocals what a rip off!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money","review":"If you are expecting some guidance on the art of standup comedy, this video is not for you. Instead of attempting to teach some basics of comedy, it wastes its (and your) time with a cute little movie about a new commedienne and her first stage performance. They could have used this format to compare her performance with more polished ones and teach something but they don't and the other comics they show are neither better nor different than she is. (...)"},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the best from innovative, yet underrated, trumpeter","review":"Underrated jazz trumpeter plays in a quiet mode, demonstrating his own technique of Ahkreanvention\\"--a creation of simultaneous jazz improvisation and composition. The end effect is more meditative than fiery, but not boring. Three long tunes make ample use of space and silence. Included in the band are Dwight Andrews (reeds) and Bobby Naughton (vibes); guests include Charlie Haden (bass), and both Lester Bowie and Kenny Wheeler who team up with Smith on \\"Tastalun\\" for three muted trumpets. Smith, now known as Wadada Leo Smith, sounds similar to trumpeter Bill Dixon and a contemplative Miles Davis. This album, from 1978, is difficult to find, but worth the search. I also recommend \\"Go in Numbers\\" (1980) and \\"Touch the Earth\\" (1979). A good recent effort is \\"Tao-Njia (1995)."},{"rating":"2","title":"nomnom","review":"got my book on time, in great condition. Great read, I'd highly recommend for anyone who's getting into Nietzsche, the editors does an excellent job of breaking down his thought and I guess you could say almost spoon feeding it to you but still, for this material and its difficulty, that's not such a bad thing. So far from what I can tell, I'd say the editors are about the best Nietzsche scholars ive seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning","review":"This book should come with a warning.

These clamps are known as lap joints and I ordered but joint connectors. They would not work in my application and had to be returned. Not sure if the error was the fault of the seller or mfg but they were worthless to me. The seller would not give me a refund and only offered me an exchange. I'm still waiting and needless to say my exhaust rebuild is on hold due to the time they are taking and the fact they won't refund. I have this sinking feeling that I'm going to get the same \\"wrong\\" clamps when they finally send the replacement parts. Avoid these clamps and this seller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't do it","review":"I wish I'd have seen the last guy's review, I wouldn't have bought this.

Were these selections recorded on a gramophone, or what? There are a million recordings of each of these pieces that are so much better than the way they're presented here. There's no real sense of musicality at all; each piece sounds about as exciting as staring at the printed music would be. I'd be ashamed to use this CD to indoctrinate my friends to Mozart. If you want Mozart in all his lush greatness, go buy a CD by the ASMF, or the VPO, or reputable orchestras. But for Pete's sake, skip this one at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"This CD isn't too great.","review":"I've heard the official soundtrack from the movie \\"Amadeus\\" and it's a million times better than this one.

None of these recordings compare to the quality recordings on the \\"Amadeus\\" soundtrack and I would not recommend this recording."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Phenomenal Soundtrack","review":"This is my all-time favorite soundtrack. I find it to be great inspirational music if I'm working on a project such as writing or drawing. It is a great sampling of Mozart's work. The piano parts are especially beautiful to me. I can't say enough to praise this soundtrack."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor transfers","review":"The reason for the wide discrepancy in reviews for this cd: several distinguished performances, but the sound on most tracks is very primitive. This is due to the digitalization process used: AAD. Nowadays, this almost never occurs; pre-digital recordings are digitally remastered, and designated as ADD. AAD cd's are carelessly transferred, and sound much worse than the original LP-intended records--tubby, ill-balanced, strange overtones, uneven volumes, raw and overblown. This early practice caused many to believe that cd could not reproduce sound comparable to vinyl.CBS/Sony should be ashamed to present these performances in such poor sound, when a modern remastering could easily have been done. Szell, Walter, Casadesus and others would never have approved such shoddy releases, but they are long gone, and their artistic legacies are here trashed. This disc is a slap in the face to some of the finest performing musicians of the 20th century."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of your money","review":"Amaturish not worth your time and money.Long boring and nothing you can't get from any fitness book costing much less."},{"rating":"2","title":"JOHN MAKES IT SIMPLE AND EASY","review":"WHAT I LIKED ABOUT THIS DVD WAS THAT IT WAS AFFORDABLE, PLUS JOHN MAKES THE INFORMATION VERY SIMPLY FOR THOSE WISHING TO SEE PROGRESS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Knife","review":"Bought this knife to add to the collection.

Shame on you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful and brilliantly written","review":"'East of Midnight' is quite an underestimated book, but when I first saw it on my cousin's bookshelf I knew it was special. It presents concepts and ideas little thought of in any time or place, even fancifully, and in a manner which draws you in with the reality of it all. Beautifully contrived with a flowing plotline, 'East of Midnight' is a book you'll want to read from start to finish. I was, in fact, nearly run over by a car at the airport in a rather stupid attempt to cross the street with my head buried in the book. Be careful not to let this happen to you, as anyone who reads it is liable to fall under the book's woven word tapestry of a spell and do some fairly unintelligent things with their head stuck in the clouds. The concepts in the book are thoughtful and mature, but the book itself is an easy read. I recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wrong Image","review":"The wrong image is shown.

If you've got a voltage regulator like I do, or a UPS that has the same funny outlets, this is the solution you've been looking for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tanika is right on!!!","review":"This could very well be the worse movie ever made. The writing is grade school at best and all the Black characters are over-sexed and mindless. The white character however, is the most rational one. Now there's a surprise. It's interesting how Black people have finally accepted decades upon decades of stereotypes and now regurgitate them for a buck. This movie makes 'Soul Plane' look like a masterpiece. Okay, maybe not, but just the same, bypass this film and read 'The Challenge of Blackness' by Lerone Bennett.

Not only creative in its concept of re-invented Muses, which are delightfully applicable to modern-day creativity obstacles, this book sparkles with an uplifting feeling.I use this book all the time as a creativity coach and artist. Each time I reread portions of the book, I find more Muse exercises that compel me to put the book down to actually do them, because they are so unusual, fun, and effective. I frequently do the \\"Frugal Extravagance\\" exercise to create options to replenish my artist spirit.Want more compassion and patience with your own creative being as you run through multiple Ahas about the creative process? You will find it all here..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastico!","review":"With the world of business finally coming around to the understanding that true profits come from creatively solving problems and providing unique and interesting solutions - many of us are stuck in corporate vacuum trying to get out of the box (or bag). This clever little shot-of-brilliance-in-a-book is just what so many need to unplug and play with our naturally creative selves. Badonsky provides so many unlocking exercises you can't help but to regain your creative self.With witty merriment, gentle coaxing, laugh-out-loud and super-keen intellect, The Muses put you on a path to pulling out your own gems of genius - almost regardless if you want it or not! Dash cunning the way she sneaks around your 'blockage' in whatever form you may think you have it.

I LOVED the Artist's Way but could not justifiably compare this to that."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Book Worth Reading","review":"Despite the catchy title and Badonsky's sense of humor, this book is far from fluff. Because I make my living as a writer, paying rent and buying groceries depend on being able to tap into my creativity every day. Some days are more difficult than others. Some days, if I didn't laugh, I'd cry. This book helped me to lighten up and allow my creativity to flow, rather than trying to force it out of of myself. I loved Arnold, the bodyguard. He reminded me that my tender, young ideas do need protection. I recommend this book to others who create professionally as well as those who are exploring creativity as a way of self expression."},{"rating":"1","title":"Marc Almond with Gypsy Band and Performing Bears","review":"As they say, Marc bought an apartment in Moscow so he really could be in the very heart of Russia.Unfortunately, that didn't help him - there is no grace in this album. It's much closer to trained performing bears and gypsies than to real spirit of russian music. In some songs Marc sings russian, but his accent is awful and he is dubbed by gypsy band members. Sometimes one russian guy sings very similar to Marc (making an impression he is Marc) but it's so plastic and fake I could barely stand it.In my opinion, Guinness World Records person should be ashamed of making such steps on his way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent mountaineering scenes","review":"Hijacked and subsequently downed RAF plane on NATO test flight crashes on top of a hitherto unscaled mountain peak on the Turkish-Russian border.The West and the Russians send teams to get to the plane first.

This book helped make a lot of sense out of the chaos surrounding our hospital. And, I recognized some of the people we helped by the description of the battle and some of their injuries. The Battle for Saigon fills in a major void in the history of the that event. Most histories I have seen present the Tet Offensive for the Saigon area primarily as the battle around the U.S. Embassy, and then move north to Hue. For those of us in the middle of the conflict, the fighting around Saigon continued many days after the Embassy events. While we may not have been as newsworthy as the Embassy folks, we were there and very involved. And Keith Nolan's writing shows this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nolan does justice to the brave airmen of Tan Son Nhut","review":"This book gives credit to the men of the 377th Security Police Squadron for an incedible defense of Tan Son Nhut Air Base.

Taken for what it is, a musical experiment by two very young song writers, The Likes Of Us is very promising and absolutely fascinating.The witty narration added to this performance (unfortunately not separately tracked) clearly points out the show's weaknesses.

The additional \\"best\\" lists were also helpful. The book is very light and thin, making it convenient to take with you. I would definitely buy the equivalent book for visiting any big city that was new to me. Although it was well worth the price, it is also too light on content to be the only guidebook and it didn't provide the accurate detail necessary to get the most out of the places recommended.The map that was included was fine and detailed, but the ones the hotels give away that include markings of the sights was more useful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Splendid!","review":"This disc is splendid - the works are colorful, the performances, by the first - rate Cincinnatti Symphony, are scintillating and of the highest quality. The Debussy is both gorgeous and stunning - and Debussy is followed by all of the Turina works that are unfamiliar but oh so enchanting in their Spanish exoticity. Turina's orchestral works should be heard more often! Just about anyone would love this disc, as Spanish - flavored music is very appealing. Telarc produces some of the best sounding discs around - this one has exceptionally fine quality sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good all round","review":"You might not want to hear the music very often, - though in fact its great fun, with the slow movement of the Sinfonia Sevillana being quite lovely, but you will want to hear the sound, which is gorgeous, if a little drily analytical in DSD fashion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Japanese Taiko Drumming","review":"This is a band that peforms at Epcot in Disney World frequently. Having seen their show, I purchased this CD, which is one of a number of their CDS they sell there. The live show is almost exclusively drumming with an occassional flute and is excellent.This CD has a larger group with more instruments and it takes a little away from the drumming at times but still this is a very nice CD for fans of drumming in general and Japanese taiko drumming in particular."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie!","review":"This movie is probably one of the best period romances that I have watched...and I've watched alot! The wonderful costumes, and great acting, make this a wonderful addition to any one who loves period romances. A must see for any one who appreciates period romances!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong aspect ratio","review":"As several authors of one-star reviews of this DVD note, the images displayed on the screen from the DVD are distorted and elongated. This is because Middlemarch was filmed with an aspect ratio of 1.78:1 (16:9, as printed on the DVD case) but was apparently compressed (rather than cropped) to an aspect ratio of 1.33:1 for the DVD, to fit standard TV screens. The only other time I've seen such distortion was in a theater where a Cinemascope film was projected with the wrong lens. If this distortion was a deliberate choice by whoever did the transfer, did they think that nobody would notice?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing after all the raves...","review":"I loved the book and had high hopes for this critically-acclaimed Masterpiece Theatre movie, but...Very little of Eliot's humor is present. Much of the casting is poor, esp. Mary Garth, her familiy, Fred and Rosamond."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Film","review":"I had rented this film once and did not complete it. I decided to purchased it from Amazon and so glad I did. It is a fully well made film and the story is full of interesting characters, though I did not care to much for the finale. I will buy all your period films since I am a great lover of BBC and England. Thanks"},{"rating":"2","title":"Middlemarch","review":"This film is entertaining, although slow-moving throughout most of it. It gives an engaging view of England during an age of new ideas and middle class asserting itself into government. The characters are cast fairly well, though the romantic relationships are not very compelling or satisfying. It is worth the money if you're truly into English 19th century film genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great film, horrible DVD transfer","review":"Do not waste your money on this DVD - the distortion will make you dizzy. What a shame that such a great PBS production was so horribly reproduced: my years-old VHS taped from TV is of far better quality than this DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"unforgetable","review":"I haven't bought these tapes yet, but I've never forgotten Middlemarch since it was aired on PBS in 1994. I couldn't believe how I got hooked on waiting for the next one each week (and I missed three, so I've got alot to look forward to ;). Up 'til then, I'd always thought those PBS specials were just glorified soap operas (though I had enjoyed some of \\"I, Claudius\\"). But every once-in-awhile, over the years, I've vaguely remembered it and today thought, ''hey, I wonder if I can find that PBS thing on tape.'' I couldn't even remember the name. So I went to the PBS web site and hunted it down. When I saw the words ''Dorothea,'' it all came back to me. I wish I could be more specific as to why I liked it so much... I think I fell in love with Dorothea ;). Anyway, I can't wait to finally watch all of it. I hate it when PBS does something this good. Tax money used to fund PBS is unConstitutional."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my thing....","review":"I normally enjoy period dramas but I found this mini-series to be tedious. Particularly Dorothea...She is such a martyr!! Boring! She seems to want to suffer and the viewer is forced to watch as she shacks up with an old fuddy duddy who treats her badly. Whoopee, I'm having fun now. The doctor's wife is not much better.... He marries an insipid shopaholic who spends his money and treats him poorly.I guess I wanted the series to be about characters I actually LIKED. These people were all sad sacks. 2 stars. Not my thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Muy buena adaptación del libro de George Eliot: los cambios que experimentan los personajes, la representación de la época con sus discusiones políticas y religiosas, muy cuidada y bien actuada. Especialmente quienes interpretan a Dorothea, Casaboun, Lydgate and Rosamond."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waiting Eagerly for this DVD to Arrive, Only to be Disappointed with it!!!","review":"Reading all the great reviews on this production I thought this purchase would be worth it.When viewing Middlemarch one can see that BBC spend alot of money making this. The customes are beautiful and the acting is great but one element of this well made production that spoiled it. The passionate sences between the town's new doctor and his beautiful wife.Rent Middlemarch before buying it would be my recommendation.This BBC production has nothing on other BBC productions.Bring on North and South, Pride and Prejudice, Wives and Daughters,Bleak House (2005) David Copperfield (1999) and Our Mutual Friend.Now those are worth your time and worth being added to your collection!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unwatchable","review":"The story might have been compelling, but the blurry, out-of-focus, crummy transfer made it unwatchable. After 10 minutes I felt as if I had on a pair of someone else's prescription lenses. Avoid a migraine - read the book instead!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing","review":"I usually enjoy period dramas/romances, but this one just dragged on. I kept waiting for the characters' lives to rise above all the sadness, but they did not. There was little plot, and not even a happy ending to make it bearable. I bought it based on positive reviews, but wish I had saved my money."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT !!!","review":"I THOROUGHLY ENJOY ALL THE BBC MOVIES AND SERIES. THIS WAS NO EXCEPTION.

The actors are wonderful and they tell this story in a way where you get to know the characters really well. I did wish the widow to end up with a different gentleman in the end, but oh well! The female characters are beautiful and give wonderful performances as do the men. I recommend this one for sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible transfer to DVD","review":"As much as I love and admire El Greco, I don't prefer movies with elongated men and women in every scene. I am giving this one star because the transfer to DVD is so awful. It is really distracting to watch as everything is narrowed and elongated. The result is that it looks as if what you are seeing as been stretched and turned slightly to the side so that nothing is realistically proportioned. I could only watch about fifteen minutes of the movie before having to turn it off. I am sure it is a wonderful movie with great acting, but I won't be able to tell until I watch the VHS version, I suppose."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dumbing down of Eliot's masterpiece.","review":"Does away with most of the social issues, including the growth of the merchantile class and cross-class marriage. Poor casting/poor scripting of Rosamund and Fred Vincy and Mary Garth (Eliot's Mary doesn't speak with a working class accent, but Andrew Davies' (scriptwriter) does) and family. I may be picking nits, but this movie turns a very intelligent novel into a simple romance.And there's none of Eliot's witty humor!!Read the book instead..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great show-excellent story line","review":"This is one DVD my husband and I devoured. SO many plots and story lines all intertwined to make a great storyline. I have just purchased the book as I liked the movie so much.I gave it four stars. I would have given it five if it had a few less swear words. They were mild, but I really enjoy watching shows such as \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" which keep crass language to a minimum. It is not as bad, however, as Vanity Fair. THe musical score was great which is something I always enjoy in these BBC shows, and something in which I was greatly dissappointed in \\"Vanity Fair.\\"This really is a captivating story and a well done program. Great price as well for the number of hours of enjoyable television."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good miniseries, horrible transfer","review":"The dvd transfer is absolutely horrible. I received two copies, one a replacement, and both were very poor transfers. On side B, the transfer became even worse. Also, the dvd is supposed to be widescreen, my two copies were full frame. Do not buy this dvd unless you are assured that the distributor has fixed the problem. Amazon was very understanding about the problem and allowed me to return both copies. However, they cannot guarantee the dvd quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Faithful to the Book","review":"I had finished reading Middlemarch not long before this adaptation was shown on television, so the story and characters were fresh in my mind. I was so impressed with how faithful the movie is to the book. Even the actors looked exactly how I pictured the characters in my imagination, which almost never happens.But, if you are a high school or college student and have to write a paper on Middlemarch, please don't watch the movie instead of reading the book! The movie may be great, but the book is always better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous, moving, worthy....","review":"I read Middlemarch 5 times in college, and did a thesis thereon. This dvd was a humbling experience, for it showed that, while I grasped the thought of this masterpiece, the beauty of it entirely passed me by (ah well, that was 40 years ago...so perhaps absolution is possible). One misses only Eliot's elegant sentences but, surely, for that one must return to hard copy which, all these decades later, I certainly plan to do."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of George Eliot","review":"This is a very, very good movie of her best writings, from our view. We first watched it, and purchased a VHS copy for our home in England. The last paragraph of the book sums it up well, and has been a theme of many of my speaches. It made me want to be a better person. As with most period movies, Americans must understand England and the British to appreciate it. Highly recommended reading, and the movie is as good as any could be from such an incredible book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ho hum, boring alert!","review":"If you want to see suffering, on top of boring, on top of martyrdom without doing much good - this movie's for you. If you're otherwise looking for entertainment, then look elsewhere because all this movie will do is to waste your valuable time and regret ever having bought this movie in the first place."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst BBC Production I've Seen","review":"I tried 4 times to watch this movie and when I finally made it through it, I felt as though I had wasted my time. This has got to be the worst BBC production I have ever seen; and I am very fond of BBC. The story dragged on and on. It jumped around too much. The plot was almost non existent. There were too many characters that seem to be of no importance. I won't go on, even though I could. Save your time, don't even bother to watch this movie. It looked like it had promise but when I finally got to the end I discovered, I was wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible movie","review":"Couldn't wait to be over. Characters are ridiculous and frankly, repulsive excuses for human beings. I hoped it developed the love story of the two main characters better and not wasted the majority of the film with the rest of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stop the Madness","review":"This has got to be the slowest movie I've ever seen. I love period pieces, but this is not worth it. Don't waste your money. The plot is .....well there wasn't a plot. It was the most depressing movie I've ever seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"the litmus test for a movie adapted from a book is whether it makes you want to read the book. this film fails that test. the book may not be to blame for this - i've seen enough poor adaptations to know this. but the film was, quite frankly, boring. i've never read george eliot, and middlemarch won't change that."},{"rating":"1","title":"In the middle.....of potential satisfaction","review":"I've heard that this version of this period piece is top-notch; based on these reviews, I'd love to have the DVD, but it does not offer English sub-titles, so that lets me out. Too bad; another sale lost!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wha??","review":"Frankly haven't read the book all the way through yet, and Cassavetes is genuinely important---but to suggest in the sub-title that Cassavetes \\"invented\\" independent film is a bit like saying Edison invented light--and more than a little insulting to those pioneers who actually DID \\"invent\\" independent film: Maya Deren, Kenneth Anger, Stan Brakhage, Harry Smith, etc. (and before that, the mainstream renegades who did incredible work even within a very constrained studio system: Carl Dryer, Orson Welles, F.W. Murnau, Fritz Lang, Sergei Eisenstein, etc)Just sayin'..."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Biography Under the Influence","review":"Beware any book featuring an outright lie on its cover!John Cassavetes did NOT invent the American Independent Film -- nor did he ever claim to. He was open about being influenced by predecessors such as Ruth Orkin and Morris Engel, among others. \\"Accidental Genius\\" is full of many other questionable interpretations of events, along with plenty of unnecessary gossip. Yet another lame attempt at rewriting cinema history (a la the 'books' of Sharon Waxman and Peter Biskind).John Cassavetes deserves better: I'd recommend reading \\"Cassavetes on Cassavetes\\" over this hogwash."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Miramax fairy tale","review":"Since it was published by Miramax and approved by Gena Rowlands, you can imagine the finished product.

However,it occasionally \\"resets\\" and looses its calibration. This seems to happen more often when the room is cooler but is not limited to those conditions. When it acts up, I have to turn it off, back on and re-do the calibration. It is a bit of a hassle if I am weighing a bunch of charges. When it is not acting up it seems quite accurate. The scale pan that was included was to shallow to prevent powder from bouncing out when tricked in from just a few cm away. It does provide a multitude of units like grams, grains, Oz. that make it useful for several tasks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap, but doesn't last.","review":"I purchased one of these about a year ago for measuring powder for reloading. I found it easy to use and reasonably accurate (.01Gr) and anticipated several years of use. Unfortunately as I worked my way into the second year of use the scale simply went off the deep end. There were many \\"ERR\\" screens and it wouldn't hold a measuring mode (grain vs gram) so had to go into the trash.

Issues that children of this age face (such as: \\"Why go to church?\\" \\"Why are there different churches?\\" and \\"Why should I get involved?\\") are dealt with lovingly and biblically. I particularly liked the way the author dealt with the issue of denominations. Many adults will gain a new perspective of their own beliefs after reading this book. From the basics of Christianity, to church history, and even into cults, this book dares to answer the challenging questions that children often ask. I consider this book and the others in this series to be of vital importance to parents and church workers who wish to help children in their spiritual growth.

The diagrams are wonderful and often help people visualize very complex tax transactions. I also think the book does an excellent job of explaining very difficult material. Other reveiws have indicated that there are erros in this book. It does appear that there is a typo in the Clark case, but I have not noticed more than the usual number of typos in this book. In addition, contrary to the statements of other reviewers, I think the discussion of both Glenshaw Glass (I am not sure what is laughable about the book's presentation of the holding in the case) and Harris are on target.My advice is buy the book if you want some added help with Federal Income Tax, but use it as a reference, not as a bible. Also realize that Tax Professors often disagree about tax law, and about the merits of various cases, that is what makes law fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy!","review":"The \\"holdings\\" and facts in this hornbook are wrong.

Lastly, it's a compilation of case studies of various countries that have recently implemented or changed their political system.The committee of authors does a commendable job of steering a neutral course between the competing types of electoral systems, while stressing that some systems work better than others depending on the relevant circumstances and objectives.

It's like a family tradition. Having said that, you can understand how listening to the soundtrack allows the movie to play inside my head.Every theme is here in its complete form. None of the tracks feel truncated or compacted. At $7 bucks, this is a steal for fans of the movie. If you haven't seen the movie (you really ought to!) you'll still enjoy one of Williams' few playful-but-dramatic scores out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Williams is brilliant!","review":"Rarely does a family holiday film impress an audience more than John Hughes' Home Alone. And it was sheer inspiration to bring the Academy Award-winning John Williams and Leslie Bricusse together for the soundtrack. With a style reminiscent of your standard classical scherzo (a musical joke), Williams' score lends incalculable support to a film packed with one comedy-action sequence after another. Even when the dust settles, a pervading musical giggle forces you to wonder what's next.But, interspersed among the prestos and allegrettos, Williams waxes eloquent as the music touchingly slows to underscore Kevin's (Macaulay Culkin) longing for peace amid the Christmas chaos about him. A children's choir reflects Kevin's emotions as they sing Bricusse's classically-styled lyrics. A few popular vocals also sweeten the disc. With the likes of Mel Torme and The Drifters, the entire album is a symphony of holiday impressions, from the sublime to the sinister, and everything in between."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"Great soundtrack. Quality cd. Here are my eleven more words required to fulfill this space, which is quite ridiculous, yes?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Should be in every Christmas music lover's collection.","review":"What most people remember about the movie HOME ALONE is the slapstick comedy. Funny stuff to be sure but what made the film work so well was it's underlying drama. Director John Hughes set the story during the Christmas season to further exploit the drama of being seperated from your loved ones. For all the antics involved, HOME ALONE is first and foremost a Christmas movie. This setting gave composer John Williams the chance to write some of his most charming and festive music ever. The score is built upon William's lovely \\"Somewhere In My Memory\\" (lyrics by Leslie Bricusse) which was given a deserved oscar nomination. Here is a song that is a contemporary Christmas classic and should be a perrenial favorite. Here is an album that should be under every soundtrack and Christmas music lover's tree. It's one gift that is guaranteed to give years of enjoyment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost perfect","review":"John Williams is by far my favorite composer in Hollywood and I really did enjoy this movie. So I guess I am basically as biased as one can get! I apologize in advance for that. This score is one of the great holiday scores of all time. The score is beautiful with moments of playfulness, surprise, and even a little creepiness (the opening little music box figure). However, I think it is absolutely necessary to comment on the songs on this album. I am not talking about the standard Christmas songs, although they do put you back into the movie when listening to them. I am referring to Williams' two masterpieces \\"Star of Bethlehem\\" and \\"Somewhere in my Memory.\\" These are easily two of Williams' best songs and they both capture Christmas perfectly in their own unique way. This score has too much great music to be overlooked."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Christmas Must","review":"A fun blend of vocal/instrumental Christmas music. I have had it for several years, and have never grown tired of it.The vocal selections are some of my favorites. From the do-op version of White Christmas, to Mel Torme's smooth vocals on Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas; I find myself singing along to all of them.There are several instrumental tracks that aren't necessary Christmas songs.

Military archivist Robin Rielly's Mighty Midgets At War: The Saga of the LCS(L) Ships From Iwo Jima To Vietnam is a vividly recounted chronicle history of these ships and the men who sailed them. We are also treated to the life history of some of these ships from their creation through their eventual retirement or sale to the fleets of other nations. The informative, engaging text is enhanced with more than one hundred period photos and illustrations. Mighty Midgets At War is a superlative contribution to military studies reading lists and history collections."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book for wedding photographers at all levels.","review":"In the first section of the book Ann Monteith gives the nuts and bolts for putting together a wedding photography buisness. The second section features 30 Top International Wedding Photographers. I was honored to be included by Ann. Photographs and inner thoughts are shared from the chosen photographers."},{"rating":"2","title":"The PERFECT soundtrack!","review":"I loved the movie and the soundtrack was just as good! We listened to this all of December, all of the songs you want are on this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"my new favorite","review":"This is my new favorite Christmas cd. I have played it to the point of driving my family crazy. Very upbeat, fun to bee-bop around to while decorating and making cookies! A swing Christmas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elfing Great!","review":"Thank you Amazon for pressuring me to download this. It was enjoyable while I baked Christmas cookies! I recommend it if you like jazz or loved Elf!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Give this girl a record deal!!!!!","review":"I am giving this CD a 4 only because I haven't bought it - yet. I am going to get this CD just to get the song \\"Baby It's Cold Outside.\\" I heard this song on my local radio station and immediately fell in love with the song and its cute flirtateous vibe. I had to know who the female singer was because her voice is AWESOME!!! I love this kind of music and was stunned that it was Zooey Deschanel. All I can say is WOW!! This girl has another talent that needs to be showcased. If anyone is out there from record labels, Zooey needs to be in the business. I am very excited to get the Elf CD but am disappointed she doesn't have her own CD. I must go now to get the CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good X-mas CD to add to your collection","review":"This CD is worth it (at DEC 2007 Amazon price) just for Leon Redbone and Zooey Deschanel's rendition of \\"Baby, It's Cold Outside\\". Deschanel's voice made this version a new Christmas favorite in my household. The CD as a whole is good enough to hold its own as a key album in your holiday music, but just shy of being \\"the one Christmas CD you gotta have\\".Would like to hear more from Deschanel and that bluesy (sp?) voice."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Way to Spread Christmas Cheer....","review":"The best way to spread Christmas cheer is singing loud for all to hear! This CD truly sings. A unique mix of Christmas songs (and a few worthy non-Christmasers) for those who enjoyed the movie, or are fans of Chirstmas music. Standout tracks include track 5, Baby It's Cold Outside, and track 1, Pennies From Heaven. So spread some Christmas cheer--sing-along to these songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Delight","review":"The only problem with this CD is that track #8 is identified as \\"Christmas Island\\" by Leon Redbone when it is actually \\"That Old Christmas Moon\\" from a CD by Leon called Christmas Island. Aside from that miscue by New Line Records this CD will sure to be a favorite for many years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yea! Leon Redbone is back!","review":"Many years ago a friend gave me what he called \\"The best christmas CD ever\\" It was Leon Redbone's \\"Christmas Island\\". It WAS the best Christmas CD. Until now. Zooey and Leons's version of \\"Baby it's cold outside\\" on the \\"Elf\\" sound track is breathtaking. Toss in a few other Christmas and non-Christmas classics and you have, \\"Elf\\" The NEW best Christmas CD ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elf CD","review":"The CD is wonderful - everything I expected and more. I particulary liked Leon Redbone and there are more than one songs by him on there. I particulary bought the CD for his version of \\"Baby It's Cold Outside\\" and was pleased to find other songs by him on there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the soundtrack","review":"If you watched the movie and liked the music and thought you'd like the 'soundtrack' beware, these are not the same tracks as from the film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie-Great CD","review":"As I listen to the CD I can picture the movie and it makes me laugh. Great movie-Great CD! I'd recommend for all Buddy the Elf fans!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Song Missing.","review":"This album is great and keeps the christmas spirit alive. The song that is playing when they run into Gimble's and jump on the bed, is \\"What Christmas Means To Me\\" - Stevie Wonder. Just letting anyone else know what it is so they don't go crazy looking Like I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fresh and fabulous!","review":"Zooey Deschanel & Leon Redbone give us the best new holiday tune in a very long time. Perfectly paired on \\"Baby it's Cold Outside\\". An absolute gem of a rendition. The rest of the CD is certainly a worthwhile collection...Eartha Kitt, Lena Horne, Ella Fitgerald and especially Louis Prima.Went to see the movie and immediately bought the soundtrack. Not at all disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"Awesome. Loved it. Listening to this soundtrack was a wonderful way to celebrate the winter season and the holidays this past year.

The song is You Make Me Feel So Young."},{"rating":"2","title":"PERFECT HOLIDAY GIFT!!!!","review":"The best holiday music compilation in a long, long time. Listen to the Zooey/Leon track. Holy Cow, her voice is breathtaking!"},{"rating":"1","title":"monotone tome","review":"a disbarred lawyer and his delinquent son are both acccused of the same murder.the protagonist's quiet determination is rendered in a tediously depressing and nearly emotionless tone and the pacing is ploddingly big booted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bye Bye Potter","review":"Fellow children, say goodbye to Harry Potter. Not Proven has skyrocketed to the pinnacle of the mystery genre. Not only has this book dominated lists such as the New York Times bestseller list, but it has touched the hearts of the 'lawyer' in all of us. I give Woody Hanstein a 5 for creativity and originallity."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best Live DVD's!","review":"I am a huge fan of meshuggah and i love this dvd cd combo. The album is top notch with a full list of great meshuggah songs, and great quality to boot.The DVD seems a bit on the quieter side but turn up the volume a little and you will feel like your right there with them! The DVD is not as crystal clear and epic as any of the Nine Inch Nails DVD's, but for metal it sits pretty close to the top of the list.BUY NOW!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A fine ADD disc . . .","review":"This is a first-rate Sony bargain release featuring the best-known organ works by Bach. This ADD recording has held up fairly well, considering some of the recordings date to 1960. Bigg's organ skills are amazing, and his interpretation of these works fantastic.The remastering of these recordings is pretty good, if not great (I can still hear more background hiss than I'd prefer). I would have given this recording 5 stars had the disc's remastering matched the results typically achieved by Philips or Deutsche Grammophon. Background noise aside (and again, it's minimal), this is a great disc. And at a great price, I'd highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost Bond","review":"Good show that we tried not to miss when it aired. While there were a lot of shows with similar story lines, Brosnan was someone new who was always trying to get over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Remington Steele Season 1","review":"We enjoyed the series immensly and are waiting to see the season three as soon as it comes out.p.s. we already have season two."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's About Time","review":"They are finally putting this out. I love the show and wanted them to put it on DVD for soooooo long. I have tried contacted different companies for years and no one ever released it. Remington Steele is one of the best shows out there and I love the comedy that is the suave, Pierce Brosnan. This should have been released a long time ago and I can't wait for it to be July. I want this set and will snatch it up the moment it is out. Thank you to whoever had the brains to put this set out for obsessive people like me."},{"rating":"1","title":"A blast from the past","review":"From the cleverness of the plotlines, to the double entendres, to the anachronisms (the limousine has a car phone that can be dialed) the first season of Remminton Steele is a joy to relive. One of the parts of the 80's that should be brought back into style, and Pierce Brosnan oozes style out of every pore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great series","review":"The first season was the best and the only one I intend to buy. Brosnan and Zimbalist were the stars around whom the stories revolved, but the Murphy Michaels and Bernice Fox characters made it a great ensemble production. I hated to see them dropped in season 2 for Doris Roberts, whom I respect but didn't like in the series. She wasn't \\"in\\" on the secret as were Murphy and Bernice and her persistent cluenessness was not believable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cleverly done","review":"The pilot episode was cleverly done-explained how it all came to be. Zimbalist and Brosnan have a nice special manner with each other."},{"rating":"2","title":"Off To A Great Start...","review":"This Show Was A Terrific Mystery Show With A Touch Of Class & Humor!!! Both Leads Are Wonderful The Co Stars Are Also Very Good, I Had Not Seen Many Of These Shows When The Series Aired But Have Enjoyed Watching Them Now!!! The Show Got Off To A Great Start!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"and the white VW rabbit convertible too...","review":"YES : )the only detective show with spectacular plots, excellent writing, better that average cinematography- sincere/relatable characters. Stephanie's acting in decadent (Laura Holt) and this is Pierce Bronson's (Remington Steele) finest dynamic role to date. I must have set to those who enjoy a believable mystery, episode and episode again.. as for the lack of Stephanie on the cover, i guess newcomers to the series will just have to stumble onto her character like we all did at first... that's corporate marketing advertising for you, but all these reviews make up for it, WE ALL love the character Laura holt, and Stephanie could not be surpassed in her delivery!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Television","review":"The first season of Remington Steele was classic television in my opinion, far superior to the series' subsequent years. Its ratings were dismal that first year, and I imagine that there are many who remember the show well, but who have never seen these episodes.Perhaps the presence of Glenn Caron as Executive Producer was the major reason for the show's excellence, because when he left to start up Moonlighting, Remington Steele was never the same.I fell in love with Laura Holt in 1982, and I've fallen in love with her all over again today! I particularly enjoy the gag about such a strong young woman being unable to deal with her mother (played perfectly by Beverly Garland).I've enjoyed Stephanie Zimbalist in other things, but this is her finest television work in my view. And it doesn't hurt that she was gorgeous!"},{"rating":"2","title":"what can I say?","review":"What can I say? I grew up with this show. I am a fan of mystery shows/movies and enjoy A&E. While Poirot and Monk are funny, too, they are about those esoteric middle-aged bachelors. Steele is different. The fragrance of love and romance is filled throughout, and I personally believe this show has captured the prime years of Zimbalist and Broznan."},{"rating":"2","title":"steele going strong, steele the best","review":"I never knew what Pierce Brosnan did before James Bond. Now I know. This series is wonderful and is a must-have for anybody who likes mysteries, solving crimes, or enjoys detective shows. They don't make TV like this anymore. Go out and buy this as fast as you can. Chances are that your parents enjoyed it, and now you will too. If you like this series, then I also recommend \\"Monk\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't like double sided discs.","review":"A great show! However, I won't buy a set of double sided discs again. I've had too many problems in the past as far as the durability of these type dvds and I don't want the hassle.I'd rather do without them or buy when they come out with a single sided disc version if ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Remington Steele Season 1","review":"Never saw season 1 for some reason on TV.

So many little birds clammered into the feeder, that when something spooked them, and they all tried to get out at once, 3 of them broke there necks in the mad rush. That is NOT acceptable!We immediately took it down and trashed it.I'd rather put up with the squirrels than lose even ONE bird!This type of feeder should be OUTLAWED!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A squirrel got in it and died the first day!","review":"The first day I put this feeder out a squirrel got in but could not get out - somehow he slid into the cage.

I have the pictures to prove it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Duncraft Feeder","review":"This is the first year that my feeder hasn't been monopolized by a mob of grackles.

Some smaller squirrels try to latch on as well, usually unsuccessfully so. As a birdfeeder, this model works really well, is easy to refill, and looks attractive. However, the price tag is way too high.Thus 4 stars and not 5."},{"rating":"2","title":"1'st time for everything.","review":"In the beginning, Ms. kirk's book was harder to believe than a Hollywood fantasy but as you race towards finding out what happens you know the wildest things are possible and do happen.Pure Serendipity, and a wealth/health of succinct wisdom.Written for women but strong enough for a man. Suspend your doubts and read it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the best","review":"This is an injustice!

It works.Here's the bad news: It was NOT the product advertised. It is not a Tripp-Lite brand cable.It is not gold plated/pins. It was a cheap cable that came in a plain plastic baggie. Not even a manufacturer name.I wouldn't care if it were just advertised as null modem cable PERIOD. Then I wouldn't care. It was cheap and works. But It burns me when someone completely lies about what the're selling. Glad it wasn't an automobile I was purchasing.

And you don't have to use a lot, very sparingly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Bad, but not great","review":"This collection is better then the Ten Greatest series, due to the fact that it has more songs. However this CD pales in comparison to the Bear Family's Sixteen Tons or the Ultimate Collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hommage a Balenciaga","review":"This is a catalogue of the exhibition of the same name dedicated to Cristobal Balenciaga in 1985 in Lyon.

There are also sections about fabrics and accessoriesNB The text is in French."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitive Recordings!","review":"These are without a doubt the definitive recordings of Copland's work.

It's an excellent set that veers between pulse quickening melodic Beach Boys meets Velvet Underground songs, sweet and somewhat psychedelic gentle ones, and a slow burning hypnotic fuzz drenched song. Can't imagine this disappointing any fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I received this rug the other day-it rolls out nice and looks great.

I have had excellent medical care, tried alternative therapies, meditated, relaxed, prayed with faith, exercised, used vitamins, herbs, etc.etc.etc. I still live with daily pain and fatigue!! I didn't learn anything new from this book. I found its simplistic, repetitive style and subtly condescending tone to be unhelpful at best, and extremely discouraging at worst. I found the ephemeral \\"mindbodyspirit\\" connection to amount to a fancy way of saying \\"it's all in your head\\". The last thing fibromyalgics need is unsympathetic MDs telling us we can \\"cure ourselves\\"!!I'd like to see them walk a mile in our shoes. Try the book Fibromyalgia and Chronic Myofascial Pain Syndrome by Dr. Devin Starlanyl for a comprehensive understanding of fibromyalgia by a compassionate physician."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I feel I have wasted good money on this one. I am a strong believer in mind-body medicine, but the bits and pieces of boring information in primer form were a real turn off.The information in this book seems to have been copied almost straight from other sources.Try Jon Kabat-Zinn, Deepak Chopra, Emmet E. Miller, J. Sarno, Candace Pert, almost anybody else, for more inspiring reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your Money","review":"MindBodySpirit can be written all together like it's one word. Now you know what this book is about.If you really want to connect your mind, body, and spirit, try a yoga class.

That means it is his job to find reasons to deny disability to those who need it, thereby saving the retirement system money. (This retirement system is being investigated for misuse of funds.) I am one of their victims, my illness being labeled as \\"Somatization Disorder\\" despite the mounds of objective medical evidence of brain injury, etc. I provided. Thanks to Season, I now struggle to work just 20 hours per week and I cannot keep up on bills. All because he thinks that illnesses like Fibromyalgia, Chronic Fatigue Syndrome are all in the mind. He needs to look at the evidence - and, a little compassion wouldn't hurt either. I'm now destroyed financially with little means of support.

Luckily it snaps back into place. Also, in the beginning she did get frustrated with the seats/seatbelts - I don't blame her...Overall this toy is fun, we were probably just 1 of a few people who experienced the door problem.There is also a button for your child to push down in the car that'll play music. :)The grocery bag is adorable and so realistic, and the stroller is just right for the twins that go inside.I highly recommend for all daughters. :o)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great, but WAAAAY Overpriced!","review":"Great toy, my 4 year old neice loves it.

But not practical!","review":"My daughter loves the van but can rarely use it all alone! The doors pop off the babies fall out of their seats the stroller gets stuck on the roof rack (an elastic band) and the seat belts are just annoying! I can't even buckle them all up! Needless to say she still wants to play with it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Priceless","review":"My girls love this little SUV...I admit that it almost $30 was a little pricey, but the joy that they get when they play with it is priceless. The batteries last very long and the toy is very durable as my girls can be rough on toys, especially when playing outdoors. While the SUV has a working horn and radio, I personally find it a little difficult to get the figures in and out of the vehicle and it often frustrates them as well, which is my reason for 4 stars instead of 5. Nevertheless, my girls really do enjoy the SUV and its accessories--at times they even play with the vehicle without the house."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loving Family SUV is great fun","review":"My daughter and my niece love the Loving Family SUV.

Thanks, again for coming through with a specialty item."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Toy","review":"This car alone or in addition to the loving family dollhouse is wonderful. The car horn honks and the radio plays three different songs. When my daughter got this car she played with it for three days straight. The doll house babies and mom and dad fit nicely in the car and is a nice size. I would recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Little SUV for your dollhouse family!","review":"I was really excited to find this SUV for my daughter to go along with her Twin Time Dollhouse for Christmas last year. She loves it and plays with it a lot. This is a very cute and sturdy addition to the dollhouse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply awful!","review":"This album is terrible. A friend purchased this album and played it while driving me around one day - it was a very unpleasant experience. \\"Pour No Gasoline\\" was one of the worst songs I heard on the album - the song is very repetitive, the singer keeps yelling on and on about gasoline and Sasquatch, and the song makes no sense. (If you purchase this album and listen to it all the way through, you'll probably want to pour gasoline all over your copy of this album.)This band is only famous (and it's actually only slightly famous at best) because Dustin Diamond (Screech from tv's Saved By The Bell) is in the band. However, don't buy this album if you want to hear Screech sing - he's just the bass player."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible.","review":"This is probably some of the worst music I've ever had to endure. This album is precisely the kind of pretentious drivel you'd expect from a washed-up child actor such as Dustin \\"Screech\\" Diamond. Dustin, we demand that you cease and desist. Get your G.E.D. and find a job, because this is just devastating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Listen to it first before judging!","review":"Dustin Diamond (Screech from Saved by the Bell) came to the college here to do a comedy routine which was very good. He played some of his band music before he came out and promoted his group. I decided that I would buy a CD to support him, I was only one that did. It was my first Parental Advisory CD I have bought, but I do not regret it. I really like this CD! I think you all will like it too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Saharan about it","review":"I would have bought this in a heartbeat had the African music featured in the movie been prominently featured in this soundtrack. The rock is great stuff, but I can get it elsewhere. The music that anchored the movie to its location (which location the director captured wonderfully without detracting from the plot) was the regional, ethnically based vocals and instrumentals. What a shame I can't get them on CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Argh!","review":"I hate it when they release \\"inspired by\\" music! Very little of this CD was music actually from the movie! If you look closely at the cover you'll see the words, \\"Music from and inspired by...\\" This is not the CD Soundtrack from the movie, or at least only a couple of the songs are really from the movie and the rest in \\"inspired\\" by it!

This is not that CD from the cover and sample selection."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to the music from Africa?","review":"For a rock and roll album this has some good tunes but what brought me to look for the album was the great music with an african sound. There is only one cut with this beat. The producers missed a good opportunity to be unique."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing the African music?","review":"I personally was excited for the CD to come out but like many, was disappointed not to see any African artists highlighted considering it takes place in Africa. (I don't count the last song since it's not even credited to an African artist.)Although I didn't stay for the movie credits, I did recognize a few songs and can recommend a couple more Malian artists. Check out the following albums: \\"Niafunke\\" by Ali Farka Toure, \\"Sou Ni Tile\\" by Amadou & Mariam, \\"Baro\\" by Habib Koite, \\"Mouneissa\\" by Rokia Traore, \\"Moffou\\" by Salif Keita, and \\"Tassoumakan\\" by Issa Bagayogo. These are just a few of my favorites from Mali."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing the Point","review":"The excellent african tracks that were included in the credits at the end of the movie have been omitted from the soundtrack.

Four of these tunes are so common that they can be found on a billion other greatest hits CDs. While reading the inside notes, they state that 5 songs are \\"not contained in the film\\"!! OBVIOUSLY some kind of money grab recycling some classic rock tunes that you already have and then padding it with some extra songs that are not in the film!The only reason to buy this CD is to get the hard to find Dwight Twilley tune, \\"I'm On Fire\\", which has all the right elements to be a classic hit, but strangely not in rotation on classic rock stations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sahara is great fun !","review":"The directors did a great job of bringing Dirk Pitt to life in their first attempt with a Clive Cussler novel.

Since the book isn't about Lincoln's dreams, it's about Robert E. Lee's dreams, I can only surmise that some editor made the author change the name because people would be more likely to buy a book with the name Lincoln in the title. Strike one. Strike two is basing any story on the work of a researcher who spends his/her time in libraries looking up information in the indices of really old reference books. I'm a researcher myself and I find this excruciatingly boring, anyone else reading this stuff for page after page will probably just go catatonic. Strike three was when I couldn't figure out what happened at the end and really didn't care enough to go back and re-read to see what I missed. I never got invested in the characters and so I just closed it up and went on to my next read. You should, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"yikes!","review":"This book had a great premise but it was dull as dishwater and extremely hard to follow.

Sometimes you need a catharsis, and I find that by the end of this beautiful little book, I'm always crying. It explores some tough themes, specifically how people deal with loss, that Willis returns to again and again. In a lot of ways, I think this earlier book says everything she later says in _Passage_, in a leaner, more elegant way."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's happening here?","review":"I can't believe this book is written by the same author as Doomsday Book (which is one of the best books I have read in a long time). I kept slogging through Lincoln's Dreams, hoping that eventually it would make sense, but it never did enough to make the reading worthwhile. The civil war trivia was interesting, but the main characters had no depth and plot was just plain weird.

Lee's dreams so that he could get some rest beyond the grave seemed a bit silly.Don't get me wrong, I love most of Connie Willis' writing. I love that her writing style is so recognisable. She throws you into this world with barely an explanation, so it feels like you've entered halfway through a story, until you realize that there's still more than you expected. But the jump from \\"Annie's having vivid dreams from the perspective of Robert E. Lee\\" to \\"She must be having them because he can't rest in the afterlife\\" seems a bit stretched. Call me cynical. Maybe I missed something, but it's questionable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting concept, poor ending","review":"Connie Willis is one of my favorite authors. I adoredTo Say Nothing of the Dogand Passage, so was looking forward to this book. Unfortunately, it fell flat. You can see flashes of the elements that makePassagebrilliant (mixture of science and supernatural, dynamic personal relationships, etc.), but the follow through just isn't there. The ending would have worked if it had been a short story rather than a novel. As it is, however, it feels as though Willis wrote herself into a corner and couldn't quite make it out. It lacked resolution.Even though I consider myself a fan of Connie Willis, I could not in good conscience recommend this book. Definitely check out her other writings, but please leave this one on the shelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"TBFW (Too Beautiful For Words)","review":"Haunting, subtle (despite what others here might say), harrowing and heartbreaking, =Lincoln's Dreams= is one of the best books I've ever read.

Connie Willis knows exactly what she's doing. She makes you care deeply about the characters' fates.

In sporadic instances, a soldier divulges something profound, as if it was an accident, like a monkey at a keyboard accidentally pecking out lines from Shakespeare.

I watched it the other night with some of my war buddies. We all enjoyed it. I thought it captured the day-to-day life of young boots-on-the-ground soldiers. It tried not to politicize the war, except perhaps in some subtle negative ways. I feel the best reporting of this war was/is from imbedded reporters - those who decide to live with the soldiers they cover and accompany them on missions. Coversley, the worst is from reporters who hide in Baghdad hotels and read news releases and refuse to live with the troops they alledgedly are covering. We had a Washington Times reporter and photographer (both female) with us for over a month during my tour; they risked their lives in a war zone along with the rest of us (as apparently the documentary maker of this movie did) and thus provided an even-handed look at the G.I.s."},{"rating":"2","title":"A straight up look at US Troops in Iraq","review":"As a Television News Photographer, my mantra was to take the story, unfiltered as possible, into the livingrooms of the viewers. Michael Tucker has done that here with a soldiers eye view of what troops experience and feel everyday in Iraq.There is no pro or anti war spin here. This is the story of the soldier. They are on patrol. They are under fire. They worry about a possible roadside bomb. They patrol.And while they are doing that, they create rap songs describing what they see and feel. They relax and vent in ways that everyone back home does. Afterall, these are our friends, co-workers and neighbors.The minimal, almost emotionless narration adds to the truthfullness of this documentary. Supporting our troops is more than wearing a simple yellow, jingo laden magnet on your SUV. To truly understand and appreciate what they are doing, watch Gunner Palace."},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie kicks butt!","review":"I loved Gunner Palace! It's one of the best documentaries on the war on Iraq, if you ask me. I like the fact that it does not contain much of a political tone. What makes this documentary great is that it focuses on the lives of the individual soldiers that are actually there. It's a real eye opener. What they have to go through on a daily basis is gaw-dropping. I was also really impressed by the way Mike Tucker was able to follow them through many of their missions. That takes a lot of gutts!"},{"rating":"1","title":"potus does flotus","review":"as a general rule, if you are able to complain, then things are not too bad. these soldiers are emotionally arrested narcissism cases who seem to think that \\"I just pulled 2 hours of guard\\" is a legitimate gripe. The people in this movie seem to be very comfortable with incessant complaining and conceiving of the soldier as basically a new victim group who should have his or her share of the general liberal whining. No, I'm not in the military, I'm not a congressman or POTUS or FLOTUS but if you are able to stand around in front of a camera complaining about poor you then life isn't all that bad. However the black soldiers seem to have invented a new style of rap: whining victim rap. The combat's so heavy that they've got time to sit around carefully crafting their grievance lyrics. It doesn't seem to occur to them that the Army is not supposed to be some kind of public works project to keep them clothed and fed while they do nothing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major Disappointment","review":"This book is sure to disappoint the purchaser--even Parmigianino fans. The book's illustrations are a disappointment. First, it contains few close-up illustrations of Parmigianino's paintings' details. Close up illustrations would shed light on technical aspects of the master's works. The major works are represented, but one would expect a book this large from the Yale University Press to contain more in the way of illustrations. Second, the book skimps on illustrations of paintings by Parmigianino's contemporaries, successors and predecessors. To understand the painter's genius, one must view his paintings in context. Third, the plates themselves are of moderate quality.While Ekserdjian's text provides insights into Parmigianino's work, it fails to convey the importance of his stylistic innovation or his creative genius.Alas, the authoritative Parmigianino text has yet to be written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This book rounded out a spate of very poor internet purchases; I had only ever seen the Madonna with the Long Neck prior to this book, and quite looked forward to seeing more of Parmigianino's work. Part of the problem is with the work itself, which I thought was decidedly mediocre, with some unbelievably poor portraits of such off-hand execution as to make one wonder how any patron would have paid for them. However, the images are also slightly off-focus, and the book overall has a dark, depressing visual feel to it. Don't buy it unless you have actually flipped through a copy (and love Parmigianino - I certainly don't think he deserves the \\"one of the greatest genius's of the Renaissance\\" moniker)"},{"rating":"2","title":"These are kinda hard to drink from.

I eventually retired the mugs but kept the rest of the set :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing mug","review":"Nice, tall mug, but square in shape (even though product description does not specify so)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very heavy, not classic lightweight Corelle design","review":"These are very heavy, thick walled cups. If you are expecting the classic thin walled lightweight Corelle then you don't want these. Very heavy mugs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Film/Terrible DVD","review":"The BCI/Eclipse release of Karate Warriors is available at your local Family Dollar Store (for $1.00 +tax). But buyer beware! The video and audio transfer on this release is very, very poor: a fuzzy picture and a nearly inaudible soundtrack.The (all-too familiar) plot traces the mercenary Chiba pitting two rival gangs against one another. In the process he befriends a young boy whose father is an apt Samurai. Chiba's and the Samurai's paths eventually collide.Admittedly, there is some fine karate entertainment here. Also, Sonny shows a very believably gentle side to his character in his relation to the young boy. In fact, next to the first two Streetfighter episodes, this is probably my (third) favorite Sonny Chiba film.Too bad the DVD transfer is so pitiful--bordering on the intolerable, otherwise I would easily have given the film 4 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING KUNG-FU FLICK SAVED BY A DECENT SECOND HALF","review":"A KUNG-FU FIGHTER [SONNY CHIBA] BECOMES CAUGHT UP IN A GANG BETWEEN TWO GANGS. THE FIGHT SCENES ARE MOSTLY BORING UNTIL THE MIDDLE OF THE FILM AND THE STORY IS EXTREMELY WEAK. BUT HOPEFULLY, THINGS TEND TO GET A LITTLE BETTER IN THE SECOND HALF. AT LEAST THE MOVIE DOES END ON A GOOD NOTE. THIS IS NOT ONE OF SONNY CHIBA'S BEST MOVIES, BUT IF YOU'RE A DIE-HARD MARTIAL ARTS FAN, YOU'LL PROBABLY LIKE THIS MOVIE."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ignore the bad review. This is a wonderful book.","review":"Candace Savage is a wonderful author known for her well-researched and readable books, many of them on nature. The other reviewer is quite obviously a close-minded pot-stirrer who probably has never read a book in his or her life. Had they actually read this book they would realize that wizards were not in league with the devil, but were scientists and visionaries. Congratulations to Ms. Savage on a well-written book that appeals to readers of all ages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, Someone Who Understands...","review":"The Born-Again Catholic is a refreshing look at Catholicism and what it really means to be a Catholic. Gone are the age old pre-Vatican II superstitions. Bordreau puts into perspective the concept of tradition with a \\"T\\" and traditions with a \\"t\\" which are usually the ones that we get hung up on. A must read for all breeds of Catholics out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"got to be kidding","review":"Someone has got to stop this kind of nonsense. Born again refers to those people who feel superior thinking they have a direct line to God. It's just sad to have anyone think the Catholic church would condone anything like this. But then again, maybe it all makes sense"},{"rating":"1","title":"pretty mediocre","review":"I bought this because I love, absolutely love the first 'Sudden Fiction' book. ...Continued is a pretty weak followup in terms of pushing the envelope of the 'short-short story'. Most of the stories in this collection run fairly long and most aren't particularly striking. Perhaps these should have been restrained to 1000-1500 words instead of 2000. Go run and buy the first one, \\"Sudden Fiction\\", then read ...Continued if you really want to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it.","review":"Out of the 60 stories, I only enjoyed 4. It wasn't just that the stories weren't my type, it's also the way some of the stories were written. It just didn't work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not writen by someone mastering the matter, to amateurs and novices only","review":"As a network designer myself I bought this book out of curiosity and I was strongly disapointed. I've stopped reading it after a few chapters because it is obvious it was writen by someone who is a complete alien to computer-networking. The number of mistakes and wrong assertions turned me down from going further. It is also badly writen, although I am not a native English speaker I found the writing poor and uninspired. If it was accurate we could pass on this detail for it is not the purpose of the book... but definately would not say it is.On the other hand, I am not sure this book is adapted to someone who doesn't have some skills to start with or has troubles with making the difference between computers.Only the amateur could really get something from this book, then you can ask yourself the question: \\"how right is that something?\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aimless Wandering","review":"\\"Pundit-itis\\" is an occupational hazard for those folks who must develop and speak quotable-quotes on anything from the meaning and construction principles of a \\"dirty bomb\\" to the likelihood of various nations succeeding in a clandestine nuclear weapons program -- after a while, it must seem like they can \\"pundit-ize\\" on just about anything. This book has some surprising errors of fact -- for example, using a discussion of \\"logic bombs\\" in a definition of a worm. It does have the obligatory chapter bashing Microsoft for their poor record in the security area but it just doesn't have a lot else -- I think \\"Black Ice\\" does a much better job of presenting how bad it really could be out there and \\"Beyond Fear\\" gives a much superior introduction to the security area for the lay reader. My advice -- spend your $$ somewhere else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Look no further. This is your Book!","review":"I have had this book for 10 years. I have misplaced it and crying the blues.

I started doing the pattern called the \\"Itsy Bitsy Spider\\" and that is my favorite pattern. I love this book because it's easy to follow and you can do these patterns even if you are a beginner.
